10.0~Ledger's Legacy.. he doesn't play The Joker... he IS the joker... viralin123 Sign in Permalink I am usually never short on words... but I was stunned to silence... utter disbelief and sheer awe...this is a masterpiece... no two ways about it... and everyone can just forget about sending in their applications for the Oscars... this is signed sealed and delivered... not that it is any mark of greatness.. But as far as pop-culture goes Heath Ledger has left an undeniable mark on what acting can be and just why the villain can be the hero of the movie.... Here's my 2-bit review Christian Bale : Solid as ever... this guy cant put a wrong foot down... he as batman is everything batman should be, brooding, honest, powerful conflicted heroic, tragic... everyone of those emotions and more are portrayed with the greatest justice... Michael Cain and Morgan freeman: small roles but significant nonetheless. Michael Cain in particular left me impressed with he bandit in the forest story... and Morgan Freeman's "so much power in one man's hands" was so apt and so relevant if-you-know-what-I-mean with bush's wiretapping etc... Maggie Gylenhall: well I didn't like her before the movie... but I must say I don't resent her anymore... Gary Oldman: one my favorite actors... one of my favorite all time characters (Sirius Black from the harry potter series...) as Gordon he is terrific. And the last part where he does the voice-over monologue, you'd have to be made of concrete to not feel a major chill down your spine... is there an award for voice-overs? Then it should go to Gary Oldman... Aaron Eckhart... liked him from Erin brokovich, loved him in Thank you for smoking... and as Harvey Dent he does justice... and as two-face he does even more so... And now Heath Ledger... any accolade I can come up will fall short... there simply is no comparison to anyone... Heath is in a world of his own... his psychopathic maniac turn as joker is so perfect that the 1989 jack Nicholson portrayal pales in comparison... don't get me wrong I love jack Nicholson to bits but Heath is jaw-dropingly brilliant for a lack of a better word... someone has to invent a new word to express what Heath has achieved... there is nothing that compares to this...every single scene he is in is a work of genius... his smirk, the madness in his eyes...the immunity to pain... and the penchant for suffering is striking... even the scene where he claps at Gary Oldman... is so utterly disgustingly devilish that its pure cinematic magic... Christopher Nolan has entered the echelon of the great directors... this sweeping epic of a movie hits all the right notes and more... the background score is brilliant, the special effects used to intensify the drama not just for the sheer heck of it... every single bit of the movies scripting is tied in so beautifully and so relevant that its astounding... My favorite moment? when the joker tells why he's got the scar around his mouth and you think you have this maniac figured... you know the reason for his malice... but then he turns around and spins and entirely different story to another one of his victims... there go all your theories about the joker... you know that this guy is nothing but evil incarnate... There will be no greater loss for cinema goers than the knowledge that Heath will not be able to reprise his role... there would have been nothing better... just to see heath as the joker one more time... RIP Heath Ledger... this is your legacy...
10.0~This Film Entertains, Big-Time! ccthemovieman-1 Sign in Permalink This was extremely entertaining all the way through, which is quite a statement for a film that is two-and-a-half hours long. There are absolutely no dry spots in this fascinating film. Does everything make sense? Of course not; there are a lot of holes in the story, but it's a superhero action film and it's not meant to be dissected for credibility. It's just supposed to entertain, and that it does. A large part of the credit for that goes to Heath Ledger for his "The Joker" portrayal. Every scene in which Ledger appeared was riveting. His speech, mannerisms and his dialog were fantastic. For the latter, I have to commend the screen writers who gave Ledger some great lines! Actually, he and Aaron Eckert, who played "Harvey 'Two Face' Dent," were most of the show, character-wise. Maggie Gyllenhaal was good, too, as "Rachel Dawes," the woman of both Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent's affections. Otherwise, the familiar good guys - Christopher Bale as "Batman," Michael Caine as "Alfred," Gary Oldman as Inspector/Commishoner Gordan" and Morgan Freeman as "Lucius Fox" were okay but all more interesting in the previous film, "Batman Begins." Speaking of Fox, his high-and-mighty attitude toward Wayne's surveillance system was disappointing to hear. I had thought he had trust in Bruce Wayne. Also, I was sorry to hear the language deteriorate in the final half hour with some unneeded profanity by some inconsequential character. Overall, however, this latest Batman movie ranks among the best of any I've seen, at least on the first viewing. I'm looking forward to watching it again when the Blu-Ray disc comes out next month. This is a great film to enjoy visually and audibly with some fantastic action scenes and excellent dialog. I had heard that Batman was a "dark" and almost unlikable figure, himself, in this film but I did not find that. Hey, he did what he had to do to stop a maniacal killer (which "Fox" didn't understand., nor some of the other main characters.) For a guy who has provided nothing but good deeds for the fickle citizens of Gotham over the years, this hero certainly doesn't appear to be appreciated......except by his fans of comics and film. In fact, that's the only main thing I would dispute with the writers of this movie: their conclusion at the end that Batman is "not a hero, but a dark knight." No, I would say someone who continually risks his life to save others is quite a hero!
6.0~How do you hate the Greatest Film Ever Made? theskulI42 Sign in Permalink When the Joker showed up at Wayne's fundraiser for Harvey Dent, my tentative rating was at an 8.5. I was thoroughly enjoying myself, and was having it go mano-a-mano with my all-time favorite superhero movie, Spider-Man 2. By the time Batman swerved around the Joker on his motorcycle, I was getting a little restless, a 7.5 maybe, and set the score around 7.5 or so; still liked the film, and was pleased that at least I was going to give it a positive grade, to spare myself the hassle. By the time Harvey Dent was chillin' in a warehouse with ol' Jim, I was rooting for Batman to die if only to end the film more quickly. There is a good film in here. Hell, there's a GREAT film in here, but my god, to humanize this film is to implore it to do a few crunches. The Dark Knight is hideously, mindbogglingly, monstrously overlong. Every source physical and electronic had informed me that the time FLEW by that it may have lasted two hours and thirty-two minutes, but it sure as hell didn't feel like it. Well, they're right. It DIDN'T feel like two hours and thirty-two minutes. It felt like three. By the time Dent got his faced burned, I was glad that it was finally wrapping up, because it had gone on a bit too long at that point. The HOUR that it spent unnecessarily wrapping up plot strands after that scene was what killed the film for me. There was definitely a lot to like here. In a superhero film, the constant is the hero, the variable, and thus, the definition of quality, is in the villain. The Joker is the best of the Batman villains because he's the most colorful, and yet the most terrifyingly plausible. He embodies things we fear on a fundamental level: People who hide their identity,in masks and grotesque makeup, who are unhinged, who can and will do anything on a whim. Where other villains include a poof who tells riddles and a man raised by penguins sewer (don't worry about correcting me if I got that wrong, I don't care), the Joker seems horrifyingly impervious to scrutiny. In the acting department, I had surprisingly little problem with Bale. He seemed less brooding and more personable, more lively than I had seen him. When he put on his scaaawy voice, my entire theater chuckled, but I understood what he was trying to do; it far more real and acceptable than before. As for the rest of the cast, Ledger did a good job, but by the halfway point, I grew tired of the film treating him as an go-to gag machine. The longer we sat with him, I saw him descend from Jerry Brudos into Jerry Lewis. People seem to overestimate the difficulty in playing a crazy person. Talk with a funny voice, affect a little walk, invent a couple of mannerisms, it's really all in the definition. The entire film, I was thinking: You know who could have been fabulous at this role? Andy Dick. Seriously, Ledger's put-on voice sounded almost exactly like Dick's normal voice, and there's a built-in hatred for the man anyway, what better way to immediately cultivate a visceral audience reaction? I think he could have done a fine job. Aaron Eckhart, on the other hand, was quite poor. He had the chiseled chin, and I know the man can act, but here he just seemed out of his element. Far too often, I saw Aaron Eckhart acting when I should have seen Harvey Dent speaking. As for positives, I thought Maggie Gyllenhall was a tremendous upgrade on Katie Holmes. She infused the character with dimensions and life, and she convinced me every second she was on screen. Michael Caine also did a fine job, and I want to give a mention to Eric Roberts, who I thought stained the screen with the sleaze emitting from his body in his meager calls to set. Most of the rest of the cast had little to do, although I was still lamenting that, as good as job as he did on the good side, possibly the great go-to villain actor of the last generation will never be given a chance to enliven a Batman villain. Batman Begins, which I gave a 6/10, ran 2:20. I don't remember feeling it was overlong, just sort of lame. While, The Dark Knight is as far from lame as you can get, but that other problem reared its ugly had and caused me far more pain that the immediate fizzle of its predecessor, because it had so much going for it, and it seemed to have squandered it with a wasted hour that did NOTHING NEW for the characters. Did anything that important happen in the final hour of the film that hadn't happened at least once beforehand? And every new thing they did introduced was so labored and obvious that it was just as much of a time waster as everything else. The word, more than any other, that I want to use for my opinion towards this film is "lament". I wanted to LOVE this film, to be greeted with open arms by my electronic peers into their cool, hip club that apparently numbers in the billions. And my initiation was all set. Bruce, Chris & I had passed several hurdles, several tests, on our way to being accepted together, hand-in-hand, brothers in arms. But like Harvey Dent's infamous coin, the game was rigged. They flipped it until we failed, and fall flat on our faces we did. Or at least, I did. We took part in a five-legged race, and they persevered while I got stuck with the shackles, and that's too bad. The finish line was in site, but they kept moving it back, and all I taste is dirt. {Grade: 6.25/10 (C+) / #16 (of 60) of 2008}
10.0~The Greatest Batman Movie Ever Made jts0405 Sign in Permalink I thought that Batman Begins was the best Batman movie ever made, until seeing The Dark Knight changed my mind. This movie is packed with such a great story that it literally is beyond a Batman movie. You have to stop and think if you are really watching a Batman movie sometimes, because it is on such a reality based level. The thing I like most is that it focuses on the story of Bruce Wayne unlike other movies that just focus on the villain of the movie. Heath Ledger also put on the roll of a lifetime as The Joker. He is by far one of the best Jokers of all time in any Batman movie. So if you haven't seen The Dark Knight yet I would definitely go see it now. You will not be let down if you see this movie.
7.0~Most over rated movie ever!!!!!!! bijithkumar Sign in Permalink top #3????? rate= 9.6?????? what the hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. that too just below "The Shawshank Redemption"?????!!! . I just watched it yesterday. Now, I know there are a lot of batman fans out there. but I feel they shouldn't use their 'love' for batman to rate a movie like this. Lot of people rely on IMDb rating to choose the movies they watch. come on!!... guys!!... remember you are doing this at the cost of credibility of this good website. I thought Juno was the most over rated movie till this moment. In fact I liked that movie but I thought it was over rated. but this one has gone way too far.... BTW, this is my first comment on IMDb. i was a silent listener so far but this injustice has broken my silence!!!!!
7.0~Dark Knight riding on the hype. maduranga Sign in Permalink I'm not trying to take anything away from this movie. It is good movie. But I wouldn't say it is the best superhero movie or the best movie of 2008. Maybe I was let down by all the hype thats been going around. maybe I would have had a better impression if I didn't read the comments here before I went to see the movie. First of all, this movie is about the "JOKER'. Not Batman. If it wasn't for the Joker this movie wouldn't have been half interesting. For me, this movie is all about the Joker. Heath gives an exceptional performance. I'd say that's one of the best performances I've seen. Other than that, this is another better than average superhero flick. I'll just break down a few points: Acting: Except for Joker (who is extraordinary), others give a good performance. Nothing special. Story: Good plot. Special effects: BELOW AVERAGE! This is where it really let me down. This is a superhero flick. Superheroes are ppl who do things normal ppl cannot do. They do things ppl don;t see in their everyday lives. For me, special effects are the main reason why I would go to see a superhero movie. And Dark Knight just don't have anything. It does. But if you compare to flicks like Spider-man, Dark Knight is miles away. Very very few action in this film. I wanted to see more of Batmobile. More explosions. More flying. This just don't have any. This is a good movie. But its just not that extraordinary as its fans want you to believe.
10.0~The Greatest Comic Book Film of All-Time! griffolyon12 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is the follow-up to 2005's Batman Begins. Now I thought Batman Begins was amazing, I mean it is one of my favorite films of all-time. To sum it up, I was very pumped about the sequel, but there was always that fear in the back of my mind that The Dark Knight might not be as good as Batman Begins, but finally after three years of waiting I can say that The Dark Knight is not just as good as Begins, but it in fact blows it out of the water. The story of The Dark Knight follows Batman on his continuing crusade to rid Gotham City of crime. In this film Batman begins to see hope for both him and Gotham in the hopes of the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent. Batman feels that Gotham needs a hero with a face, and he believes that Dent is that hero, not Batman. Of course, Batman's hopes are soon shattered by the arrival of a new criminal mastermind calling himself the Joker. As I have already said, The Dark Knight is amazing, you could call it a masterpiece, but that just doesn't seem to fully sum up how blown away I was by this film. To start, the directing by Christopher Nolan is superb, reinforcing once more that he is quite possibly the film industries greatest current filmmaker. On top of that the cinematography by Wally Pfister is amazing, and I really think it is about time he finally wins an Oscar for his work. Then the score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is perfect, fitting each scene perfectly. Finally the script by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan is perfect, flowing perfectly from scene to scene, making this 2 and a 1/2 hour film feel as if it lasted only 90 minutes, but in a good way. Of course the true highlight of the film is the acting from the all-star cast, all actors turn in perfect performances, including: Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart as D.A. Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Maggie Gyllennhaal replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes; though the one performance that truly stands out ahead of the others is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker, he was amazing, this role just fit him like a glove, and he truly deserves a post-humous Oscar win. In final thought, the Dark Knight is epic, emotional, and exciting, all at the same time. I loved this film, it was tense and disturbing while being at times a little comical through the Joker's odd, dark sense of humor. I could go on all day long talking about how perfect this film was, but I'll try to wrap things up here. The Dark Knight is easily the best film of 2008, and should definitely be considered for some big-time Oscars, in particular Heath Ledger's stunning performance as the Joker; but not only is The Dark Knight the year's best film, it is the best film of the decade thus far. The Dark Knight is the Greatest Comic Book Film of All-Time, and definitely stands in my books as one of the Greatest Films of All-Time. It is a true masterpiece. The Dark Knight earns a perfect 10 out of 10!
10.0~A roller-coaster ride of a movie! A dream come true. hitman_0303 Sign in Permalink Nolan definitely knew what he was doing when he named his 2005 blockbuster "Batman BEGINS". I loved that movie, it's really hard not to, but I didn't have a clue that I should take the title literally at the time. After watching Batman Begins, I expected another good Batman movie, but not a masterpiece. The only downside to this may be the fact that Christopher Nolan has definitely set new, much higher standards for the superhero/thriller genre. If he decides to make a third (and probably final) installment, it will be a very difficult task to live up to the expectations. The cast of the Dark Knight is superb, it's not just Heath Ledger's perfect performance that carries it, the entire main and supporting cast are at their best. The story is clever and the pacing is perfect. After a third screening, I still get the feeling that it can't get any better than this. Directors and producers managed to deliver an audio/visual masterpiece that really makes you think that, as awesome as it was in 2005, at that time Batman had just begun. Go see it, then go see it again and again. Then buy it. And watch it again. I know I will. It really is that good!
10.0~Just my honest opinion jtbuckle Sign in Permalink I would have never said that there is, or ever will be a better movie than The Shawshank Redemtion, but this masterpiece has left me wondering... If you don't fully appreciate either of them to the extent they deserve then you shouldn't even be viewing this site anyway. Bale was certainly flawless as Batman, and after watching Heath Ledger make himself a legend by playing what I now firmly believe is the greatest movie villain of all time my faith in the chilling villain Anton Chigurh was also rattled. Obviously under the circumstances we will never see him continue to compete with some of the greatest actors of all time, but I think he showed everyone who has ever seen a movie, and intends to see more the new standard to be a legendary actor. Did I mention that if you were to take God and cut him in half and then ask each side to read a script it would be something like the roles played by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman? Nearly all of the cast did a flawless job, but these were my favorite standouts. Just throw any doubts you have to the wind, and you will be rocked by this movie. P.S.- Thankyou to all involved in the production of this gift.
1.0~Meh... Jonny-ironica Sign in Permalink I'll have to admit, I was not keen on seeing this movie, just because I didn't really enjoy Batman Begins, but I had some hope this movie would be an improvement. And it was... slightly. I did like Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker, besides having no back story or anything like that. Does it deserve an Oscar nod? Not really. I think that's mainly out of the fact that he bit the big one earlier this year. That and he was supposedly going insane while(or because) he was taking on the role, so I guess the acting wasn't much of stretch, then, was it? I have to admit, the direction wasn't very original or spectacular. But besides that, the movie was chalked full of big BANG BOOM action scenes. The scenes that dealt with dialogue seemed to be trying to make up for the lack of action with cheap humor that wasn't all that funny. Rachael Dawes, the most pointless character in the new series... What can I say about her? Other than no one really seemed to care about her or her death. The only reason I feel like she returned for this film was to give Harvey Dent a reason to go nuts and start whacking people. Which brings me to Two-Face... Was it necessary to shove that villain into the last part of the movie like a bad subplot? I think it would've been more appropriate for him to have his own sequel, but I guess the writers really didn't think he deserved that. I also feel like everything in the movie was so forced together. I mean, 3 villains in one movie and none of them hardly interact. I mean, you got Scarecrow briefly cameo-ing his way into the first little bit of the movie. I don't mean to compare the movie to Burton's works because that's biased(and screw you, because I am) but Batman Returns had all 3 of it's bad guys smoothly fit together in the film... was it really that hard? The last thing I really did not like in the movie was Christian Bale's "I-Must-Sound- Like-I'm-an-80-year-old -woman-who-has-cancer- and-still-smokes-after-60- something-years" voice. Other than those things, the movie was okay. Does it deserve a 9.7? To be above the likes of Pulp Fiction, Alien, Aliens, Psycho, Grindhouse, etc? Not really. I think the movie has lost itself in the hype and most of the people who gave it a 10 did so because they didn't understand half the movie, but thought it looked cool. I think the movie would sit nice with a 6 or 7.something rating, but that's my opinion. Anyway, I will be not be seeing any more films in this version of the series, so you won't hear from me about it again.
4.0~Too Noisy, Too Dark, Too Violent, Too Long! michaelgrantham Sign in Permalink I shall probably get blown out of the water for this, but I hated the film. I absolutely loved Batman Begins, and thought it was the best of all the Batman films. But not this one. Maybe it didn't help that our local cinema had the volume up very high, so the action scenes and gunfire became irritating; however, the whole thing grated on me. I really can't understand how it got a 12 rating, as the violence, while often implied rather than actually shown was far too much for a 12 yr old. At least a 15 rating was called for in my view. I agree with with one of the other reviewers that there was no plot other than the constant battle between the Joker and Batman. Granted, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was superb, and by far the best part of the film. He made a truly scary psycho! But that couldn't make up for the rest of the film. Maybe I need to watch it again on DVD (at a reasonable volume) but I was very disappointed as I had been looking forward to seeing it. So there it is. I'm obviously out of step with most of the viewing public!
6.0~Good, Not Great triplestrikekid Sign in Permalink This movie was, I'm sorry, NOT a masterpiece, NOR did it deserve an Oscar nomination for BP. That's my opinion- it doesn't necessarily mean I'm right. Here are some good things about the film. Heath Ledger does give a brilliant performance, and that's one reason that it's worth watching. The film balances comedy and drama very well, and Aaron Eckhart also stands out as Harvey Dent. But sadly, even though this is better then almost every other comic-book film, that just means that it is not horrible. The screenplay is a very average one, and all of the other performances are nothing special. The story is stifled by all of the action sequences, and the plot isn't allowed to be as deep as it should. In conclusion, this movie is only above average because of Heath Ledger's spectacular performance and the visual effects that will undoubtedly deliver the thrills consistently. Undoubtedly, nearly all of you will disagree with this comment; that's fine. It's my opinion, and a less-then-solid but above-average 6 out of 10 stars is all I think the film deserves.
10.0~Amazing that-damn-asian Sign in Permalink Walking into the theater, I began to wonder why I had been so excited about this movie Why for weeks, I had been spouting how amazing it was going to be. It was a black cloud moment. And I prepped myself for "just another movie". Leaving the theatre, all traces of such a feeling were gone, and I was left in a strange way; pondering all the things I'd just seen. Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger. I can't express what an amazing job I think he did with words. I can't not give props to the writers and Designers. it was a brilliant take on the Joker. Somewhere about half-way through, I suddenly missed Heath Ledger. that's all I can really do to explain it. Now to the one thing I really wanted to say. something. one thing. the one thing. the one thing i DID NOT (gasp here - >_____< - ) like about the Dark Knight: Michael Caine as Alfred. another thing I can't really explain, but will try to anyways. Alfred seems like so much of a softer role than Michael Caine has gone after in the past. Something along the lines of him being too strong. this. is such a minor thing, that it doesn't even scratch the surface of this amazing movie. it delivers enough fighting, shooting, and explosions to satisfy my action Thirst. but also gave enough Thought Provoking themes. (the Boats scene, and the general aim of the Joker). god bless the Dark Knight!
3.0~Action Aplenty. rmax304823 Sign in Permalink I tried to get through this. Really I did. And I could appreciate the effort that went into the performances and the wads of dough that must have been spent on special effects. The atmosphere too is lucidly rendered -- night time in the big city. But my enjoyment was hampered by the fact that I'd outgrown most of this stuff about the time I entered High School, and that was when the comic-book Batman still looked like a human being, not a bemuscled behemoth. The experience, the viewing of this, as much of it as I could stand, was exhausting. You have never seen so many vehicles, large and small, racing through the gloomy and deserted urban streets. And every one of them seems to crash and turn into an exploding fireball emitting shards of glass and flaps of unidentifiable metal. The business is taken seriously too. The blows rained upon the victims seem to hurt. The occasional wisecracks from The Joker don't begin to make up for the realistic pain. It all makes me wonder if our peculiar civilization hasn't entered the decadent period that precedes its fall from dominance. At least in the comic books you had to READ the dialog bubbles. Here, no challenge at all. Just sit back and let the despondency overwhelm you. I know, I know. I missed the point. It's just a fantasy. Right enough, but it's somebody else's fantasy, not mine.
9.0~Well worth staying up missmissa Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight became the third movie I've gone to a midnight showing for (the other two being Revenge of the Sith and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and it was by far the best of those films. The energy in the auditorium was palpable. There were times when we collectively gasped, laughed, and cheered. For fans of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is grittier, funnier, and more complicated. As a matter of fact, the film's only drawback is the complicated storytelling. It made the film two and half hours long, and, moreover, it felt two and a half hours long. Also, the PG-13 rating in America, is quite serious. There are some truly gruesome images and Heath Ledger's Joker is one of the most menacing villains ever to appear on the screen. One villain in the host of supporting baddies who got the short end of the stick in the last film and in this one, was Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. I almost wish they'd left him out entirely, instead of giving the boy a lousy send-off twice, because Murphy could be a fantastic villain in the third film, in my opinion, anyway. The rest of the returning cast is fantastic, as expected. Christian Bale is perfect as Gotham's self-sacrificing Dark Knight, and he also did a great job with the billionaire playboy side of Bruce Wayne. The banter between Bale and Michael Caine is pitch perfect and is responsible for one of the funniest scenes in the film. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are also given a chance to shine in this film. Oldman was especially fantastic as Jim Gordon. Aaron Eckhart is a great Harvey Dent, and I have an easier time with the chemistry between him and Maggie Gyllenhaal than between Gyllenhaal and Bale. While Maggie Gyllenhaal is her usual great self, it's difficult to pretend that she's Rachel Dawes, not only because she's not physically Katie Holmes, but she's practically playing a different character. Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Overall, it was a fantastic film and a great second installment. My only question is, how will they top themselves for the third one?
1.0~Just what Iexpected - It's a self-parody fabyss Sign in Permalink This movie has proved again, that cartoon means junk, and whatever you do starting from a cartoon, it will still be junk. At least now someone else in Hollywood realized this, and made a real good parody of the cartoon genre. An extra joke is, that all this was masked as a serious superhero cartoon movie. Just some of the best hidden jokes I've found behind the cliché story: 1. Batman kills at least a dozen of cops during the car chase, and makes some million $ worth of damage in the road, buildings. etc., but he is still the good guy. Sure. 2. All the citizens in Gotham are totally stupid. First of all, they don't realize, that the only person, who has enough money to buy those hi-tech gadgets is Bruce Wayne, and nobody realizes, who Batman is. Second, it doesn't matter, that Batman's mask is covering only a small part of his face (his forehead and nose), they still don't realize, who is "hiding" behind the mask By the way, did you notice, that there is a face recognition software running on one of the monitors in Batman's hideout? The very same happened in the previous Batman franchise - looks like folks in Gotham didn't get any smarter in the past decades. 3. Looking at the height of the pile, I guess that the amount of cash Joker is burning is more than there is in circulation in the whole world. 4. All the mobs are stupid enough to keep their money in cash, so if they want to make a transfer, they have to hire a dozens of trucks. They haven't ever heard about electronic money. If they are so stupid, then how they can run a syndicate? 5. Some billion worth of hi-tech gadgets is hiding in the basement of Wayne company. For years in nobody's mind turned up the idea to find a customer and make some money of it. They just wasted some million $ into it, and later they decided to hide it. 6. The way the bat car and the bat bike moves is totally unrealistic. Also, such vehicles would be totally unpractical. For example, why are the wheels of the bat car in the front of the vehicle? Anyone can shot it with a simple pistol (these are rubber wheels), and game is over. The stupid design of the vehicle is proved in one scene, when Joker immobilizes the car (supposedly worths some million$ + the development costs, as this is a prototype) with a common RPG, which costs only a handful of dollars. 7. When they bring down the chopper with the steel cables, the two guys must have know in advance, that exactly where (which street and what height) the chopper will go through. Keep in mind, that according to the plot, all these Joker sidekicks are mentally retarded people. And doesn't matter, that the chase is half a dozen mile long, they are just in the exact time at the exact place. 8. Hey terrorists and wannabe terrorists! I have some good news for you! It looks like, that if you want to kill a major, then all you have to do is to get an uniform. (An uniform can be bought in any costume shop, you don't even have to beat policemen and take away from them like in the movie.) Then you can approach the major to point blank distance - the only problem is, that there are oracles in the police, too, who can predict the future, and jump between you and the major even before you pull the trigger. 9. Blowing a building is an easy process. High explosives are strange artifacts, as you can move and properly plant hundred kilos within a couple of minutes into the designated places of a building. Also, when you blow up a building, you can stay 10 meters away from it, and you will suffer no damage from debris, rubble and/or air pressure. 10. Ship crews are incredibly dumb. They can't realize that there are hundreds of gasoline in the engine room. Or even if they have found it, then they may have thought, that the captain is going to throw a surprise party for the whole crew, and in the barrels there is the stuff necessary for such party (vaseline). These are just some quick random things I can remember, I don't want to waste much time commenting this disaster. Let's not talk about obvious plot holes, pointless violence, superfluous subplots, and Bale acting like a wood - oh my god, why that deep voice when dressed as Batman?
4.0~Really...??? ...... REALLY..??? krixtenn Sign in Permalink I would like to start this out by stating that I LIKED Batman Begins. I felt that the whole entrance to attempt to make things "logical" and "realistic" (as far as comic book movies go) was refreshing and adult. Its difficult as an adult to easily suspend disbelief or compensate loopholes with imagination where there exist such obvious loopholes sometimes. Sometimes you need more "detail" in the story to make it better in some places... I felt like this was one of those movies: Convoluted, ill-paced, and at times, ridiculous. Even for a comic book movie. What was good enough about this movie that I rated it a 4? It was "cool". I enjoyed the effects and at minimum was entertained (started shifting in my chair 3/4 through though, after beginning to notice how long I have actually been sitting there...not a good feeling for watching an "epic movie"). Loved the bike, loved the car, LOVED Heath Ledger. He was brilliant....I WILL defend his "smacking lips" that some are actually filtering into the "bad" aspects of this. Here's a hint: IT IS SUPPOSED TO ANNOY YOU! He's a madman with ticks, quirks, and no doubt the smacking was created (and obviously deliberately emphasized) as something that was created from the cuts on the character's lips. I forgot he was Heath Ledger only minutes into the film...incredible, incredible performance, he deserves all the praise he is currently getting. The bad: The story. I get it, sometimes being a hero is not about being glorified, but taking the fall. That IS a superhero in a nutshell....and the development of that idea was good....but....it seemed like there was way too much work throughout the movie to arrive at something so.......... simple. I was awaiting a profound catharsis to make me think "WOW" and not a 'well, this is it after all of that'. Maggie Gyllenhaal was decent, though I have no idea what they were thinking in casting her. She did pull off the "strong" part of the character well, because she isn't attractive enough to be assumed as an airhead (sorry). It isn't just about that though... I found her dull, and almost apathetic. Maybe that was the point? Im not sure. Bale as batman is OK....I'll take it.... the over-the-top voice became ridiculous, and actually unintentionally comical though. I felt like I was listening to "Brock from a 1-900 line" at times. They went through SO much effort to explain the physics of the Batman costume, vehicles, details of how Sonar would work, that I started to become excited and interested...until the creation of two-face. I had a very difficult time accepting a man with such exposed burned/raw skin would be able to snarl and strut around without being.....well, the slightest bothered to the HUGE chance of infection/irritation. It was so ridiculous that I actually started to ponder details.... How is the exposed eyeball looking completely healthy when he has NO eyelid to moisten? How is he able to perfectly pronounce speech when he is missing half of his mouth/lips?? Go ahead...try to partially speak through only your teeth and see if it works that well. It was ridiculous. His transformation and "meeting" with the joker was disappointingly quick. The joker gives him a 4 minute pep talk and it was kind of "well, that was easy". There was little to no internal conflict, self-reasoning....he literally went from someone who SHOULD NOT be unable to function with muscle, bone, jaw, eyeball exposed to.... a child murdering thug? Huh? Then, after ALL the ups and downs in the film...batman rides off because he has to take the fall because "sometimes heroes do that". That was the conclusion? OK, that was ALSO easy....so.....is that it?? Really? REALLY?
7.0~Is it really one of the top 10? clangfield Sign in Permalink There seems to be a lot of hype about this film. As I write it's sitting at #6 with an average rating of 9.0. Honestly, I don't think it's that good. Heath Ledger is fun as the psychopathic side of the joker, but I'm not sure he's any more enjoyable than Jack Nicholson - where, for instance, are the actual jokes? Michael Caine just is NOT Alfred - butlers should speak much more correctly than that, and the cockney boy just doesn't work for me. Christian Bale doesn't seem solid enough as a Bruce Wayne. It's a bit more jolly than the Tim Burton efforts - there is at least daylight this time - and the plot twists and effects are decent, but I don't think they're particularly ground-breaking. All in all I'd say it's watchable, but I don't expect it to hang around in the top 10 for too long.
5.0~Incredibly overrated minorfifth-1 Sign in Permalink This film is basically average. NONE of the performances in this film are anything worth getting over exited about. Heath Ledger's performance was good. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't even great. Just like Ian Curtis his death did him the world of good. I'm not saying he wasn't a capable actor; I'm simply saying he wasn't anything special. Have we reached an age where licking your lips and snuffling is regarded as 'a performance that should earn him every award known to man'? He is only regarded as being so super good because he's dead - simple as that. Watch Tim Burton's Batman, it's a better film.
10.0~The Best Movie Ever arnab_das Sign in Permalink This is definitely the best movie I've seen, and I'm quite sure the best movie one will ever get to see! Christopher Nolan rocks! Not just because of the fact that this is the best Batman movie made, not just because of the amazing special effects and action sequences, but also because of the fact that this movie is a worthy tribute to one of the finest actors delivering one of the best performances of our time. I have well and truly been, as one my friends most eloquently put it, "Ledgered" and "Jokered" all at the same time! Heath Ledger has delivered a thoroughly amazing and stunning performance, which to a large extent overshadows the acting talent of Christian Bale, who one again delivers a flawless performance after Batman Begins. He is well and truly worthy of the great old Batman suit! And the rest of the review is all about Heath Ledger, for I am left with no other option but to praise him for the best performance of this decade. We have always found Joker to be a guy with a makeup resembling that of a...well...Joker! Which made it almost impossible for us to realize the fact that this man beneath his makeup is a human being, but in this movie the makeup has been "toned down", so that we are able to see a more realistic Joker, a more deadly Joker, who is not just a psychotic killer, but also an emotional blackmailer. Every scene that the Joker appears in, takes your breath away! Such a pity that we wont be able to see more of Ledger ever again... Let us all pay us deepest regards to this wonderfully amazing actor of our times. Tight plot, amazing special effects, stunning action sequences and brilliant acting performances definitely makes "The Dark Knight" a real gem of a movie! No wonder, it features in the top 10 of the TOP 250 MOVIES list compiled by IMDb.
10.0~For Best Picture Oscar ike74ph Sign in Permalink I initially went to watch this film mostly to see Heath Ledger's take on the Joker. That was three days ago. The Dark Knight still haunts me now. The Dark Knight transcends the superhero genre. It's on big morality play. It's a crime drama with interesting action scenes thrown in. Admittedly though, the movie wouldn't have worked if it wasn't a superhero movie. The best aspect of this movie is the complicated plot that revolves around the Joker. We keep on guessing what his ultimate plan is, what he's going to do next, how will Batman and friends deal with him? It was so many stories interwoven that it will keep your mind occupied up to the end. One particular thing I liked is that the love triangle did not throw off an already good plot line. It rather enhanced it. The script was the best thing done here. It wasn't boring. It was complicated but understandable. The script also devoted a lot of time with the supporting characters that it felt like an ensemble piece rather than a story revolving around Batman vs. Joker. But the acting was great. A marked improvement was the better portrayal of Rachel Dawes. Maggie Gyllenhall could portray well that she carries the burden of knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman with just facial expressions. It wasn't flat or overacted. She's not a damsel in distress either. She can take care of herself. She did manage to physically assault the Joker. She was just overpowered and captured. Christian Bale was excellent in conveying Bruce Wayne's dilemma. Yeah, he was more Bruce Wayne here than Batman. His Batman voice wasn't more menacing as the previous film. It came somewhat annoying sometimes, in a sense that it was obvious to movie characters that Batman's voice wasn't a natural one. Best entrance was the interrogation scene. It reminds us on how unnerving he is on comics on other characters, even fellow heroes. A revelation here was Aaron Eckhart. He played a perfect Harvey Dent, an ambitious and driven district attorney who only wants to do good for this city. His portrayal of Two-Face was compelling. It was a character who could not handle well the tragedy he suffered and he got that down to pat like we expected Two-Face to be. But he was better as Harvey Dent because we really liked him as a person. Gary Oldman's Gordon was a conflicted character. Gordon wants to get rid of all the criminals in Gotham. He's saddled by the fact that the police force is infiltrated by the mafia. He also keeps on scrambling to catch the Joker and prevent his plans from wreaking havoc. Morgan Freeman's Fox knows his boss is Batman and supports him 100%. But he does have his own principles and scruples and makes him more believable as a character. On the other hand, Michael Caine's Alfred stays loyal to Batman. He also has some of the best lines. His character here shortened as compared to the previous film but his presence is necessary nevertheless. I liked the crime bosses here too. You hate them at first but later they are scared of the Joker. I never really like Eric Roberts before but here, I could view his character with sympathy. They're too afraid of Batman so that they're meeting in daylight and their hoods hide upon seeing the Bat Signal. Heath Ledger's portrayal is the Joker can be described as creepy and disturbing. You'd never realize it was him. It's the best because Joker wasn't trying to be funny. He's an inscrutable psychopath who's out to create havoc for no one else knows why but him. He's also a dangerous hand-to-hand combatant and shoots really well. He planned it all from the start. He's a criminal genius out to prove that anyone can be as murderous as he is. Case in point: the ferries scene made me very nervous and didn't expect how the problem would solve itself. His hospital visit was funny but you realize that he was person without scruples. And what he said to Two-Face about not to take what he did to him personally was the best ironic statement in the movie. The Joker here was pure evil and chaos, not a clown trying to be a mass murderer. Best Actor? Definitely. A supporting actor wouldn't do him justice. His character was the centre of the movie together with Batman. He also had the best lines and delivered them with menace you'd loose bladder control if you were with him in the same room. This film ought to be best picture for many reasons. It has a superb script, amazing cinematography, appropriate score, and a great cast who could all act. But it's more than that. It haunts you and makes you giddy at the same time. It makes you want to watch it all over again. It reminds you of the Titanic bandwagon. It doesn't have the Titanic's mushiness. The appeal is more mental. It's so perfect. Oh yeah, it earned a lot. So start the buzz.
9.0~A stupendous effort that needed a little tweaking. thauseefbhai Sign in Permalink This review is for you, if you have watched it, and are wondering if it was brilliant and flawless. Or was there a tiny little "hard to point your finger at" thing that was wrong with it? I am an avid Batman fan, who has been devouring the Frank Miller graphic novels that depict the grim and gritty side of the dark Knight. I have followed the tidbits and stories on Dark Knight for over a year. Batman Begins marked the beginning of one of the most amazing "ordinary superhero movie" ever witnessed. Four years later, as I stepped into the hall, and awaited the beginning of this new movie, the excitement was almost palpable. I was not disappointed. The movie had enough chills and sadistic pleasures to keep me hooked and unable to look away from the screen for the most parts. And yet, when the credits rolled, I had a queer feeling, as though something wasn't entirely right. A few hours after the sensory overload, when I could finally think,I realized one of its drawbacks was dwelling into too many story plots simultaneously. For instance, we follow the joker through a long, and sometimes cumbersome car chase, which except for that final brilliant (and much publicized) truck sequence, was nothing great. We have been lead to believe that the joker is a man who attacks psychologically, and is not physically strong. This is portrayed eloquently in the interrogation scene. As a result the car sequence became the sort of cliché they could not avoid despite the possibility of becoming the only boring sequences in an otherwise splendid movie. I remember because, I caught myself yawning. Also considering how Joker is the arch nemesis of Batman - the yang to the Dark Ying, the absolute bad guy, Two Face pales by comparison. No doubt, the make up and graphics are grotesque and excellently done. But we just are not able to believe that he is capable of the menace that Joker manages to exude. I just could not believe that Two-Face was that bad. The directors have somehow failed to bring the transition between his characters. If i remember the comic books, the disaster drove Two Face insane, making him dependent on the coin even for small decisions. The real trouble if you ask me, was bringing in a new villain in the last half hour of the movie. One that made the joker's final confrontation with Batman seem a little unsatisfying. I kept expecting them to show Joker one last time. He didn't die, did he? Yes, I do understand how Joker is the arch nemesis, and its Batman's great burden that he can never kill Joker, and they are back at it time and again...but Ledger is dead. We know he won't return. So we, as audience wanted an ultimatum. Not a dangling loose end and definitely not a dangling loose joker from a building top. Enough with the criticism. I am Batman fan. A son of batman, if you wanna call me (ref: Frank Miller). I loved the style. I loved the bat pod, the first robbery sequence, Joker's pencil disappearing trick, the flick of his tongue, the little line about Joker completing Batman, the other line about joker being the dog that chases the car and not knowing what to do if it catches the car... Dark Knight was about Heath Ledger. Sadly, we wanted more of him. It JUST WASN'T ENOUGH! Batman as always was his sporting best, the flight sequences were brilliant, Caine and Freeman had the best lines apart from Ledger. Aaron Eckhart did a great job as Harvey Dent, though I did feel that Two-Face lacked character. I expected the sort of chill Javier Bardem inspired in No country for old men, when he tosses the coin. Instead, Two-Face's tosses were merely just passably interesting. Oh, I must really commend the Nolan brothers for doing away with the only female lead, and in such a sudden and scary way. I almost couldn't believe it. Enough has been spoken about Ledger. I do not want to be repetitive. Clearly, his lines were the best. But more important was his body language and sequences, which were to say the least, eccentric. Kudos to Nolan for a good script, something that could give Ledger an opportunity for such a mind blowing performance. He sparkles in every scene, and we only wish there was much more of him. A word on Bale. As Batman, he is the best ever. As Bruce Wayne, he does excel in a few scenes. But were those scenes requiring Bruce Wayne driving around in his Lamborghini necessary at all? In the quest to make The Joker the most remarkable villain ever, some of the dilemmas that made Batman the Dark Knight are never questioned. Batman Begins did such a good job of bringing in the character. Why leave him like hanging like a prop actor in this one? Some of these sequences could no doubt be shortened. Batman could have been given some character and Two Face could've been the surprise element, AFTER a somewhat more definite end to JOKER, and the movie would have been a tad more awesome. I would have given it a 10. Instead I give it a 9. I dare not give it less than that... Background score was brilliant. The scenes involving Joker, just before he mutilates someone, or pops a psychological question, are well, horrifying. I was almost squirming in my seat. Over all a brilliant movie. A landmark Batman film, that ends on the right note, ready to jump headlong into the next phase of Batman's life. I only hope it doesn't take four more years! Long Live the Batman franchise. Long live Nolan fraternity. RIP ledger.
10.0~Perfect Superhero Movie movie-lover_93 Sign in Permalink This film was great, it's the best superhero films with it's drama, action and suspense. The Joker was truly one of the best villains ever. Heathe Ledger gives you chills. It's the film where clichés don't exist. Nothing is repeated. This film has great direction and not just bombs, guns and explosion. Many superhero films consist on action and stunts, cheesy story and weak dialog. However this film has a really edgy and a really well done story. The special effects were just amazing. A couple of scenery from the film I just didn't like, didn't make me feel the darkness. But that it. Acting was really good and not corny at all. And for the writing is excellent.
1.0~SICK ART FROM A SICK CULTURE "We're so far gone that real human emotion is beyond us." mmoynihan-1 Sign in Permalink Jim Kunsler is not a regular film critic. He is an accomplished published author and highly educated in arts and literature. I subscribe to his blog, usually for his political writing. There are hardly any film critics around. The newspaper, magazine, internetz,IMDb & TV folks are just reviewers as opposed to critics. They mumble about good or bad, thumbs up, how much money is involved and other nonsense in what is an ignorant parody of Consumer Reports, as if the art of film were a microwave oven or brand of toilet tissue. In writing about the incredibly popular movie, THE DARK KNIGHT, Kunsler has actually written a piece of film criticism. He puts the film in the context of our present national (and international) culture, economy and values.

1.0~Batman needs an inhaler williworks1 Sign in Permalink I hated this movie. The editing was awful. There were times I didn't know what was going on like they cut out a part of the movie and I was left guessing. It was WAY to long. Batman couldn't breathe through most of the movie or was that an attempt at acting and seeming "dark". I felt like he should pull out an inhaler- what a joke this flick was. Are we that stupid that this many people loved this movie? Oh and let me not forget the 100 flips of the two headed coin- boy that got old quick. The ONLY thing that saved this movie for me was the Joker. Cut out everything else and run clips of all the jokers scenes and I would happily pay almost twenty bucks to see it oh and anything Morgan Freeman does is all right by me- otherwise GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!
8.0~Bringing this conversation back down to earth deproduction Sign in Permalink Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good.
7.0~So overrated! info-14461 Sign in Permalink So this is the movie that created one box-office record after the other. I really expected quite something, but was left disappointed. It's definitely not a bad movie. There are many things that are good entertainment and worth watching and definitely one of the better movies this year, but come on it has so many flaws. If you think that a movie like matrix which is more original, more intelligent, better from its action-sequences and so on and so on just didn't earned that much at the box-office. The most disturbing thing is probably the amount of realism they tried to put in a comic book story. Which always confused me as a viewer. That doesn't work for me. I think there was a hype created in America that pleased the hardcore comic book fans but i think the main reason why it was so extremely successful in America is it's dealing with Americas 9/11 Trauma. The whole movie was kind of a propaganda movie for the government and its actual foreign policy. When you see Batman standing in the ruins of an exploded building together with the firemen it evokes images of 9/11. And America's desperate yearning for a hero. Someone who will clean up with this scum. But what made "it" a scum isn't really told. A super-villain like the joker is just mad in a comic book. But in real life who is mad and who is not is often just a matter of the point of view. The prisoners in the one boat evoke images of Guantanamo. And it justifies their illegal and often unjustified imprisonment of innocents with the words of the people of "other boat" . Why shall we have mercy with them. They blew their chance. But still we give them much more than they deserve. It still was a nice gesture giving them some kind of redemption by letting tiny lister throwing the detonator outside. In the end Batman stand for me as a symbol for "W", because he is blamed by the people even though he is doing it seemingly just for them and sometimes they don't appreciate it or even understand it. Next thing was how often and illogically they let the joker get away. I mean come on. The just cut to another scene and he is free. Thats so cheezy. Batman hits him up like nothing and the man doesn't even bleed a bit. Other real people he just hits once and they are K.O. I thought the Joker had no superpowers but here he seems invincible. Then you wonder how quick he has everything planned without ever getting a touch of an recruited army behind him , even though he seems to have tons and tons of toy soldiers. I a comic book it works but in a movie where they try to put a lot of realism in it it feels weird. First he is in prison but he is so foreseeing everything. Maybe i need to see it again. But it felt weird. The action sequences felt not really thought trough. The whole chase tunnel sequence was so unrealistic. i mean first the police somehow never hits back. And joker just shoots and shoots and shoots. And it felt unreal. Maggie Gyllenhall felt miscast. She maybe a favorite in art-house productions but here you need someone with obviously more sex-appeal. I never bought it that they fell for her. The the totally unrealistic wounds of Harvey dent turning into "two-face". Come on. No one would have such an open wound. Isn't "Two-Face" a mad scicophrenic in the books. Here he never feels mad, just like a guy trying to get his revenge. Thats what I mean, with the amount of realism. Here a mad character from the books is explained in his madness, but the main character the joker which is a synonym for any terrorist threatening America isn't explained a bit. Yeah better that way. One might get scarred that one self turned that man into a terrorist. So they better leave that explanation out. Then the much hyped about heath ledger (r.i.p.) performance. It was good but not that great. For me it was just an update of the Nicholson joker. He even talked much like him and his facial expressions also resembled Nicholson's expressions. So whats all the hype about. He is still performing very good but not legendary. I have seen better villains. Then it seemed like there were many points in the movie that resembled of "L.A. Cofidential" One scene in the end where they let Harvey dent die as a hero is one of them but there were others too which i forgot. So after all. Worth watching. Good movie. But too overrated. And i still don't understand the enormous box-office-records.
7.0~not as good as all the hype MLDinTN Sign in Permalink I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didn't miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I don't think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that. And I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end. I also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema. FINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I don't get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made.
10.0~the dark knight outshines evryothr superhero dashsanchal-1 Sign in Permalink Wow what a classic....3 cheers for Chris Nolan....one exceptional director have loved all his movies from the movie following to TDK he has shown what a classics director he is for me he is gonna be the most exceptional storyteller of his time. Now abt he cast bale was effective,oldman was excellent,gwyenhall was OK better than Katie Holmes,Aaron was a revelation loved his make up as Two Face,Eric Roberts was strictly OK and Caine was as usual brilliant but the movie's centrifugal force was none other than the charismatic and super talented heath ledger.No one has portrayed a negative character with such determination and passion as ledger had done. this felt like more of a super villain movie rather than superhero. The story was marvellous the whole backdrop of Gotham was superb.no batman movie had portrayed Gotham in such a manner as Nolan has.Now why i think its the best superhero or to some point the best movie ever made is because of the simple fact that it shows heroes superheroes or normal heroes everyone have some weakness and no one is perfect.this shows that batman is not infallible does the people think so as the quote in the movies goes either you die as a hero or live long enough to see yourself as the villain. this superhero movies shoes the real emotions of a man n how often he is misunderstood by general people. the message is clear some people think abt their immediate people and some people think abt the whole mankind and those people who think abt the whole of mankind are the real superheroes and TDK aka the batman is a real super hero and unlike most of the other superheroes we can see that batman has no jurdiction. Hand up to NOLAN, BALE,OLDMAN AND the ledger hope u win an Oscar fr ur effort.
7.0~What marketing can do marko999 Sign in Permalink From where to start? Maybe, from my disappointment with IMDb and vote engine? Or, just leave that and straight go to the description of this movie? 1. Bad directing...up up up in tension and then totally down with low intelligent denouement 2. Bad script, too much talkingt, non stop talking, superheros and villains talking all the time, everything must be explained 3. Joker performance is nothing more than little above mediocre. I'm counting this in list, because so much talking in public about awesome performance by ledger...well, maybe, if you didn't watch any film with al pacino...if you just put attention to it you will see legder is trying the best to act like al pacino in talking scenes 4. too much slow and heart breaking(yeah) lordoftherings scenes 5. film is next elections campaing, nothing more And film have few good things, to be honest: 1. music is great, pumping tension whole film 2. masks are very good,2face mask is perfect Short: this film in top ten alltime movies? bah!
1.0~Hum... 10 years later and people still worship this overrated piece of crap!! judoman_69 Sign in Permalink This movie is not even a Batman movie. It's basically a Joker movie featuring Batman because that's what everyone remembers. The irony is that Batman Begins is miles ahead of TDK, yet it's rated lower than even TDKR. The movie itself is watchable only because Heath Ledger gives an exceptional performance, but looking beyond his performance, the movie is very awful. There are more plot holes in TDK than the entire DCEU put together, including Green Lantern. Usually, in this kind of situation where it's a comic book movie, you tend to let some things slide, however, when Nolan publicized his trilogy as being realistic (where he failed miserably), you end up cringing most of the time. The problem with TDK is there are too many inconsistencies smothered in incoherence... The fact that people (and critics) are usually very critical on everything, but did not notice all these plot holes in the movie and dubbed it "the best comic book movie ever and one of the best movies ever made". TDK, if you actually watch the movie, is not even top 10 material in its own genre, let alone being top 5 all time. The legion of Batmanites made this rating high, but it does not reflect the actual merit it deserved. It was a complete piece of crap, plain and simple. No character development, abundance of plot holes and a week story... How can people be so blind?
10.0~The night is Darkest before the Dawn... imalamin Sign in Permalink Is there anybody out there that was more excited about this movie than I was? Maybe but most probably not. I've been looking forward to another Batman movie since the credits rolled on "Batman Begins" back in 2005. Batman is a movie that needs no synopsis, even for non-fans. But in case you are totally clueless, all you need to know is that Batman is a guy that dresses up in a bat costume and fights crime in Gotham city. The Dark Knight continues where Batman Begins left off. Christian Bale reprises his role as Barman from the last movie, and this time he has two new villains: The Joker, played by Heath Ledger and Two-Face/Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. This is no doubt the most hyped movie of the year, especially with Heath's sudden death, and I must tell you it was up to the hype, or very very close to it. There's a buzz for an Oscar campaign for Heath and I'll tell you right now that he was absolutely amazing and deserves an Oscar, or at least a nomination. If Warner Brothers didn't tell us Heath was playing The Joker, I swear not many people would have guessed it was him. I know I wouldn't have. So is this a good movie or just a good-Joker-used-to-promote-an-average movie? Good question. But an even better question is did you watch Batman Begins? Did you enjoy it? If you watch this movie, you'll never want to watch Batman Begins again because The Dark Knight will make it look like the worst movie you've ever seen. I promise you. Everyone is talking about The Joker, but Harvey Dent/Two face is equally as good. His make- up, as Two Face will blow you away, and his acting is nothing less than amazing. Everyone else reprised their role from the last movie; all except Katie Holmes which if you ask me is a good move because I felt she didn't really belong in the first one. She is replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal, which I love. Director Christopher Nolan is a genius (Yes I know all the directors I reviewed are geniuses). He not only made an awesome superhero movie, but an awesome crime/detective movie. His brother Jonathan Nolan worked on the script, and since I saw Memento which the two worked on, I know that these two were born to work together. So is there anything bad about this movie? As another critic rightly put it, "This movie was too long, but I'm only saying this so it seems like I'm doing my job..." That being said, I don't think the length of this movie is a problem at all. I mean, The Godfather ran for almost three hours, I don't hear anyone complaining. Moreover, in most long movies, you'll see a scene or two that can be cut to shorten it, The Dark Knight had none. It was pure two and a half hours of awesomeness! The closing speech of the movie ended with Commissioner Gordon saying "... he's the Dark Knight". Then there was a black screen. It was at that time that I noticed tears rolling down my cheeks because of how lucky I feel to be alive to witness this cinematic masterpiece. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the first movie I've given 5 out of 5 stars!
5.0~A terrorist plot so complicated and convoluted, it would derail even 007... moonspinner55 Sign in Permalink Gotham City no longer has an ethereal, poetic glow. In director Christopher Nolan's follow-up to his 2005 blockbuster "Batman Begins", Gotham is just another Metropolitan city full of embittered residents squirming under the stronghold of Mafiosos, psychopaths, blackmailers, and terrorists--namely the Joker, who opens the film robbing a bank owned by the Mob with his masked cohorts, whom he has no loyalty to. Heath Ledger won a posthumous Supporting Actor Oscar for his twisted portrayal of the Joker--playing the facially-scarred criminal mastermind as if he just escaped from a lunatic asylum--but it isn't a multi-layered, pleasurable performance. Christian Bale returns as billionaire Bruce Wayne (and his alter-ego, a flesh-and-blood Batman), putting his trust in Gotham's latest hotshot District Attorney who is dating Wayne's childhood sweetheart and going after the Mafia in court, if the Joker doesn't get to them first. Nolan stages one extended, fiery vehicle chase that is absolutely astounding, yet the rest of his film falls a bit short. The performances are variable, the mood is dour and depressing, and the illogical plot tied in endless, headache-inducing knots. Fans of the superhero genre will no doubt revel in the sleek look of the picture, but the script (penned by director Nolan and his brother Jonathan) is a disappointment, not helped by the smash-and-grab editing which cuts off and mixes up sequences before the drama has even played out. ** from ****
4.0~On an epistemological level, it's bogus seriousfilmcritic97 Sign in Permalink Like the great Shakespeare wrote: "Those with empty heads shall nothing say, and so remain like stones 'til Earth's last day". This is how I would describe Christopher Nolan's "THE DARK KNIGHT". I have duly noted its infamous popularity, which I can only attribute to a lack of understanding regarding, first of all, the art of aesthetics; and second, philosophy. This needs perhaps some elaboration. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a famous nihilist, notes, a man like the Joker can only exist given certain ontological realities, one being the de facto existence of pure probability rather than a fixed set of Platonic universals. This demonstrates an alleged entanglement with quantum physics: A simulacrum of the nothingness onto which the concept of meaning is applied can, it seems, take us further into the kind of world-view dominated by the struggle for understanding. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle seems apparent here, especially given that the philosophy of quantum mechanics now shows us that there are, in fact, cats that can live multiple lives at once under certain conditions monitored by the sort of pluviophilic entities hinted at before - there is in fact nothing certain at all, and we are left wondering if there is even such a thing as reality. The apparent flatus voicis we can derive from this pandemonium, this godless hell, is, I take it, the main concern and theme of "THE DARK KNIGHT", embodied in the positivistic antihero The Joker. Why does the film not deliver on these seemingly apparent premises? In the words of famous French philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, there simply cannot exist a set of ontological realities without a de facto set of morals; without morals, there cannot even be reality. Epistemology would dictate that we cannot be sure even of that very uncertainty Planck detected in his discovery of quantum leaps during the 1950s. The same phenomena apply to art as well, hence my entanglement of the two into an amalgam. But as ought to be apparent by now, these morals are left to wither in a helix of inconsistency. This is, in conclusion, what is thoroughly wrong with "THE DARK KNIGHT". This does not say, however, that the movie lacks any value of entertainment. You can watch it, if you choose to turn your brain off for its faulty epistemology. ****/10
10.0~Everything clicks. Nomad123 Sign in Permalink "Why so serious". This is a film which will satisfy serious movie goers, comic fans, fans of the late Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Christopher Nolan..in short everyone. The entry of both Joker and Batman are unrivaled to any character ever. Once inside the theater watching this, you are immediately aware that you are watching a masterpiece and greatness unfold. Christian Bale is suave, stylish, cool and dialogue timing is perfect. The voice modulation from Batman and Bruce Wayne are fantastic. Christopher Nolan has directed and orchestrated quite brilliantly; this is one of the most beautiful movies ever to hit the screen. The camera sweeps and angles are breathtaking. The shots of Chicago and Hong Kong are beautiful. Heath Ledger is electric, he absolutely deserves an Oscar for the portrayal of the Joker. No other joker is as good, whether in the comics or the movies. He has embodied the brilliant madness in the eyes of the joker, the coolness in which he handles everyone or everything around him and he has given us possibly the scariest and most dangerous villain to hit the screen. The suit and the bat bike (pod) have incredible tricks to show on screen. The bike sequence especially elicited a one minute of whistling out of the audience here in Chennai (I watched the 1st day, 1st show in India). The relation between the Joker and Batman are drawn excellently. It explores their 'link' like in the comics and does not disappoint. Coming to Harvey Dent, the character was portrayed excellently by Aaron Eckhart and the transformation excellent. Every character was given equal screen time and superb roles. The action is mind blowing, what makes it even better is the way Joker handles it. At no point was I able to predict which way the movie was headed. It never disappointed. The ending was good, it went well with the theme of the movie. Batman's inner struggle, Joker's obsession with him, Harvey Dent transformation and finally Commissioner Gordon's vital attachment to the plot were shown exceedingly well. Thank you Chris Nolan.
1.0~gratuitous "vileness" howardrbarnett Sign in Permalink One of the writer's wanted it to be realistic? yer kidding.. Could the joker realistically rig up all that stuff? ...c'mon, maybe a bomb in a closet, but the character's mayhem seems very unlikely (hospital demolition was particularly overdone). And what a premise, ever been to a hospital? Full of hard working people helping sick and hurting folks, nice theme point to blow one full of innocent people up; Like i said gratuitous vileness, period. And could anyone understand what Batman was saying? So much of his dialog I replayed and even after several times, still couldn't make it out; perhaps all for the best. The movie's set up -(of course to justify the conclusion), - is just all sort of contorted, irksome to this viewer. Another point of 'unbelieveability': when a person experiences really severe injuries, as one character did, how many scenes can you expect to play as a "running around guy" when you should actually be hanging by a thread in intensive care? We saw it on cable TV; did he perhaps turn super human during a commercial? Finally: does anyone know what becomes of our friend the Joker in the end? Maybe the TV version cut that out? It just sort of left him "hanging". All in all, a pretty crumby premise, w/ what's become so overused and typical: sick motives, expressed by pathological plot themes and characters. Just more of the same sensationalism, like so much of todays action thriller stuff, nothing new here, just another film trying to out "gross" (and by that I mean: to be more grotesque, repulsively ugly or distorted and gruesome). For a viewer who enjoys action movies, or used to, from what's being produced now-a-days, - I'm more inclined to pass them by and go for other genres. My recommendation: save your time and seek alternate entertainment to this gut wrenching tripe. I'd say boycott it, and the stuff it imitates. Avoid it like you would trans fat and second hand smoke, it too will probably be found not not so good for us in the long run (exposure to sick minds carrying out sick motives. You can find entertainment alternatives that aren't based on sicko themes! (and also, never try to do one of these reviews on an android, ouch.
8.0~Good? Yes. Great? Yea. Amazingly perfect in every possible way on an epic scale of perfection? No. diac228 Sign in Permalink I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be. *Runs* The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City. Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it? We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips? Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long. Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such. Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the "yang" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the "yin"; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven.
8.0~Overrated and very boring Dr_Death666 Sign in Permalink I don't mean to hurt the feelings of fans of this movie, but I simply hated this movie. I only understood and was interested in it for about a half an hour then I got extremely bored. The movie is extremely confusing, and overrated. I only got into the action for one scene in this whole movie. Seriously. Since people were sad about Heath ledger's death they all gave it high ratings in order to get it into the top 250. And #7?!?! Man, society today has changed drastically. Go watch the Batman movies with Michael Keaton. And Batman Forever. Do whatever you can to avoid this trash, despite it's extremely high, undeserved rating. 1/10 or: F
10.0~Misunderstood phenomenon Jarz2010 Sign in Permalink Being a Dark Knight fan of the comics for many decades, Batman in its true format, was NOT a comedy or a representation of anything that came out prior to Batman Returns. The TV sitcom was a joke. Tim Burton missed the context of Batman in its entirety. Finally, Christopher Nolan brings out the true essence of Batman, and its a wonder how so many people miss the context of what Batman represents. Even the vast majority of professional critics missed the true meaning of Batman. There is a much deeper, allegorical meaning about Batman itself that has been perfectly recreated in The Dark Knight that makes this movie surpass any movie ever created. The Dark Knight is a work of true ingeniousness, far more complex, contemporary, poignant and relevant than any movie ever made. If you miss what its trying to say, then you are left without any ability to understand why people are raving about this movie. But that's precisely the point. Too many people have forgotten how to think. Do you believe that Gotham City represents a fictional city? Do you believe that Batman and the Joker are based upon fictional characters? Then you missed the meaning behind Batman. The Dark Knight is a true work of genius. Its the complete war of two diametrically opposite ideas that work in our system of western culture and its extension to other concepts as well. Its a war between liberalism and conservatism. Its NOT only a war between good and evil that most people think. Not by a long shot. Gotham City represents the disease of liberalism gone amok. The fact that liberalism is guilty of graying out the dividing borders between good and evil has been fully established within our own societies. Look at our legal system! The guilty are treated far better than the victims. We have made the perpetrator the victim and the victim the guilty within the system of law. What is good becomes bad, what is bad becomes good. This is what Gotham City represents. Batman represents the conservative position to hold to what is right no matter what, and the Joker represents the conservative position of holding on to what is evil to the maximum. Its true that the statement there is a fine line between a genius and madness applies within The Dark Knight. Now lets take a good look at parts of the movie. During the robbery, we know that the Joker has no allies, he has his own agenda and doesn't have a conscience whatsoever. This fact is also represented by the "pencil trick" where his actions to himself was nothing more than a simple act that meant absolutely nothing to him. The Joker is immune to death or remorse. He plays by his own rules of madness, but is in perfect control of his extraordinary intelligence. What delights the Joker more than anything is to create sadistic moral dilemmas for everyone, criminal or not. To the Joker, Batman is the complete antithesis of who he is, but so much alike in determination to stand separate from apathy towards right and wrong. In the scene where Harvey Dent goes before the crowd and the crowd wants Batman to reveal himself because of the moral dilemma that the Joker created to weaken Batman's resolve, the crowd cries out for the Batman to succumb to the Joker's demands. This is pure liberalism at its best. Personally I believe its a disease of the mind. The inability to think rationally. We find this in our country where people cry out to stop the war that's going on in our world. Pure madness. How so you may ask? In the Joker's context, its so easy to see. Why? You can clearly see that he is a madman of epic proportions so you understand WHO the Joker is and what he represents. Know your enemy. The vast majority of people don't have a clue what the enemies true intension's are in this world. People refuse to see and believe that different mind sets exist within our world and how to understand them. Its there for people to see, but they don't see. In the movie, someone wants to save others by revealing who Batman is, but who defends the secrecy of Batman? The Joker. The Joker isn't interested in who Batman is at all. It was all about breaking Batman's resolve and using the public to revolt against him. Its absolute brilliance! You think two face has gone mad? Think about it. Use your brains! Harvey Dent stood for the conservative position that defied Gotham City completely. He stood for what is right. Absolutely. He understood that if his position was compromised, the legal system would be so corrupt that the flip of a coin exceeded the values of justice more than the liberal legal system that prevailed. Fifty-fifty odds were better than anything available. How true is this today in our world. Batman stands as enigma towards our world today. If you stand up for what is right and fight for it, you are condemned by the very people you protect. If you do nothing to prevent evil from spreading, like liberalism is guilty of, then you become weak and useless to stand against the tide of evil that is certain to overwhelm this world. I loved the ferry scene. Think about it. If you knew anything about the Joker, you would have realized that each boat had detonators, but being consistent to the Joker's mindset, each boat would have had the detonator that would have blown up their own boats, not the other. Its remarkable that no one clued in to this. I guess I know the Joker better than others. This only touches the surface of how deep The Dark Knight goes. Its far deeper and meaningful than any other movie ever created. It takes brains to understand Batman. Use it.
10.0~The best batman movie to date, without doubt evilpilch Sign in Permalink I'm hard pressed ever to give a ten. I don't think a film exists that deserves a ten. That value alone would perhaps mark the downfall of cinema. However grandiose that may seem. The Dark Knight certainly deserves more than a nine. It is quite simply the best batman movie ever. I have literally just walked out of the cinema. My only criticism is Bale's voice as Batman, which seems a little forced at times. That's about it. Ledger's Joker steals the movie. IMHO his best role to date, and his last of course. I expected he would get a posthumous Oscar anyway. But in this case he certainly deserves it. His Joker makes Nicholson's look like a joke. His character has more unexplained depth than any tawdry summoning that occurred before. The film has subtleties that may allude some viewers looking for a simple comic book action movie. Many of the comments before mine reveal such intricacies. I shall not bother to repeat them. Anyone that gives this movie a nine or above is pretty much spot on. Watch the film. Simple is that. Bale's Wayne / Batman are great. Joker is stupendous. What a shame Ledger isn't around for a sequel or any other movie for that matter. RIP Mr. Ledger. And to the Nolan's, thank you for a film which finally does the Batman better than DC.
10.0~A dark night in July onedayiwill Sign in Permalink Have just watched this film this evening in the Electric cinema in Notting Hill (if you haven't been....book in soon, for what is probably the most comfortable and Movie centric cinema in London, if not Europe). I will make this post short and sweet. 1. A disappointment from having listened to hype and IMDb ratings 2. Beautiful direction from Mr. Nolan (some of the best cut scenes and editing I have seen for some time) 3. Outstanding performances from all leading roles, notably, Bale, Caine, Eckhart and Oldman (who continues to deliver a resoundingly strong depiction of the uber-straight police chief Gordan)....also very notable is Maggie Gyllenhaal (Katies holmes replacement) who outshines her predecessor in spades (or jokers) 4.The films direction is so fast pace that towards the end of the film it almost overtook itself...from a viewers perspective...this could leave you feeling somewhat confused as to what is happening. Never the less the finale and ending was well structured, routing the Dark night into is place within Gotham and more importantly...the very successful franchise....left on a limb, so we expect more. 5. This Film sets a new benchmark for the comic book Genre and whilst I can absolutely, hand on my heart say that this is not the best film ever made (as IMDb and media reports have been claiming), it does put all of the previous production attempts in the Marvel/DC arena to shame & a tough challenge for the future to step up to this same calibre & level of production. 6.Ledger - Posthumous Oscar? - Maybe! The man delivers a truly absorbing and convincing performance, which not only firmly concretes this film together but keeps you guessing and transfixed on the persona that he portrays. A very disturbed and pchycotic individual he is too! 7. Moral Standpoints? Some have written that this film depicts and glorifies everything that is wrong in the world today....Excessive Violence, Knife crime, , extortion....disregard for society, not to mention using a School bus to facilitate a robbery. These comments have weight to them and the film touches on many taboo subjects which are not suitable for under 13's, in my opinion....but differ little from the norm in this and similar genres of film - 8. In summary, this film is hugely entertaining with plenty of surprises and great moments of cinema genius which will stay with you long after the film has ended. Don't hype yourself up - view with an open mind and not what you have read and you will undoubtedly enjoy this film. (especially in your own leather arm chair at the Electric Cinema, Notting HIll !!)
9.0~About as Perfect as a Batman Film Could Ever Be gavin6942 Sign in Permalink After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). There's little use in writing a review of "The Dark Knight" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor). I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The "Bat-Sonar" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score). Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see "Batman Begins" and "The Prestige"). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my. The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his "A" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre. As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre.
10.0~in regards to jfmvp's nitpicking bigredbeefstakes Sign in Permalink The scene about killing off the other heist men, the money The Joker was stealing from the bank was not for his own use in the first place, he was stealing drug money that belonged to the mafia, and that Asian dude. This is why he goes to the mafia for help and this is why he doesn't want to share the money. This also answers why he was able to get so many accomplices, since the accomplices were either part of the mob(in which they were doing it to get their money back) or mentally ill people, (the man who Harvey Dent was about to kill in the ally, and the man with the bomb inside him in the jail). As for "why did the cops not notice that The Joker was dressed as a cop in the scene with the mayor is because all of the other people weren't cops either, they were goons. Notice how there were about ten cops tide up and stripped when Batman saw them. The hospital was the only scene i couldn't figure out especially since their was no way for the Joker to have pre-lay the bombs before knowing what Hospital Harvey was at. As for the movie itself, the only thing I didn't like was Batman's raspy voice, it made it hard to understand some of the dialogue. I also think that Heath did too good a job acting that he stole the light whenever any other actor had a major role on screen. I specify major, because those few scenes when batman entered unexpectedly were great and shined light on the batman again. If this movie didn't include batman, and was written using characters from Batman, more people would be calling it a masterpiece. Because I think long time fans of Batman man were probably disappointed that it didn't keep with some of the humor that is associated with comic books, and the cartoon, and Tim Burton's earlier films. On the other side of the fence are the people who loved the original Batman cartoons comic books etc..., and they love the fact that Nolan and his brother put so much thought into the new direction they took Batman. In thinking through, if Batman were real, how would people react, how would a completely psychotic villain (aka The Joker) think and act in a real world setting. The results of Nolan's brainstorming open light to very plausible outcome if such a hero were to exist. The story was simple, but told in a complicated way. A psychopath steals drug money to build a gang of goons to fur fill his plan of corrupting a city, to prove his point that everyone is just as sick as he is, but a Hero, who is trying to give the city a real hero (aka Harvey Dent), tries to get rid of this villain, without losing what he fights for. It was told extremely well, and all thought with a run time of over two and a half hours you would think it would be drawn out, it was extremely well paced, especially when compared to "Batman Begins". The movie was performed well,The Joker being the only exception who was performed perfectly, told well, and filmed brilliantly, it certainly deserves to be called a masterpiece, and is in my top ten just below Forrest Gump and just above Shawshank Redemption. The 10 stars really should be 9.8 but i cant choose that
1.0~Need to take this movie down a notch willz187 Sign in Permalink Loved Batman Begins. Then it seems like Christopher Nolan lost his love-if he ever had it - for the source material. I am a huge Batman fan and will give any adaptation my full support. I can usually get something out of it. The more I watch the 2 Dark Knight movies, the more I hate them, and the more I think that Nolan was never a Batman fan. The stories are poorly thought out but that's not exactly Nolan's fault. It's how he introduces our heroes and villains that make me question his passion for the projects. In a scene that looks like it was shot by my older brother and his friends with a $40 video camera, Batman is introduced only after seeing a few pathetic Batman copycats, then we see him running through a parkade, after a car. He is indistinguishable at this point from the copycats. Not how I wanna be reintroduced to my favorite comic book character - in a fluorescent lit parkade, uncertain if it's even him. Where's the mystique? Wheres the darkness? The mythos? Where's the fear he's supposed to bring with him? It's all washed out. The second bad ENTRANCE was with, the most significant villain in comic book lore, the Joker. I know everybody loves Heath (R.I.P) but I cannot approve of his portrayal. Firstly, the Joker, THE JOKER, is introduced when he casually walks into a scene reminiscent of a scene out of Dick Tracy, where a bunch of corny, campy, bad guys exchange dialogue in what is supposed to be a meeting of Gotham's underworld kings. Then, some nobody strolls into this BASEMENT with his henchmen, like a background character might, does some tongue acting, then puts the screws to the crime bosses with no opposition. How did the Joker even find out about this meeting? And how was he allowed to waltz in - with no charisma might I say. Where's the evil? Where's the man behind the face paint? Where's the unbridled lunacy? The key to a good villain is that you want to hate him but you can't help but love him. I couldn't find the Joker, a Joker, any Joker, in any minute of Ledgers performance. His characters ability to predict the multitude of variables that had to occur for his plan to go off is unbelievable, even for the truest of believers. Agent of chaos or not, I need my Joker to be somewhat grounded, connected to something, to have SOME motivation. Some cause for his direction. I've already been lambasted by the people around me so I understand if this review will upset people. Im happy there are so many die-hard, passionate Dark Knight fans. But I have to state what is so obvious to me: shot for shot, this is a train wreck. Oldmans comatose performance as Gordon, the purposeless, tacked-on fight scene near the end of the movie. All of it. Just can't do it. It's plot is challenging in many ways, absolutely stupid in most others. No rendition will ever ruin Batman for me. But the follow-up, Dark Knight Rises - which I also hated - cemented to me, the lack of love on Nolan's part.
10.0~No words. felong1 Sign in Permalink This movie is the greatest movie I've ever seen. When I left the theater there was just so much excitement and understanding of the word around me. I felt enriched and amazed that there could be such a film. I highly recommend this movie. Great Suspense, Drama, Action, Comedy..you name it its got it..If Heath Ledger doesn't get best supporting actor then I'm going to burn down the academy :)..Bale does an amazing Job as well. This movie will keep you hooked from start to finish and the ending will leave you stunned. This is easily the best movie of 2008 and I believe it is my favorite movie of all time. Please, see this movie. There was a tone of hype surrounding it but its the only movie that has surpassed the hype for me. 10/10
1.0~If you liked this movie, don't vote. arcooper Sign in Permalink bad parts of this movie: --The action scenes sucked, other than at the beginning. -The action scenes consisted of the joker saying something stupid, batman hitting him, the joker hitting him back and then walking away, and something exploding -In a good movie, the good guy is supposed to be a little weaker than the bad guy and has to overcome it, but batman has radar vision and can fly while the joker has nothing but a knife -This movie was not inspiring. What does it inspire me to do? Pay a British douche a lot of money so I can dress up in robotic bat suits and catch criminals. Speaking of the bat suit: -If part of batman's sacrifice is that the city hates him then WHY DOES HE HAVE A SPECIAL UNIFORM? If you're supposed to be hated by everyone, wear a ski mask and stop advertising yourself. If you are trying to be loved by the people, then you can advertise. -The movie created so many dumb unimportant plot lines and nothing ended up happening. Right after the love triangle, the girl died. That guy said he was gonna reveal batman's identity, but nothing happens. --There was so much that didn't make any sense. -How does one guy in Hong Kong do the accounting for all the criminals in Gotham? -Why is it the biggest problem in the world that 5 people were killed in 5 days? That's better than things are usually in big cities. -Why don't the gangsters the joker is talking to kidnap him? etc. -The joker wasn't creepy. There is nothing creepy about a guy wandering around in face paint and giggling. If he walked in to a bar, cut a guys head off, and then ordered a salad, that would be creepy. -A superhero should be a superhero because he did something cool. Batman is a superhero just because he's rich. good parts: -The credits.
1.0~This movie was a joke... bigben5 Sign in Permalink C'mon folks, you call this movie a masterpiece? The greatest movie of all-time? Sheesh, I thought people had higher standards than this. The only reason why people went to see this movie is because it was Heath Ledger's last performance. And boy, does he deliver! But is it really worthy of an Oscar? Well, that depends on how you interpret The Joker. To be fair, there is no right way to interpret The Joker. His past is just as mysterious as his motivation. But how can you create a character with absolutely no history and expect him to be believable? In the comics, his name was Jack Napier, a thug/ comedian who fell into a bath of chemicals that bleached his skin as white as snow. He had only one motivation for all the mayham he caused -- to amuse himself. This back story, that I've just given you, makes the villain far more credible than he was in the film. Even Charles Manson, one of the greatest killers of all- time, had a motivation for killing that made sense to him, but in this film we are never given any insight as to what this might be. Okay, so I have no problem with Heath Ledger winning an Oscar here. Then why did this movie suck? Because it was created for shock value instead of for entertainment. This movie has no plot. "The Joker wrecks havoc on Gotham," is pretty much the only storyline you get. There are cars blowing up, people blowing up, people screaming blue murder and other bits of mayhem that make as much a sense as people screaming for mercy in a Godzilla film. Did Batman really have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to capture a corrupt banker or was that a ploy from the Chinese government to showcase the area for the 2008 Olympics? Why can't Christian Bale fight after all this time? Do you think those people on the boat would have talked things out in a "civilized" manner with the bombs about to explode? Me thinks pandemonium would have ensued, and that in the real world they would have dead in 10 seconds flat. Can you really set 30 million cell phones off to find one person? I think the writers wrote themselves into a corner on that one. Another thing that bugs me about this film is Two-face. The movie doesn't give lip-service to his love for duality at all. He just wakes up and goes "Gee, I have a burnt face. May as well use it for scaring kids," and runs off plugging people, serving up his own brand of justice. To say that he was a hero was laughable, as people serve up their own brand of justice all the time. All you need to do is walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time to see what I mean. Overall, this film was terrible. Christian Nolan's vision of creating a modern Batman kills the whimsical charm and poetic lyricism established in the earlier movies directed by Tim Burton. Besides, Danny Elfman's theme will always be the defining music of the Dark Knight. By the way, what ever happened to the Bat Cave? They should never have taken that out.
10.0~Batman Begins & Batman The Dark Knight miniliquid Sign in Permalink I always hated the batman movies, I kinda like the comic books but the movies never appealed to me. I never planned on going to Batman Begins at first but when my mate asked me to go I thought I'd go for the fun anyway. I was totally surprised by the difference between the new movie and the older 3/4 movies. But because I didn't expect much of the movie due to the first couple of Batman movies I kind of thought that made it go up in my movie rankings list. I never ever thought they could do something like that again and I was completely wrong. I went to Batman: The Dark Knight, because my brother went and I thought I would just go along while being bored. I never ever could have hoped for a better movie. And first I wasn't blown away at all, but after the movie had finished and I started thinking about it, I first of all saw it a 2nd time and I still wanna go a 3th time. Most important of all, this movie made me want a 3th Batman movie from this same producer and I wanna go right for the premiere! Batman finally kicks ass!
10.0~Masterpiece... vgagnani Sign in Permalink I took out some time today from my schedule to watch this movie with friends. I arrived exactly at time, what a luck it was the last show. As soon as the movie started "JOKER" made me sit on my seat for the next 2:32 hrs. Not to miss any single JOKER moment (scene) I controlled my pee (Full-pressured) till the end of the movie (from the starting of movie i wanted to pee but...). During the whole movie, I was shouting; OMFG, Holy S, fcuk that guy is completely nuts. Just give attention to each N every line joker says & I am sure it will keep your brain active, spinning for hours. Literally, this is one of the best movie I have seen in times. I still am shaking by the after effects of the JOKERs acting. I don't want to give a review on movie, You got to watch this movie to believe me. Watch it, I bet you wont regret any single moment (but don't control the inner calls,lolz). God bless "LEDGER" !!
5.0~Disappointing lucianomarzo92 Sign in Permalink Soon after watching the Dark Knight, I decided that it does not belong in IMDb's top 250 greatest movies of all time. It's a problem with IMDb. The minute a popular film hits the box office, what does it do? It skyrockets to the top 250. Of course, this happens because, whenever a big blockbuster first comes out, people get all hyped up about it and rate it 10 stars. They hardly ever take the time to recognize any faults that may be in the film. They just jump to conclusions to call it "a masterpiece" and "best movie of the year." Now I too had looked forward to this movie for a while. I enjoyed Batman Begins, and saw all of the other Batman films. The Dark Knight takes what was originally a cheesy comic book concept and tries to turn it into a big-budget crime thriller. It doesn't exactly make the transition. Because of this, the whole film turns out to be contradictory. At no point does the atmosphere jibe with the source material. The Dark Knight is also much too long and it isn't even that engaging. I wanted to like it but found myself wanting it to be over already halfway through. The way it is structured is also very sloppy and disjointed. It's just one outrageous scene after another. The movie doesn't have a whole lot to offer apart from a great performance from Ledger. I feel that Batman is very weak in this film as a character, especially compared his portrayal in Batman Begins. The Joker really dominates the entire film, not leaving much room for Batman's character to be developed. Batman also speaks in a growl throughout this film. Yes, I know this was intended, but it is not very menacing, nor intimidating, but quite ridiculous. And it is made worse by the fact that The Joker is main character in the movie who poses much of a threat. Christian Bale is alright as Batman in this movie, but his performance is really dwarfed by that of Heath Ledger. Morgan Freeman is great as he almost always is--best acting in the whole film (besides Heath Ledger). Maggie Gyllenhaal is average in this movie, and I found myself not sympathizing with her character at all. She's just another wooden character. Gary Oldman is alright. Michael Caine is good, but I have seen him do better. Aaron Eckhart is very competent at playing his characters (Two-face and Harvey Dent). But it is pretty unbelievable how brutal he turns out to be, compared to his cordial personality in the beginning. The Dark Knight has one very good scene (the hospital scene), in which Two-face looks at his coin and finds it has half its side burned, just like his his face. I was very impressed with this scene. In my opinion, it is the one part of the movie that has any depth or symbolism. But I found many scenes in the movie to be poorly done, including the scenes with The Joker escaping from the prison, and the scenes with Batman on the motorcycle. These scenes rely on expensive special effects to compensate for a story that isn't very compelling. Also, the scene with the two ships at the end is way too long, far-fetched, and really just a poor scene overall. The movie flows somewhat until this point, but this scene is just intrusive and irrelevant to the movie. The whole scene is very anti-climatic and interrupting. Overall, I'd say The Dark Knight is ok as far as summer blockbusters go, but that's really not saying much. For many, the movie is made watchable by a great performance by Ledger, high-end special effects, and first-rate production value, but, for this viewer, the shoddy writing ruins its chances of ever becoming great. The Dark Knight isn't so disappointing that I would ask you not to watch it; it's probably worth watching if you really like Batman. I do not ask you to side with my negative opinion of the film, as I am of the minority. However, I do ask you to not blindly fall for the hype, as so many have done, and to acknowledge the faults present in the film. Thank you.
10.0~This movie is awesome ga9065 Sign in Permalink the the joker play a great role, to bad he die rest in peace heath. I wanted to see it since i saw the trailer. It is top rated in here so its good. the plot its well played out. it is about 2 hours seen to long but it has action and surprises that you did not see coming. THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. I saw it in a regular movie theater but it is out on I MAX imagine how it will be like that.this movie is awesome from the beginning to end. if you had not seen this movie you should GO WATCH IT NOW. Thanks to all the actors directors and everyone that made the movie because it was AWESOME. CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE BATMAN 3 i hope it going to be like the first 2
1.0~The Dark Nothing HoBopkins Sign in Permalink This was one of the worst movies ever made. Never before have I witnessed a more confusing and convoluted mess. There were about ten subplots, but there was no main plot. The Joker existed to run amok and to represent the "honest villain", that is, he didn't mess around and play games like most villains, and he didn't do it for money, he just killed and wreaked havoc for the heck of it... okay, that's fine. But in having the Joker purposely ruin all the other subplots involving other bad guys, it basically made all the energy in having to keep up with the subplots involving these other people come to nothing. It was very tiresome realizing that everything you witnessed, after two hours of non-story action and hammy performances, really didn't mean a thing, kind of like when a movie shows that "it's all a dream". It might as well have been a dream. Because in this complete mess of a film, nothing mattered. The Joker had no purpose - which was intentional. But since the rest of the movie had too much purpose, or rather, tried too hard to have all the purpose in the world - it all came together like a big explosion... then, nothing. Just ruins. And two and a half hours of my life wasted. As for Heath Ledger, he wasn't terrific. He wasn't amazing. He was horrible. Weak. Sounded like a nerd. And he claims to have studied from "A Clockwork Orange" (please!), but he seemed more like he was doing a Johnny Depp impression, being silly and androgynous. It's just such a mess of a film. Horrible, simply horrible. And the reason I haven't mentioned Batman himself, is that he was so nothing, that there isn't anything to say about him. The main character seems more like a Vin Diseal character, and not a comic book hero. I understand trying to make the franchise more serious after being ruined by Joel Schumaker, but this film doesn't resemble a comic book in any way at all. It could have been a cop film, only the main cop had pointy ears, and the main villain had really bad makeup.
3.0~Hmm, the most overrated junk movie, I have seen in my whole life caramb Sign in Permalink This movie is a non-plot action-packed propaganda movie. Which wouldn't be so bad but the combination is such that it IS the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. Seriously, when I came out of the movie theatre I was sick and angry at the same time. The whole movie is about approach towards the various kinds of villains, how they are and how they should be generally handled. You have about twenty propaganda lines, towards which each part of the film leads, those parts connected by a very feeble link. You could almost see the authors as they thought, hmm, we need to put this line into the movie, what circumstances will lead the hero or antihero to tell the audience this truth? Of course that made the movie a two hour drag where the twists and turns of fortune made you think if it wasn't a 10yr old child who wrote it. Ha, the setup worked we caught the Joker. Oh, Joker escaped, what are we gonna do? Then the good guys would realize that Joker wanted them to set up a trap, he wanted to be caught so as to get ..., escape and harm even more. Well, that is so childishly ridiculous, first surrealistic propaganda movie ever. So guys out there in the US remember. When you get spied through your cell phones, when your dear ones die in stead of a rich undercover agent, don't feel offended. Because to fight the "crime" or "terrorism", we don't need the good heroes (those apparently end up as dead half-faced wackos). We need dark knights. Sorry for my bad English. I needed to get this off my chest. So much approval, 9.2 user rating here, 94% on rottentomatoes, are that many people so simple or so easily bought?
10.0~havoc, bale, ledger and eckhart ... Nolan lead the way please theurchin Sign in Permalink i was immensely disappointed that this movie didn't release in the imax dome in India. but nonetheless i settled in for the first show in a normal sized theater with people waiting in anticipation for India's most loved super hero. people actually came in wearing the bat mask(rarity for India) i was shocked that most of the shows in other theaters were booked. i whistled when the movie started i was like a little girl in a Barbie shop waiting to buy a Barbie she has waited for for 6 months. the movie opens with a shot of Gotham city and throughout the movie we are treated to the wonderful pan shots. and at this point may i cite, this movie has no unnecessary shots, every shot speaks distinctively for itself and adds the extra bit to the movie. the acting is excellent. Bale is Batman. i guess there is no one else who can do a more perfect batman than bale. if batman was real he would be giving a standing ovation to bale. ledger, the man everyone has been waiting fro in this movie is fantabulous. he has given joker life, made him real rather than a stupid comic book villain. jokers funny but his humor catches you by your you know what and makes you wanna shudder. at one moment you are laughing and the other moment you realize you shouldn't have laughed, the joke wasn't funny, you laughed because you were scared. thats what he does to you. Aaron Eckhart ... what do you say about him? he is scarier than joker at times. his transition and anger outbursts are terrifying but at the same time remind you that he is probably one of the better actors around who is not duly recognized for his talent. he is terrifying and at some parts more scarier than joker.(his make up or whatever the hell they have done with his face adds to it) his face is horrible, you cant help looking at his eye and wish it stopped moving. also he gives something to the character of harvey dent, the Mr. do good to all and the man who has his own wars to face. he balances these dimensions to his character well. the script is flawless. it got everything right, the dialogs etc etc. Mr. Nolan probably the EST director around take a bow. this is your Oscar. after giving us excellent movies i guess this is your podium speech movie. the movie is chaotic. as the viewer at times you go dizzy trying to understand how can so much havoc be created. but Nolan handles it as though its pouring milk in a glass. this movie in the wrong hands would spell MESS i dunno about ledgers Oscar but Nolan should get recognized for this movie. watch it and be amazed. be blown away by probably one of the greatest movies ever made
10.0~Heath delivers another great performance clarilujangualtieri Sign in Permalink Dark Knight is awesome . Like many have said before , is much more than a simple Batman movie in many aspects The script and direction are terrific. The movie takes your breath several times. Heath Ledger's performance as the joker is breathtaking , is awesome , I've got stunned and as a person who loves acting I admire him very much. It is incredible the capacity he had to change from a character to another like that ( just compare Brockeback Mountain's Ennis del Mar with this sinister Joker ) . This amazing performance is worthy of an Academy Award nomination (and could even win) but it only proves to us the great actor he was. I think that is disrespectful to say that Heath's performance has something to do with a drug problem or even with his death. People should think before talking and respect everyone who is hurt by Heath Ledger lost. In every single interview Heath seems to be a normal ,respectful, warm and a shy guy , there is nothing weird but a terrific actor leaving us his last genuine performance . Thanks C . Nolan for such a good movie . Thanks Heath , I wish you were here to enjoy this huge success and I sorry the fact that I will never meet you..
10.0~The Dark Knight is a Revolutionary Title We've Been Waiting For RolandDeschain1990 Sign in Permalink In today's day and age, superhero movies run amok in Cinemas all around the world. Just like crappy horror and action movies of the 80's, comic book movies are everywhere. From the turds like "Catwoman" to the decent like "Blade" to the classic like "X2:X-Men United", they have all felt like comic book movies. But there was one franchise that went from decent to horrid in a span of 8 years. It was Batman, going from "Batman" to "Batman and Robin" from 1989 to 1997. And when everyone counted out the franchise, they were in for a rude awakening. In 2005 WB and Christopher Nolan came together and made "Batman Begins", a movie that transcended the genre and made people clamor for a sequel. Well in 2008, Christopher Nolan returned and brought with him the old team and newcomers Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhall and Jonathan Nolan. This was a movie hyped for so long because of the last one and the buzz around Ledger's performance around the Joker. Well after three years of waiting, it arrived. And the question on everyone's mind is "Does it live up to the hype?" Well a simple answer in yes. But it is so much more complex that that. It is not only the greatest movie of 2008 or the greatest comic book movie, it is the best movie of the decade and one of the best crime dramas ever. The movie starts right where Batman Begins ended. The Joker and his goons are robbing a bank. But this isn't an ordinary bank or robbery. During the robbery, the henchmen start picking each other off. We find out the Joker told them each to make the cuts better. But they don't he's there with them. Also, this is a mob bank. So the manager doesn't go down without a fight. He pulls out a shotgun and goes to town. But he is dispatched off and we get our first glimpse off The Joker. Things only get better from here. After the robbery, we are treated to a gang meeting. Apparently the drugs being bought have odd side effects. Turns out the dealer is none other than Scarecrow. Cillian Murphy is back, but it's only a cameo to tie this to "Batman Begins". This scene works very well. It shows us the fake Batmen running around. It also shows us that Batman isn't happy with his suit. Things really kick off during the meeting of the mob. All the remaining bosses met to discuss the cops recovering the laundered money, led by Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman). They also briefly mention The Joker, but they feel he's a nobody. Then he crashes the party. He shows us a nice little magic trick and talks to the bosses. We find out he plans to kill Batman. After this scene, the movie just kicks it into high gear. I don't wanna spoil the movie for anyone, so I'll stop discussing the plot. Let's get this out of the way, Heath Ledger is no where in this movie. All we get is the Joker. It's a performance for the ages. Quite possibly the greatest performance of all time. Every scene he's in, he chews up the scenery. He's hilarious and frightening at the same time. The third time I saw it, I was still tense whenever he showed up. He's brutal, manic, psychotic, hilarious and very smart. The ultimate screen villain. He makes things harder for future Jokers. Everyone else in the movie is also amazing. Christian Bale is still the best Batman and Bruce Wayne. He is intimidating and charming. Gary Oldman is given more to do this time and he owns it. Amazing to watch as Jim Gordon, one of the only good cops in town. Morgan Freeman is still good as Lucius Fox, Bruce's source of gadgets. Michael Caine still works as Alfred. Maggie Gyllenhall is a step up from Katie Holmes but Rachel is still an annoying character. The most under rated performance is definitely Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. He is really great in the role. He owns Harvey Dent. He starts out as the White Knight of Gotham, a really admirable man. But he slowly becomes a ruined man, culminating into his change into Two Face. It's really fantastic. One of the best things about this movie is it managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. I thought I knew what was gonna happen, but I was always pleasantly surprised. The twists and turns in this movie never felt forced or gimmicky. It was all a natural progression of the story. Same goes with the action scenes. There aren't many, but the ones there are amazing. Nolan really knows what he's doing. The action was all natural progression. This movie is a lot darker than every other comic book movie before, excluding "Sin City". It really kept it's promise about escalation and how things are gonna get worse before they better. It is "The Empire Strikes Back" of this generation. It really is amazing how Nolan and company made such a groundbreaking movie. This movie transcends the genre of comic book movie. It's the second movie to transcend the genre, the first being "Batman Begins". It is an epic crime drama. It really ranks as one of the best of all time. It managed to be better than the hype which was out of this world. It's my fourth favorite movie ever. Nolan is now my second favorite director ever, Heath Ledger is my second favorite actor. Oldman and Eckhart move up in my list after this flick. A once in a lifer time event. It is truly a challenge to make a third movie that lives up to the hype. Absolutely amazing.
1.0~An excellent movie in every way...except the one way that mattered. dottyjyoung Sign in Permalink Looking over this movie piece by piece, anyone could say it was excellent. The acting was phenomenal. Heath Ledger deserves every accolade that's heaped on him by fans and reviewers alike. The dialogue was sharp, relevant, and paced well. The action was mind-boggling, but not so over-the-top that you were taken out of the story. That is an excellent, and incredibly difficult, balance to achieve. The directing and camera work was outstanding. The music was great. Even the makeup and costuming deserves a nod, especially for the fascinating re-design of the classic "Joker" look. And I loved the new batsuit. (Nestor Carbonell was wearing eyeliner--was that a shout-out to LOST fans? :) ) All-in-all, it was a superbly *crafted* piece of art. ****But I will never, ever watch it again. Why?***** Well, let's put the shoe on a different foot and see how it fits. What if the story of "Lord of the Rings" was told this way? What if, after their long, arduous journey, Sam decides that *he* wants the ring, kills Gollum to get it, then Frodo has to throw Sam into the pit of Mount Doom to destroy the ring...but destroying the ring doesn't really rid Middle Earth of Sauron, and Frodo spends the rest of his (short) life in disgrace, and dies of a broken heart? What would we say after we left the theater? "Why the hell did I just sit through that movie? What was the point?" Or what if Harry Potter was told this way? After 7 books and 17 years, what if it ended with Hermione being tortured to death, Ron blaming Harry and becoming a Death-Eater, Harry refusing to kill Voldemort out of respect for all living things, and the entire wizarding world blaming Harry for Hermione's death? What would we say after putting down book 7? "Why the hell did I just read all those books? What was the point?" The Dark Knight's over-arching theme was, "You either die the hero, or live long enough to watch yourself become the villain." The story that this movie tells is simply this: no matter how hard you try to fight evil, evil will take everything from you, and the world will be no better off for your sacrifice. If you stand against evil, here's what you'll get. Maniacs with no motives, misguided moralists, or simply "blind chance" will take the people you love, break your body, destroy your mind, and leave you with nothing in return. And as the Joker unflinchingly tells Batman, insanity is just a little "push" away. Oh, great. Does it surprise anyone that Heath Ledger had anxiety attacks and insomnia after immersing himself in this script? The creators of this movie used an immense amount of story-telling talent to create a film that tears hope away from the soul. Why? What's the point? What a waste of time, creativity, and resources! What a waste of a good story! What a waste of spirit!
7.0~does NOT live up to the hype hyperbart Sign in Permalink Having had to wait for 2 weeks before I had a chance to watch The Dark Knight, I was thrilled when the time came. After the first week of IMDb votes I kinda guessed there was some hype going on. But after 200.000 votes the grade was still 9.4. Was this still a hype or was the movie genuinely good? Also reading very positive movie reviews and hearing people go on and on about how great Heath was as the Joker, this meant the movie just had to be great, right? Well it's NOT. It's a good movie, but people who compare it to history's best cinematic productions are just out of their mind. Let me get to the first point of the hype: the Joker. I read reviews of this character being the most evil, terrifying, psychotic and creepy villain they had ever seen. I must agree that Heath does a great job of playing the Joker. But this just isn't living up to what I read and heard. The biggest problem with the Joker is that this is still an action hero movie, not a thriller or horror for that matter. What the Joker does made me laugh most of the time. I mean his opening with jamming the pencil through a guys eye may sound creepy when you hear or read it, but in this movie it's just hysterical. The Joker isn't scary or creepy at any point. He is psychotic, he is unpredictable and he is played with great depth (for a character that is flat in the script). But he can never compete with the great villains like Hannibal Lecter or even Jigsaw. Those are just out of his league. I would love to have seen the Joker develop more. The screen time for Heath is just way too low for him to carry this movie (although lot's of critics claim he already caries the movie, which would be a sad conclusion if you ask me). It's a shame Heath died. With that hype out of the way, the rest of the movie is pretty plain. It has great special effects and make-up, for which it'll surely compete for awards. But the other actors really can't deliver, even great ones like Freeman. Characters are not developed. Which brings the viewer in an awkward situation when we have to feel the pain that both Dent and Wayne feel when the lose Rachel, but we just can't feel that pain. That's just a result of poor script and poor character development. Good film, entertaining, but surely not great or superb. Get real people, look past the hype!
5.0~Disappointing sequel john3-2 Sign in Permalink I'm probably one of the last people in the world to see this movie, and I'm glad I didn't spend $10+ to see it in the theaters. Technically, the effects are amazing, and Heath Ledger does give a very good performance as The Joker (though crazy people are the easiest characters to portray IMHO). My issues with the film are: Batman resorts to physical torture in several scenes. The Batman I know would scare criminals, mostly through the fear of the mysterious "bat man". However, dropping a crime boss off a building to break his ankles is pretty extreme, and even his treatment of The Joker in the interrogation room is over the top. The film has too many plot lines...romance triangle, Two Face, both add extra baggage. The "Two Face" story line (coupled with a love triangle) could be a film on its own. And how about the Wayne Enterprises employee who was going to reveal Batman? Plot holes galore....I can suspend my disbelief and let Batman "fly", but how can the Joker sneak explosives into hospitals and ferry boats in MASSIVE quantities without anyone noticing? Too long by about 30 minutes. If they had trimmed a few plot lines it might have worked better. So enjoyable to watch, and probably a 7 rather than a 5, but I feel I need to vote down a bit to offset all the crazy 10 ratings.
6.0~The most *OVER-RATED* Top 10 film on IMDb flick_182 Sign in Permalink I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress! As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame. I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's "finest performance". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically. This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10. Having said that, this is nothing more than 'popcorn' film.
5.0~I like Batman Begins better. socfulofquarters Sign in Permalink Batman Begins was a more complete film. SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hated the way they dealt with the Scarecrow in the beginning. It was like they said, "How can we get rid of this character as fast as possible?" Shouldn't the Scarecrow have been on the ferry at the end of the film? I hate the way Batman fought in this film. In the first film it was about deception and stealthiness. In this film, it was about just going out and fighting. Lame. Heath Ledger was good and fun. Christian Bale went a little overboard with his "Batman voice." In the first film it worked because he barely talked. In this film, it got really annoying and started to sound comedic. They never explained how Gordon survived the gunshot. If they did, I missed it. There were more problems with this film than the first one. It wasn't as refreshing and I think it's being completely over hyped.
8.0~The fourth part is called illusion. The magician shows us something ordinary as something magical Ziya90 Sign in Permalink Do you know tricky coins? It is an ordinary coin at first look, but two-sided. One picture on each side. When you start to turn it continuously, the picture seems like it moves or changes. I don't know the name of it, but in the movie, Sleepy Hollow, there was one. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is like this tricky coin. You look, it seems like a crime epic and sometimes innovative, sometimes stylish, sometimes entertaining, but when you stop turning, it becomes mediocre, sometimes far fetched, sometimes illogical, sometimes scratchy and sometimes insipid. The opening sequence is so impressive. It is clearly seen that Nolan inspired from Heat as he said. Then, in the bank, we see an 'unusual' bank manager. By that, Nolan tries to say my movie will be different. This was a realistic Batman movie, wasn't it? However, Batman flies at the minibus and he jumps off a high place, but does not get injured. As for his voice, it sounds good, but a bit unrealistic and in theater it sounded ridiculous because of the subwoofer. Yes, the movie has a few smart ideas, for example, while Bruce Wayne changes his clothes, there are scars, bruised wounds on several parts of his body or Nolan gets Batman enter a disco which is postmodern, interesting. And Heroes never make mistakes or heroes are always good. The Dark Knight does not say these. The movie is like a drama, a crime epic. The atmosphere, the mood are stylish. All these are good.. Not only The darkest Batman movie after Batman Returns, but also one of the darkest movies so far. The scene that Joker gets on the stage first is my favorite. A scene the character deserves. Nolan's Joker is appealing, interesting, but lack of many things that Jack Nicholson's Joker had. And there is ''the criminal who does not care about money'' cliché. To play Joker after Jack Nicholson's acting, performance had seemed impossible. It is like play Hannibal Lecter after Anthony Hopkins, but Heath Ledger did it. This happens once in a blue moon. His acting is excellent. However, Nolan's Joker is passive and not a colorful character as it should be. Nolan does not highlight any character, so can we say that Nolan does not care about the details? Because, it seems that the actions or personality of Joker was not emphasized. The killing scene in the billiard room was odd, everything is off screen, but may be otherwise, it would have been too disturbing, but Nolan could have found 'the middle' of it. The scenes take place in Hong Kong were familiar to me. It was like a copy of Mission: Impossible 3 and there is one more action movie with the same concept, but cannot remember the name. The second goof. The distance between two buildings are extremely far. I should say the third one. Batman and Rachel fall from the penthouse of a skyscraper and within an inch of hitting the ground. Batman opens his wings, but they don't even get injured and Rachel cracks a joke! It seems that Nolan and his brother cannot decide the past of Joker, because he tells different stories about how he became like that? but this is not real important, just a bit frustrating. The ceremony scene is great, you feel like you watch a crime epic. These are the moments that the magician deludes the audiences. This is a pretty conventional, usual movie. A showy car chase, people who get panicked in ships (unbearably uninteresting), remote controlled bombs which a dull and extremely cliché idea. There are some far fetched scenes either. The sick prisoner in the jail was far fetched, Joker should have found a way to do that! In this movie, Joker is not acute minded like Jack Nicholson's Joker, Nolan tries to show him smart, but fails. The escape scene can be an example. Or they say Joker wanted to be caught. No he does not. In contrast, the questioning sequence was brilliant, touching by parallel story telling. The moment that he bashes Joker's hand was disturbing. Also, this part was the most depressive part of the movie. However, later Batman hits a man's car mirror while he picks his teeth! If Alan Moore wrote these lines, I don't know what he would do, but I did not like the new Batman costume, it is not stylish, the one in Begins was the best, very appealing, impressive, but this is not. Two Face. He appears as Two Face in the last 30 minutes approx. You know, they did the same thing in Spider-Man 3. Nolan repeats this mistake deliberately. The injured side of his face is disgusting like a zombie, good news for horror fans and I had not expected a cute face, but it could have been better. By the way, the way of becoming Two Face was far fetched. Couldn't they find a better idea? As for action, the car chase was extreme and entertaining, but conventional, it does not raise the bar. And I hate that S.W.A.T. members always crack jokes while in danger. This is superficial. Then why? Because this is an audience-driven movie. Audiences should laugh and be entertained, it must be both! Even Joker's saying ''he's missed'' is cliché. Another goof. Joker shoots at the car, but no glass are broken, no bullet hole. What kind of bullet is this? Blank? Batmobile tumbles number of times, but Batman looks as if nothing happens, not even get injured! There is one more harsh car accident later that people look very well and sound! This is such a movie. Car accidents do nothing to people, blades don't stick or cut! The action sequence that S.W.A.T. and Batman encounter were one of the most tasteless action sequences ever made. Plus amateurish and showy shots (the glasses) As for the Batman Joker encounter, it was run of the mill and also insipid, I had expected much more.
5.0~Let's be realistic. Faena Sign in Permalink I settled on a 5/10 for The Dark Knight. I appreciated the story structure and all the notes they hit... I just don't think they played them loudly. I don't like re-casting, and the replacement of Katie Holmes/Rachel and the original Barbara Gordon actress (yes, her too, didya notice?) is awkward and distracting. The lack of ANY blood in the film to complement the multitude of beatings and killings (to sustain a PG-13 rating) nullifies the tension that should be present in some brilliantly conceived scenarios. I didn't believe for a second that the victims of several hostage situations (mass or otherwise) would actually lose their lives, because it's blisteringly apparent from the onset that this film is a PG-13, and would never disturb its audience beyond the minimum necessary plot points. The Joker is actually underwritten. Ledger was game and his performance solid, but honestly: Throw the makeup and stringy hair on 75% of capable actors out there, and you have the same product. I think Jack Nicholson's output is ultimately more interesting, and I think that Tim Burton's original film, although imperfect, is still the most entertaining in the pantheon. I realize that to hardcore Batman fans, this is a wet dream having the grittiness of the graphic novels transposed to the big screen (if they say so; I say it came close), but riddle me this: If the same script was fashioned into a non-superhero flick, let's say Heat II, and had the same strong performances and production values, would the lack of Batman fan loyalty still rocket it to its current position on the IMDb Top 250?
10.0~Will Stand the Test of Time death_rocker45 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is rightfully called that. It's not a Batman movie, either is it a Superhero movie. It's a character film. Honestly, it should be called "Harvey Dent, as told by the Joker". It's about three characters; each dealing with heroism in their own way. It's one of the most unpretentiously complex movies to be released in recent years. The incredible acting across the board stunned me: Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllanaal, Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart all give the performances of their lives. This is an amazing film, and will stand the test of time as one of the greats. Nolan is to be commended for his incredible vision.
1.0~Am i the only one who thinks........Average? enlightenedexodus Sign in Permalink OK now i was a big fan of Batman Begins, i really liked it but it wasn't really my favourite movie ever and the same can be said for The Dark Knight. First of all, whilst the joker was an interesting character and very well written, to be honest i don't see what everyone is raving about. Yes Heath was amazing, but it gets me thinking was this due to the script? Or heath's ability to understand and become a phycopath? If it really is the second, should we applaud it? Did it live up too all the Hype? Is Heath the only reason people went to see it? Is it the best film of the year? The answer to all these is of course..........no, and i don't understand why everyone is treating it like a god "omg it was so amazing, best movie of the year", you see people this type of person is called a "Hype Hound"(by the way, thats copy written =]), a person who bases there sole judgement on the hype surrounding a film, and the first few reviews. Thats not to say there aren't some true fans who really did love the movie, but I'm sick of the pretenders giving it tens when they didn't even like it "Conformity is for those who cant think of there own free will, free will is for those who break through conformity" Anyways guys my final words is, a great movie but not the greatest. Will Heath win an Oscar? Yes. Will it win Best Picture? Well lets just see
5.0~An action movie. Nothing more mausar Sign in Permalink When I read the enthusiastic reviews in Italy and I saw this movie ranked 1st in the IMDb's Top 250, I thought: "It's strange, the other Batman (Begins) was not so brilliant, what's happening with this sequel? Is it really this masterpiece? Is it really in the same league with movies like 'Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse now'?". No, it's not in the same league. Not at all. When I saw it, my delusion was strong. It's a good blockbuster action movie, but nothing more. Let's see. The following comments contain spoilers. Be careful. The script is not so original. There are tons of action sequences, but what can I say? I've seen it all. I've seen the robbery made by violent people, fighting against the guards and killing each others (in all pulp tradition, since "Reservoir Dogs"). I've seen the ransom in China by plane ("Spy Games"). I've seen those action sequences with cars and armored vehicles in all American movies. (And this Batmobile is really awkward). I've seen the killer who kills by chance ("No Country for Old Men"). I've seen the super-mega-sadistic-mad-chaotic-evil-serial-killer in action who creates dilemmas and plays with his victims (in "Seven" and in the "Saw" saga). I've seen it all: "The Dark Knight" is nothing new. And it's very predictable: you really can predict any sequence before seeing it. There are a lot of absurdities. The heroes could kill The Joleker dozens of times, but they never do it. Why? Are they retarded? The "two ships dilemma" (I don't want to reveal more about that scene) is not realistic at all. There are only a couple of surprises, but the 2/3 of the movie doesn't create any suspense. What about the actors? The only two heroes of acting in this movie are Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. Heath Ledger, with his Joker, bears quite the entire movie. All the other characters became secondary. Aaron Eckhart is really powerful and he confirms his talent shown in "Thank You for Smoking". What about the others? Christian Bale is one of the most talented actors of his generation, but in this movie he keeps only one expression all the time, with or without mask. His Batman has no personality. Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most interesting (and underrated) independent actresses of the New Hollywood, since "The Secretary". But in this movie she can act only in few sequences and she has no chance to show her real talent. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane are giants, but in this movie they barely appear. Finally: I've never seen so many waste of talent! The good side of the coin in Christopher Nolan's work is: his philosophy. It's really positive and constructive and all his movie is coherent about it. It's just like the positive answer to "No Country for Old Men" and to modern nihilism: in the Cohen's movie, Evil is the absence of values and it's unstoppable. In "The Dark Knight", Evil is again the absence of values, but it's a minority, not the rule. So, we can fight Evil and defeat it, with or without super-heroes. But all those themes could be and should be explored better. "The Dark Knight" explores nothing.
10.0~An Unnerving Masterpiece that Requires Multiple Viewings. theballadofspikebeoulve Sign in Permalink This is for those of you who are avid film watchers and take it very seriously. Others will only applaud this film as a wonderful work. Avid film watchers will gush. Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'--well, frankly it tickled the bottom of my cockles. I'm very rarely tickled in that magically hidden place of pleasure (save for many random moments from my fiancé). After watching this film, I can't sum up my feelings for it in one review. I must see it again, and again. I wanted to see it right after I got done watching it, but all showings were sold out at the theater I was at. This movie will kick you in the teeth, figuratively speaking. If in an IMAX theater though, it will at least rattle your teeth as it is booming in those theaters. The acting is superb throughout. The directing, the lighting, the action, the set pieces, the script and plot are great as well. Ledger may be getting his just rewards for his portrayal of the Joker, but I feel the other actors are getting short-shrifted in their praise. They all do very well. Even the swat team members who really have no names in the movie. As for critics and their assertions about the movie? Too dark, too grim and depressing? No, not at all. In fact, it surprised me how far it didn't go in that direction. The graphic novels are a lot more depressing from time to time. A work of art? A masterpiece? Oscar worthy material? Yes. Yes to all three questions. More importantly though, this film is masterfully made work of love. Love for the source material. Love for film, and most importantly love for the human being. We can be soulless creatures every now and then. We can. When the chips are down, however, we show who we really are. Not schemers, not killers. We're human. We do what we have to in order for us to survive. When the chips are down, we will band together.
1.0~w0rst Batman leianleian Sign in Permalink i really don't know what is on in this version of batman which made the record for all time box office, it was the worst. The Batman voice is very gay trying hard to be male. In every superhero movies, leading lady always be on perfect look, but not on Dark Knight. There is only one truth, it was totally dark. The story was adapted from Spider man 3. Lack of batman gadgets. Cast was boring. I can't see any good looking cast. On every fight scenes, Batman really obvious that it was handled by a real martial art expert and not the actor itself.
2.0~The greatest thing about this film is its capacity to bore klc-16 Sign in Permalink How could the critics and the public be so WRONG about a movie? Well, the public is easily influenced, especially if they are teenagers with no broad movie-going experience to allow them to contrast this with other films. But the critics? More and more I get the feeling that the reviews we see are no longer about quality but only about sales. In this world of "reality" shows that are anything but - and MTV music videos that are to what film-making is that McDonald's is to cuisine - well, who can blame them if they no longer have any reliable criteria? What is WRONG with this movie? Just about everything... First and foremost, we don't CARE about anyone. Whether they live or die doesn't seem to really matter at all. Did ANYONE get teary-eyed over Maggy Gyllenhaal's death? I certainly didn't. We are not really given any time to FEEL anything. Second: no real suspense about anything. We're not given enough information, there is almost no attempt to build suspense... we just sit there passively watching as events keep happening all around us with NO attention to logic. Just one example: the Riddler is left in a locked room with a policeman. He has bizarrely been left without his handcuffs on... and all of a sudden the two of tehm are outside the jail-cell, and the Riddler has a knife at the man's throat. We don't know where the knife came from, we didn't see him overpower the guard, we don't know how they got out of a locked room. This is LAZY film-making... and it happens over and over again throughout this film. Events happen but there is no logical progression. The action scenes. Terrible. Everything is shot like an MTV video. Close-ups of the action that leave us with very little idea of what is really happening. The car-chase sequences were boring, because we had no real idea of who was where. It was all just a lot of close-up chopped editing. If this is supposed to be thrilling, then I suggest everyone go back and watch the chariot race from Ben Hur. No special effects, no insane wild editing in close-ups that don't allow us to really see what is happening... and yet it is three (four, five?) times more exciting than anything in this film. Bruce Wayne/Batman: stupid voice for batman, is he trying to channel Darth Vador? Wooden acting ... no sense of humour. A bore. The Riddler: better than I expected, but not as brilliant as everyone says. OF COURSE he'll get the Oscar, but mainly because he should have gotten it for Brokeback Mountain, and because he died. Everyone else? Just wasted talent... Such a disappointment, after Batman Begins...
6.0~Way Too Much of a Good Thing bababear Sign in Permalink Honestly, I wouldn't have seen THE DARK KNIGHT at all except I'd read so much about Heath Ledger's performance. It didn't take long before I was sorely missing Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. After a while I was nostalgic for Adam West and Cesar Romero. At about the two hour mark I realized that I really should have seen MAMA MIA or MIRRORS. THE DARK KNIGHT is a good ninety minute movie that's bloated to over two and a half hours. Christian Bale is probably a nice guy, kind to children and old ladies, but his performance varies between bland (as Bruce Wayne) and rotten (as Batman). Bale's speaking voice isn't all that distinctive, so there's no reason for him to try to disguise it. Heath Ledger did well with what was on the page, but the character emerges full grown from a vacuum. This man has gone through life looking like this for however many years and nobody has noticed him until he bursts onto the scene in Gotham? Warner Brothers spent $185,000,000 on this. It would have been better if they'd handed Christopher Nolan $18,500,000 and patted him on the head and told him to go make his movie. Best performance in the whole film: Chicago playing Gotham City. The movie looks great. The Cinemark where we saw THE DARK KNIGHT has digital projection, and however bored I might have been when the story bogged down the movie looked great.
1.0~Soulless, anticlimactic, over-hyped and finally..not Batman! Travixius Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is the worst sequel since "Highlander 2: The Quickening". I am dumbfounded at this entry into the franchise that was re-invigorated so wonderfully with Batman Begins. I speak to people frequently about this film and have had little opposition to my views on it, ergo people don't like it. I really think this film is the biggest dupe since The Blair Witch Project. I want to make it clear that I love Batman, Bob Kane's Batman, Frank Miller's Batman, Jeph Loeb's Batman and the DC Animated Universe's Batman. Like many, I found the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher films excruciating to watch. Batman Begins came along and Christopher Nolan gave us a Batman we could respect and understand as well as believe. We were then teased with The Joker's calling card and ready for what was going to be the meeting of the the most famous adversaries in comic and screen history....and we got....a joker with self applied makeup and no gadgets who is essentially a terrorist, no batcave, a batsuit that looked like a riot cop, a convoluted Scorsese like story about laundered money and a massive emphasis on factionalised and organised crime, a Two-Face who's only motive is a dead girlfriend, a Batman we hardly see, and a Gotham City that now looks like Chicago. But the enigma I can't stomach is that the film HAD NO CLIMAX!!! I asked many viewers what they thought the climax was and there is a different answer each time...oh it was Batman confronting Dent...no it was the Joker hanging upside down, no it was Rachel Dawes being killed.....NO there was no climax! This film's success lies only in the sad fact that it's main antagonist was played by an actor who died during the promotional phase of the film. In Nolan's attempt to legitimise the Batman mythos he has made it sterile and boring.
1.0~To much hype, and premature praise. showtime-14 Sign in Permalink Too much hype to take this film serious. People were crazy about this film even before it released. Talk of an Oscar for heath ledger before this film hit theaters. Will respect to heaths death but i think his death gave this film a bigger boost and expectation. Once the film came out i didn't find it that much different than any other action film. it was just one explosion after another. The performances were strong by everyone except for maggie gyllenhaal. Though better than katie holms performance doesn't mean it was a good one. There was something that bothered me about Christian bales voice when he was batman. As bruce wayne it was normal but when he was batman it was a complete change to a lower aggressive voice that didn't even sound like bales voice at all. it sounded bad. Then there is heath ledger, it was not a bad performance at all in fact it was rather great at times. He took the joker character to an all time low and gave it a more sadistic gruesome feel but to discredit what Jack Nicholson did for the character 19 years ago is not right. Jack gave heath a blue print on how to play the character and heath took it to another level. I really don't think its Oscar worthy like everyone is preaching for but it is a fine job by ledger. I really don't understand why fans are treating this like the second coming of Christ or something, calling it the best film ever, a masterpiece, the greatest super hero movie ever, it should knock Titanic of the top of the box office cause its a better movie. its all a little premature if you ask me. If degrading other movies or other actors to make this film look good is people best review of the Dark Knight then they are pretty closed minded. The dark Knight is a damn good action film, nothing more nothing less
10.0~Perfect cloverfield_is_a_great_m Sign in Permalink We all remember how good Batman Begins was, right? Well, after seeing the much anticipated (and hyped) sequel, Begins is child's play. "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We're tonight's entertainment..." The action kicks off with a bank heist that brings back memories of Michael Mann's excellent Heat (a feeling that lingered for the entire movie) and more-or-less introduces us to The Joker. Now believe me when I say that The Joker is completely mental. Heath Ledger's performance is brilliant. There's talk of an Oscar nomination, something which is very much deserved. He completely disappears into his character, perfecting the best screen villain since Hannibal Lecter. Just check out the scene with the pencil... The Joker prefers the slow kill. He is tortured by his sinister smile (and when you hear how he got it it will send shivers down your spine). But the thing that is truly sinister about him is he's not into crime for the money. The Joker kills and stirs the pot-because he can. "This city deserves a better class of criminal... and I'm gonna give it to them!" With praise for The Joker out of the way, it's time to acknowledge the other key players in this epic crime thriller. Morgan Freeman manages to put a new twist on his never-ending good guy roles (he was God once, for Christ's sake), Maggie Gyllenhaal is the perfect replacement for the bland Katie Holmes as Batman's long time friend and love interest Rachel Dawes, Nestor Carbonell (of Lost fame) nails the Gotham City Mayor and the awesome Michael Caine is, you guessed it, awesome as Batman's trusty butler Alfred. Another interesting point of this movie is we get insight into all of these characters, even Alfred, who's often just a plot device in previous Batman movies. "The night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you, the dawn is coming..." Following the opening heist we see everyone's favourite troubled millionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, cinema's definitive Batman) in his Bat-Suit once again cleaning the streets of Gotham, before getting the news from his close friend and clean cop James Gordon (Gary Oldman, reprising his rare good guy role from Begins) that it would be wise to work with the city's District Attourney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, perfectly cast) in their attempts to clean the streets of criminals. This begins a series of events that brings Batman to the attention of The Joker, who then plots to kill him in order to maintain criminal status of Gotham, first targeting various authority figures including the Mayor and Dent. "So what are you proposing?" "It's simple: kill The Batman..." To say much more about the plot would weaken the experience of the film, but there is one other key point of this film, and that is the dramatic rise and fall of Harvey Dent and his painfully emotional and physical transformation into Harvey Two-Face... "You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain..." All in all, this film is perfectly written, there are action scenes a-plenty but they don't interfere with the extraordinary character development, contains brilliant performances all round, especially the power-house performance by Heath Ledger, directed with confidence and gusto by Christopher Nolan and is darkly funny for the most part, but takes itself very seriously when it comes to the drama. "Know your limits, Master Wayne." "Batman has no limits." The verdict: The Dark Knight is stunning. It will be regarded as one of the best movies of the noughties, if not all time. It twists the standard comic-book formula and sets the standards of every comic-book and crime-thriller movie yet to be made. In a word: perfect.
6.0~Not as good as Batman Begins...Top marks go to the marketing hype created. margalong Sign in Permalink First of all, what a wonderful performance from Heath Ledger. He immersed himself totally in the role as the Joker, a much more sinister and psychotic portrayal than Jack Nicholson's 1989 performance which was also excellent. Was his performance alone good enough to propel this film to number one on the IMDb website? Absolutely not!! Do not believe the hype!! Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are veterans of the screen and are very easy to watch. Christian Bale as Batman was quite ordinary this time around and I imagine his throat was very sore by the end of production with all the growling he did. The character development of Batman as a person was well thought out in Batman Begins. We saw him face his fears and conquer them, something very much at the heart of authentic Martial Arts training and provided an insight into the character we as the audience could relate to. In the Dark Knight, he appears too one dimensional. His guilt at the death of innocent lives by the Joker is for the most part portrayed by bland expressions and plenty of growling when disguised as Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal was just plain bland as Rachel Dawes. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between herself and Christian Bale in the one romantic scene they had together. I thought there was more chemistry with Katie Holmes and Christian in Batman Begins. I found myself nodding off when she had screen time with Aaron Eckhart. Thankfully, the director must have reviewed her lack luster performance up to this point and decided the only option left was to blow her up. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent was for the most part quite bland also, but improved somewhat after becoming Two Face. His scene in the hospital with Heath Ledger was his one saving grace. The hand to hand combat was quite ordinary in TDK. With Batman being a practitioner of Ninjutsu , there was no dynamic display of technique to marvel at, or the subtleties of subterfuge (psychological) like in Batman Begins for which this art is known to employ. The film dragged at the end and needed to finish half an hour earlier. Overall, Heath carries the film with his performance, but there was a lot in the film that felt disjointed and not up to par with the original.
10.0~My mind is BLOWN!!! k_alby Sign in Permalink This was the perfect way to bring a superhero movie to a non superhero world. They made it so that you could believe that this could happen at any time. How do you do that? Well... a couple of aspects were put into place: First, write a wonderful script that explains how everything happens. Bit by bit, nothing left to wander. Also about the script I should say that it helped a lot that a lot of mini-stories were played together so you wouldn't be bored for a second, and you will be very busy following everything that's going on, story-wise, because every bit is important and there are no filler moments. It almost gets to a point were you don't want to blink to miss what's going on. Try not to. The next aspect, to bring it to play. And in this, we have to take into account that even a good story (and specially a superhero story) could turn out ridiculous if badly developed. Great directing by Nolan leaving you busy at every second of the way, so that when the action wasn't catching your attention (and few moments it wasn't) the character development was, and more times than not, everything was happening at the same time. The casting was a dangerous part too, and risky, casting Ledger to fill in the shoes of Nicholson, and to everyone's surprise, well.. it has been the best joker ever! and in this influenced the fact that Ledger was strictly prepared for the role and it showed, and the character was fairly better portrayed, in the script, and in action. It was as sick as you'd expect and yet he didn't take himself too seriously, you almost felt like sharing some of the fun he was having. But even so, he wasn't the only one in the spotlight. In that sense, you can remind yourselves of movies like "Ocean's eleven" or "The Departed" in which everyone played their part and got enough screen time not to make the movie just about one. This movie is about Batman (more so than about Bruce Wayne), it's about Harvey Dent (and he portrays brilliantly the role, one to surely remember), it showed the human side of things, by the hands of Gordon, Rachel Dawes (who is so much better and a refreshing change this time around) and in the hands of all the secondary characters, that cement the whole ensemble. If you're looking for action sequences, you won't be disappointed either, this movie delivers. You'll find it to be a "slice of life" movie, in an alternate reality that you'll certainly find believable and will identify with. If you look beyond the action and superhero gimmicks you'll also find the deep political critique behind the story, and the struggle that everyone feels, between wrong and right, every character in this movie is faced with the choice, and it's what they choose, that we can all relate to. It's a must see. I give it a ten.
8.0~The Joker wins Chris Knipp Sign in Permalink The new Batman film is out and it has triumphed as only a blockbuster can. It has made more money in less time than any other American mega-buck movie before it. It has brought the audience to its knees. Something approaching $200 million (enough to make 100 French art films) got spent on it, but soon the expenditures will be recouped. Wow. Good job, Chris Nolan. 'The Dark Knight' tears up the screen. Villainy, as embodied in the triumphant and voluptuous posthumous performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker, so spills over Gotham that it seeps into the hearts and minds of the leaders of the Good Guys. That's what they mean by 'Dark.' Gotham is No Country for Old Men. What's happening to superheros these days anyway? Hancock (Will Smith) is a foul-mouthed drunk who causes major damage. The new Batman movie raises the issue that vigilante justice, even meted out by a chiseled millionaire with glowing skin, encourages lawlessness and may over all be a Bad Thing. The Joker is a sadistic lord of misrule. He has serious childhood issues, but he only uses them to tease and torment people ("know how I got these scars?"). To hell with money, he says, setting fire to a two-storey Step Pyramid of bundles of cash--prompting thoughts of the drooping dollar, Bush's war, and the way Hollywood throws money at a franchise like this one. His pleasure is all in sowing the seeds of chaos. And it's his movie. We don't see that much of Batman, or much other than his masked face, and the Joker is just way more fun to watch. Ledger-The-Joker tears apart the movie, too--yet seems sometimes all that's holding it together. Punctuated by his appearances, The Dark Knight barely comes to life till he shows up twenty minutes in, then is shaped by his always-flashy and riveting turns. But the movie is troubled by its own chaos. It's too long, and grows increasingly incoherent toward the end. Noise is pervasive, urging the audience to be excited from the first frame. This is always a problem with any film, especially a very complicated one like this: if you start out at too high a pitch, it'll be hard to sustain that and if you do sustain it, you risk wearing out the audience. Contrast the 'Bourne' movies. They're pitched high, hard and fast, but they're essentially simple chase stories with the hero in nearly every scene so they hold momentum easily. 'The Dark Knight' has us following too many different forces, and who's aligned with what gets too blurred. DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhardt), Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale), the DA's new--and Bruce Wayne's old--girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllanhaal), Wayne/Batman's loyal sidekicks Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Alfred (Michael Caine)--the latter two film idols who grab the screen and create a void around themselves (they're shot that way too). There's also police lieutenant Gordan (Gary Oldman), perhaps the least interesting yet nearly the most important character, and a mayor (Nestor Carbonell) with huge eyebrows and black-rimmed eyes. Except for the loyal sidekicks it's hard to know which way some of these people are going to go but they're all vying for the audience's distracted attention. And then there is the further major distraction and overkill factor of the gadgetry, the weaponry almost everybody has in his hand, the Bat-suits the thuggish-heavy Batmobile--virtually indestructible, like some giant prehistoric beetle, and the Lamborghini, whose smashup was, for me, the film's saddest moment. What a beautiful thing! It cost hundreds of thousands to custom-make, and then they run other vehicles into it and put big dents in it. That's a blockbuster. It destroys all in its path. It burns up pyramids of money. Then also you've got sonar or radar or something in cell phones and tanks of gasoline, and dynamite and flame-thrower weaponry. Little things with blinky lights, a match, anything will do: The Joker likes to blow up things. And if you like to see explosions and fires and hospitals collapsing and cars and trucks flying through the air spectacularly (and pretty convincingly) this is your movie. If you like dialogue, it may not be. Voices get muffled in the noise and Christian Bale talks in a hoarse whisper as if he's trying to turn into Darth Vader but needs more amplification. Here again Heath Ledger stands out, and so does Maggie Gyllenhaal. They both speak their lines not only expressively but clearly and distinctly. Aaron Eckhardt gets to wear some pretty elaborate makeup. He, like Maggie, is a good addition to the series: she offers heaps of believable personality and his square jaw is made for a comic book hero. He could play Dick Tracy. He seems a long way now from Neil LaBute. And I'm sorry, 'The Dark Knight' lectures us an awful lot for a big budget action movie, about good and evil and law and order and stuff, but it's a long way from meaning anything--except that it's a terrible shame Heath Ledger had to die. He dives into and romps with this role. It's scary fun. He had much pleasure to give us. He was just beginning. The Joker rules.
8.0~Good movie, even if you aren't a fan of Batman superglualderaan Sign in Permalink I have never been a big fan of Batman. I went to see Batman Begins when it first came out and haven't seen it a second time. I saw The Dark Knight, and I thought it was a very good movie. Because I don't know a lot about Batman, a few points were a little hard to follow. Overall, though, you wouldn't have to see the first movie in order to understand, or really have seen the cartoons or read the comics, either. As others have stated already, Heath Ledger's performance was incredible. He's portrayal of The Joker was extremely creepy and psychotic, adding humor to his morbidity. The plot kept me guessing and wondering how it would end. This movie was very enjoyable and I will probably see it again.
5.0~This movie is way over rated. Ledger good. Plot sucks. cmichaelo Sign in Permalink Overall, this Batman was merely an average movie. It was a mix of greatness and disappointment. What pulled it up was individual performances; particularly by Ledger. But also Oldman, Caine and Gyllenhaal were good. What pulled it down was the non-focused plot and the poorly executed transfigured character of Eckhart. Plot first: The Dark Knight is only a half-baked story about Batman. In fact, it's more about the Joker, the DA and the cop with Batman playing second violin. I could not identify or feel Batman's purpose in the Knight. It's like all the air went out of him since Batman Begins, which I think is a much better movie than Knight. Also Bale was not as good as he was in Batman Begins. Reason being that his the story surrounding his character was not well thought through. It's almost like they tried to stitch in his Batman character after they wrote the main story about the psycho Joker's mission to "get the Batman" and to turn good people into bad people. Well, the plot to "get the Batman" is simply to make Batman feel so guilty about all the carnage in Gotham that he decides to step down. ABC terrorism tactics. How novel. Please folks. They could have done so much better with the story line. The second mission, to turn good people into bad people, I mean, OK but why is the Joker doing this? There's a disconnect here. The story is not built up. There's no context. Only little is told about the Joker's apparently traumatic past. Now Eckhart: Eckhart's transition from DA to vigilante was so not convincing. I never felt a real love connection between him and Gyllenhaal. There was no spark between the two on screen. They were like oil and water and the storyline never supported Eckhart's apparently insanely deep love for Gyllenhaal. Secondly, Eckhart simply sucked at playing a mean psycho character. He's too cute and lovable for such a role. The flipping of the coin thingy was downright lame. Particularly when one compares to the identical "method" of deciding another persons fate as masterfully executed by Bardem in No Country For Old Men. The makeup of the burnt side of Eckhart's face was also poorly done; like it was done in 1980. I also could not identify with Batman's mission in this movie. I had no trouble in Batman Begins, which in my opinion is much better than the Dark Knight. In summary, the Knight lacks story line and context. Ledger is great, but halfway through the movie his character grows old. The movie relies too much on the Joker to carry the story line. The main plots to "get the Batman" and turn people bad are both lame and lack story build up to be convincing.
10.0~Purely epic of Batman installment isensehaha Sign in Permalink This movie surely pulls one off and raise the bar to the whole new level of what a real "movie" should be, not only its a "Batman" movie, but it also deepens the mind of the audience about humanity and moral issues. It is a lesson, that guide us thru the journey of dark and justice, not a word can describe Heath Ledger's performance, he is truly phenomenal, as well as good job for the rest of the crews, most important, the core of the movie, Christopher Nolan, a brilliant director and writer. This surpass previous Batman movies, I mean, Tim Burtons' movie is awesome and dark in comical kind of way, but Nolan's Batman is dead serious with the plot and captures the dark core of the movie. Joel's crap Batman series is not a subject to be fitted, he should have done power ranger movie and done better, he surely ruined the Batman and himself. Way to go, Nolan, for bringing us of what a true Batman movie should be!!
8.0~Over-hyped thats for sure.. noshuan Sign in Permalink Don't let the title mislead you, I am not going to bash the movie, actually this movie is good, only that the hype over the internet(Heath's death and the Batman fan-support) effected the movies overall rating too much. I said this is a good movie. But is it the best ? Not even close. In its own category, it dominates most of the movies though, probably as good as Ironman and better than the first movie. Like most of the people, I am satisfied with the film but there are a few criticisms that I can make, about the fighting sequences, jokers screen time, and the process of the movie. First I wonder, why this film isn't called "Joker"? Not only that Heath overshadows everyone with his performance, he also has incredible screen time as well, it is as if we are watching Joker as the main character, everything revolves around him. Maybe It was because there were too many characters in the movie, with separate goals and purposes, which also effected the process of the movie in my opinion. The story sometimes advanced too slow and sometimes too fast(but too fast in general) not allowing you to digest the theme fully. One other thing is the fighting sequences, the careography was not well made, most of the time it was too blunt, too dark and because of that, hard to perceive. Maybe it was the directors intention, but it kinda disturbed me, not being able to understand what was going on. To sum up it, the movie was just like I expected, but obviously below its hype, with a few deficiencies, a good movie in overall but definitely not a master piece.
10.0~Ledger must be a shoe-in for Best Supporting Actor!!!! Superb!!!! nb-12 Sign in Permalink I went and saw the Dark Knight last night and have to say, I was absolutely blown away by this movie. The acting was spot-on especially Heath Ledger who I thought produced one of the best villain performances ever! He was so indulged in his character it was unbelievable. If Heath's performance doesn't earn him a 'Best Supporting Actor' award it will be a travesty. It's such a shame that Heath left us prematurely as he was beginning to be known as one of the best actors on the planet and his performance as The Joker proved this. Aside from Ledger, the acting as a whole from everybody was superb. Bale, Oldman, Caine and Freeman were typically astute in their performances as well. The movie had a very interesting storyline which had me hooked until the credits rolled. It had the perfect mixture of dark suspense and action which, by comparison, makes the Spiderman movies look almost laughable. I would recommend that everyone sees this movie. 10/10.
1.0~Vere Boring... kinggolub Sign in Permalink Tedious and boring. To begin with, I will say: comics about Betman - those commercial attempts that come out every week - I do not like. But arbitrary variations on the subject, for example, "Arkham: a serious place on a serious land," and no less paranoid "The Return of the Dark Knight", which was drawn by someone, and Frank Miller, and even more "Killing Joke" for the authorship of the incomparable Alan Moore - I can reread time after time. Especially "Arkham" and "Murder joke", and the latter can be called "typical Moore": he is very fond of his thoughts. Very smart and worthwhile thoughts. But the mainstream regressors never had such thoughts on the screen. Thousands of disastrous adaptations of books, stories and even poems are statistics, and there's nothing to be done. Do it "as it should" - they blame them for their clumsiness, their artificiality. Do it "as you want" - you will surely roar in the company of directors who have gone too far with pathos. And if this philosophical pathos looked simply awesome on the pages of comics painted by masters with an excellent syllable, then the same pathos on the screen, created with the help of special effects and "original angles" turned into cheap hypocrisy. To the director, it does not matter. Now it's fashionable to love Joker Ledger. But why? It's not the Joker. Not the CLOWN. Just a terrorist. A joker is a symbol of insanity, and pushes the masses into madness. The Joker must have a blood-stained, frozen smile. He must have a frightening, monstrously whitened skin. In the end, he does not have dirty green patches, but short, bright green hair that gives him a cartoonish look. A joker is not a person, it is a phenomenon, a symbol, and it can not be changed - its entire meaning evaporates. And then Ledger, with his desire to convey his vision, went too far. Played a bit strange - in some places it seems to be remembered at the last moment. Bale I like only in "Equilibre", because there are no emotions on the plot. Bruce Wayne from him nikakuschy. Meggie Dzhellenhal - a vivid example of an ugly and inconspicuous actress. Why is she in the movie? What role does it play? Did she understand this? Kane and Freeman are the bridgeodontists. They look organic everywhere. In this film they simply are - more and not necessary. Aaron Eckhart before the excellent Harvey, canon. After the zombie from the old horror, and not only make-up, but also a game
10.0~Just perfect. A must! sir_clive Sign in Permalink My wife and myself, parents of three little kids, rarely get to go to the cinema. Two weeks ago, during our holidays, we got my parent to babysit the little monsters, so that we can finally get out again. Taking a peek into the papers (actually *real* papers, I had no internet access :-) ) revealed, that "The Dark Knight" was the only watchable movie playing in the small nearby town. Somewhat reluctantly, we decided to give it a try. What the hell, we thought, we are on holidays anyway, why not check a kids movie (sorry to all fans of previous Batman movies, but that's just what I think of them). BOY, were we surprised! After the movie, it took us a few minutes before we both burst out "this is one of the best movies I ever saw!" I won't go into any details, for the multitude of excellent comments on this board already presents this movie as it is: a MASTERPIECE! Especially the performance of the late Heath Ledger (Joker) was unbelievable (posthumous Oscar, anyone?) I actually felt quite nervous and actually even a bit scared during some Joker scenes - something I didn't experience that often in a movie theater! And yet, we both felt, that quite a few lines of his could have been from us... :-) It's a must, please go watch it either in a real movie theater, or in a DAMN good home theater. While the special effects in this movie are just what they *should* be (a mere vehicle to transport the message), the atmosphere of the movie just won't come over if you watch it on a 19" monitor with your 5.1 headset on... :-) I'd gladly pay again to see it one more time!
10.0~a bit overrated ricardo-240 Sign in Permalink Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed watching this movie 2 times in the cinema now. 1st time I-max in Amsterdam 2nd in the local little theater. My girlfriend is a big fan of this movie (yeah women definitely enjoy watching this movie also) But, this movie went #1 within a week on IMDb. That means it surpassed all the movies registered on world's largest Internet Movie Database. I'm sorry but am I the only one who thinks that the movie owes this success to Heath Ledger's death? Not that he didn't act marvelous in this movie, he did. But I could name lots of movies which are better, or more entertaining, or more complex. I didn't even had to hold my breath in this movie. Normally I'd give this movie 10 stars but since everybody blindly does that I must give it 1 star.
7.0~An unbiased humble opinion mr-jaykay Sign in Permalink Granted it is a good popcorn superhero movie, but that's all. I have always enjoyed super heroes movies, but this flick in particular is a mix of the best and the worst you can find in a super hero film. Expect: A different lackluster "ungothic" Gotham City, solid special effects, cinematography/ photography, good acting and fine action scenes, empty crazed villains (take the case of Harvey Dent), thoroughly idiotic sidekicks, hard to swallow parts/ ultra suspension of disbelief,unclear character motivations/ decisions, a 50-50 script: so good/ so bad - with some forced situations and unnecessary scenes that almost ruin the movie, for instance the criminal's over-the-top ultra perfect plan and the would-be love triangle. All in all, an OK movie directed by a very good director (although INCEPTION is his worst work so far and one one the worst, most boring movies I have seen in my life). Don't expect; logical explanations, a deep look into the psyche of villains and heroes, a beautiful damsel in distress - here that's a real turn-off,a great satisfying movie like Superman by Richard Donner, X-men by Brian Singer or Spiderman by Sam Raimi. Don't believe the hype: Batfans are infatuated with it. Nolan's first Batman is way much better than this one. As much as I love the Batman (films, comics, TV series, cartoons, action figures, etc.)and superheroes in general, this one is not that good. Heath Ledger's death somehow made it more special than it would be and should be. Ledger's Joker character is no better or crazier than Cesar Romero's Joker ( from the classic TV serial), Jack Nicholson's Joker or Mark Hamill's Joker (from the Animated Cartoon series) - just a strange-looking criminal that doesn't act that mad, whose motives and motivations are unclear. The worst of all: he does not play any jokes or pranks on anyone in the movie.
1.0~Knight Not SO Shining HypercriticalHangdog Sign in Permalink Before walking into this movie , i really had great expectations, what with the rave reviews the movie was being lavished with and the seemingly awesome trailer. And then came the moment of truth,the movie was very ordinary. I saw nothing special in this movie for me to even remotely praise it. It was long, many gaps in the plot in addition to scenes and story lines which seemed senseless and had no follow -up. Plus, there really was nothing artistic about it and it didn't actually have the enjoyable cinematic experience moviegoers would want to relish in. This was further aggravated with the poor lines in the film. In short the movie didn't get me all excited or sucked me into it. Throughout the entire film I was hardly able to connect to the film. That said however I wouldn't recommend folks to not watch it but just an advice to keep your hopes to a minimal point.
4.0~Too Long, Too Little in Spite of Heath Ledger's Brilliant Performance jmbellin Sign in Permalink Unfortunately, this is a movie that just didn't know where to go most of the time. We have an almost three hour movie that really feels longer and doesn't know where to go and when to stop. First of all, let's talk about Heath Ledger's performance. The hype is absolutely justified. He lights up the screen with his performance and the film is delightful when he is on the screen. Part of the problem is that no other characters are equally as interesting and that includes Christian Bale as Batman. There is not all that much charisma in Christian Bale's characterization as Bruce Wayne and none of the other characters grab the screen the way Heath Ledger does, so the movie doesn't really give Heath Ledger much to play off of most of the time. Eric Roberts, almost unrecognizable probably due to the work that has been done on his face, has some acting moments in a minor role that cause a stir. I always liked him and wish I saw more of him. Meanwhile, the film has so many twists and turns that do nothing more than confuse, I felt more like I was in a maze that I couldn't get out of rather than on a roller coaster ride. Just when I thought there might be a resolution to the film, yet another plot twist, a new discovery would occur. I found myself looking at my watch after about an hour and a half or so, and the movie was only half over! The first part of the film, that is to say, the first hour, was more character setup and that was far more interesting. The first part of the film relied more on dialogue and there was quite a bit of evident wit. But when the plot points started getting laid on thick and heavy, I got restless and continued to get more so. At film's end, I ended up thinking "So what?". I was glad to have seen Heath Ledger's performance, but not much more than that. I felt, other than for Ledger, the film wasted my time (and money).
7.0~Kind of mediocre, but with astounding redeeming qualities. mullaryn Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is pretty much an average action flick. The standard 'almost-all-powerful-bad-guy', the 'all-powerful' good guy with friends, romance, rivalry, friendship, pathos, sob-stories, etc... The plot is really quite mediocre, but this is made up for by several things. One of these is the way the movie looks. The movie is alive with special effects, stunning views, constant movements, some slow motion 'cool' takes, pyrotechnical effects, and more. The movie is more than two hours long, and yet it is constantly in motion, something is constantly going off in a spectacular explosion or a wonderful car crash. Not once during these 2 hours was I bored or inattentive. The acting. The acting in this movie was superb, with two exceptions. Christian Bale... well, I can't say anything special there. He is a good actor, but somewhat uniform. His acting is almost the same in every movie. Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman were more rewarding, and I think that Harvey Dent is Aaron Eckhart's best role yet. Maggie Gyllenhaal was not bad, but a few times she was... unconvincing. There was something not quite right about her playing, either it was too dramatic or a bit weak. But good overall. Gary Oldman was a disappointment. He obviously tries, but his James Gordon is unconvincing, overly dramatic, and weak. The final lines (a very cheesy little monologue meant to inspire) would've been so much better delivered by any other actor (except Ben Affleck). And this is the same Gary Oldman who played Zorg in 'The Fifth Element'... The other exception is Heath Ledger as the joker. His acting is not superb, it is above. His Joker is the epitome of deranged, malevolent genius, and every single scene with the joker should be watched again and again and again. Heath Ledger as the Joker has become an iconic role, similar to Johnny Depp as captain Jack Sparrow and Kevin Spacey as 'Verbal' Kint. Heath Ledger truly died at the peak of his career. (I really did watch the scenes with the Joker several times, over and over again). In short. The Dark Knight rates a 5 without the Joker, a 7 with. A weak and foolish plot line is masked by a very glamorous and advanced look and great (for the most part) acting. Should you watch it? Yes. Once or twice. Except for the scenes with the Joker. Watch those several times. PS. (Kind of a spoiler) The situation with the two ships is Utopian and unrealistic. In real life, both buttons would've been pressed within 2 minutes, 3 minutes tops.
1.0~Awful!!!! grandgamer Sign in Permalink This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen!!! It has nothing to do with Batman and especially Joker!!! Joker is supposed to be a crazy,obsessed with money and vengeance villain who had an accident with chemicals! Not just an anarchist who doesn't like organizations and money and looks like homeless, with paint all over his face and some scars! Two-Face isn't supposed to die, he is supposed to be playing in another movie. And come on now, more people know who Batman is except Alfred, Batgirl and Robin? I am telling you this is not Batman.
9.0~Fantastic Film aralith-1 Sign in Permalink Oh, where to begin? This film was absolutely incredible. I have almost zero complaints about it. Of the few that I do is the set direction. A commenter before me mentioned that Gotham felt like any average American city, rather than the Gothic, dark style that was presented to us in the comics. Heck, even the first film gave us more of a sense of darkness than this one did. The city was a dark, dirty, gritty mess, with extremely dark lighting, long shadows, and buildings that looked decades old. In this one, all we got were clean modern skyscrapers with a few dark warehouses and docks thrown in there. Why the sudden change in set decoration between the two films? Other than that though, this film was fantastic. Heath Ledger did an absolutely brilliant job as the Joker. So brilliant, in fact, that I didn't even notice it the first time I watched the film. I spent the whole movie just being absolutely captivated and pulled in by his performance that I just thought, "Yes, that's Joker. That's just who he is." It wasn't until I exited the theater that I really thought, "Wait, that wasn't Joker. That was Heath Ledger playing the Joker!" Truly phenomenal. I completely agree with those who think he should be awarded an Oscar posthumously. Granted I haven't seen every film of the year, but it's hard to imagine somebody doing better than what he did with this role. As for the complaints about Joker's "purpose" in the film, or his "motivation": I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty sure that his motivation was purely insanity. Alfred even makes mention of it when he says, "Some men just want to see the world burn." Of course, this led into the great line later when Bruce asks Alfred how they eventually caught the bandit he was talking about at the time and Alfred tells him that they had to burn the forest. Essentially telling Bruce that he would have to become the very thing he wanted to fight, if he wanted to stop Joker. And yet, despite all this, Batman overcomes Joker's attempts to make him break his one rule, and still manages to catch him. As for Harvey Dent, I loved him. His transition from the White Knight of Gotham to the deranged, vengeful, chance-using Two Face was both believable and tragic. Having to tell Rachel, his love, that it would be alright, even though he knew that he would be thought of as more important and probably chosen over her to be saved was just tear-jerking. The only part of Two Face that I was disappointed with was his death. He is truly my favorite Batman villain. Thinking of chance as the only unbiased reasoning, the only incorruptible, is just a truly brilliant character and plot device. I am sad that we won't get to see it again in another film. On the other hand, Joker's psychotic devotion to chaos will hopefully make up for it in future films, though having to recast Joker may detract from the role detrimentally.
10.0~Oh sweet merciful Lord, that there can actually be sequels that surpass the originals drillbitz03 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie, just last night, at an advanced screening for the theater. I was not terribly looking forward to it initially because I figured it was just another Batman movie. Yes, Christopher Nolan was directing it and he also directed the movie that renewed my faith in the Batman series (Batman Begins), but it was just another sequel in my mind. wait for it to come to DVD, I thought. So my friend got me a free ticket to this screening and I went. All I can say is this (and I am not exaggerating): It Is THE Best Superhero Movie EVER. A true psychological thriller, Nolan slowly builds the suspense, terror and madness each minute you watch. At first, Oh sure it's the Joker. Biiig deal, he kills some of his own henchmen. But gradually, the diabolical mind behind the clownface emerges (demonstrated absolutely flawlessly by the late Heath Ledger). Batman, played by Christian Bale, is as dark and brooding as he was in Begins. His gadgetry and the quality of his costume is improving, but he is also gaining admirers in some strange places as small-time criminals begin to emulate him--something he refuses to accept, they ARE criminals after all. Bale's portrayal is perfect. Vengeful anti-hero by night, Billionaire jackass by day. In this movie, he is charged with cleaning up the mob from the Gotham City streets. Utilizing the legal powers of Dent and Gordon's access to city officials, he does this, clearing Gotham of the scum in one magnificent swoop. Hooray for our hero. Fortunately, the movie does not end there. A string of deaths occurs, all masterminded by the same diabolical villain and Batman makes it his personal quest to rid the world of the Joker. As people begin to blame him for the mounting hysteria, Bruce Wayne begins to falter. Drawing into himself, he tries to shoulder the responsibility onto Dent more and more. But Dent has a weakness, the same one Bruce does. And when she dies, with Dent listening over a radio, it is the final straw breaking for him. Maggie Gylenhaal portrays the role of Rachel Dawes, thankfully, grabbing it from the poor acting of Katie Holmes. Rachel's role is fairly minor, unfortunately, but there really is no back story to her. Not in the comic anyway. While Gylenhaal is there, she plays a much better Rachel than Holmes...though that is not saying much. Aaron Eckhardt, a man I almost immediately recognized from his role as the main character of "Thank You For Smoking", plays the 'White Knight of Gotham', D.A. Harvey Dent. This is a man destined to plummet into the depths of complete and utter insanity, as the villain Two-Face. Everyone in the theater saw it coming when he did. That doesn't take away from Eckhardt's portrayal of the driven Dent, who allies with Batman and James Gordon to rid Gotham City of the Mob. He is equally magnificent in his fall. I never forgave Tommy Lee Jones for destroying my vision of Two-Face in Batman Forever...but there were a lot of mistakes in that movie. I digress. Two-Face may be a psychotic, but he is NOT a giggling, twerpy psychotic. He retains Dent's drive and powerful charisma. Eckhardt and Nolan flesh this out beautifully. But all of this pales in comparison to Heath Ledger's Joker. The movie may be about Batman, but it is the Joker's movie, without question. I had always felt that Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker was done well. It was cartoonish to Ledger's maniacal villain. From the outset, as he so deviously states, he is out to "send a message." The message is that anyone in this "sophisticated" society that we cling to can fall to his depths with just the right push. His very demeanor was so creepy and so histrionic that it had everyone in the theater on the edges of their seats. And he wins, in spades, as he finds a way of turning Gotham's "greatest hope" and the man Batman sees as his public face, into something similar to him. Ledger, for those two and a half hours, is the embodiment of the chaos of the Joker. He captivates. It may be the most incredible bit of acting I have ever seen. But don't take my word for it. Go see the movie.
5.0~I hated this trash Bigbang Sign in Permalink Glad to see I'm not the only one who didn't like The Dark Knight. I can step back and objectively say it was a "good" movie on some levels, the performances, over-the-top entertainment, etc. But the bottom line is I hated it. Loud, obnoxious, pointless, and soulless. Who are these awful people? Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker, and it was impressive. He's fascinating to watch. But what is the point of his character? At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role, Heath's joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value. I don't get the point. Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining, are we that desperate? I was disappointed in Christian Bale too. He is one of the best actors working today, but this time he was kind of flat. I thought he was better in Batman Begins. This entire movie is just so over-the-top: explosions (wow an explosion, that's new), the cool looking but ridiculous motor-cycle, the millionth chase scene, repulsive characters like Two-Face, and on and on. We've seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers, and this loud, obnoxious trash is the result. We really are getting desperate. I usually agree with IMDb more or less, the ratings are usually reliable. But right now this is #5, come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie? I'm not hating it on purpose because of the hype, I liked Iron Man and that got hyped, I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped. But this nightmare of a movie needs a backlash.
3.0~Dark Nought j-lacerra Sign in Permalink I rented this movie to see Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance. I endured about an hour of this dreck, and, finding nothing compelling in Ledger's work (or anyone else's), turned it off before my mind turned to jelly. Admittedly, the film is well-produced, if somewhat dark and foreboding. I would have continued watching if the film was less stilted, and took itself a bit less seriously, campy and ridiculous as the material intrinsically is. But it does not go for laughs, and therefore becomes laughable. I found Christian Bale annoying, as usual, and was surprised at just how annoying Maggie Gyllenhaal (with whom I was not familiar) came across. One word kept pummeling my consciousness as I watched: STUPID! But I guess these kinds of flicks thrive on stupid. So, despite the big budget, big names, expensive CGI, positive reviews, and all-around high production values, there is still no remedy for stupid. Miss it and save your brain cells.
10.0~Will be remembered as one of the best films of our time baumer Sign in Permalink If there is anyone who is an anti-Batman fan, it would be me. While I thought Batman Begins was one of the best of 2005, I did not care all that much for the first four Batman films. I actually despised Batman Returns to the point that it is entrenched firmly on my top 50 worst films of all time. With that in mind, I began hearing all of the accolades this film was getting before it's release. How Heath Ledger had turned in a performance of a lifetime. How this was being called the Godfather of Comic Book films. How this film was being lauded as one of the best films in the last ten years and so on. By now, you've heard them all. And to be honest, I resented that and I believed that it was simply the scope of Heath's death that was causing this love fest with The Dark Knight. Never have I been so glad to be wrong. Not only is this film the best film I have seen since American Beauty, it is one that moved me and reminded me why I fell in love with the art of film in the first place. Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger and everyone involved should be proud that this film transcends comic book films, and it transcends the summer popcorn genre. It is a larger than life experience and it is one of the best films ever made, in my opinion. As we all remember, the end of Batman Begins we were shown a new villain named the Joker that had been leaving his card at the scene of his crimes. This takes place shortly after that with the Joker and his henchmen robbing a bank that holds mob money. He steals a cool 68 million dollars in a well executed and highly improbable robbery. Soon he is crashing a mob meeting and introduces himself quite effectively with a disappearing pencil trick that gets everyone's attention. His thought process is that he knows the mob no longer has the respect they once did, and that is because of the Batman. He offers his services, to kill the Batman, but with a hefty price. When his prediction comes true later in the film, that the mobsters are not safe from Batman, they realize they do need him. Meanwhile, a new DA named Harvey Dent is keen on cleaning up the city in any way possible. When he realizes that Batman is actually good for the city, Bruce Wayne takes a liking to him and decides that Harvey will be his white knight. This may actually allow Bruce to live a normal life. But of course nothing goes as planned and when tragedy strikes Harvey and his loved one, all hell breaks loose in Gotham City and the Joker becomes more and more unstoppable. Soon of course we are headed down the inevitable mano a mano confrontation between Batman and The Joker, but in a way that has never been done before. The Dark Knight explores socio-political issues usually reserved for a Michael Mann film. Take one exchange between the Joker and Batman, on paper it sounds good, but to see it on screen is mesmerizing: "Don't talk like one of them. You're not, even if you'd like to be. They need you right now. But when they don't, they'll cast you out...LIKE A LEPER. See their morals, their code...it's a bad joke...dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show ya, when the chips are down, these civilized people will EAT each other." Batman and The Joker are separated by a fine line. But that line is often crossed in the film and when the Joker puts Batman to the test, I think they switch personalities. The film works because it has iconic characters and wonderful performances no doubt, but it also works brilliantly because it treats the audience like they are smart and perceptive. Spiderman 3 this is not. It has to be mentioned of course that Heath Ledger gives a performance that has no equal. When I think of some of the great performances in film, I think of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, Val Kilmer in Tombstone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood and Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, just to name a few. They have nothing on Heath. He is The Joker. You won't recognize him, you won't know that it is an actor, you will believe that there is a man named the Joker that is on screen and someone captured him on film. There is not a finer performance I can think of and if anyone wins best supporting actor this year besides him, it is their duty to thank the academy and then decline the award and give it to Heath. He is that good. The Joker is mesmerizing. The Dark Knight is a film for a generation of film lovers that has been begging for a better comic book film. This is that film. Even if you are not a big fan of these type of movies, it will win you over. 10/10
10.0~The Dark Knight Delivers miscellaneous411 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat's crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman. The bad guys don't know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they don't really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Joker's personality is his motive. He doesn't care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger. Ledger's performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, he's focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker's humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing. Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledger's Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that, this is, by far, one of the best films I've ever seen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter, will never be revealed to us again.
3.0~Really, really disappointing, and way too long. nuwriter Sign in Permalink I guess I missed the warning on the label. "You must be at least this shallow to enjoy the film." This movie had no depth, although it really, really wants you to think that it does. Michael Caine was very good in this film. So was Morgan Freeman. But everything else was just so hollow. Nothing to draw one into the characters. And then the utter repetitiveness of the whole film. The Joker is a bad guy. The message which was relayed in the opening scene was then repeated again, and again, and again, and... And yet through all of this, they couldn't manage to put forth a story that was interesting. Nothing at all. Just excuses for special effects. Not as bad as Spiderman 3, but a really, really overrated film. Heath Ledger acts crazy throughout the film, but in a very, very two dimensional way. Ironic that a movie featuring a character called the Joker failed to have any laughs in it whatsoever. The first re-invented film was good. Things happened for a reason. Things happened that were surprising. Editing occurred. I would rather watch Adam West's Batman, than this. Those stories eventually got to the point.
1.0~i must have seen a different film!! fatbottomgirl-1 Sign in Permalink i have never been so bored the plot was totally predictable and it just never seemed to end it kept going on and on and on. the best bit was when the love of Batman's life died. my husband and i both nearly walked out cos it was so boring. the amount of times that the joker was caught was unprecedented and the heroes just had no brains about them as to what he would do next it took 3 of them to catch him and then he still got away. personally preferred Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the joker and as for batman what is with that fake voice? This is the worst film i have seen in a long time. as for it being a 12a who's idea was that? it should be a 15 so a warning to all parents. anyway don't waste your life wait till it is the DVD clearance shelf at woollies.
7.0~Fairly good movie. 7 out of 10. CindyH Sign in Permalink First off, this is a fairly good movie. I'm not going to say it's the best of 2008 by any means, as I can think of many others that are better, but it is a good movie. Most of the performances were great and the action was good. The problem I had with it was the length and the dark theme. My understanding however is that it's closer to the original theme of the comics, so I suppose that's the way it's supposed to be, but personally I don't care for that. Speaking of the dark theme... if you have kids, this is probably not a movie you'd want them to see. It's a bit graphic and the whole beating up the dogs thing was a serious turn off. Not to mention Two Face's faceless side. It was just a bit much. One thing I have to say is something that is a bit touchy. Prior to seeing this movie, I had read the reviews of how "amazing" Heath Ledger's performance was and I thought to myself that this was an insult to him. I mean everyone only begins to rave about his performance only after he dies and not before. I felt that they were only saying it because he did in fact die. I'm happy to say that I was very wrong and believe me, I wouldn't say this if I didn't feel this way. Personally I think Heath was obviously not the least bit intelligent for dying the way he did. It's unfortunate that stupidity caused his death, as so many before him. I cannot possibly admire anyone like that and they never learn, do they? In any case, Ledger's performance was indeed amazing. He owned the movie and it's a shame that we'll not see him reprise the role. Oh well, life is hard and it's too bad some don't know how to keep it. I do have another gripe too. I understand that in order to make things realistic, they have to make Wayne's voice disguised, but does Bale have to sound like he's gritting his teeth when he's speaking every single time Batman opens his mouth? Surely there was a better way of disguising his voice. Finally, as I mentioned above the movie was just way too long. I found myself wishing that it would simply end, only to be disappointed that it was still going on like the Energizer Bunny. Aside from those things, it was an okay movie. I can only give it a 7 out of 10, but I'm not a big super hero fan so that's probably why. My husband thinks it's a 10 so he should probably be writing a review. He says it's very true to the comics and is a great depiction. I'll just have to trust his word on that.
1.0~Objectively, one of the worst superhero films ever ljmcmillan Sign in Permalink The protagonist is boring, his Batman voice makes it impossible to take him seriously, he kills two people despite his no-killing rule being a major plot point, the villain makes no sense, the plot is riddled with holes big enough to see from orbit, and the action and editing are objectively terrible, to the point that basic spatial consistency does not exist. But worst of all, the film promotes a clear authoritarian message, with the protagonist indulging in torture, mass surveillance, and openly admitting that lying to the people is a-okay. The only good things about the film are the music and Ledger's entertaining performance. There is no defending this film. Do not even try.
10.0~Excellent movie. But not quite #1! bubbathom Sign in Permalink First off, I gave this movie a 10 because my standards for movies aren't high, and this one definitely exceeds. I know it sounds like I'm contradicting myself,(Giving it a 10 and saying it shouldn't be number 1) but in my book, this movie deserves a 10. Anyways, I loved the dark feel of the movie, as many other people have said. Christopher Nolan made Gotham perfectly. Heath Ledger did do an awesome job as the joker, and I feel he actually does deserve an Oscar for his performance. It was gripping, thrilling, and even pretty scary/intense at moments. Christian Bale also did very well as Batman, much better than everyone else who's done Batman in the past. The ending is great, one of the best ending's I've seen in a while. Overall, this movie was written great, and executed perfectly. Movies like this don't come around too often. Excellent, 10/10.
10.0~"The Dark Knight": Superhero Movies Get a Better Class of Criminal hardrock666 Sign in Permalink I can think of quite a few descriptions for THE DARK KNIGHT. But truthfully, it is very difficult to describe how the film went above and beyond my expectations. Christopher Nolan's latest is a near masterpiece that is smothered in atmosphere, and delivers all the thrills you'd expect and more. First off, while BATMAN BEGINS reawakened the comic book hero, the latest chapter offers up the best Batman ever. Nolan introduces a brand new character that he brilliantly shoots around, he surrounds the dark buildings with shades of blue and sweeps through the streets and alley ways. That character is Gotham City. Okay, this is not the first time we've seen his Gotham. But this time around it feels more alive and it seems to be closing in on the good and the bad, as criminal activity takes over what may have once been a beautiful, bustling city. It is so splendidly photographed, that every shot of this majestic land brings us closer and closer into their world. This is by far, his most daring and ambitious film. In fact, this is one of the few superhero film that is absolutely Oscar worthy. This is as good of a Best Picture as any film could be. As far as the plot is concerned, I think it would be better for you to know as little as possible. There is a very strong and effective story with a wonderfully written script by Christopher and his brother Jonathan. They give each and every character a real reason to exist. The dialogues are surprisingly smart, as are the people that live and breathe in this world of mayhem. And that mayhem, is mostly created by a nasty little character called The Joker. If you've seen the trailers for the film, it won't surprise you that Heath Ledger is great in the role. But he is more than great, he is absolutely frightening and brilliant. The character is evil incarnate, a man who feels no empathy and evokes no sympathy. He is referred to as a mad dog even by himself: "I'm a dog chasing cars," he tells his do-gooding nemesis. "I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it." Backing up this notion with evocative cinematography, returning director and co-writer Christopher Nolan includes a near-silent shot of Ledger in pancake makeup leaning out the window of a Gotham City police car, hair streaming and the wind in his jowls, like a happy Doberman."Madness is like gravity," the Joker gloats at one point. "All it takes is a little push." Belief works the same way. The Joker is the world's first anarcho-terrorist; interested neither in power nor money, he simply wants to see things go boom. He is a close cousin to Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men, but even that guy was taking orders from someone.Late in the game, suspended upside down from a bit of Bat rope, the Joker smiles (as he must) and tells his captor: "I think you and I are destined to do this forever." Alas, not. As for the rest of the cast, I would hate to see the wonderful Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent not receive the accolades he deserves. I've always thought he was a terrific actor, but he really delivers in TDK. Harvey Dent is a true hero in a mob infested world. He is a man for the people that wants to save his beloved city. Aaron approaches his character with such an honest and sincere performance. As he begins to let the violence and hate seep through him, he undergoes his transformation. In many ways, he is probably the most relatable character in the film. One of the things that makes The Dark Knight the classic it is destined to become, is the perfect casting of both Echkart and Ledger. A superhero flick can only be as good as its villain, and they don't get any better than this. Obviously, I can't go without saying how important Christian Bale is as Batman. It is such a pleasure to see an actor of his caliber playing a role like this. But Maggie Gyllenhaal is also a major improvement over Katie Holmes. I don't dislike Ms. Holmes as a actress, in fact, I find her quite charming. But Gyllenhaal comes across as a stronger, and more believable heroine. Aside from those I've mentioned, I also have to say that both Gary Oldman and Eric Roberts are a welcome addition. It was nice to see Oldman grow from the first film and it is even nicer to see the guy go against type again, as a non-quirky, oddball free character. He is one of the very best actors of any generation. How wonderful it is to see him as a regular part of the Batman mythology. Yes, I loved THE DARK KNIGHT. It is a moody tale about the struggle of good and evil, and everything in between.Yet in the end, Heath Ledger's Joker, Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent, Christian Bale as The Dark Knight and a phenomenal vision realized by Christopher Nolan makes TDK easily one of the years best.
3.0~Who needs 2 and a half hour superhero movies? cookinbaconandeggs Sign in Permalink Too long, too dark, and too serious. The darkness is unavoidable - but exacerbated by the length, and the fact that for a movie about a superhero, it is entirely too serious. No matter how hard we try, the idea of a superhero is still a bit crazy. Imagine Bill Gates or Warren Buffet as superheroes - it's silly. So why does the film take itself so seriously? Also, it seems that the Batman story slips to the side in parts, as though the film is intent on tackling too many issues all at once. This isn't said to be contrary - the movie can be legitimately difficult to watch. It's simply too long for the content. It's not a bad film - but it's not an all-time great either.
1.0~Silly and Boring pj-bus Sign in Permalink I have never watched a Batman film before, in fact I have never watched a super hero film before. I'd picked up that this was the best of them, so when I saw that it is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video I thought I'd have a look. Well I have discovered that super hero films are certainly not for me. As a child I really loved the Batman DC comics and in that animated world for children it works very well. However the realisation of the comic character in a more adult context is just totally silly. That voice he has sounds like Dirty Harry only more so and it is just funny. The Joker seems to be able to construct remarkable situations at a moment's notice. It is not credible. At every turn there seems to be something that has no credibility with the viewer and so you just don't care about what is happening. There is no adventure in this film nor are there any particularly clever twists or turns in the plot, primarily there seem to be some situations that the Joker sets up. Batman's solutions seem to be boring brute force either with fists or technology. In fact I think the DC comic Batman was a cleverer and more interesting guy. It was quite nice seeing Michael Caine but I don't think his, or anyone else's script was very imaginative. Boring and silly throughout.
10.0~Quite simply, redefining a genre, one of the greats. CinematicFanatic93 Sign in Permalink First of all let me start by saying this film is in the elite list of best ever sequels. Only a few sequels in film history have been better than the first, this film is one of the best examples of that. The first in the trilogy was a solid movie, but what The Dark Knight did was take it to that next level, it brought in some of the best characters in a genius way and elevated it to a modern classic. A lot of this films success is down to the perfect casting, Christian Bale reprising his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Heath Ledger taking on the Joker in what can be described as one of the best on screen performances in history, to Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as James Gordon, although the last 3 characters are supporting, they truly do make the film and give you the heart of the movie. What Christopher Nolan did when making this movie was redefine a genre, every comic book movie since has tried to do what he did with this movie but just hasn't been able to capture the same spark. There will always be Batman but I truly believe this will be the one everyone looks to for many years as the greatest of all. The Dark Knight truly is a cinematic masterpiece.
1.0~BORING, This film goes on forever abdelgulabkhan Sign in Permalink The worst film i have seen this year. Its so Boring. I think it got good reviews because heath ledger died and that was a tribute to him. Batman is crap, the joker is average. The first Batman with Jack Nicholas as the joker is 1000 times better, that was excellent, this was dire and boring. Beware, batman fans are just going over the top for this heap of rubbish. The film is so predictable because you know what happens. I think that gadgets were not that good and the actors were not that good. I was expecting this to be great but as with all films with far too much hype i was waiting for the good bit. After an hour i was still waiting. After 2 i thought this is so dull and it wasn't going anywhere. I love good films eg Iron Man, Lord Of Rings, Indianna Jones, Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars. This is a classic by no means.
10.0~Not just a "Superhero" type movie... 851222 Sign in Permalink Greetings from Lithuania. This movie "put a smile on my face!" I just came back from premiere of this movie in our country and i can tell you one thing - this film is a serious stuff. Forget all "Spider Man" or "Superman" type blockbusters - this movie is serious as it gets! Dark, real, and scary (in different ways) - this movie beats them all! It is a crime movie and a suspense-thriller - not a superhero movie. Heath Ledger really deserves an Oscar nomination for his Jocker - one of the best villains i have ever saw on a big screen. Watching him on screen i thought - that's what makes performances unforgettable. Ch. Nolan created a "real" world and a "real" movie about Batman. It's so real that even scares. One of the things i like about this movie is that it has very limited CGI. "Dark Knight" won't win an Oscar for a best picture of the year, but it's the best action - adventure film of this decade (along with "Bourne Ultimatum"). My hat is off to Christopher Nolan and his brother for creating the essence of a masterpiece. So, "why so serious?!"
10.0~Single Best Acting performance I've ever seen... rysmith25 Sign in Permalink ....and could be the best movie ever made. Granted, I've only viewed this epic masterpiece 3 times thus far, I came away feeling ecstatic that such moments of beauty still exist in this world. Last night(Sunday, 8/10), I viewed the movie in IMAX for the 2nd time at a 6:30 showing. The place was sold out. I couldn't believe people sitting in the aisles after the movie had already been released for 3 weeks. We got there 30 minutes before the movie started and 160 out of the 360 tickets were already sold. Let's start with the Joker. Heath Ledger is a god. I've never really loved any of his previous work, but I viewed him as a descent enough actor. Heath Ledger's acting in Dark Knight set a new standard for acting. I can't even put a finger on why he was so good, but he scared me. When they rolled the credits, I had a smile bigger than the Jokers, but at the same time, I was left wondering what if. What if Heath Ledger was still alive, what other great things could have he done? Did Heath become so obsessed with his work, and playing the Joker that it made him insane? Or, was Heath already so mentally unstable that it allowed him to play the Joker with such perfection? I think Heath was starting to come into his own, and realize his potential and everything came together for this movie. We all know the rest of the story. R.I.P. Heath, you made this sad person a happy one for a day. I don't even like Comic Book Movies. With a CBM, you already know none of this could ever happen, so its hard to even have a connection with any movie of this ilk. Unlike other CBM's, the Dark Knight had a very real, almost eerie feel to it. No superpowers, no radiation mutations, no aliens from other planets, just plain people in extraordinary situations. This movie is a classic story of good vs. evil, and why people decide to choose the sides they choose. What makes this movie a 10? Well, besides the fact that it includes the best single acting performance of all time, I couldn't get enough. The plot was rock solid, with many interesting plot twists that kept you guessing. I don't care how much of a veteran you are of movies or comic books, it was impossible to predict what was going to happen next. I love when movies have a perfect balances between plot, character development, and action sequences, and I can't remember a movie that has ever had a better 'flow'. The other thing that I absolutely love in movies is just when you think the movie is over it keeps going and getting better. The acting was top notch. Christian Bale is better than Michael Keaton, he just is. Old people, accept it, and move on. Bale is cooler, more determined, and has a deeper soul than Keaton ever did. Aaron Eckheart was outstanding as Harvey Dent, worthy of a best supporting actor nominee in my opinion. As good as Bale has been as Batman in both movies Eckheart was his equal in this movie as the White Knight. Heck, even Eric Roberts as the mob boss was a convincing character. The symbolism and cinematography was also top notch. The whole idea of people destined to destroy themselves, and how chaos ultimately reigns is fascinating to me. The Joker was the symbol in this movie. The Joker symbolized anarchy and Christopher Nolan's pessimistic nature let his character come alive. It's sad that there are such corrupt people in high levels of power, and while it's just a movie, it begs the question....what if?
9.0~The Dark Knight Brightens The Summer CitizenCaine Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan returns with The Dark Knight, his second entry in the post millennial Batman franchise. Christian Bale returns as a more anguished, morally ambiguous Batman than before. Morgan Freeman returns as Luscious Fox, Gary Oldman returns as Gordon, and Michael Caine once again is Alfred. All actors shine in their supportive roles, especially Oldman. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the new Rachel Dawes and is OK in the role but nothing more. Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent/Two-face in a great visual parallel to the film's theme of moral ambiguity and the duality of man. Heath Ledger as the psychotic joker becomes the catalyst forcing each of the righteous men to act for good or ill: Batman, Harvey Dent, and Gordon. Ledger's performance is as good as advertised. The action, acting, art and set direction, cinematography, dialog, and direction are all first rate. The film builds to a different kind of climax, reminding us that fate plays a role in influencing our lives, and we must adjust to survive. This is a terrific action film for adults with several contemporary parallels that are a little uncomfortable at times. There are a few drawbacks, such as how the joker seems to pull everything off without a hitch off camera. The Bond-like moments and the obnoxious flip comments made by Nicky Katt in the S.W.A.T. van during the chase under the Chicago loop are serious detractors from an otherwise outstanding super hero movie. The brief appearance by scarecrow served what purpose? This appears in IMDb's top 5 of all time? I think that says more about today's audiences and less about the film. ***1/2 of 4 stars.
10.0~Not just the greatest superhero movie ever made. A fantastic crime-drama is at play here. SimplyirreBraggisible Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight serves as both the title of the film, and as its final purpose (i.e., its a play on the phrase, "White Knight.") At the essence of this film is an extremely simple story, complicated (rather enhanced) by a series of developments triggered by the introduction of said "Dark Knight" in the previous film. And their consequences. The core of the movie is Bruce Wayne - originally having intended to serve as a hero for a time - desperately clinging to the hope of Rachel Dawes, and her promise of waiting for him, in the last chapter. But her heart is elsewhere. On the flip-side; everything is troubled by the inner-workings of a clown-apparent madman without a purpose. Christian Bale is exceptional here; playing the role of both Batman and Bruce Wayne differently (one of the only actors to ever realize that in the role) and both are played with equal confliction and brooding, building on the same promise shown in "Batman Begins." Aaron Eckhardt, on the flip-side of the coin (pun intended), is the obviously-inspired presentation of Harvey Dent like Elliot Ness in "The Untouchables." He is doomed to misery and scarring, of course, from the first reel and - strangely - every scene with him in it carries that pre-established foreboding. Perhaps intentionally. And Maggie Gyllenhaal does well in a role that was poorly-written last time and difficult to really care about. In the end, he comes through and enhances a role that comes off bland on paper. The rest of the cast is exceptional as well. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Eric Roberts all shine spectacularly in this ensemble cast. But the true star of the show is Heath Ledger. From the first reel of the film in which he leads a scene that starts the show with a bang, to the end credits; the actor and the man who was Heath Ledger is nowhere to be found. He disappears into the role with an intensity that you would not expect in - what is ultimately - a superhero movie. I have seen the film three times now and each time I notice something else in the performance. For instance, every line that he utters has a strange comical side of it. Whether its threatening someone's life, giving a rendition of his "violent history" or simply antagonizing Batman; every line is strangely funny and unnerving at the same time. Its also note-worthy that in performing a rendition of the iconic Joker far and away from his comic book origins; he ironically nails the best depiction of the Joker to date. Yes, surpassing even the likes of Mark Hammil. I found it interesting how they interweaved the Joker into the plot. Without spoiling anything; the Joker exists outside of the entire structure of the film and, truthfully, could have been easily removed and still maintain a tangible film. It almost reminded me of the intentional-writing on "The Sixth Sense" where (again, without spoiling anything) Bruce Willis' character exists in the movie with that same "interchangeable" involvement. This increases the entire scope of the Joker because, as a self-proclaimed "agent of anarchy"; he even exists within the reel of film as the embodiment of chaos. Christopher Nolan comes through yet again. One of the things I was hoping walking in was that the movie would be more urban than "Begins", which was more wrapped up with mythology than action and deeing the Batman in action. This time, we start off running with Batman finishing some business from the last movie. He keeps the film on the brink Another interesting thing I noticed about the film is that EVERY character is developed by the end of it. At first glance, all of the characters, second-billing and less, comes off extremely cardboard cut-out and one-dimensional. Surprisingly, throughout the course of the film, each and every one of them have their little story arcs that flesh out their characters. Perhaps this is why the movie has an epic feeling that surpasses the vast hype surrounding it. Having seen it three times in the theater, and "other places" (*waves at the Internet police*) I find myself hard-pressed to find a legitimate gripe about the movie. I have been sitting here this entire time trying to find one - and I can't. It is a taut, hard-boiled crime-thriller and mystery that happens to have a superhero at the thick of it; which is exactly how a Batman movie should work. Most of the film is even strangely realistic, in an unsettling way. Probably the finest movie of the year and a legitimate masterpiece. ****/****
6.0~Tedious billcr12 Sign in Permalink Other than Heath Ledger's magnificent, brooding and evil Joker, I am stunned by the rating here on IMDb. I found The Dark Knight noisy, overlong and annoying. Joker demands that Batman reveal his real identity or someone will die every day at random. A newly appointed district attorney claims to be Batman. He is abducted and placed in a building with explosives. Dent's face is badly burned in an explosion, but he survives. More bombs go off followed by chases on motorcycle and confrontation with the Joker, mobsters and various other villains. I completely lost interest in this endless, two and a half plus hour fiasco. Christopher Nolan needs serious counseling and to learn that some things need to be left out. Rest in peace, Mr. Ledger, it wasn't your fault.
10.0~dark and amazing lmespinoza5 Sign in Permalink I loved it. Heath ledger was chilling, Maggie was a step up, Aaron Eckhart was really good, and Christian bale was good.sad, dark, and a masterpiece. bravo. the best part was: random Guy: do you think you can just steal our money joker: yeah I am glad Katie wasn't in it, her bad performance is no match for Maggies Oscar-worthy performance.two-face looked a little fake, but who cares. joker will from now on be known as the best villain ever. batman might be the greatest movie ever. in honor of heath ledger, a great actor among us, may he rest in peace
1.0~A Plot in the Dark mphilipm Sign in Permalink Why did I watch this movie? To observe the performance of the late Heath Ledger. It was not a disappointment but, like other reviewers, I think it was not one in a league with, say, John Huston in "Chinatown" or Bogart in "The Treasure of Sierra Madre". It was more akin to Edward G. Robinson in "Key Largo", not shabby, entertaining in a movie which is really not memorable at all. The noise of it would have been unbearable in a movie theater but I saw it at home and could control the sound level and fast-forward. I've only seen a handful of movies that shouldn't have been over in ninety minutes and this one really didn't even have that much content. The dialog seemed to have been pieced together from the dead bodies of older scripts. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman grace any film by their acting abilities but I kept waiting for Christian Bale to say, "Go on. Make my day". Monique Curnan was notable in her supporting role. The rest of the major players seemed to be phoning it in.
1.0~Too implausible and too dark, but not terrible RIK-22 Sign in Permalink For a film to be 10/10, it really has to be almost perfect. I know it's all about opinions, but to get that rating it must be technically well made, you know, entertaining, good plot, special FX, acting, realism, etc. Oh and when I say realism I don't mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy, but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules. For example the Matrix was still realistic even though people could fly (it was set in a computer so it's possible). I liked the fact TDK was serious and dark, but that is where the positives end. The plot is ludicrous, as the Joker, who is a human being, is omnipresent, clairvoyant, a great hypnotist, invincible and has no human needs. I know this is a "comic book" movie, but when you set up a film in a normal America city, with normal physics and all that goes with it, you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events. The joker is beaten up, involved in car crashes, doesn't seem to sleep, yet is perfectly fine at all times Has a vast amount of mindless, kamikaze, henchmen, who inexplicably do everything he says. The joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in Gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once. No one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter. A man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time, somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery. In the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well. You don't care about anyone, as everything is too unrealistic. Therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10/10, almost regardless of opinion. I quite liked the filming and the mood of the film, but it has too many flaws to be considered that good. I gave it a 1/10, which is too harsh, but I felt obligated to bring down the overall rating.
7.0~Are you kidding? GNickL Sign in Permalink To think that this movie belongs in the top 100 movies of all time let alone the top five is ludicrous. You bet, it' quite a spectacle. But spectacle doesn't make a great movie. There's one truly great character and everyone knows it's Heath Ledger's Joker. That was a magical paring of great writing and great acting. But what happened to the rest of the movie? Besides The Joker the film is merely almost good. That is if you like exceedingly dark and depressing movies that have little if anything to feel good about. It's mildly suspenseful at times but much of the action is telegraphed. Let's see some more stupid police who can't see another Joker getaway coming from a mile away. I'm no wimp -- I can be engrossed by and accept wholesale carnage when it's in something like "Saving Private Ryan" -- but this is yet another movie in which it doesn't matter how many faceless civilians and police die just as long as there can be lots of shooting and car crashes and the stars are OK. And what of poor Batman? Christian Bale does a creditable job in the role, yet this is really a movie about The Joker. The hero and who he is isn't nearly as well explored as the villain. Besides Ledger the two old pros, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman, play the most interesting characters. Gary Oldman does a decent job as James Gordon. The problem is we're never given any reason to doubt him yet there is this undercurrent to the character that maybe he's not really working for the good guys. The scene where Batman hunts The Joker as SWAT teams come crashing into the building is one of the most confusing messes I've seen. There's no clear idea what's happening and why and The Joker's final capture is anticlimactic. The turn to the dark side by character Harvey Dent is poorly developed and in the final scenes, lacking much logic. And the suspension of logic -- especially when it comes to the evil doing of The Joker -- just goes too far. In the end, despite Batman's expected saving of the child, the movie simply peters out with a muddled message and Batman zooming off on his motorcycle in the direction of -- we can only presume -- another sequel. If you want a dark, action-packed film then see "Quantum of Solace." It's not a great film -- not nearly as good as "Casino Royal" -- but it's a fair shot better than "The Black Knight."
10.0~Ex-ce-lent! br_venom_luque Sign in Permalink I Watched The Other batmans film and i was seeing the downhill of the saga but with "Batman Begins" i said "OK yes we are going high now" then i thought "Wait the first Batman was OK but Batman Returns start downhill the saga" so i was thinking maybe TDK was a screwed up but no way!!!! Heath Ledger its excellent without a question in his role, Michael Caine is "Sir" Michael Caine, Christian Bale its a savior of the dying franchises like Terminator too and Gary Oldman its what you need to get the formula a succeed anyway Christopher Nollan its an excellent director and really if he keep going like this Batman will be more than a Legend... it would be an Era Well done hands down and ey... grab your hair when you kneel down :) :)
6.0~A bit of criticism to counter the praise ... corrinadylan Sign in Permalink Admittedly, Christopher Nolan has been incredibly successful at what I would consider a doomed endeavor. After all, what sane director would try to fashion a realistic, rational universe from a sophomoric fantasy about a self-indulgent playboy with a costume fetish and a penchant for stylized bedlam? Still, I find the Batman premise more palatable when overshadowed by the fun spectacle of carnival freaks, kitschy art, and psychedelically rendered pulp lore. Without such accoutrements, the story largely relies on the poignant characterization of caricaturesa difficult task, to be sure. At times, Nolan tries to circumvent the problem by turning The Dark Knight into a didactic meditation on terrorism or a vehicle for its catch phrase, "You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain." However, terrorism loses its contemporary salience when exploited for plot and entertainment purposes, and Nolan seems reluctant to subject his protagonist to the implications of a dubious aphorism or to explore adequately the transformation of his less fortunate foil, Harvey Dent. Because each character serves as a mouthpiece for Nolan's ideas rather than a living manifestation of his themes, even a cast of capable actors cannot save some of the more unconvincing scenes. In the film's best moments, the camera lingers over a face or a cityscape and allows the image to transcend the script. Sadly, such moments are few and far between. Nolan reminds us that the Batman legend will always fail as social commentary because it focuses on allegorical, larger-than-life individuals while relegating the masses to cowering factions of homogenized corruption, selfishness, or ineptitude. Such a perspective underestimates humanity, which is lost in the frenetic whirl of action sequences on screen.
1.0~10/10 Is Absurd daniel08-2 Sign in Permalink First let me say that this movie does not deserve only one star. My real rating would be a six to an eight (depending on your taste in movies) but I had to compensate. Compensate for what? Well, literary device, I'm glad you asked. Toolsthe answer is tools. No, not instruments used to construct objects or to do maintenance work around the house such as a hammer or screw driver. I'm talking about people, people who are easily swayed by other people's opinions and by mass marketing campaigns. Unfortunately, almost everyone in America (including myself) is subject to tooldom from time to time so we can really only judge others based on the extent and frequency to which a person is a tool. Now I realize that these tools sound pretty scary so here is a trick you can use to spot and avoid the biggest of these flaming idiots. If they have ever given The Dark Knight 10/10 stars or referred to it as "one of/the greatest movies of all time" well then Lil Miss Daisy I'm afraid you have a huge tool on your hands. I recommend immediate euthanasia. Why this movie is not up to par is covered thoroughly in other negative reviews, I simply felt the need to explain why there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews. It's quite simple really. The media told everyone they should likeso they did. These people then went out and told their friends that they should like itso they did. And these friends then went out and told other friends that they should like itso they did. So it went until one day TDK topped the list of IMDb's greatest movies of all time. What it boils down to is that this is your basic super hero movie that got really good media coverage. Had the initial media coverage been negative and Heath Ledger (God rest his soul) not died at an unfortunately opportunistic time for Hollywood this never would of happened. Basically what I'm saying is someone told you this movie was good, so you went into it with a positive attitude and were willing to ignore some of the flaws. And while the revelation that going into something with a positive attitude will make the experience better for you might not surprise you or anyone else on the planet I feel that the warm fuzzy feeling towards this movie has gotten to a point of excess. Too many people told you it was good. You went into it with too positive an attitude and you ignored too many of the flaws. This movies current average (9/10) is absurd and a perfect example of why all my scathing comments about tools in the previous paragraph are justified. It's an OK movie and a good movie if you like action movies and are willing to ignore glaring plot holes like the villain spitting in the face of physics and being able to do or be anything anywhere at any time he wanted.
10.0~One of the best Batman films to date... demoneyeslaharl Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is probably one of the few examples where I am unsure how to rate it. It has awesome action sequences, rather deep plot, a charismatic villain and the charismatic hero... yet it has problem with pacing and editing. The action and suspense would come at you without pause, making everything seem erratic, and not in a good way. Maybe to be specific... those who were expecting a direction and story-telling like Begins will be disappointed. Unlike Begins, The Dark Knight is not a story about Batman, but a story of Gotham in response to Batman's arrival. The theme of escalation, the classic notion of good versus evil, chaos versus order, and what a hero truly is, is present in the whole movie... but it was rather cramped in a way that it was somewhat difficult to understand it all with just one sitting. Batman (Bale) has now been doing the job for over a year. His appearance had in fact inspired people of Gotham to be intolerable against crime... but not in the way he expected. Copy-cats ran around the streets, guns blazing and shooting criminals. Thankfully, there is a new District Attorney who is also rattling the cages as Batman is, except in the open, and with legality. The dark knight hopes that one day, Dent will finally make the difference that Gotham will no longer need its masked vigilante, and he would get back together with Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal, replacing Holmes for the role). But things don't go according to plan. The mob, in its last corner, calls on the services of the Joker (Ledger), who unleashes forth a crime spree of unparalleled precision and destruction that drags in almost all pivotal characters towards the end. What's the most amazing thing about this movie is how accurate the characters are portrayed in the spirit of the comics. Batman now is more involved in detective work (which other movies, even Begins, explored little to naught)... Gordon (Oldman) is now more active, and much more explored here more, portrayed as a desperate cop trying to clean the streets, but getting trapped in his own dealings... the Joker, who finally is represented right (even if he does wear make-up) not as a prankster criminal... but as a true agent of chaos. Ledger had nailed him as a definitive Joker for the live action movies. How he acts, his 'plans', even his odd sense of humor. By the pictures, you see a grungy, dirty looking madman... you'd think he'd be so serious... but he is not. I could count how many times he made me, and the audience laugh. He tells Batman the duality of their nature and relationship, even wishing how he would want to do this forever... this is truly one of the best Joker portrayals in history. Disturbing, yet funny. Another strong point of the film is past its first hour... there are intense action sequences here, showcased mostly with real sets, and not relying heavily on overused CGI. Have you seen a truck flip on its back? Beautiful. Even on its last leg of the movie, the finale was not some regular battle between the two antagonists, but one big hostage situation. Trust me... it'll be a blast to watch it. One of my main complaints is how choppy the editing seemed at times, though only for a few parts. Understandibly, they were used to push the suspense forward, but there are times where the audiences would be left off somewhat confused. Batman's voice was also somewhat grating at times (Bale should start thinking of a voice that he can use when he's doing conversations as Batman... not always growling). There was also some annoying parts where the lines were either said too fast, or muted by the music. Overall, not a perfect movie... not even a true masterpiece. Its faults are often glaring at times, and even annoying, but its out-shined by the fact on how good it delivers in the middle to the end. 10/10 - You cannot go wrong with this movie. Watch it. Now.
2.0~Really didn't like it (warning - some spoilers) mail-doron Sign in Permalink When I saw Nolan's "Batman begins" I thought it was poorly directed - Not because Nolan is a bad director, but because this style of directing does not fit a comic. You can't take a movie about a guy in a bat suit too seriously and dismiss all comic aspects. Tim Berton knew this, directed accordingly (although this is also his usual style) and the result was a good movie. Nolan ignored this fact. The result was a movie that was not realistic at all, and yet tried to seem serious - an unintentional parody. The "eastern wisdom and training" montage clichés didn't help either. With "The Dark Knight", Nolan keeps making the same mistake, only this time its much worse. If the film is supposed to be realistic, you can't have so many unrealistic assumptions. One example: How is it the the Joker can get anywhere and do anything he want? He plants powerful radio activated bombs everywhere (it takes a whole company just to design these), He infiltrates the world's most powerful crime organizations etc. He keeps talking about how people start behaving like animals once you start disrupting their ordered world. But a plan of the Joker's magnitude would in real life require a huge, organized and coordinated group. Actually, in order to create "anarchy" in real life, you would have to organize and create a new form of order, so the Joker's point is moot. And that is just one of many contradictions I feel this movie has. That's OK for a movie that doesn't seem to take itself too seriously (like Berton's), but not for this one that seemingly aspires to be 'realistic' and to be taken seriously. The reason to give 2 stars instead of one: Superb acting by Heath Ledger.
10.0~Best AcTion Movie in A loNg time! (look at caps) supersmalls77 Sign in Permalink Just saw the midnight release of The Dark Knight and I must say I was more excited to see this movie than any other movie I have ever seen in theaters. Expecting a masterpiece in a comic book movie is crazy, I know, but a masterpiece is exactly what I got. First off, let me just say that the acting was PHENOMENAL! Christian Bale delivers another solid performance as Batman, and we can now comfortably say that he is by far the best actor to ever play the role. At first I was upset Katie Holmes did not come back for this movie but Maggie Gyllenhall does a fine job as Rachel. Caine, Oldman, and Freeman all do a great job as role characters, as they did in the first but the best acting was by two of the new guys. Aaron Eckhart as Two Face makes Tommy Lee Jones a figment of our imagination as he blows his performance out of the water. But the real story of the night was Heath Ledger as The Joker. Sad to see him go, I am glad that he will be remembered not as a cowboy, but as The Joker. Every scene that he was in gave me the chills, as he perfectly portrayed the psychopathic ways of The Joker and really helped you understand why he does the things he does. If he does not win an Oscar for his performance it will be a major disappointment. Last on the list is the Director. Christopher Nolan(Batman Begins, The Prestige), yet again makes a brilliant movie. This movie though, is by far his best, and hopefully, he winds up with an Oscar for it. The only movie I know of that may compete is the new 007 movie, but I personally don't even think it will come close as this movie, like a said before, is truly a MASTERPIECE. Well worth the ridiculous $10 dollars I had to spend to see it and I recommend it to all audiences. 10 out of 10 stars!
1.0~very weak, unfortunately valkyria4 Sign in Permalink I'm very disappointed and this rating reflects my disappointment. It could have been so much better, easily. First, it's as if there's no obstacles the characters couldn't overcome by snapping their fingers. It's just too easy for the Joker and Batman to do all what they do. It seems the writers didn't want to be bothered by realism and it's one of the main reasons I didn't feel involved or excited at all. Batman pulls out technological rabbits out of his hat to move the plot forward - it's contrived and not entertaining. The Joker sets bombs anywhere he wants without facing any obstacles. His team of super terrorists can fill a whole hospital with explosives in a few minutes after it has been evacuated - or was it before? Anyway we don't see them setting up anything, everything is done off-screen and it goes into action without any kind of dramatic buildup. How did his gang do this or that? Doesn't matter cause there's an explosion coming soon. *YAWN* The Joker starts with a small gang but in only a few days or so it seems he builds a big organization capable of operating rapidly without flaws - a group we are told made up of many schizos and psychos from Arkham Asylum, as if they had all been released all of a sudden to join him and moreover in doing so became hyperobedient and hypercompetent robbers / explosive experts / terrorists / etc. Yeah. Right. As if running a criminal organization made up of Arkham inmates would be a piece of cake. It would have been so much more REALISTIC and ENTERTAINING to see the Joker having to deal with nutty and sometimes incompetent henchmen and we the viewers doubting whether or not he would succeed and yet pulling it off and laughing all the way up to the last confrontation. Instead he surfs on the action, survives all kinds of explosions and crashes and moves around as if Gotham City was butter and he a hot knife. *YAWN* Second, the style & editing of the movie was mediocre at best. You would think the Joker's first meeting with the mob would have something of a tension. Here we are introduced to Batman's no.1 enemy and he tells them they have to kill the Dark Knight. But the way it was shot the scene was cold, he simply goes in, makes a few enemies and leaves. And next The Joker invites himself to Bruce Wayne's party to kidnap Harvey Dent and he simply comes in, Voilà!, without facing any obstacles, there's no buildup, no dramatic crescendo, the pace stays the same, we get lots of quick shots, a constantly moving camera and even one or two 360 degrees around Joker and Rachel as if this was some kind of music video. There's nothing, no tension. And it went downhill from there, like a typical dumb action movie. Explosion, car chase, car chase, explosion, fight, car chase, explosion. Can't you guys come up with something original? And those action scenes aren't even well made. *YAWN* Why? After all you had an ace, The Joker, he should have had some cool crazy ideas to cause mayhem... but he didn't. He lacked the charisma that should be in such a character. Not that Ledger is bad but the character he plays has nothing special. He's cold, predictable and not funny. In Tim Burton's movie the man isn't just some psycho killer, you know early in the movie he's going to do his crimes with style and that he has surprises in his bag. He's a bit silly but you don't know what to expect from him - he's fun to watch. In TDK he neither has style nor surprises, HE JUST BLOWS THINGS UP WITH DETONATORS and he's not even having fun. Bbbooorrriiiinnnggg. I think a lot of people don't see all the big flaws of the movie because they like the characters and the themes. I like Batman, the lone vigilante fighting crime in his city and his struggle to retain his morality while confronting the worst criminals, I like Harvey Dent's character and the Joker trying to turn Dent into a madman like him to ruin his crusade against crime and I liked the Joker trying to corrupt the people of Gotham and turn them into murderers ...BUT THE MOVIE STINKS I really wanted TDK to be good, good at least like half of Batman Begins is, I wanted to leave the theater with a big smile on my face but I left the theater feeling cheated because I wanted to see a cool movie and I didn't, I saw a lame piece of crap. There was no climax, no great scenes, no drama, no tension, no substance, only over the top action scenes we have already seen elsewhere. This movie itself isn't a 1 out of 10 but I'm so disappointed by it that it deserves its 1
4.0~sorry, overrated hippothirteen Sign in Permalink This is currently the third best film of all time (according to IMDb ratings). No way, no way. The film was OK, Heath Ledger was good, but overall the film was way too long and rather over-plotted - just like Spiderman 3. Compared to Batman Begins the film felt like a safe attempt at a follow-up. Lots of big explosions, not much plot and hey a new look Rachel. To all the people that have rated this film as 7 or above, how often did you look at your watch, I know I did after 2hrs 30! Large and flabby, sorry. So go and see it, but it's no masterpiece - last point - why was Christian Bale's voice 3 octaves lower whilst wearing the Batman suit?
10.0~Absolute Masterpiece jared_alforque Sign in Permalink Now I've never been a huge Batman fan but this movie just takes the cake! Never have i seen such performances by the actors especially Heath Ledger. This guy's performance was just out of this world. In my opinion he puts the other Jokers to shame. I bow down to his performance. The others were good as well with Christian Bale and Michael Caine being as good as they were in Batman Begins. Applause as well of course to the director Christopher Nolan for being the backbone of this film. This film has to be at the top of my favourite films of all time. This film my opinion has indeed lived up to its hype. Overall Score: 100000 out of 10
1.0~Batman's War on Terror. Tachikoma-2 Sign in Permalink Ledger gives a powerful performance as the joker, but the rest of the movie was a bit out of focus. Surprisingly the movie revolves around Harvey Dent. "The White Knight" Unfortunately Eckhart was bland as Harvey Dent and his fall to the dark side was almost corny. Shame really as this was Harvey Dent's story rather than Batman's. Speaking of which, I have never seen Christian Bale act this poorly. The man is one of the greatest actors of his generation and now his performance was totally uninspired. The Batman voice is incredibly distracting and as Bruce Wayne he just sleepwalks through his scenes. I also noticed that he wasn't as buff as he was in Begins. In all honesty there wasn't much for him to do here though. The script simply doesn't give Batman much to do, other than fight and beat up people. Bruce Wayne is the billionaire Playboy and that's about it. Freeman and Cain virtually play the same character. They do it well but the cast is too bloated already so they don't get much screen time. Maggie Gyllenhaal was great. She was able to bring warmth to her portrayal of Rachel Dawes. But unfortunately we don't get to see much of her either. The philosophical themes in this movie are barely explored. Every hero turns into a villain? Or some such nonsense. Every firefighter will turn evil unless they die? Very shallow and laughable. Only Jokers nihilistic speeches were convincing. Every good hearted person either dies or gets horribly mutilated. And then turns to evil. Batman beats prisoners and brakes peoples legs. Why so violent? Then you have your boring action sequences, the mandatory car chases and numerous explosions. The Dark Knight is actually an action movie much like Die Hard. Only the nihilistic philosophy sets it apart and gives it a unique flavor. If you are a big action movie fan you'll probably enjoy this movie. The Dark Knight isn't as good as Batman Begins. Batman Begins was a character study. How a traumatized young boy became a hero and how he turned his anger and fear into something positive. Here we see the hero corrupted by Joker. He is violent and angry. No longer a hero. He is willing to lie to the people of Gotham because they couldn't handle the truth. This sends a dubious message. In fact this movie has way more propaganda than your average summer blockbuster. Invading privacy, torturing prisoners and lying to the public.... But It's cool cause it's Batman. Kids wanna be like Batman and therefore Batman is cool even while torturing prisoners. Dark Knight could be viewed as legitimizing Dick Cheney's War on terror. It's pretty disgusting. "We have to work the Dark side..."- Mr Cheney said after 911. Batman agrees.
10.0~Ledger is Without a Doubt Best 'Joker' There is... dcbargas Sign in Permalink I've seen this movie the day after it's release in theaters in the US. I have to say that it's one of the best movie ever. Though like many others would say that it's as good as Godfather. I can't really say since I've never seen that movie and probably never will. But the most thing that caught my attention the most is Heath Ledger's performance as the menacing Joker. I have to admit, Joker is one of my favorite comic book villains of all time, and Ledger nailed it. Sadly he's not here to see how big of a success this became, but I bet he would be appreciable about his accomplishment. Though I came to found out that Ledger was in two other movies that I really like ("10 Things I Hate About You" and "The Brothers Grimm"). I never knew the actor's name in both films until I realize it after seeing "The Dark Knight". Yeah, I felt stupid, but can't help it if I have bad memory sometimes. Though enough of Ledger's excellent work in this movie. There was other things in this movie that I really loved. Two-Face was awesome. Especially the actor, Aaron Eckhart, was really great for the role. It was like he was born to play as Two-Face (Same for Ledger as the Joker). I actually thought Two-Face would be a cliffhanger to the third movie. I guess not. It was a great ending for the movie to end it as Harvey the hero and Batman on the run from the law for the choice he made (I hope that made sense). Brilliant. Just pure brilliant. Commissioner Gordon, as always, is my favorite supporting character from the Batman comics. Gary Oldman was great for the role, and just because I never like the guy who portrayed Gordon from the Burton/Schumacher movies (Blah! He was a good actor but I didn't see him as James Gordon). And I actually thought Gordon was killed, but he came back and shows Joker who's boss. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, sticking true to the comics perfectly and the character was explore excellently too. And Freeman is a very talented guy and did a really great job at his role. Maggie Gyllenhaal was better then Katie Holmes. I don't care what you are all complaining about, Maggie is great for the role. Just I wish Rachel's death came unexpected (Internet sucks sometimes, that's all I can say). Sir Michael Caine from my favorite movies he starred ("Dirty Rotten Scoundrels", "Austin Powers in Goldmember", "Batman Begins", and of course "The Dark Knight") is a great talent as well. He serves us was a really good performance of Alfred (Michael Gough is still my favorite portrayal of Alfred from the original Batman series). Last but not least, the main character, our favorite Dark Knight caped crusader, BATMAN! He's also known as Christian Bale. All I have to say about what he did for this movie is...well, what can I say? He is the Batman, he was perfect with the role from start to finish. I like to say that Heath Ledger wasn't certainly playing the Joker. He IS the Joker. I know a lot of you say that, but it's the truth. So overall the characters, actors, plot, and director did a great job. Nicely done. So hopefully I will see this movie in theaters again. It was the greatest movie experience in my life as a filmmaker, and forever will be remembered. I just wish my cousin and her boyfriend wasn't there making out. Only kidding though. I wasn't anywhere near them while watching the movie. :P I rate "The Dark Knight", 10 out of 10 stars!
6.0~This film is so overrated! jimihendrix1998 Sign in Permalink This has to be one of the most overrated films I have seen. It isn't a bad film at all, it isn't overly dark like some of the Tim Burton Batman's, which was a nice surprise. But this film shouldn't have 8.9 out of 10. It's more a 6 or 7. To think that Dent could just all of a sudden turn from the cities Saviour, to being some psycho loony, for no other reason than his girlfriend being killed, is ridiculous! He stood up against everyone, and then one person he loves dies, and he loses it?? The acting in this film is good, although Christian Bale is not that good at all. Can you really tell him apart in this, as apposed to American Psycho, or even Shaft? I agree that Heath Ledger is great as the joker, but I have to think, if he hadn't died, would everyone still think he was so amazing. I really thought that the Batman Begins was a better film, and it was interesting to see how he became batman. It does seem amazing, how things become so fashionable, and people all rave about something when everyone else seems to be. This films plot is weak, and at points, like with Dent, it is just plain stupid. To be honest, this is the problem with films nowadays, all people seem to want, is great special effects, and lots of action. But what about the plot?? For me, the best decades for music were the 60's and 70's, and for films, without doubt the 80's. Sure, some films are bit dated now, but they are classics. The goonies for example, is for me, the greatest kids adventure film ever made, and one of the best adult adventure films ever made too. It had action, but it also had great acting, and a great storyline. I know the goonies has nothing to do with Batman, but it seems people are satisfied with mediocrity nowadays, with music and with films. Bands where the musicians sound like they just started playing the guitar a month ago, and films with lots of action, but no substance. And the worst part, no one seems to care? Shouldn't we being asking for more for our money?
5.0~It's not really that great of a movie Roseybaby63 Sign in Permalink I'm so relieved that I'm not the only one who doesn't think this movie is great. I saw this first in the theater, and to be honest, probably would've given it a bit higher rating...if I would've reviewed it then. But........I just watched it again on cable and it doesn't hold up as well outside of the movie theater with it's huge screen, dark room and loud speakers. First off...what I liked. Heath Leadger was fantastic as the Joker and could've done so much more with it if the writing and plot had been better. The movie should've focused on a battle of wits and balls between Batman and Joker. That would've been more interesting. I liked Morgan Freeman. I enjoy his character. I like that there wasn't some big distracting relationship for Batman/Bruce. I even enjoyed some of the explosions. I hate Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce. He just doesn't emote anything. Also...HE HAS THE WORST BATMAN VOICE EVER....EVER....EVER!!!! The movie was way too long and had way too many subplots going. I could've lived without the whole Harvey Dent thing. Why introduce Two Face just to kill him off? It made no sense. Then again, a lot of the subplots made no sense. The movie takes itself too seriously. There's really no humor either. I realize the whole idea was to make it dark, but sheesh, c'mon. There were too many just shoved in there explosions going on. It felt like two movies being rammed into one. It's just too much. Too many things going on that don't really gel together. I guess I'm tired of movies that offer more in explosions and chases than solid story telling and characters you can give a damn about. I honestly could not sit through this movie again. If I do anything, I'll watch it free on demand and fast forward to the Heath Leadger scenes. He did so much with what he was given to work with.....which wasn't any where near what it could have been. All in all...this movie doesn't live up to the hype.
1.0~Sorry, this movie sucks alexbunardzic Sign in Permalink *Disclaimer -- may contain spoilers! * Sorry, people, despite all the unbelievable hoopla, this movie is terrible. The acting is wooden, the story line is moronic, the endless one dimensional tirades about heroes and anti-heroes are totally childish and idiotic. The much praised Ledger in the role of Joker is laughable. There is nothing in his act that is worth mentioning. As a matter of fact, he was overacting big time, and it made it painful to watch his presence on the screen. The hand-to-hand fighting scenes were retarded, slow as molasses. Compare the martial art in this movie to the martial art in the Bourne trilogy -- night and day. Even "Batman and Robin" is more enjoyable to watch than this sorry excuse for an action film. Two thumbs down, way, way down...
1.0~Really Overrated grantm91 Sign in Permalink I know this is pointless since it will be in 3,000 other reviews and no one will ever read it but, whatever. Anyways, on with the review. OK, I'll admit it. When I went and first saw this movie in the theatre, I thought it was amazing. I even did what other people did and started quoting the joker all the time (and good lord did that get burnt out REAL fast.). But then I bought the movie and kind of thought to myself, you know what, I should actually try to analyze this movie as a whole and not just pay attention to one persons performance(aka Heath Ledger.). So I sat down and watched it and I realized. Holy crap this movie is bad, REALLY bad, I did not realize how many plot holes this dang thing had, and the fact that it is in IMDb's top 10 best movies of all time is just insane. Look, I'm sorry Christopher Nolan fans but, I have to give you the gods honest truth. This movie is not top 10 worthy. I think the only reason why this movie has such a high rating is because of obsessive Heath Ledger fans and the Christopher Nolan fans who can't stop sucking on his tit. They think he can do no wrong. Well that's what this movie is, wrong. I mean c'mon, you Christopher Nolan fans are telling me that you can honestly sit there and tell me this movie is better than these (and yes Dark Knight is currently ranked higher than all these movies I listed.): Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Terminator 2, The original Star Wars, American History X, The Lord of the Rings, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, The Matrix, The Silence of the Lambs, Citizen Kane and Full Metal Jacket? No, no, no, no, no, no, absolutely not. I'm sorry mister Nolan but, you're obviously really good at brainwashing your fan base. That's the only explanation I've got is that Christopher has discovered how to hypnotize people and he can do it very well. It's ratings on movies like this that really make me think about how stupid society is nowadays. I'm sorry if I sound a little aggressive in this review but, I honestly feel this movie does not deserve the HUGE spotlight that everyone gave it.
1.0~When they said 'Dark' did they mean a coal mine at night billpappas-1 Sign in Permalink I just rented this from Netflix and forced myself to watch it till the end. What a dreadful, boring yet expensive movie. It was so dimly lit, they could have had any of the thousands of out-of-work actors in Southern California in it with no perceptible difference. I guess a couple more explosions would have helped (not really). I only watched it cause of Heath Ledger's excellent performance in Brokeback Mountain. Boy, was I disappointed. I didn't care about anyone while watching except for myself who was waiting for it to end. At times the dialog was difficult to understand with the volume way up but the loud soundtrack made every sound effect rattle the furniture. I just don't get what passes for great entertainment nowadays. I had to watch some old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons afterward as an intelligent antidote to this cartoonish movie that tries for so much significance, an odd combination. It's like looking for significance and the meaning of life in an infomercial. Don't bother.
3.0~Very disappointing sequel Wayne_Mellors Sign in Permalink I really can't understand why people are gushing about this. The movie was overcomplicated, overly-long and, frankly, quite boring. The set-pieces were a mixed bag, i'll admit, ranging from the ludicrous Hong Kong escape (where the plane managed to out-fox the entire Hong Kong airforce) to be glorious (the truck trip). However, I had serious issue with the fight sequences. Almost every combat sequence (Batman Vs The Bad Guys) was overly-jumpy, with hardly any clear view of what was going on. The Scarecrow appearance was a bad joke. Two minutes of screen time and no follow-on? I was fully expecting him to turn up later. This was a criminal waste of an opportunity as The Scarecrow really has the ability to throw an extra level of chaos into a situation. Two-Face 'turned' in the last 15 minutes, when I was already glancing at the cinema ceiling wondering when it was going to end. However, I will say that this character (Harvey Dent) was the most interesting of the entire movie. Without doubt. The Joker was not the central character to the movie, as you would believe based on the hype. That honor, IMO, went to Harvey Dent. However, The Joker was played in a suitably crazy, off-the-wall, manner. Batmans throaty voice was verging on the ridiculous, especially in overly-long scenes of dialoge, as they were towards the end. In Batman Begins his voice was relatively controlled but raised and deepened when he got angry (and amplified with The Scarecrow). In this, it was a constant, irritating growl/scratchy throat noise, even when he was speaking to Rachel, who knew his real identity! How on earth they didn't catch this in pre-screenings and complain, I don't know. The plot just seemed to go around and around and around, with no discernible start, middle and end and a palpable lack of believability. How did The Joker manage to infiltrate a troop of Police without anyone noticing the massive scars on his face? How come the blades on Batmans arm-guards stuck an inch into the wood, at the start of the movie, but seemed to glance off The Jokers face at the end (leaving no scars)? How come a simple bike crash left Batman knocked clean out yet in every other scene where he takes a hammering, he's fine and can pick himself up? For a movie that claims to bring the franchise back down to earth it certainly managed to bypass many problems for the sake of the plot. The editing was also poor, with completely unconnected scenes cutting into each other in a rather obvious, jarring, manner. I noticed this within the first 10 minutes. Ultimately, I think the crux of the problem was that where Batman Begins was a focused, tight, plot consisting of a relatively small, core, set of characters, this tried to expand in all areas but didn't retain the same level of pace which left it trying to cover many more angles without the same level of detail. Any film that has me concentrating more on how my backside is aching or what the cinema ceiling looks like, proves only that its not been able to deliver enough to keep my attention focused. Where movies like Ironman and The Incredible Hulk did just that, this didn't come close.
10.0~One of the best movies ever made !! desire_911 Sign in Permalink I was not really excited about seeing this film. The last Batman Movie was good but it was hard to break with the previous versions. When I arrived at the premier I had no expectations. The other "block busters" this year have been awesome but this one tops them all. Action from start to finish and when you thought it was over and you had been in the theater for about the average time you are thrown a twist and the ride kicks into fifth gear! Great movie, great casting, great acting!!! Christian Bale and Heath Ledger represent true acting in this film. The visuals are stunning, the plot: complex but not overdone. Being an avid Batman fan, I couldn't wait to see this installment. It not only met my expectations, it blew them out of the water. Batman "The Dark Knight" is simply the best movie of 2008. Overall Score: 9.8/10
1.0~Memorably bad ffidil Sign in Permalink This is the second worst film I have ever paid to see in a cinema. (The worst was Zoolander) Where to begin? The ersatz brooding music, the inane plot, the "heavyweight philosophical dilemma" posed by the two ferries episode, the overacting, the deeply pathetic ending. There was much made in the British press about its violent content, and the (un)suitability of its certificate - after seeing it all I can say is I didn't find the violence objectionable, but emerged thinking that perhaps a new certificate is needed for the irredeemably crap. Avoid! The tragedy of this, and what personally makes me angry, is that directors like Loach and Leigh could probably have made ten films on this budget, even someone more expensive and supremely talented in the fantasy genre like Gilliam or del Torro could have made several. What a waste.
10.0~Simply Breathtaking btsmit02 Sign in Permalink I honestly don't know how anyone could possibly not love this movie, much less despise it. The director obviously took for granted that everyone who decided to view the film would have some intelligence and he wouldn't have to spend an unnecessary amount of time explaining why characters are the way they are or do the things they do. A back story is not the directors responsibility in a freaking sequel. As for the characters being prone to having very involved and seemingly impossible plans that revolve around knowledge that you think they probably don't have, I have two responses. There is a reason that the movie is even made. First of all, the people in it are not real and therefore are not subjected to limits of normal reality. There are countless things that happen in movies that probably shouldn't happen, but there are maybe even more things that happen in real life that shouldn't happen... Who made you the judge of the probabilities of fictional occurrences? Secondly, the reason that a story is being told about people is not because they are normal. The reason they are characters in a movie is because they are exceptional and are not limited to the normal standards of behavior of normal people and can sometimes do surprising things that ordinary people can't do. This tends to be the case with a great deal of movies, and is especially common in SUPERHERO MOVIES!!! The point of the entire genre is that we know this stuff can't really happen. You don't have to explain individual circumstances that can't happen and support your claims with your limitless knowledge of the laws of physics and probabilities of fictional worlds. We get it, you know everything that could ever happen and ever has happened and something happened in the movie that couldn't have happened so it's a bad movie. Brilliant!!! And if you thought the movie was too long, then you are an idiot. And I'm not arguing with you whether the movie was actually too long or not. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't... I personally could have watched it a lot longer than 2.5 hours. There is this mystical thing you can do before you go see a movie... it's called CHECK HOW LONG THE MOVIE IS. If you don't want to watch a two and a half hour movie, than don't go to a movie that lasts two and a half hours. And if you don't want to but do anyway, then don't complain about it because there is no excuse and it's your own fault. And while Maggie Gyllenhaal may not be the most attractive woman they could have cast for the role of Rachel Dawes, maybe Batman and Harvey Dent just aren't as superficial as everyone who finds the movie flawed because Batman values character over appearance. And I read a comment that complained about the Joker being too serious and violent. There is a reason the Joker is Batman's arch-nemesis. He is a psychopathic, homicidal, ruthless murderer with no morals or values whatsoever, the exact opposite of Batman in every way. To think he goes around committing "prankish" crimes and is an all around funny guy is naive and missing the point. And if I hear one more person complain about Batman's voice I am going to shoot myself. This isn't like Spiderman where he can talk to people he knows in his normal voice and people still won't figure out who he is, or worse, Superman when he just puts on some glasses. You can see half of Batman's face even with his mask on, do you not think it would help to hide his true identity if he didn't use his normal voice when speaking? I MEAN COME ON!!! Is it that hard to understand? People are really reaching for complaints about this movie. "WAHHH, ITS TOO DARK...WAHHH". Well, I believe Gotham City is kind of recognized as a dark place with a lot of crime and darkness. It kind of plays in to the overall setting and subsequently affects the quality of the film. In the 90's, the fantasy Batman films were fine. But now that I've seen this much realism with the last two Batman movies, I can't go back to the phony, almost comedic interpretations of what was meant to be somewhat serious struggles between good and evil. I can't and I won't, and what's more, I won't stand idly by while someone is complaining about the best thing to ever happen to not only Batman, but possibly the superhero genre as a whole. Do you have any idea the kind of quality movies we are going to get now, people following The Dark Knight's example, trying to compete with it, and so on? Do you realize that this movie has made over 22 million dollars, ON A TUESDAY!!! It's been out a week now, and is already in the top 50 grossing movies of ALL TIME. I mean, could it be that 99% of the world is wrong about this movie and it's actually garbage? I mean really, what's next. "I didn't see Bruce Wayne sleeping in the film. People have to sleep to live. It's not realistic...drrr" "WAHHH, its a crime fighting movie with a superhero and villains but there's fighting in it and its violent fighting...WAHHH" Oh, actually some people really do have that complaint. I personally find it laughable, as well as anyone else who doesn't give this movie at least a 9/10.
10.0~The Dark Knight delivers the film fans have been waiting for. colonel_green Sign in Permalink In 2005, Christopher Nolan relaunched Warner Brothers' dormant Batman franchise with "Batman Begins", an exceptionally well-made film that took a realistic, detailed approach to the origins of DC's biggest hero (arguably the most popular hero in the world). Now, three years later, Nolan and his star Christian Bale return to the property, and they deliver what is perhaps the greatest superhero film ever made (and a great film, besides), one that will become the model all others will look up to. The first movie ended on an optimistic note: Batman had saved the city, and had "really started something", in Gordon's words: however, one tease at the end (the Joker's playing card) hinted at the violent chaos to come in the next movie. And here, Nolan delivers on that, in the form of the late Heath Ledger, in a performance that is already becoming legendary. Gordon closed the last film with a prediction that Batman's presence would lead to escalation in the criminal community. He was right. The desperate Gotham mafia (a coalition of Slavic, African-American, and Italian gangsters) turn to the Joker to deal with Batman before he brings them all down. The Joker enacts a campaign of terror designed to smoke Batman out: the caped crusader and his chief allies, DA Harvey Dent and Police Commissioner Gordon (the first film's Commissioner Loeb is among the Joker's first victims), along with assistants Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox, must deal with this embodiment of chaos. Dent, as well, is romancing Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a superior replacement for Katie Holmes). Nolan and his screenwriters draw on several different comics sources to create their vision of Batman, the Joker, and Gotham. The most obvious among these are Alan Moore's "The Killing Joke" (perhaps the seminal Batman vs. Joker story) and Jeph Loeb's "Batman: The Long Halloween", which involved Harvey Dent and the struggle between Batman and the mob. Moore's Joker was conceived of as having no fixed origin, and Nolan follows throuhg with this: the Joker has no origin, though he offers several different versions to different people. Conversely, the film diverges noticeably from the comics in its depiction of Two-Face. There is no split personality in evidence, nor any of the psychological problems that said personality springs from. Two-Face has more or less been cut down to his gimmick, and then a new rationale for the gimmick constructed to suit the themes of the film. Eckhart is very compelling as this version, which also sports some effectively grisly makeup/effects. "Batman Begins" was notable for being the first Batman film to really be about Batman, instead of being a showcase for various freakshow villains; this is dialled back a bit in this film, where the villains take more of a centre-stage. Batman still has a significant character arc, but the story is less about him; notice that the buzz surrounding the movie centres on Ledger, not Bale. That Batman is less of a focus is not a bad thing in and of itself, so long as the villains are well-done, which they are. Caine, Freeman, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal are all effective supporting cast. One of the most notable things about this film is its ability to make the audience doubt the outcome, bringing the storytelling styles that have flourished in the comics industry for at least twenty years to the big screen at last; Spider-Man succeeded in 2002 where he failed in the comics in 1973, but now the audience is never sure whether Batman's allies will reliably make it out alive. It's a jolt that one hopes will allow future comics adaptations to reach the greater diversity of outcomes that the comics currently enjoy. A bravura effort from all involved.
6.0~8.9/10? Come on! canerbey Sign in Permalink Well actually when I decided to watch it, my expectations of it were really really high because everyone around me had built it up so much. This is a movie of which sub-plots are all over the place with some wishful thinking of the director or the screenwriter. Joker is much too powerful. He's got many, many, many connections that he can even rig hospitals, blow up bridges, even manage truck drivers. If this is a superhero movie, where the hell is our superhero? Superman Returns was junk, too but at least it had a really blasting superhero movie opening. Where is Batman? C. Bale is a brilliant choice for Batman but there is not enough Batman but too much Joker.
1.0~An Overrated Film PhantomMayHare Sign in Permalink Sorry. It's just an overrated film. I have heard many people telling me to go see this "amazing" film. It has to much pyrotechnics in it. I just don't care for it. It really is overrated. If you like explosions and good vs. evil movies then go see it. The role of women in the film was just sad. Mostly shown as toys. Just didn't like it. Christopher Nolan did wonders with Interstellar, but, in my opinion, this film just doesn't cut it. I guess it something people will like more if they are into superheros. I don't like how they showed the female characters either. I just don't like it. Hopefully, Christopher Nolan will release more masterpieces like Interstellar.
2.0~First 15 minutes was stupid. Didn't watch the rest robert237 Sign in Permalink Started to watch on flight to Asia. After 15 minutes went back to listening to music. Just a bunch of cartoon characters in tons of makeup shooting each other. Why did the movie open with two guys sliding down a tight rope stretched from one high rise to another. If they could have rigged the tight rope in the first place why did they need the tight rope to get to their destination? How did the get-away school bus get inside the bank in the first place? Does a procession of school buses always go by that bank at the same time everyday? And what's with all the amazement of Heath Ledger's acting? With all makeup and gee whiz camera angles anyone who liked this movie would be amazed at anyone who played the Joker. At least I didn't have to pay to find out what a disappointment this was.
10.0~A comic book movie turned into a detective crime masterpiece edzelr Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is one of those comic book based films that has raised the bar. Though the movie is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, the film has become a detective action drama in the vein of The Untouchables where our Dark Knight (Christian Bale) is the Eliot Ness and The Joker (Heath Ledger) is the Al Capone. In the course of the film Harvey Dent is represented to be the one who would replace Batman in the crusade of cleaning Gotham City with the intent of retiring to pursue his normal life but things go wrong when the Joker has become a major threat. Joker really is a worthy adversary to the Batman, he pounds him psychologically and tactically especially to Harvey Dent. I liked the way Aaron Eckhart portrayed Harvey Dent, he was played not as a villain but a victim of circumstances it makes his character more human. As for the Joker, he's really scary most of the time but provided some little laughs. It's too bad that Heath Ledger passed away I hope he'd get an Oscar nomination for this, he's really good. Eckhart, Ledger and even Gary Oldman are the stars of the film, Batman became more of the supporting actor in the film process and it works.
3.0~This movie not for kids robj1-1 Sign in Permalink This movie is NOT for kids. Don't even think about taking your 10 year old to see it. Batman is a cartoon, but this movie is anything but funny. It is intensely dark, and scenes of violence occur from start to finish. More than that, main characters are twisted, in the serial killer sense. The hero characters are also driven by dark motives. This movie is likely to be a source of bad dreams for children. My wife and I stayed to the end, but we left feeling depressed by the whole experience. We enjoyed the last movie, Batman Begins, but we will be much more reticent to see any more in this series. If you must see it, don't take the kids. Seriously, I think the MPAA should have given this movie an R rating.
1.0~The jokes on us fougasseu Sign in Permalink I may run out of words to end with "less". Mindless, witless, a view of the world that's hopeless. Horrible acting, writing, editing, lighting and music. I've seen it all before only done better. Nicholson's turn at Joker was far, far superior. Ledger? Mirthless, just a distracting concoction of tics. Bale? Who knows? His augmented voice and masked face made his 2-dimensional performance meaningless. Dent? What a horrible performance, something you'd see on "Knot's Landing". Where have we come as a society? Kubrick made "A Clockwork Orange" in '71, a devilishly clever, mean and stylish film that pushed the limits when it came to on-screen violence. His young monster, Alex, played by the brilliant Malcolm MacDowell, was a thing to behold. Now we have families taking their kids to the '08 version of ultraviolence and yukking it up. The dark night of America film-making is more like it. Are we really this numb, are we really this nihilistic?
10.0~Legendary Movie sultanalodah Sign in Permalink It is within the list of the best movies I have because of what I saw, as the writer excelled in the writing of this story, in addition to shine representatives who carried out this great work, we saw the Joker in the film, where he was a major reason for the success of the film with Christian Bale, which embodies the personal nicely very. Christian Bale is always creative in other films, but this is work, especially in the Dark knight 2008 is the most prominent and successful Alomes him. I liked this movie a lot and I liked the characters in this beautiful film and I hope that the dark knight of the series do not stop and continue on like this, which is a little like I've seen it in other works Thank Christian Bale Thanks for the director and his staff with representatives
10.0~It's Difficult NOT To Enjoy This Movie zack-51232 Sign in Permalink From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen.
1.0~Can't believe this is still top 10 wynegret99 Sign in Permalink People who know and study FILM will all have the same basic review of this MOVIE. It's overacted (and yes, Heath Ledger is included in that remark) and just an overall horrible script. The whole "why so serious" bit was again, overacted, and SO predictable. I wrote better dialogue when I was a toddler. Then comes the completely unfathomable events - Nolan wanted the movie to be realistic but he clearly is a moron for that statement because only pre-teens and people pretending to go along with the hype would believe the whole cell phone bomb inside a guy's stomach. And a gun in court? COME ONE STOP INSULTING ME! The fact that this movie is ANYWHERE in the top 250 proves that people are generally stupid.
8.0~Excellent Sequel to Batman Begins SeussMeTub Sign in Permalink One thing's for sure: comic book based movies are here to stay. Once before they were B-movie, red headed stepchildren with very miniscule budgets and low grade actors, now these films regularly attract A-list talent both in front and behind the camera. The latest in this summer comic book slate is THE DARK KNIGHT, the sequel to the well received and awesomely successful Batman reboot BATMAN BEGINS and continues right where it left off. Where the first movie dealt with the origins of how and why Batman came to be, this sequel now moves onto a larger canvas: the storyline now revolves around the consequences of Batman's appearance in a city gripped by crime and hopelessness. With the demise of former mob boss Carmine Falcone's power in Gotham City, the various crime syndicates are now leaderless and trying to reconsolidate as Batman (Christian Bale) AKA billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne continues his relentless assault to restore order. In the first film director Chris Nolan portrayed Gotham as a sort of cross between the slums of Hong Kong and Chicago of the Al Capone era with lots of rain and gloom, now Gotham is depicted as being very similar to New York, with many massive high rises and somewhat sunnier skies, it seems Gotham is literally coming back to life. But even with new fearless district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart in his best role to date), it seems the city is just a few steps ahead of the rising tide of criminality that is beginning to strike back against its newfound heroes and it manifests itself into a new and powerful adversary called the Joker (Heath Ledger in his final film role). I have always found that the main differences between the main comic book makers Marvel and DC is in the portrayal of their heroes- whereas Marvel superheroes tend to be average guys and gals who are thrust with superpowers and lots of responsibility, DC superheroes tend to be iconic representations of the human condition: Superman is a depiction of the ideals and greatness of mankind while Batman represents vigilantism and revenge. As the plot of the movie unfolds, the forces of law and order, represented by Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman once again reprises his role and it has been expanded considerably) and Harvey Dent, battle it out on the streets of Gotham city against the forces of criminality with mob bosses Eric Roberts and Michael Jai White (yes, the SPAWN guy is here too) allied with chaos and anarchy which is represented by the Joker with Batman the vigilante smack dab in the middle of it all. Despite Batman being on the side of order, his very methods create a copycat gang of vigilantes who style themselves after him which puts the city even closer to the brink. As all the swirling plot lines culminate into one big showdown, Batman must make his choices carefully as every action he takes creates unintended and sometimes tragic consequences. The last great movie I saw since last year was NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN but I can say that THE DARK KNIGHT finally gives me a satisfaction that I had been missing for over a year now. The acting is superb with many old faces returning- Morgan Freeman is homely as Lucius Fox while Oldman has a larger role and consequently gets to shine even further. Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes is an infinitely better actress than her predecessor (though I thought Katie Holmes looked sexier even though she had zero talent) but her role is somewhat subdued and we never got more into her character. Christian Bale is adequate for the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne though he doesn't seem to put in anything new to the character (I still think Micheal Keaton was the best movie Batman). The big question is obviously on Heath Ledger and he delivers a deliciously wicked and sadistic Joker- very similar to Jack Nicholson's take on the character and that's a compliment; my only peeve is that he wasn't given a permanent smile like the previous Jokers in the movie and comic book- slightly different take but still very, very entertaining and fits in well with Nolan's more realistic version of the venerable Bat franchise. It is sad that Ledger will never be able to reprise his role and his makeup seems so similar to that of the equally late Brandon Lee in THE CROW that the parallels are eerie. Unlike the past incarnations of the movie and cartoon Jokers, Ledgers performance has transformed the Joker from a villain with a smile on his face into anarchy incarnate- he is no longer just a bad guy but a force of nature. The big surprise here is Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent- he steals every scene he is in and watching his fall from grace is like seeing that of an epic Shakespearean tragedy. Terrific action sequences and nail biting suspense adds to an epic sequel: 8 out of 10.
10.0~A movie doesn't have to be perfect to completely amaze you! user-28221 Sign in Permalink I really hate those censorious critics. When everyone is saying The Dark Knight is truly one of the top five movies in the whole history and the movie itself is becoming really popular, someone laughs coldly and says things like "this is the most overrated movie ever made". And if you go deeper to their ideas, you find all they have done is pick up the small detailed flaws of the movie, which is completely not affecting the whole quality and worthiness of seeing more than twice of the movie. Hey boy, WHY SO SERIOUS? I wonder if those people work in a watch factory, in which you are never allowed to make a single tiny mistake because if you do, you will ruin the whole work. Movie is art, and art is never perfect. Its imperfection is the very thing that makes it amazing. The Dark Knight is not perfect, or in other word, can anyone name a literally perfect movie? Is Godfather perfect, or The Shawshank Redemption? But they are indeed amazing aren't they? I really think The Dark Knight should be even longer, maybe three hours will do. This is a so complex multi-layer script, for many directors it's too hard to tell the story and make it clear to the audience. The Nolans made it, although not 100 percent, but they did make it understood plus shining plus intriguing! If the movie were long enough, the story-telling would be even more clear and very importantly, not that tied up, which is the biggest shortage of The Dark Knight. Then it's time to talk about why it is so amazing. I hate to say everything in the movie is great because that's over-simplifying and showing no respect for the standing out. THE JOKER, it's him who makes the movie different. It's not only about Heath's acting,(actually I have no idea how to describe how great his acting is, it simply defies description) it's about the role. Many marvel that this joker is the NO1 villain of the history, indeed he is, why? Because he never deserves anyone's mercy, in other words, he is, in absolute terms, bad, bad enough to go way beyond the punishment people make to measure the fierceness of bad. He is a villain that will stay longer in your heart and control your thoughts than your best hero image can do. A hero is an example; a villain like the joker is an obsession. So I suggest you not fall too deep in love with The Dark Knight and the joker, although I already have.
3.0~Such Rubbish.... werefox08 Sign in Permalink The tragedy about most movies in the last 20 years is that the scripts and acting mean nothing. It is all about CGI....and that is SO sad. This crap is just another example. If you like "Super-heroes" you may enjoy this. I dislike Super-heroes (perhaps ..because I have a brain) However--lots of people LOVE this kind of trash..Heath Ledger won an Oscar for his ridiculous performance...He was actually an above average actor, but this whole pile of nonsense was just...very bad. Batman or Superman ? Both are better in the magazines...The young folks who spend half their lives looking at their Smart-Phones (trying to work out how to use them !!) Will love a movie where you don't need to use your brain.
10.0~Seeing the Light in a Dark Knight bradmode Sign in Permalink One of the great things about superhero movies has always been that you don't have to think to much about them. You get the basic back story and go with the flow. This movie wasn't like that. You actually had to think when you were watching this movie and I couldn't have been more pleased. You can say what you want about it being "smart" or hard to follow, but its nice to have a movie like this every once and a while. I agree with some of the critics about the action scenes being chaotic and hard to follow. Nolan didn't improve on that much from the first one, but there was plenty of action. I think Robert Downey Jr.'s biggest problem with the movie is not that he couldn't understand it, but that it has made almost $200 million more than his movie "IRONMAN". That probably sticks in his crawl a little or maybe he's back off the wagon, in any case you lose, TRAMP ("Chaplin" reference). Why so serious? Everyone talks about how great Heath was but I thought that Aaron Eckhart was just as good and Christian Bale was good too, but he has to do something about his Batman voice. In closing, the movie is definitely worth the price of admission and I would say that you might need to see it twice to get a good grasp on it.
6.0~QUITE good randomperson446 Sign in Permalink First of all, this movie has a pretty good cast. It's a shame that Freeman and Oldman have such small roles because Christian Bale as Batman would be as forgettable as the usher if his voice wasn't so stupid. The joker was indeed played excellently by Ledger which saves this film from absolute mediocrity, but I can't understand why the performance could deserve an Oscar. He just plays a crazy guy well. His character lacks any other emotions or motivations. The effects and gadgets are very impressive, if not a bit ridiculous at times, but it's a comic book movie and I wasn't hoping for realism. The plot is a bit messy and dragged out but overall quite good. I felt like two face was created rather inexplicably and was killed off too soon. Ranked the best movie EVER at present?! Not by a long shot. I didn't leave the cinema feeling moved, thoughtful or blown away. It was just a decent action film.
10.0~One of the Best Superhero movies EVER!!!!!!! baltazar07 Sign in Permalink I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film.
4.0~And the Oscar for Overrated Movie of the Year goes to... earl_sibley Sign in Permalink Dark Knight. If anything good came of this, the movie prompted me to get off my keester and sign up at IMDb, if only at the outrage (OK, maybe disbelief) that this movie is rated 9.1 and currently the 3rd highest ranked movie in IMDb history. Long time reader and user but non-contributor here, now needing to get this off my chest. Even if you go into this movie with the low expectations that need to go with comic book movies, this one stretches far fetched to new limits. The acting, aside from the performance offered by Ledger, was given a terrible screenplay and it showed, and at time makes you want to look away. Bale is horrible as Batman, a hoarse menacing voice accompanied by an overacting mouth, made we wish for Michael Keaton again. I could go on, but I won't. To say that this movie is better than Schindler's List, La Dolce Vita, It's a Wonderful Life, and about 100 other movies that are great to OK, makes me lose just a little faith in our internet institutions.
10.0~A perfect film pinkliz41 Sign in Permalink Films like these don't come along very often. Perfect acting, directing, music, characters, story, cinematography and so on. To me The Dark Knight is one of those examples that will be remembered for a very long time to come. Everything that has been said about how wonderful this film is is true. The action is massive and beyond epic. But in-between the high flying punches and explosions its the acting that sums up this mastery. All the actors prove their worth as masters of their profession. Christian Bale has characterised the greatest Batman ever. His portrayal as Batman is brilliant and we finally witness this characters struggles, ambitions and morales all onto screen for the first time. Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is so chilling and monumental, menacing and pure that no other actor could had pulled that off. His presence on screen lights up and your left with, what i consider to be the greatest performance by any actor. To conclude, The Dark Knight is a perfect film. Perfect in a sense that i think has never been seen before and that wont ever be seen again. R.I.P Heath Ledger
5.0~Very poor movie. Just mad senseless action agutxisol Sign in Permalink I have read so good comments for this movie so far... and I have to say I'm surprised. When I went to the cinema I was hoping for a great action movie, as the first part seemed to me, but I have to say I found the movie very boring and was wishing for it to finish long before the end. The acting was quite poor for me and the characters' reactions and wishes didn't make much sense to me. Moreover, the action scenes where very confusing and messy and didn't flow with the plot, they where just forced in for the sake of some action. So many things didn't need (or so the director thought) further explanation/justification and broke the logic/reality/former plot with no sense. All in all, for me a disappointing movie from every point of view.
2.0~Overrated carrotwax Sign in Permalink Yes, the special effects were amazing. In some ways it's the modern day's Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The plot was predictable,boring, and extremely long. I saw it in theatres and had to force myself to stay to the end. Yes, Heath Ledger was good. A playful psycho. But the film itself is something I'd have to be tied down to see again. So much of the accolades this film had seems based on Heath Ledger's death. It would be interesting to know how the reviews would be if not for that tragedy. I suspect the next generation would look back on this film and say "boring".
6.0~And the Oscar goes to ?!?!? liamzdaman2 Sign in Permalink I come never to expect much from comic movies or superhero movies or superhero comic movies or whatever they are called ? However this was a superbly entertaining, brilliantly acted film. However it must be said that the story lacked a little, nothing much seemed to happen it was mostly just the joker killing people and threatening to do so. The story has the same theme as most batman movie in my opinion which is why this movie cannot be labelled a classic and also why the hype has blown this one out of proportion. In my opinion BATMAN is the best batman film ever as it had a sense of comic book about it and was not to serious. I am not sure if a movie about a grown man dressed in a bat suit should be made the way BEGINS and THE DARK KNIGHT were made, but then again they had to do something after the car crash that was BATMAN AND ROBIN. Now on to why exactly it has become such a big movie and as i write this is sitting at no 3 on the IMDb's top 250, having been no 1 for some time before that. For me it is because of MR Heath Ledger. He is simply outstanding in this film and with out him it is unlikely the same amount of success would have followed. I do however believe there is a certain factor of his death that is lifting this movie to heights it would never have reached but that does not change how good he is in this film. The dark knight just simply is not as good as many people are saying it is in my opinion and i think the 10 out of 10 button is used before thinking these days as I personally would never give a film 10 unless it blew me away and I'm sure many people give ten's out a lot. 7 out of 10
7.0~Did you people see the same film I saw? lordfrazer Sign in Permalink Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be. You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time..... This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?
10.0~Three hours later and I am still in Awe!!!! patrick-corrado Sign in Permalink If there ever was a perfect movie, this wasn't it - there are some scenes that are just a bit too cheesy and one actors who performance is a bit too much dizzy schoolgirl, and there is something about it that makes it clash somewhat with the first movie...however there never was a perfect movie but this was the closest I have seen...it is a masterpiece of fear and depression - an opera of violence, yet very few drops of blood, a tale of flawed heroes and pure evil - and Two seconds of hope and faith in humanity that make it grand. I can't believe the best movie I have ever seen, has been a "comic book movie" that's not even accurate anymore - the story has evolved to what Batman, the master detective, has always been - a Mob Drama. At it's core is Ledger's Joker - a brilliant performance. When actors want to play a psychopath - this is who they want to play. Hell, real psychopaths wish they were this cold, this insane, this evil. I cannot get his performance out of my head - it was simply brilliant - give him the Oscar. Although, a villain is only as good as his hero, and this movie has two...Bale's Batman is dark and insane is Wayne is pompous and suave and seems effortlessly to be what "The Dark Night" would translate to in reality. Eckhart's Harvey Dent is pure plot device...white knight to vengeful killer...but wonderfully executed. The rest of the cast is wonderful as...with the exception of the Dawes character (not bad just the weakest in the film) The story, the plot, its a grand tale of a murderous terrorist holding a city hostage and it incredible...I said Oscar earlier fr ledger, I think Oscar for the Dark Knight as well - we need to reward cinema this great!
8.0~just another batman comment bixhu2004 Sign in Permalink I've seen many people consider this the best movie ever made, and others the best superhero movie ever. Apparently, i don't think it belongs on that category, as it is not in any way a superhero movie. it does not have cool weaponry like that in iron man, or awesome action sequence like the train fight in spider-2. It possess something greater, the deep emotions of its characters. But not all of them, as i don't think batman himself has such impact we've seen in joker's character and the way heath ledger acts (he's my favorite actor though). I think it unforgivably lacks that part. Everybodys talking and criticize the movie only through its joker, so wheres the main character lies really? Is this really a story about the dark knight or super villain Harvey Dent (i think he acts really well) and the joker? I do think its a very good psychology/drama movie though.
10.0~Great Batman Movie frapper_l-artiste Sign in Permalink First of all, I'm not a big fan of Batman, I like comics and all of that but I prefer Marvel, in any case I went to see this movie, the only thing that made me go was my anxiety to see Heath Ledger performance, but when I saw it, it left me speechless, not only the acting but the sequence and action is great. I've already seen this movie 3 times, and I'm still not bored of it. Well I have to agree with some people in something.. and it's about Two-Face, I mean, Eckhart did a great job playing Dent and Two-Face, but it wasn't really necessary having him in this movie, maybe in the next Batman, but not in this one. Other than that it's really a masterpiece, worth watching, and it will be worth buying. I loved Bale's acting, when I watch the first one I liked his acting, but now I'm sure he is Batman. Now Ledger, how can I not talk about his performance if that was the main reason I watch it?, his performance was scary and great, he really portrait THE Joker, and if he wins an Oscar it won't be because of some sentimental thing because of his death, it'll be because of his great acting. I don't really have much to say, I'm still speechless, but If you haven't seen it yet, you should watch it. (oh and for those who says that this is just another hero movie, another superhero movie, well for your information BATMAN is a HERO, it can't be an animal movie or a documentary, so call down, don't like it.. that's fine but think better.)
8.0~Very Well done; does not replace Nicholson papastrony Sign in Permalink Easy hype-machine due to Ledger's passing; this film is not better overall than the original Batman starring Keaton and Nicholson who both will forever be the perfect Batman and Joker character portrayals. Ledger and Bale are great and this film entertains every step of the way. However; Ledger comes off sounding a bit weak with his high pitched-squeaky voice and he certainly isn't as darkly humorous as Jack was. He doesn't even have memorable lines-recall "This town needs an enema/Stop the press; who is that/Where does he get those wonderful toys?" Sorry young kids, this film is not the #1 rated movie of all time and isn't even close. Superior to Batman Begins for sure but Ironman is 2008's stronger film.
10.0~The Dark Knight, the new mile stone of the super hero movies badappleathens Sign in Permalink The new milestone for the future super-hero movies are set. It's a brand new standard now. The whole movie made you hanging there. I couldn't take my eyes away when Jokers on, what will he do the next, you never know, he says things sound so random, and doesn't make sense, yet it make very sense. The acting of this film is top notch. No question about it, and I loved every minute of it. The only thing I would like to see is a little more of the inside struggling of the Dark Knight. The movie's soul was stolen when Joker shows up, he just grab your attention, every single movement, every single word.
4.0~Nothing really new, but still a solid comic movie Oliver_Rizmanoski Sign in Permalink I have to admit that I am writing this comment, just because of pure amazement. I am baffled, I am sorry. But the reason for the superb ratings, this Batman movie has received, is beyond my imagination. In my opinion it is a good comic movie, not a great one and definitely not a masterpiece. The acting is almost non-existing. That does not mean that the actors are bad. It just means that there was no space for acting. Christian Bale does his best, but his performance as an actor is just a faint shadow of what he can actually perform. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are simply wasted. Heath Ledger is offered more freedom when it comes to acting. He does the Joker in a nice way, crazy at times, funny at times and sometimes he looks like a guy who protests against the WTO. He is good, but does he surpass Jack Nicholson? Definitely not, and the same applies if you compare this batman edition with the first Burton Batman. There are still too many flaws and weak points in the movie. The list would easily crack the word limit. Nonetheless it is still a good, sporadically a very good comic movie. So if you are a die hard-comic fan, then you will probably like it. If you think that comic movies are the masterclass of movie making, then you can call this movie a masterpiece. From my point of view, if anybody asks me which good movie I have seen recently, then I can easily name two or three better films, that I have watched during the last month. And even those are far away from being called great.
10.0~"I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you stranger" raphael88 Sign in Permalink Heath Ledger was the man. His death is a big loss for the cinema. His performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight is just unbelievable and unforgettable. The first word I can think of is "powerful". Powerful as the whole movie, which is a real masterpiece. I thought Batman Begins was excellent and now I have a problem because I can't find a word to define correctly its sequel. When you have a bunch of such great actors (Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Christian Bale) to serve such a fantastic plot, it has to be really good ! Oh, and Mr Nolan, if you want to do a third Batman movie, don't hesitate ! One piece of criticism, though: why did you replace Katie Holmes by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes ? There are so many beautiful actresses in Hollywood I could write more but it's nearly impossible to describe these 152 minutes of ecstasy without destroying their magic. So watch this awesome movie !
10.0~Great Heath Ledger steals the show... kite111 Sign in Permalink The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree. All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger. 10/10 rating...well done
8.0~Nolan, Bale, Ledger, Eckhart, all hit it out of the park Quinoa1984 Sign in Permalink I wasn't sure what to expect from The Dark Knight a sequel to Batman Begins and, by virtue of extended franchise, a remake of the Tim Burton 1989 Batman movie, which also featured Batman, the Joker, and Harvey Dent (though not Two-Face). The previews had all the action and excitement, and some cool-looking gadgets, but... despite the whole "Heath Ledger is dead, this is final great performance" hype, I didn't want to second guess myself. A Joker with no real "origin" story? Ledger playing him with slapped on, sloppy make-up and lots of facial tics? How will this work, and how could it be any better than Nicholson's Joker? Answers? It does work, very well, though it's dependent on the universe that director Christopher Nolan has set in place. Ledger's Joker wouldn't work in Burton's style, as his mix of camp and seriousness was perfect for an actor like Nicholson. But in Nolan's world, he fits in like a f***ing psychotic glove. To get it out of the way for this review, I'll say this: Ledger practically lives up to the hype. His presence is uncouth and strange, and not like one's used to (the slashes through his face are "jokingly" referenced that "my dad did this, "my wife did this"), and he's totally ambiguous. But it's also the unpredictable Joker seen yet on screen, and only topped probably in the craziest of the comics. He's an unpredictable force that is the twisted ying to Batman's protect-by-all-means-but-murder yang. It's basically an anarchic punk rocker taken to the lengths of a terrorist. While this should make the Joker boring, there's nothing that Nolan isn't willing to do to make the audience jump or second guess the plot, which makes it extra exciting as he heads on in the last half hour, leading to an incredible double-catharsis of sorts. But if Ledger's performance is being touted for an posthumous Oscar nomination (which I'm still not sure about though will probably happen), then the amount of attention being paid to Aaron Eckhardt is minuscule in comparison. On his own terms, Eckhart delivers a performance that's even better than Ledger's (or, rather, he has a lot more complexity than "I'm gonna blow stuff up and go chaotic here"). He puts in everything that's needed for the perfect Harvey Dent, as a man who's the "white knight", someone who could be the one to take the place of Batman as the one to look after Gotham. His downfall, however, becomes the great, horrifying tragedy of this Batman. To say Eckhart blows all other interpretations (on film or TV) of Dent is putting it lightly, and the make-up given to his latter reincarnation is some of the best I've ever seen. In the interest of not coming off like a total crazy fan-boy for the Dark Knight, there are some likely criticisms to have. Despite Nolan's vision being epic and grand, and for the most part pulling off such a big story very well, the last section, however exciting and tense and posing moral questions, goes a little long. And, however staying true to the comics (which is great), the last section starts to pile on the exposition a bit much. But these are mostly mild quibbles. In the scope of delving into the Batman world as honestly (if not realistically) as possible, Nolan succeeds even further than in 'Begins'. The characters of Batman/Wayne, Gordon, Dent, and Rachel Dawson are all put into incredible circumstances throughout the film, and we're pulling for them and care about what happens all the way. It's all the more a credit to the storytelling power since we should know how things will turn out; a certain twist mid-way through had me thinking "say it isn't so", and when I knew I was had, I knew Nolan had done his job well. Another question: does Dark Knight live up to the hype? It depends on how you define it and how it pertains to the movie. A lot of the hype has been around Ledger's death, and the new characters, and some of the hype (i.e. box-office predictions) have become ludicrous. Yet, for what Nolan set out to do as filmmaker, delivering drama and action and pathos and a kick-ass-but-truly-conflicted Batman in his *very* dark city of Gotham, he succeeded admirably. It might not be the same amount of pure "fun" of Burton's films, but then again it doesn't need to be. It's an excellent, breathtaking experience, and one of the best pics of 08.
8.0~The Dark Night...good, not great johnsonryanm Sign in Permalink One of the things I love about IMDb is the honest and frank nature of the reviews; however, I just cannot sit back and allow The Dark Night to be the highest ranked film of all time on this bastion of neutrality and reliability. The Dark Night has eclipsed the all time great films; the greats on this site that were ranked by true die hard film fanatics. Now, we have every Tom, Dick and Harry (or Thelma, Debbie and Hennrietta) judging films. Sadly, they are probably no older than your average teenage porn flick. This is not to say they are not intelligent or tasteful, quite the contrary. I am sure most of the quarter million voters for The Dark Night are great folks; however, I suspect most just plug in a '10' because they enjoyed the film. I mean seriously, look at WALL-E, can you look me in the face and honestly tell me that not only is it one of the top ten films of all time, but also better than Toy Story, or even possibly the best follow-up movie--besides Godfather II--Toy Story II. I hope not. For all true film fanatics I know this is not the case. So, I think, with The Dark Knight, we have witnessed the end of a truly great and wonderful era, when IMDb was a true, real and honest reflection of the best and worst in film. Now, sadly, it has become a McDonaldized landscape of McBig films that do not deserve anything better than being a meal for for a massive hang over. All of this is not to say The Dark Night was not a good film; however, let us all be honest with ourselves. It lingered, it moved chaotically through its narrative and worst, it was stable, level in its cinematic impact. The best films yank and pull you through. Twist and gouge, make you run the gauntlet of emotions...The Dark Night did not do this. So, again, lets be honest with ourselves. Is this film really on the same par as The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather, The Departed, The Return of the King, Gladiator, Braveheart or a handful of other films that ripped and shredded us throughout the film going experience? Did you really feel that you were 'moved' by this film? Do you really think it deserves the highest honour on this site? Or do you think, perhaps, we are seeing a gross over-rating? In the end, it is the film lover, the cinematic junkie, who will decide the epic nature of this film. Sadly, though I wished it would have fulfilled its promise, The Dark Night is not an epic film, just a very good one.
10.0~Not only the best ever comic book adaption but also the greatest film ever juarez-8 Sign in Permalink Most of the time people give a 10 to films they enjoyed but not me. I save my tens to films that deserve it and this really does. There's not much that I can say that hasn't already been said but this truly is the best film ever and it pains me that the Oscars are likely to leave it out of the major categories because its based on a comic book. You will not see a film that has a greater emotional depth as this and I mean it. We see characters that develop throughout the film which really lets you realise that Christopher Nolan has spent a lot of time on this. And for those who criticized the action sequences in Batman Begins can be reasurred that the action sequences will blow you away here. I'm not going to spoil anything about this film because I don't want to ruin it to anyone but there are so many things that I can point out about this film that left me amazed by the end of it. The acting was the best I have ever seen (It makes Return of the King appear shallow), Heath Ledger was of course amazing but the rest of the cast are too good to be left out. Christian Bale continues to shine as a great actor who will soon get noticed by the academy sooner or later. Michael Caine is perfect as ever adding a bit of British charm to the film. Morgan Freeman has a larger role this time as does a great job. Aaron Eckart is perfectly cast as DA Harvey Dent. Maggie Gyllen(However you spell it) improves greatly over Katie Holmes' Rachel Dawes but the real star has to be Gary Oldman, like everyonelse is overshadowed by Heath Ledger, does a great job bringing more emotion and power to the film but I can't tell you why as that would be telling. Another thing that makes this film so perfect is that it feels so realistic. Thanks to Nolan's choice for using CGI when only necessary everything seems so real. All the other criminals respond to the Joker realistically thinking that he is crazy and not to be trusted. This makes the whole film so much more interesting and adds to the film's incredible depth. My Oscar predictions and why- Best Picture- Its original, has a fresh feel to it, characters that develop, great acting, perfect storytelling, the list continues... Best Director- Nolan has achieved in reinventing a genre and has saved the Batman franchise. Screenplay- No bad dialogue. It is in some ways a film about redemption with a Christian teaching about helping others and not receiving any credit for it. Its perfect. Original Score- Makes your spine tingle because of how epic it is. Supproting actor- Heath Ledger. No surprise there. He's great. Cinematography- Beautifully shot. Editing- I'll let the action sequences fill this one in. Make up- Take one look at the Joker. Sound- Right from the start you are blown away. Listen to that shotgun at the start and you will know why. Sound editing- (See editing) Visual effects- There are only two things in this film that are CGI. One involves a helicopter and the other I'm not going to say at the risk of spoiling it. If the Oscars don't even nominate the film for any of these then its an insult to the amazing actor Heath Ledger (RIP) and the Oscars are officially broken (Example- How did the Golden Compass beat Transformersin Visual effects) Miss this film at your peril. Its an incredible masterpiece and an instant classic. What else can I say? Its perfect.
9.0~Not for kids! badman-4 Sign in Permalink Saw it at a preview last night and thus did not have the benefit of reviews beforehand. Although I let most of my kids watch "Batman Begins", I won't let anyone but the teenagers see this one. I thought the movie was exceptional, but the menace of The Joker is too intense for kids younger than that. I'm not suggesting they'll be scarred for life, but don't let the action figures and kids' meals fool you - this movie feels real and it's one of the darkest I've seen in a long time. If you've read the Batman graphic novels of the modern era then you know what to expect, but people unfamiliar with how low Batman can go may be in for a shock (my wife was one!). Heath Ledger for Best Actor!
3.0~Plot holes and a very poor joker al-464 Sign in Permalink I watched the first of the trilogy yesterday, Batman Begins and thought it was a great film. So i watched this today and felt compelled to write a review. I have never reviewed any film before. My problem is with the Joker and instead of the one or two quick lines we are used to from the joker in previous films and the series, we are treat with a freezing of time while the joker bores us with a minute plus of not very well delivered boredom and the other character in the scene keep silent and listens. This happens all the way through the movie and ruins it. I had heard people rave about heath ledgers performance but they must be young uns who didn't grow up with the American series and then jack Nicholson's excellent portrayal. It was basically a toned down bad copy of jn. Now i know its fantasy and we have to stretch our imagination but there was a point in the film where i nearly turned it off as it simply was beyond belief. Dents loved one has been killed by the joker and he has a gun pointing at him and doesn't kill him. WTF? Heath ledgers dialogue probably bored him into a coma or sent him to sleep. But there is no way if you loved someone and had their killer at your mercy and you had already shown in the film that you were prepared to take a life that you wouldn't have killed him. Sorry i could not get over that. Especially after that point Dent then kills people who were peripheral to Rachels death!!! How the film gets 9/10 on here i haven't a clue. Come on people how can you paper over a massive plot hole like that?
3.0~A convoluted slow ride to Paris! rrandlaw Sign in Permalink It is difficult to write a bad review of a Batman movie. The franchise, started for most of us in childhood, grew to reach major movie studio treatment. That being said, the Dark Night Rises is a laughable attempt at completing the Batman story. At a very long 2 hour and 45 minutes, I eventually felt I was being held against my will. In fact, by the end, I was hoping that Metropolis would once and for all be destroyed. As luck would have it, that did not come to pass. The movie was filled with plot holes, a ridiculous villain and contrived drama. As the clock on the bomb counted down from the overused 5 seconds, a silent cheer could be heard in the audience watching with me as the end neared. The plot line, hard to call it that as it is more of a plot meander, like a slow moving stream that carves its way snaking along the unremarkable flatness of the mid-west, covers far too much territory far too glibly. The only character that was actually fun to watch was that of Anne Hathaway, and not for the most obvious of reasons. Her snide and cynical portrayal seems just right for this abomination of a film. I lack the ambition to finish this review as it makes me relive nearly three hours when I was held prisoner by The Batman!
4.0~Doesn't Live Up To the Hype. whirlawayC31941 Sign in Permalink This movie was given way too much credit. It was not as good as people said it was. The only good thing about it was Heath Ledger. This was the best performance of his tragically short life. He was amazing as the Joker, and extremely frightening. The rest of the movie was a waste of my time, though. The other actors were sub par, and the story was unoriginal. That really annoyed me because of how people were RAVING about it. This movie is not worth your time, don't listen to the people saying 'Oh, The Dark Knight is great, it's the best movie ever', because that is not true. I actually don't know if I was watching the same movie as those people, as the movie I saw was total garbage, almost but not quite saved by one absolutely stellar performance.
10.0~The Artistic Side of Superheroics NickAngle Sign in Permalink The art of the superhero film is to most people, not an art at all. Films like Spider-Man 2 and Hellboy, while widely acclaimed by critics did not receive anything more than special effects nods from the big boys upstairs when it came time to hand out shiny trophies. In 2005 however, ground was shattered when Christopher Nolan, the highly-thought of director of Memento took the Schumacher-ized Batman series and gave it one swift kick in the jaw. The two and a half hour film was entitled Batman Begins, and like all superhero films it received little critical thought, but it changed things. Now with the 2008 sequel at long last out, Christopher Nolan may be the first man to pull an Oscar out of a superhero shaped ass. As the main antagonist of the movie would say, "I'll show you, you'll see." The plot of The Dark Knight revolves around the same concept of it's predecessor. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) parades around the dark streets of Gotham as the Batman in an attempt to clean the most corrupt city the world has yet seen. Together with his trusted manservant Alfred (Michael Caine) and local police lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), things are starting to look better in Gotham. Even the new district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is making big changes, so big in fact that Batman is beginning to wonder if he's truly needed anymore. But things change when a sinister madman known only as the Joker (the late Heath Ledger) begins to terrorize the city. The story is pound for pound what was expected from Nolan since the previous installment. It's dark and powerful with psychological themes doused throughout. The film improves on the last one by truly showing the tormented side of billionaire Bruce Wayne as he deals with being both the most loved and hated man in Gotham on and off. As Harvey Dent begins to save the city with the law and not his fists, Bruce Wayne reaches the point where he seriously questions the necessity of his role as Batman, especially if it will get him back into the good graces of his lost love Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who is now wrapped up in a relationship with the aforementioned Dent. The love triangle is a small part of the story and does little to detract from the main film, but instead adds to the emotional aspects perfectly. More needs to be said for the film's greatest strength though, which is Heath Ledger's performance as the sinister Joker. One of his first on-screen lines is "What doesn't kill you, makes you stranger," a thought the man clearly echoes throughout the film. Ledger has a way with this character that will make you feel guiltier than ever before, making the viewer laugh at his quirkiest of moves, despite those moves resulting in tragedy near all the time. The Joker is at all times hilarious and menacing, switching from laughing and toying with civilians, to threatening them at knifepoint while sharing the tragic stories of his life gone down the drain. Ledger's performance is nothing short of a masterwork, as he portrays one of the most challenging characters a comic book could produce flawlessly. It's truly amazing to watch every scene in which the Joker is featured. Though Heath Ledger inevitably overshadows the rest of the film, there's no need to take away from the other performances. Bale is fantastic as the emotionally torn Wayne and Eckhart as Harvey Dent will likely go down as one the most under-appreciated roles in cinema this year. The rest of the cast is fantastic at what they do, and while none of them steal the show, none of them have to. Each member of the ensemble cast brings forth great performances that compliment the others well and really just complete an already stellar movie. The Dark Knight is clearly at this point, the best movie of the year. The acting is the best I've seen in some time, the story is top notch and stays close to Batman mythology, and the overall dark and emotional tone captured by Nolan is powerful and fantastic to be a part of. All in all, to call this film anything short of a masterpiece would detract from what is easily the best superhero film yet produced. To call it a superhero film would almost be a crime in itself, perhaps it is better described as a dramatic thriller with superheroic themes.
1.0~Worse Batman movie ever! gringostar2 Sign in Permalink I really tried to watch this movie. I enjoyed the first scene and that was about it. After the first scene or so i was so annoyed. i could not follow this movie to save my life. i was utterly confused and annoyed most of the time. i have never in my life seen so much dialog in a batman movie. where has batman gone? where has the joker gone? Hands down this was the worse. To make matters worse this was the looooooooooooooongest movie i have ever had to sit through. the movie was totally boring. furthermore, i cannot believe that so many people liked this movie. it seems that 90% of you loved the movie and 10% of us hated the movie. This movie really really really sucked.
10.0~Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! LegitAsBallz Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan you just made my day. This blockbuster season I was admittedly pumped for Dark Knight and Indiana Jones. The latter I was most pumped because I love Indiana Jones. Though when that came out I was very disappointed. So I turned my eyes on the Dark Knight. Baman Begins was great (9 stars) but the Dark Knight flew above my head and soar and never looked down. It was a strong movie in almost every aspect. Story: 8 A new villain is in town, the Joker, (the late Heath Ledger) and he is trying to bring down the whole city with him at no cost. Try to corrupt the Batman, (Christian Bale) and the D.A. Harvey Dent. Acting: Great acting everywhere. Though Heath Ledger stole the show. Oscar nomination time! Above average acting from every one except for Maggie G. which was average. Script: Great one liners, not cheesy though like, (Lets kick some ICE! and "Your not send me back to da COOLER!") have been replaced with, (Why so serious and more.) Oscar Nod Camera Work: Great Oscar Nod Music: Fits perfectly. Oscar Nod too. Overall: Amazing and is the Blockbuster of the decade. Best Picture Nod time! 10/10
3.0~worst batman movie ever drakesalute Sign in Permalink This Batman movie is told from the Republican point of view. According to this film, violence is the only possible solution in every situation. Intelligence is of no use. The hero is a rich man, Bruce Wayne, a boor who brags about how much money he has. Republicans will love him. Instead of outwitting his enemies, which might require more gray matter than is contained in his cranium, this Batman just invests in fancy new weapons. This sounds like the policy of the outgoing Administration. The villain, the Joker, is a two dimensional idiot that only wants "to see the world burn," having no depth whatsoever. He kills even those who cooperate with him. He is yet another serial killer, a tedious figure often used in films because the writer has no imagination and no grasp on human psychology. Anytime you see a serial killer in a film, it means the writer is to lazy to bother thinking about motivation. I stopped the movie mid-way through and threw the DVD in the trash can. It was that bad. I liked the previous Batman movies better. They had some heart. This one has no heart and should therefore appeal to a great many armchair generals out there that fantasize about fancy weapons.
10.0~One of the best movies ever made. See it to believe it! wizardlord-1 Sign in Permalink This Joker will put a smile on your face! Batman History: Gone are the days when Adam West's campy Batman T.V series used to be the only source of "Bat Entertainment" for the audience. The Batman movies of the 90s did not do justice to the great comic book icon. They all made the caped crusader appear as a happy-go-lucky masked vigilante who saved the day at the end with his "Bat Gadgets". Where was the character development? A real plot? (Oh please, not the penguin-stole-candy-from-a-baby plot). The superficial storyline and lack of commitment catalysed the fiasco of the Batman franchise. All in all, much to the dismay of fans, a costly costume party was all that we ever saw! A Knight was born: 'Batman Begins" at last delved into the dark and troubled past of Bruce Wayne. A man trying to find his identity, conquer his worst fears and overcome the grief of the unjust murder of his parents. A man who becomes invincible as a symbol. The magic of this movie lies in the fact that although it is not real, it makes you want to believe that it is! The Dark Knight: The success of Batman Begins opened the flood gates of great expectations and surreal anticipation for perhaps one of the most awaited movie sequels, let alone a Batman sequel. With expectations and speculations running wild, the overzealous promotion and media hype knew no bounds. The Dark Knight was put under microscope long before its scheduled release. The tragic loss of Heath Hedger, especially after whispers of his alleged over-the-top performance, added fuel to the fire. With fans and critics eagerly waiting to sing praise or eviscerate the movie alike, Dark Knight made a smashing entry! The question is, did this movie deliver? Did it live up to the unrealistic expectations of the fans? No. It surpassed it! This movie is not just for fans of Batman, but for all those who love to see a masterpiece. It certainly stretched the limitations of a typical comic book movie. The Joker is not just the avergae psychotic villain who blows things up and deliver jabs and witty retorts. No no no no no! He is more than that. A lot more than that. His every word has a deep psychological connotation to it. He poses moral dilemmas that play with the boundaries of normal ethical conduct and human psyche. Simply put, he puts people under the microscope and test their reaction under extreme situations. And he does it with flair! That's the beauty of it. He creates ingenious situations and traps that tricks everybody into believing something, while something else is happening. Bruce Wayne is pushed to such extremes that he thinks that his days as the caped crusader are coming to an end... As Rachel puts it, "Bruce don't make me your only hope for a normal life". We also find that The Joker and Batman have a lot in common. Joker pretty much sums up the entire comic book history between him and Batman as "You and I are destined to do this forever"... Although they are portrayed as freaks with troubed childhood, it all comes down to the choices that people make at testing times. Harvey and Bruce are both influenced by The Joker's brilliant yet fiendish schemes and the outcome is colossal... You've gotta see it for yourself! This so much more than an action movie. A psychological thriller? Perhaps. The way Joker manipulates human nature is simply "mind blowing". Believe me, he is more than what you expect him to be in every single moment of the movie. His influence on Harvey Dent is even more intriguing than it is on the rest. And the fact that special effects are less prominent compared to character development and storyline goes to show that drama and theatrics impacts people on a personal level that all the CGI in the world cannot conjure up. It simply makes you care for the character rather than being a mute spectator of a violent showdown. This movie revolves around deep forgotten fears, traumas, hope, faith and courage. This is poetry in movie making! Rating: 10/10 No questions asked!
5.0~Big bold that's the advertising maryzaaz Sign in Permalink Seeing Batman: The Dark KNight is the event of the year. That makes it exciting. The problem with this film is that its too long. 30 minutes need to be cut out. The story is not sufficiently written to carry the film for its full length. Whatever any one says there is a load of padding in the filming to take it to its 152 minutes. Blockbusters need to be epics its seems. Even if the story has to be stretched to fill the time. How many times does Jim Gordon have to say "The Joker meant us to be here?" Christian Bale broods and broods and ... broods! No wonder we haven't heard very much about him in previews on his performance. He doesn't do very much. Aaron Eckheart's good guy DA is the only clear moral character out of all them in Githam. Its a dark and violent city returning to the original comic book stories. All very well but you need more story to support it. Heath Ledger as predicted steals every scene and is having wild fun with a huge character where everyone else is subdued compared to his Joker. It owes a debt to Jack Nicholson's Joker with whom it has been compared. Its largely good as a blockbuster but is over-hyped and the advertising surpasses its expectations
10.0~The Dark Knight Movie of 2008 LJStephens1980 Sign in Permalink Heads Up, TDK is the best film of the year, and leaves everything else gaping in its wake. Yes you heard right. There is not a single wrong-step, here, everything is perfect from the Sets, Gotham looks like Sin-City on hyper-steroids, to the actors, and the story. The acting here is top-notch from everybody, Bale, Cain, Eckhart, Oldman, Gyllenhaal, Freeman, are all brilliant, and yet Heath Ledger stands above them. His Joker is destined for movie legend and greatness. Peter Travers in the Rolling Stone wrote that '. If there's a movement to get him (Heath Ledger) the first posthumous Oscar since Peter Finch won for 1976's Network, sign me up." I concur entirely. This has everything, and once its finished it won't leave you, in fact you'll want to see it again. RIP Heath, The Dark Knight was brilliant.
7.0~Take off the fanboy goggles! jonathancee Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is for sure a good movie. It can easily be called the best Batman movie yet, although in my opinion thats not saying much. To be honest, there are just as many things to dislike about this movie as there are to enjoy. Just to summarize the things I liked about this movie: This is the smartest, darkest, complex, involving and violent Batman yet. There is no doubt that a lot of thought went into the plot movie. I really enjoyed how they made the Joker psychologically attack Batman and cause havok around the city. He really seemed like an intellectual villain who had a larger purpose than just killing Batman. My main complaints were that at some times, the movie takes its storyline a bit too far. I honestly thought the whole Two-Face origin was way too pushed. Harvey Dent's story arc seemed way too predictable and quite flat. I didn't really buy his whole transition into a villain. It seemed a little rushed and completely unnecessary and I think the movie could have done much better without the Two-Face side story. Plus I didn't like the whole "Bruce Wayne turning himself in drama". The story of the people turning against the hero has been overdone in the movies. It tries desperately to create some inner character turmoil for Batman, but 15 minutes later he is kicking ass like it never happened. Silly. Don't get me wrong, its a good movie. I just wish all the fans would see the movie for what it is and take their fan goggles off.
10.0~Best Picture of the Year movieguttx95 Sign in Permalink I saw this film on opening day, expecting an average movie, i was actually blown away by the acting performance that was presented by Heath Ledger, i was susprised, i was never a batman fan until i saw this movie, It had a very dark tone and i must say that it was probably very close to acheiveing an R-rating, I personally do not recommend this to children under the age of 10, I think it would scare little kids to death, I must say since his movie was unbelievably great, it deserves the best picture of the year this summer, it was that great, if you haven't already seen this movie, definitely see it, its one of the only movies that are worth seeing this summer, it definitely deserves a 10/10
5.0~It wasn't as good people made it out to be. ssmksi Sign in Permalink It seems that hype really does work for the masses. They easily succumb to what larger, more powerful entities want them to like. It's shocking and scary, really. This movie, in my opinion, and it is mine and I do not care what anyone has to say, is a perfect example. I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't bad but it definitely was not great. I liked the pace of the movie and some of the acting is OK. I did not like the joker character, though. The joker was quite boring and not flamboyant enough. The dude that played the joker did an OK job but the writing for it really fell below the waterline and I felt that the script was boring and uninspired. This was more of an eye candy movie. Christian as Batman still bums me out. He is simply not a good choice for Batman nor is he a good choice for Bruce Wayne. It just does not feel correct. Unfortunately for this movie, my favorite scene(s) involved that beautiful Murcielago with the painted six piston calipers. That was the most beautiful thing in this movie. It broke my heart to see it smashed. I couldn't help but feel that this movie minus the costumes could have been named Die Hard 5. It had that same momentum and feel. It was still a good movie. It was just not a GREAT movie.
1.0~Too much of everything dianemarie123 Sign in Permalink There were just too many subplots, too much violence, and it was at least a half hour too long. They should have taken some of the time they spent planning CGI effects and used it to seal some of the plot holes: 1. A witness pulls a gun out while he's on the witness stand? Excuse me?? This is some mythic land where the courthouses don't have metal detectors? 2. There's a terrorist threat against a hospital, so they evacuate every patient--*except* the one who's been in all the papers. 3. The police are transporting a high-profile prisoner, with dozens of vehicles escorting him and SWAT teams all over the place--but one trailer truck starts chasing them and they're all helpless. 4. The silliest thing of all--Batman's constant whispering. It's supposed to make him sound menacing, but he just sounds like he has laryngitis. It's like the old Superman TV show where people magically have no idea who he is as long as he keeps his glasses on. I know I'm way in the minority on this one, but I have to say this was the ugliest, stupidest movie I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I weren't trapped at the end of an aisle. You couldn't pay me enough to sit through it again.
1.0~The Dumb Knight leesiad Sign in Permalink You have got to be kidding me! My husband and I decided to watch this piece of garbage on New Year's Eve instead of a marathon of The Office. Boy did we make the wrong choice. How do people like this "film"? What has happened to artistic integrity and plain old good taste. The plot was disjointed, confusing, and ridiculous!! The direction was horrid. Even the actors who many I respect all looked like a bunch of sell outs who were in it for the paycheck. Gary Oldman are you joking? One of the greatest actors - what a horrible role. Could you not keep your English accent out of Gotham when you raised your voice? Don't you learn how to do that in acting 101? The highlight of the movie is when Rachel blows up. Sorry to be morbid but talk about a bore - that Maggie girl should take some lessons from her at least competent brother. Can anyone explain the plot in 1000 words or less? Unbelievably all over the place. Heath Ledger did a good job as the Joker, but please don't tell me this role drove him to emotional torment and insomnia. I have great respect for him as an actor and feel so sad for his death. I just don't understand what was so dark about the dark knight. Batman should definitely hang up his suit.
5.0~Not good enough! william-481 Sign in Permalink Spectacular and entertaining but no more than that. Batman Begins is way better. This movie has nothing to add that movie and/or original story. Be honest! What do you remember about this movie, a week after seeing it? Just the Joker walking out the exploding hospital I guess. Nicely done but not "Nolan proof". Please don't make a third one Christopher (you're still one of my favorite directors). Summary: go see it for it's spectacular actions and... that's it. Nothing more! (sorry) This is the required 10th line
1.0~This film does not belong in the top 10 Movies of all time. ambient-music Sign in Permalink Firstly, I wish to say that I think "The Dark Knight" is a very good movie. As an average Batman fan, I think that this version of the Batman chronicles balances artful pathos with run-of-the-mill mainstream icons and themes. Secondly, my goal is to make a brief point that this film has no place in the top 10 movies of all time. Thirdly and lastly, in order to make my point, I would like you to review the top 10 list below. 1. The Shawshank Redemption (1994) 455,891 2. 9.1 The Godfather (1972)372,101 3. 9.0 The Godfather: Part II (1974) 218,313 4. 8.9 Il buono,il brutto, il cattivo. (1966) 137,484 5. 8.9 Pulp Fiction (1994)372,926 6. 8.8 Schindler's List (1993) 247,064 7. 8.8 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) 190,056 8. 8.8 12 Angry Men (1957) 100,190 9. 8.8 The Dark Knight (2008) 403,372 10. 8.8 Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) Now, ask yourself the question does "The Dark Knight" belong in this list? I do not think it does. My opinion: I do not think that the "The Dark Knight" meets the basic criteria of Character Development and story/plot/dialog quality. It is a 2 dimensional action film that wants to nick the surface of character development but fails to meet the challenge.
1.0~Load of rubbish!! ewansp-2 Sign in Permalink BORING, UNEXCITING, TEDIOUS, OVERLONG and UNINTERESTING..only a few choice words I can think of off hand to describe this total and utter let-down of a film that everyone else seems to be raving about! What a load of absolute rubbish, it was a total waste of time from start to finish. I had originally decided not to see this film having not overly enjoyed Batman Begins but gave in in the end due to all the hype and the fact that it had soared to the No 1 spot in the IMDb database. I was absolutely shocked and amazed by this, how it can go ahead of such BRILLIANT films as SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and STAR WARS i'll never know, not to mention the masterpiece of LORD OF THE RINGS! I see TDK is currently in the No 3 position, all I can say is that I only hope it continues to drop places. To put things in perspective I wish I hadn't of bothered with TDK..within ten minutes I was sitting there in the cinema yawning my head off! For one thing I had difficulty understanding many of the sentences the characters were saying and for another the whole film just didn't hold my attention. I thought Christian Bale was boring and wooden in his role of Batman, with that silly voice when he's in the suit to match. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were fine as always but utterly underused. If their is one shred of goodness in this film through my eyes it would be for Heath Ledger as the Joker. His untimely death shortly after the making of this film did, i'll admit, help spur me on to see TDK and, after all the hype put out for his performance he certainly didn't disappoint. He truly stole every scene he was in and so deserves every credit he gets. He was a great young actor who will be sadly missed. I just can't believe how so many people love this film so much, what is the matter with all of you?!? No disrespect to any other IMDb reader/writer of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion but mine is one star for this film and one star only. TDK was the worst film of the summer for me, Wall-e was better by far! At least that film had bags of imagination, character development and story. This had nothing, even the action sequences were uninteresting and flat. It was so overlong too that, after a while, I was silently shouting at the screen - "COME ON, GET ON WITH IT". I will NEVER see another Batman film again in the cinema, I don't care what level the hype meter goes to. I knew this would be crap and it was. By the way, in case your wondering, my one star rating is for Heath Ledger's performance and for it alone.
3.0~Just a thought on Ledger's portrayal lilwhitehand Sign in Permalink I saw this movie twice and both viewings have not changed my initial thought. Grossly over-hyped, a lot of muddled dialog (particularly when the Dark Knight speaks) and some really silly and unacceptable plot holes. What I won't do is detail these holes because they've been mentioned and opinionated on hundreds of times already. Well, one, and only one: The Jokers recurring speeches about how he is an agent of chaos and he's not a man who plans, he just does things. Ring,ring,bells,buzzers and a red flag for ya'--Every single scenario and setup in this film would have to involve major planning and tremendous attention to detail to pull it off, ie: rigging explosives in hospitals, on ferries, and in a precinct--all of these places are public domains-- surgically implanting cellphones, penthouse home invasions full of politicos, dignitaries and all their accompanying security people. Point made? This paragraph will be for the true film aficionados. Can we agree that in order for a movie to be bestowed with accolades like (the following terms, with the exception of genius or awesome can never truly apply to something artistic or creative in nature) best ever, the greatest, genius, the most misused and overused word in these times--awesome--, and many other pretentious terms it has to hold up to scrutiny when all the hype has left town? For those who have a good reference point for films regardless of genre, budget or era in which a film was made, I can't see how they won't see this film as anything more than fairly entertaining, unremarkable and pretty forgettable. One other thing-- and this may really appeal to all my hardcore film people out there. Something struck me as interesting the other day. Get a hold of a copy of the Exorcist III if you can (if your a real film beast you might make this connection just from memory) and when you get to the scenes where Brad Dourif is in his cell talking with G. C. Scott pay attention to his speech patterns and his mannerisms. Its almost like Mr. Ledger subconsciously or even overtly brought Dourif's performance into his portrayal as the Joker--which I found to be energetic but far from 'genious', 'groundbreaking', 'instant classic','awesome'and the many other bru-hahas coming out of so many pie holes. I'm saying all that to say this, Ledger may not have been influenced by Dourif's portrayal of Damien Karras but it illustrates that hardly nothing is new or groundbreaking and rarely is something totally different in modern cinema. For those interested, post up on IMDb if you view that segment in Exorcist III and can juxtapose it to TDK's Joker portrayal. You guys tell me if something seems soooo... familiar or not. 3 out of 10 from the non-sheep / non-fanboy set. --I just had a thought fart--Should give it 2outta10 for casting that annoying little whinny kid from the Mist (Gordon's boy).
1.0~Dark Knight is Overrated TMokko Sign in Permalink I gave this film a one just to pull down the overall score of the film - it doesn't deserve the 10th place on top 250 list. There is no way that this film deserves ten points! Heath Ledger was great in his role as a Joker - no doubt about that. His early departure from the land of the living makes his role stand out in many peoples minds and give a extra glitter to whole movie. Without Joker this film would have much less ten point votes. Story really was bloated with too many characters - most of them just showing their face in the movie without any significance to the main storyline. Scarecrow and batman-boys (or what they were called) were totally unnecessary bypassers in the first half of the movie. Story was all over the place and it didn't have the consistency or the red line that it could follow. Many scenes were just boring and ridiculous. This film really didn't give nothing good to the whole Batman saga.
4.0~Fight Club for stupid people SupaChupacabra Sign in Permalink Instead of questioning Capitalism, Communism, Taoism or Existentialism... and challenging the audience... it is about corruption and surrendering to corruption like surrendering to jaded teen boredom. Fueled by the claustrophobic helplessness due to terrorism, and the merciless acceptance of hipster nihilism, TDK is a cold unrealistic mechanical set-up sold over and over again by it's proponents as "ultra-realistic". That is the most frightening thing about the obsessive if not immoral blatherings of TDK fans is the Emperor's New Clothes insistence that the film represents "realism". From the Joker's precision timing to drive a school bus into a line of school buses, with one space left for him... to Dent's facial damage due to 5 seconds of burning gasoline... the film is rife with movie fakeness sold like Ad (or ADD) pitchmen for "Nolan's formulaic realism", which is actually just him stealing from "The Long Halloween". A meaningless Rube Goldberg contraption, Nolan takes the audience on an endless set of fake-out twists and turns to deliver very little but loud moments. As calculated and obsessive as The Joker is, and to the degree he plans about 5 separate "back up plans" that come to fruition, he enters the level of anal retentive... yet somehow we are to believe he is some "agent of chaos". Which, means cool. Chaos = cool, get it? There's nothing cool or chaotic about this drugged out riffing Joker, and as fun as Ledger makes him, he overshadows what should have been the center of the story: Harvey Dent. But it's Batman so, business as usual... problem child villain acts up, makes a mess, BatDad shows up to clean up the mess. Crowd applauds. Unfortunately what the film creates is a subtext of a NeoCon wetdream with "by any means necessary" militarism, where the Batman uses unethical means to "detect" the Joker, and we are to assume this fall from grace makes him heroic because he is banished and falsely accused (for 1 minute of nagging by the Joker, turning Dent evil for yet another film coincidence) of driving Dent from white to dark knight... so Batman takes the blame and is the dark knight cuz he's just a Christ figure. So our sacrificial Justice League hero is supposed to be a sympathetic figure of crossing moral boundaries to save society... George Bush must have loved this puppy. Not sure half the tween tards watching this caught that bit of hooey, but as much as the poster art evokes Fight Club, this film is about as far from punk anarchy as you can get. Maybe they should all be sent to military school if this is their idea of rebellion.
10.0~The Dark Knight easily the best movie, no FILM, of 2008. By a longshot. willidke Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight was by far the most hyped movie of the summer. And I walked into the midnight premiere expecting a masterpiece, which depending on how you look at it could be a good or bad thing. I walked out a lengthly 2 and a half hours later absolutely stunned. Not has there EVER been a summer blockbuster movie like this. This was a super-hero movie that breaks all the rules a superhero movie has. And it didn't matter one bit to me, because the way I see the Dark Knight, its not a Batman Movie, its a Crime Drama that happens to have Batman in it. Now let me tell you right off the bat, This movie is not typical crash-bang-boom action movie. Its a movie you may have to see a few times to completely comprehend. What sets it apart from the rest of the (mostly) disappointing summer blockbusters this year is that it has a plot that you care about, characters that are believable and the moral choices presented are truly deep. Now lets just talk about the one thing people walked in to the theater for in the first place, not for Batman, not for Gotham, but for the Joker. Here is my one word to describe Heath Ledger's performance: Incredible. He made Jack Nicolson's Joker look like a grumpy Ronald McDonald. It was disturbing yet funny. Half the things he does on screen are truly horrific yet you laugh. And you wonder, "Why am I laughing? This is disturbing behavior!" My advice, "Why So serious?". Overall, the Dark Knight is not a movie, but a film. It breaks all the right rules and pulls all the right strings. I tell you its the quickest 2 and a Half Hours I've spent in the theater in a LONG time! I recommend this film to anyone, but I do warn parents that it is not a film for younger children, since some scenes are disturbing. I hope this sets the bar for all movies to come, but there will never be a film like it again.
7.0~Not as good as I'd hoped nicolaf_1964 Sign in Permalink Let's get it out of the way first: Heath Ledger was fantastic. A terrific performance, but that didn't make this "the best movie ever" for me. I found Dark Knight over long and dull at times. Maggie Gyllenhaal is adorable, but she is not the "great beauty" that the role should be. Katy Holmes would have been more plausible. Why does Batman have this strange gravelly voice? I couldn't really get to grips with that. Two-face has perfect enunciation even though half his face is missing - what's that all about. It was a fun movie, but nothing fantastic. My 13 year old daughter LOVED it, but not her 43 year old mum!
7.0~Not bad, but not great. This is the Doctor Zhivago of Batman movies. PWNYCNY Sign in Permalink Is it finally over? Did the movie finally end? This movie proves the following: NEVER make a movie with comic book characters that is longer than two hours. Even most Shakespearean plays aren't that long. NEVER make a movie that is somber, morose and convoluted. NEVER have the good guy act like a bad guy (here Batman is just as nasty as the guys he's going after). NEVER have the leading lady play a support role. NEVER have lead actors play support roles unless they are no longer leading actors (superstars Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are in support roles). NEVER have Batman without Robin. Christian Bale is no Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman is no Neil Hamilton. This movie needed ... cried out for ... Batwoman (remember Julie Newmar?) ... and Frank Gorshin, Burgess Meredith and Cesar Romero, and, yes, even Burt Ward and Adam West. This pretentious movie is not bad but it certainly is not great. The one bright spot in this otherwise somber production is the performance by the late Heath Ledger. His performance as the Joker almost carries this otherwise lackluster version of the Batman story. Batman is a hero and to portray him as being anything else does not work. Dark Knight is the Doctor Zhivago of Batman movies - long, pretentious, drawn out, somber, and above all, dull. A few words about Heath Ledger. Mr. Ledger was a great actor and proved it in Dark Knight. Despite the movie's flaws, his performance is practically flawless as he brings a unique interpretation of a sinister and complex character to the screen. Whenever Mr. Ledger was in a scene, the movie improved and became interesting. Mr. Ledger gave a great performance for which he deserves a BRAVO! Also, during the filming of Dark Knight, one of the stunt men, Conway Wickcliffe also passed away. Although not a movie star, the loss of Mr. Wickcliffe should be duly noted. From the extra in the crowd to the featured star, every member of the cast and crew play a critical role in bringing a story to the screen ... or the stage. The amount of planning and work involved in producing a movie or staging a play is almost indescribable and without the efforts of EVERY member of the cast and crew, the entertainment brought to public in the movie houses and theaters would not be possible. This movie reportedly is a box office smash hit, but when viewed today the theater was practically empty and after watching this movie, now I know why. After all, if you want to take a nap why pay good money to fall asleep while watching the Dark Knight?
10.0~A Tragic Masterpiece kgbellinger24 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight, truly is dark and raw, it digs deep and provokes. Going in, I knew it was gonna be dark, but with this Shakespearian/Hamlet tragedy, it becomes so much more entirely. The movie deals so seamlessly with the ideas of human nature, psychological core, emotions of hate, revenge, torture, angst, betrayal, sadness. The action is notched up, and boy does it deliver. From the opening scene to the final scene, you will be spell-binded. You really don't know what's gonna happen next! Bale delivers a heartfelt performance, Oldman shines, ECKHART is amazing at the end, and of course Ledger well was the Joker himself. I couldn't even get past that the man behind the makeup was Heath. His character is absolute, but very complex, in that, credit to writers, his actions paradoxically have so much meaning. He too symbolizes an ideal, anarchy, and does so breathlessly illustrating his view of the world, that provokes and delivers some forbidden truth. The mythical, tragic overtones, themes, and character arcs make this film a masterpiece. Amazing, amazing, amazing.
9.0~I went in expecting 'ok'.... gundamxeroa Sign in Permalink I left the theater with a grin from ear to ear. AMAZING! Absolutely astonishing... fantastic cinematography coupled with great writing and gritty fight scenes... my expectations were FAR surpassed. Easily the best comic-book movie out there. However, there were a few things that did get under my skin... such as Christian Bale's voice behind the mask. Why does he sound like a nasal congestion victim coupled with constipation? No good. One plot hole that really got to me at the 'fundraiser'. Maybe someone else will notice it? Also, the bike.... ugh, the bike.... a bit cheesy for my taste, but maybe that's just me. All in all though, it was extremely well done and look forward to the next one being even better, if that's even possible.
10.0~Raison d'etre...just want to watch the world burn. Ark-Flash Sign in Permalink Heath Ledger's edgy portrayal of the Joker is a frightening and macabre vision of the Clown Prince of Crime. Sure his costume is the right colours, but shades of purple and green have never looked so muted like he's been dragged through the filth of alleys and gutters. His makeup is a halloween gone wrong: applied blood red over torture scars, smudged & cracked white wash, blacken sharks eyes of death, capped by a entangled toxic green weave of hair. While his lip smacks and tongue snakes, his many quotable psycho babble tirades on chaos and madness had this preview screening audience in silent shock and awe. As fans, we wait to finally hear the Joker's maniacal laughter...we are rewarded. But it is a chilling laugh that plays on our nerves with a subliminal shrilling echo that will haunt us long after the film. His facial twitches and deliberate gestures work to induce a hypnotic and mesmerizing hold on Gotham/audience. His weapon of choice (not the lint or veg peeler) is the knife, for both it's ability to inflict a visceral cold kill and likely because it was an instrument of his own twisted grinning origin. The lack of origin story is also effective as an open book for the imagination. The hand held cam scenes of Joker 1st POV filming his prey and the off cam torture is a stark reminder of the realty of terrorist footage. From the sick punch line of his disappearing pen trick to becoming a masochistic punching bag for The Batman, Joker can certainly dish out as well as he gets. The Joker casts pure fear into the minds of Gotham by testing the citizens beliefs and moral lines of good and evil. This Mad Dog of Chaos thrives in a world without rules, where even the Good of Gotham can succumb to corruption and conflict. Hence his handiwork in the transformation of Gotham's White Knight to Harvey Two Face Dent. The eerie background "music" is like a deaf tone barbed-wire noise that rings through Gotham's cityscapes as a harbinger of the Joker's evil to come. In all fairness Ledger cannot be compared to Nicholson. Its Apples and Oranges. Burton's 80's film delivered a comic book to screen, thug turned clown which was hammed up with the flair and suave that's stamped with Jack's vintage trademark. Ledger has redefined the role and delivered a nightmare Monster that won't let you awake or escape. All truly memorable screen villains are able to forever get into the mind of the protagonist and audience. It is with this performance that Ledger/Joker joins the ranks of the top three cerebral cinematic killers, namely Hopkins/Lecter, Spacey/Doe. This is a tour de force Oscar worthy performance that lives up to the hype (rare thing) and even raises the bar (even rarer). So kudos to Ledger/Nolan and TDK Team for unleashing the perfect villain for The Batman. And remember, the next time you're playing a card game your hand may come up with the Joker's signature calling card. RIP HL.
8.0~No Backstory, good action and acting heatherlina Sign in Permalink First I'll say, if you're one for the story and the 'why' of a character, in this movie, you will be disappointed. It was not the directors goal to explain everything about every character, and wanted to show the story instead. I feel that the story went along nicely. Most movies, I look at my watch, I'm not a movie person, this movie did NOT feel like 2 1/2 hours at all. I feel that Aaron Eckharts transformation from Harvey Dent to Two Face sucked. He didn't play Two Face up good enough... they had developed him as too much of a good guy, and didn't seem able to throw himself into the 'bad' Two face role. He needed to be more tormented when talking... more dramatic. He fell short as Two Face IMO. Ledgers Joker was perfect. He lost himself in that role. Sometimes when watching, you can see an actor through the part.. and that was not the case here. All you saw was Joker... crazy, funny, quirky Joker. Oscar worthy? maybe.
7.0~Hype tombelushi Sign in Permalink A good film but not the master piece every one is making it out to be. One word. Hype. Two face is wasted and his existence is only known by Gordon and batman in the end so why bother using (and wasting)his character?, was there any real point in Maggie Gylenhall? The ferry bit went on far too long (probably so they could give ledger more screen time), The batbike/pod thing looked really slow and spent most of its time spinning its wheels and looked like more of an excuse to release a cool toy tie in! and i could go on but you probably all agree but are too blinded by hype and the fact that ledgers dead to see that this is a pretty average film. Why was the scarecrow not arrested at the start of the film? How come the clear reference at the end of batman begins regarding the jokers existence is completely forgotten about in the next movie. I could go on but i'm sure you'll all realise when the hypes died down. In summery, too long, wasted characters, a bit of mis casting and what the f**k was with batmans ultra gruff voice! i nearly choked on my popcorn first time i heard him! Heath ledger is a sad loss however.
1.0~Unwatchable - only 1 sound guy? ls-77 Sign in Permalink It's not often I find a movie plain unwatchable, but that was the case with the Dark Knight. The reason is plain and simple: almost every dialog feels "fake" as only 1 person speaks per camera point. Like with cheap soaps where they can only take care of the sound of one person, or where the stars don't physically meet that much. The lack of chemistry and realness resulting from monologues shot in series an then cut to dialogs, is bewildering. Staggering low-quality. I honestly found it unwatchable because of that, and what's even more bewildering is that this seemingly cheap or ill-produced production is considered a master piece by so many. I feel like the little child in The Emperor's New Clothes. What's going on here? Has everyone turned blind? Shockingly bad.
6.0~Overrated / Hyped Movie lmottley Sign in Permalink I do not know who is running up the hype on this movie, but it is not as good as it is currently being portrayed as being. I saw the movie tonight and found it to be OK, it is a little long, the action is OK, but too many twists and turns in story and plot to just keep the movie going. It is definitely not worth the #1 status it currently has on IMDb. I enjoyed batman begins better, I think due to my expectations being very low for that movie. It is an enjoyable movie, I just think all the marketing hype is not justified. Marketing deserves an award for the job they are doing for this movie.
5.0~Too Dark. OllieSuave-007 Sign in Permalink I know there were a lot of hype and excitement about this film, but I think it's the weakest in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Though it does have some strong movie elements such as good special effects, high drama and a haunting music score, this film is too dark even for Batman. The plot drags, action and violence are overkill and some of the cast performances were weak. As a fan of the comics, I was hoping that this trilogy would follow the comic continuity more than the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher series. But, it wasn't meant to be. We have a story about Batman trying to rid the city of the remaining mobs, but ended up facing a new villain, the Joker. Later on in the story, crime-fighting Harvey Dent flips a nerve and turn into Two-Face. While pretty good acting, Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was too manic and sadistic. I didn't care for the make-up and costume as well. Aaron Eckhart's performance of Harvey Dent/Two-Face drove me off the wall - bland as Harvey Dent and much too angry as Two-Face. I know Director Nolan wanted to avoid camp at all cost after what we've went through with Schumacher's films, but the story is too serious and dark. I would highly recommend "Batman Begins" or "The Dark Knight Rises" over this. While also dark, those two films had much better character development, compelling plots and a better balance of humor. Grade D+
10.0~Why So Serious? puffball97 Sign in Permalink Why is "The Dark Knight" so serious? For many good reasons. Christopher Nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplistic comic book story like "Batman" and turn it into a complex psychological movie with plethora of character study. He has directed Christian Bale into the most serious Batman character of all. He sure did direct the late Heath Ledger into performing as the best Joker of them all, and Ledger did not work to upstage Bale or the other actors in any way. Ledger should definitely win a posthumous Oscar for his scary performance of a clown who possesses deep wounds. If Christopher Nolan was old enough, he should have done Batman movies instead of Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher put together. Tim Burton's mood was dark as well, but as I'm looking at it now, Michael Keaton was a more sloppy Batman, Kim Basinger was a mousy Vicky Vale, and Jack Nicholson overdid his Joker performance. In "Batman Returns," also directed by Burton and starring Keaton, the commercialism continues, adding Michelle Pfeiffer as a more idiotic Catwoman than the Catwomen on the 1960s TV series and Danny DeVito, who still was a wounded Penguin, but not enough that we feel sorry for him. Then in the mid 1990s, Keaton didn't want to play Batman anymore, feeling he was upstaged by all the villains. Looking for more actors often typecast as villains, director Schumacher got Tommy Lee Jones to parody his villain persona as Harvey "Two-Face" Dent. Also, there was still that rubberface persona in Jim Carrey as the Riddler as well. 1997's "Batman and Robin" was a total washout. So Nolan came to rescue this moribund franchise and made his own franchise moody with dark colors, mature, less focus on the action and more on the story and detailed development of each character without exploiting them. In 2005, "Batman Begins" was just the beginning, but "The Dark Knight" is the real story. It would be sin that Christopher Nolan does not get nominated for an Oscar, just as well as Heath Ledger, for best director. Christian Bale is, and many people would agree with me, the best Batman of them all. With his rich performance, we do know him better than Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney put together. We know Bruce Wayne's haunted past and demons, and why he becomes his alter ego Batman to fight crime in Gotham City. Unlike Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger is a much more complicated joker. He doesn't torture people just for pure torture. He doesn't laugh maliciously between every single sentence. He grew up with such an abusive upbringing that he wants to exploit Batman as a fraud for Gotham City, even bringing in Batman clones with the typical Caped Crusader outfit on the crime scenes just to tell Bruce Wayne "Will the real Batman stand up?" All the other actors give excellent, detailed performances. Maggie Gyllenhal gives a stronger performance than Katie Holmes (Mrs. Tom Cruise) as Bruce Wayne's love interest Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes, but is smitten with D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in the end. Gary Oldman, in one of his few good-guy roles, does a fine turn as the mustachioed Commissioner Gordon, more serious than the one we've seen on TV. Veteran thespians Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are always a treat to watch as the faithful butler Alfred and the gadget inventor Lucius Fox. These two men get better with age each time they make movies. And Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey "Two-Face" Dent not as a torturous villain like Tommy Lee Jones did before, but as a victim wounded by the Joker's torture in a gas chamber out to seek revenge with his coin as his calling card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on his intended targets. The summer of 2008 had a lot of movies. I've seen "Mamma Mia" as a light feel-good musical comedy riddled with off-key singing, notably by Pierce Brosnan. I've seen "Wall-E," which I thought was Pixar's blander efforts. Remy the rat from last year upstaged this robot on all costs. But "The Dark Knight" is the best movie of the summer. When it comes to comic book stories, as I said before, directors Burton and Schumacher got all caught up in themselves with too much action and seemed to forget their audiences. Nolan never does.
10.0~The Dark Knight connor-macgregor Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight blew me away in seconds.The Joker's Entrance was amazing and so shocking.Then his meeting with the Mafia was classic.The characters were great.Harvey Dent was a very good character and was slowly turning to the dark side like Anakin in Star Wars.It was a very long movie.The story was amazing and the effects were outstanding.Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was amazing,Brilliant...just classic.Shame the actor's death will mean we will never see the Joker again.Above all The Dark Knight was a memorable film which i will never get tired of.Hope a 3rd one is in the works.There were also a lot of surprises in the film.I won't mention but there was one that shone out above the lot. The Story is basically Batman(Christian Bale) And The Gotham Police starting to clean up Gotham's crime when a new villain the Joker(Heath Ledger)Enters Gotham hoping to create havoc and mayhem across Gotham.Bruce/Batman also has to adjust to the love of her Life Rachel(Maggie Gyllenhall) Dating Lawer Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart).Batman allies with Harvey and James Gordan(Gary Oldman) to bring down the Joker and the MOB once and for all...but will suffer heavy consequences along the way which will affect and destroy Batman forever.
9.0~I have no words but I will write a lot anyway! jshadle0807 Sign in Permalink What can I say about The Dark Knight? Star #1 goes to Christian Bale for his appearance as Batman. Everything I ever thought of when I thought of Batman, Christian Bale brings to the table. He's cunning, a brilliant fighter, compassionate, yet conflicted, dark, lonely, and self righteous. While his almost beast-like voice grew a little tiresome, I felt like it fit nonetheless. I could go on forever about Christian Bale. He's the reason I went to see it in the first place (and by that I mean his hotness). But we're moving on . . . Star #2 goes to Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. Eckhart completely surpassed my expectations for him. His portrayal was subtle but it was all we needed. We're shown immediately in the trailer that Dent is technically 'the hero' yet he just as messed up as everyone else in this film. His transformation during the film is quite believable and we all know that character transformations can go very wrong(anyone remember Spiderman Three?) I give Eckhart a mental high five for bringing depth to the cardboard comic book character. Stars #3 and 4 go to Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. I don't think I even need to go on. The cinematography was fabulous. The dialogue was incredible. The characters were deep and the actors didn't even have to do much work. Despite amazing performances from the whole cast, they would be nowhere in this film without the Nolans. I can't wait to see what they do next. Star #5 goes to Morgan Freeman. We've known he's a man for some time now but he emphasizes that fact in this film. No, he's not in it much but when he is, he steals the scene. Even Lucius Fox is complicated and almost dark in this film. After all, he is a liar and an accomplice to Batman's law breaking in the name of justice. I applaud him for so subtly bringing so much to the table. Star #6 goes to Michael Cain who has been Alfred well, forever. He was endearing and brought some much needed comic relief and lightness to this film. Cain was simply adorable and you could almost see the tight bond between him and Bruce Wayne. In other words, he simply made me smile. Star #7 goes to Gary Oldman as Detective Gordon. I didn't expect what he delivered. He too is conflicted about lying to his entire department about Batman, especially Harvey Dent. His friendship with Batman is so screwy, its borderline Holmes/Watson. Although . . . I'm not sure who would be who. Oldman's character is warm, gentle, and caring yet weary, exasperated, and troubled. I give him a mental high five as well for reminding us that most police officers are good people. Star #8 goes to the idea that the Nolans put out. They challenged all ideas of civilized society today without offending most anyone. The theme of the Dark Knight reminds us that once you remove society's rules, we are all just trying to survive and we will do anything to stay alive. You all know what scene I'm referring to and if you haven't seen it, you will know what scene I'm referring to. I left the theatre and immediately wanted to watch it again because I knew I missed a lot. And Star #9 goes to the great late Heath Ledger for his beautiful interpretation as the Joker. I'm not just saying he was amazing because he's dead. He reminded me of why people are afraid of clowns and he does it with a permanent sadistic smile. He challenges Batman and pushes him far past his limits while cynically proclaiming that they are exactly the same. Ledger caused me to wonder if everyone would be like the Joker once society's rules were gone. He also conflicted me throughout the whole film. Was I the only one who had to keep reminding themselves that Batman is the good guy? The reason I did not give it a ten is because yes, it was a very long movie and I think it could have been cut down. I also don't understand the purpose of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Who is Rachael? We don't know and I never cared to find out. I also never give anything a ten because nothing and no one is perfect but this film is pretty close . . .
1.0~Hyped and a little overrated, this is a good film but with many flaws wouterdirks Sign in Permalink I think the hype around this movie makes people completely overrate it. OK Heath does a great job at the joker but the movie itself has many flaws: 1. The balance between good and badguy is all out of sync. Batman fades into the background, he also has way less dialog than the joker. This makes the movie unbalanced. I think they re-cut the movie after Heaths death, to put him in the foreground. 2. The movie is tooooo long, this story can be shorter with less redundant scenes, its like they couldn't choose what to put in, so they just put all of it in! This gave me and some of my friends several *yawn* moments near the end. 3. Gotham city looks like a normal city. In "batman begins" it had a real comic feel but in this movie it doesn't, which is a shame really. 4. The point of the movie, (i wont tell u what it is) but yes, this action movie tries to make a philosophical point. Of course this can be great, but in this movie it gets chewed over and over and over and then it gets forced down your throat. 5. Lack of humor. An occasional sharp or funny dialog would have been great, however the dialogs arnt very good and they're never funny. 6. The plot devices are really quite lame. I wont go into details but most of the plot devices are silly and inspirationless, even the comic manages to feel more realistic than that. Somehow the movie doesn't manage to convince the audience of its own logic, probably cause there is none. All in all its a fun movie, with great performance by Heath as the joker, however it is not the masterpiece people try to turn it into. It doesn't deserve a place in the top 250, and it is not the best movie of 2008. Of course, if you settle for mediocrity this is the movie for you!
10.0~The Dark Knight: Masterpiece Dillypogo Sign in Permalink Some comic-book film adaptations are brilliantly action-packed and exciting and some are.....well......crap. The Dark Knight most definitely falls into the first of those two. Christian Bale returns as caped crusader Batman, still saving Gotham City from it's villains. But he's soon to meet his match in the form of the insane clown-faced Joker (the late Heath Ledger) who is determined to kill Batman and cause complete chaos in Gotham. The Dark Knight is set to be one of the best comic-book adaptations ever made, maybe even THE best. From the well-shot opening bank robbery scene I knew that this movie was going to be excellent and I was right. Christian Bale, Gary Oldman's and the rest of the cast's performances, although great, are completely and utterly overshadowed by the flawlessly top-notch performance from the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Ledger gives such a brilliant performance that when he went off-screen, I couldn't wait to see him on-screen again. He is without a doubt now my favourite cinema villain due to Ledger's Oscar worthy performance. I found myself laughing at his character's humour several times throughout the film. The film is action-packed and I have to say that the action scenes are exciting and exhilarating. They keep you on the edge of your seat and each action sequence seems to be better than the last one. The scene involving Batman on his Batpod (the bike!) and the Joker in the truck is absolutely outstanding. The only problem I have with The Dark Knight is that I felt it's 2 hours 30 minutes length is a tad too long. Don't get me wrong, it was highly entertaining, but I think it should have been slightly shorter and some people (not me) don't appreciate sitting in a cinema for two and a half hours. The Dark Knight is an action-packed masterpiece. I give it 10/10.
10.0~Astonishing, gripping, epic......everything it should've been vipher20 Sign in Permalink I had to write a review to tag on the later part of this thread cause it was being bombarded with crappy wannabe critics who think a movie has to be an utterly depressing Sundance Film Festival winner to be considered "good". I've seen some people on here saying this movie was too cliché and not real enough. How much more real do you want it, people, without clipping out the gripping action scenes? Christopher Nolan did a PHENOMENAL job of making Batman and Joker as believable as possible. Obviously, there's always going to be a degree of fiction when you're dealing with a guy that dresses up as a bat and parades around the city stopping crime. And the dialogue was perfect. It was believable, yet engrossing. Passionate when it called for it. Silent when need-be. There's a fine line between "cliché" and "profound".....and this movie rides the latter perfectly without ever shifting into the expected on a cliché level. Then there's the other degree of people who think it's not comic-book style enough. Well, there-in lies my point. Nolan had to meet you nit-picky people somewhere in the middle. He had to create a movie that would give you something that you didn't expect, yet not stray to far off blockbuster material. C'mon people.....you have to understand that creating an amazing movie is like creating a great song. You want to write something original that's never been done before, yet if you stray to far off a mainstream sound, you're not going to get much of an audience and it will bomb. If you didn't want to see the movie and had these preconceived notions that the movie was "over-hyped" before you even went into the theater, why the crap even see it? The movie was beautifully crafted from start to finish. Was it more than two hours long?....yes. But if you can't pay attention to an ACTION/SUSPENSE flick for that long, then maybe you should stick to romantic-comedies and Nash Bridges reruns. It wasn't like the third Lord of the Rings long, where they did ending after ending that just drew it out for no reason. If TDK stopped the movie about 20-30 minutes short, then yeah, it couldn't stopped there....but then the same people would have been complaining that the loose ends weren't tied up and you don't know what happens to certain characters. Ledger was perfect. Period. Anyone on here that says he didn't do an amazing job is a friggin snob. Put down your $10 latte and quit acting so self-righteous. Just cause it was a comic-book character doesn't mean it can't be a role worthy of an award, which Ledger is definitely worthy of for his performance. If you think you can pick Heath Ledger peaking out from underneath his character at any second....please point it out. Cause I NEVER once saw Heath Ledger at any instance. I saw the JOKER. It's by far, some of the best acting I've ever seen. And believe me when I say it had nothing to do with him dying in real life. I would've praised Ledger all the same for his performance should he still be alive. The Dark Knight was everything a movie should be. It was a crime movie. A comic-book movie. A suspense-thriller. An action flick. A tragic love story. And the jokers kill-or-be-killed scenarios were reminiscent of the SAW movies (though on a less gruesome scale). How could you possibly ask for better? This movie has every right to push it's way forward and replace Titanic as the number-one grossing movie of all time (which never deserved that privilege in the first place). There's a reason this movie is riding around the top of IMDb's top 250 movies ever (when I posted this, it was actually THE top movie.....above the Godfather.....). It will go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever. My hat is off to Christopher Nolan and his brother for creating the essence of a masterpiece.
3.0~Another ultra violent video game diegorodriguez Sign in Permalink I believe in democracy. Sometimes, I get scared of it. For so many people believing this is the best movie ever, I can only fear something must be wrong. This is just another ultra violent mix of action movies, with all the typical ingredients. You can even watch the hero save his love using his wings! Love triangles, car persecutions, explosions everywhere, and... not to lose its target audience, youth... not a drop of blood can be seen around. Hypocrital enough. So much lack of originality makes the movie so boring that many parents will take a chance on the intermission (maybe the best movie feature) to flee away from the theater. I confess I did. If this is the way things will look in the future for IMDb ratings, pested with promo infected young males looking for the next level in shootings and video game movies, the ratings system will render useless.
2.0~Convoluted plot and lack of humor sinks overlong exercise in self-indulgent nastiness Turfseer Sign in Permalink Unlike their first entry in their Batman series, the Nolan brothers juxtapose their comic book characters against a well-lit Chicago urban backdrop—they seem out of place in the real world and would have been much more at home in a make-believe noirish setting. The opening scene urges us not to take any of the antagonists seriously. As a bank robbery unfolds, the criminals end up double-crossing one another, shooting one another in the back. Only Health Ledger's Joker is left standing, collecting all the proceeds from the robbery. From the outset, the Joker faces no obstacles and appears almost omnipotent. The next thirty minutes consists of a series of very slow-moving expository scenes. There's a clash between mobsters and a few Batman wannabes show up (The leader of the wannabes is later captured by the Joker and in a repugnant scene is tortured in a video clip shown on the evening news). Cut to Bruce Wayne's 'Bat Cave' which looks more like a concrete bunker fitted with large high definition computer screens (so much for the neat old Bat Cave!). Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's affable butler has little to do except impart pithy advice to his boss. Then there's the relationship between DA Harvey Dent and his girlfriend Rachel, who Bruce has an interest in (the love triangle never seems to develop). After Dent invokes RICO laws, the mobsters agree to allow one of their own, Lau, a Chinese Mafia accountant from Hong Kong to hold all their cash outside the US where the DA can't get his hands on it. Wayne then makes his way to Hong Kong where Batman manages to break into Lau's impenetrable skyscraper, kidnap him and return him to the DA where he's placed under arrest. Of course, this sideshow has nothing to do with the main plot which involves the Joker approaching the mobsters and agreeing to take half their cash in exchange for killing Batman. After the bosses refuse to go along with the Joker's proposal, one of the bosses, Gambol, puts a bounty on the Joker's head. The Joker then gains easy entry into Gambol's lair in a body bag, only to jump out and then kill the hapless criminal by slashing his throat with a knife (the point is made that the Joker is a sadist and the Nolans appear to congratulate themselves by emphasizing that fact over and over again without regard for good taste or an economical narrative). The rest of the film's extremely convoluted plot mainly concerns the Joker's efforts to eliminate his nemesis, The Dark Knight. The Joker declares if Batman doesn't reveal his identity, people will die each day until he decides to act. When the Police Commissioner and Judge presiding over the mob trials are assassinated, the public blames Batman. DA Dent concocts a plan to draw the Joker out by claiming that he's The Dark Knight. As Dent is transported in an armored car, the Joker attacks but is captured by Batman aided by Lt. Gordon who is soon promoted to police commissioner as a result of his heroic efforts in capturing the Joker. We never see how it happens but Dent and Rachel disappear and soon turn up as hostages at a warehouse. Batman gets a little rough with the Joker in jail and it's revealed that some corrupt police officials (they seem to be all over the place) were the one's who kidnapped the DA and his girlfriend. It turns out that one of the Joker's associates who he was imprisoned with has a cell phone implanted in his chest (don't know why he wasn't put through a metal detector) and when the phone rings, there's a huge explosion and the Joker and Lau both escape. Batman is able to save the DA but is unable to rescue Rachel. Despite surviving an explosion Dent's face is maimed and now he becomes the second villain of the movie, 'Two Face". The unlikeable Joker proves even less charming when he declares he has no interest in money and torches Lau who is tied up in a warehouse on top of a giant pile of cash. Then in the most ludicrous part of the movie, the Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to take revenge on all the corrupt people responsible for Rachel's death. How the good guy DA could morph into a sinister criminal so easily just proves how silly the whole story is (instead of honoring his girlfriend's memory, he too conveniently becomes a bad guy!). The finale features a bunch of convicts and upstanding citizens held hostage on two separate ferry boats. The boats are rigged with explosives (how did they get on the boats undetected?). Each person on the ferries have the ability to set off the explosions but out of the goodness of everybody's hearts, no one can bring themselves to act. Finally, in the most distasteful scene in the movie, Dent attempts to kill Commissioner Gordon's son by throwing him over the side of a building. The killing of a child is not something that should be shown in a story that's supposedly taken from a comic book. Despite the absurd, overlong plot, The Dark Knight wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers didn't take themselves so seriously. Did they really have to rehash their point ad infinitum—that criminals are sadistic? Somehow a little humor could have humanized all the comic book characters and made the film a lot more enjoyable. Instead, the Dark Knight is an example of lazy screen writing where there is no interest in explaining one implausible event after another.
1.0~warning contains spoilers, OVERHYPE, NON-EVENT zug83 Sign in Permalink How can a film like this be ever compared to a film like the godfather is laughable, i am a big comic book and superhero fan i particularly like this genre but i did not like the way this was handled whatsoever..the following points highlight my case why batman is nothing but a okay film.. 1- CONCEPTION AND CREATION everyone knows that one of the most exciting things about villains is there creation, and how they became they way they are, i believe the original batman films which Tim Burton directed handled this brilliantly, but look at Spiderman 2 which has a great villain. There was no flashback even to the creation of the joker character we must believe he has been there all along, as well as Two Face whos original coming of being i liked better in batman forever, not to say i like tommy lee Jones character portrayal any better than this 1. 2-VIOLENCE this film had left a bitter taste after viewing i am a fan of violent films but it can be seen the way this was edited to ensure the upper catorgory of a pg-13 12a(uk) over here left the film looking a feeling like something was missing. Instead of showing the conseqeunce of for example a bullet in the head the camera would cut away leaving it for the audience imagination, another example of not showing violence and actually changing the tone of the film was robocop the R rated version when compared against the X rated version which seems lighter in tone. 3-BATMAN now Batman played by Bale one of my favourite actors opted for a stupid gruff sounding voice which didn't work, also the suit castes were terrible and i mean truly bad, batmans suit made him look like a more well equipped navy seal or something, not the true mysticism that is batman which is lost in this film. There is no reference to bats whatsoever throughout the duration. Another letdown was the fight sequences which even though Bale did a lot himself did not look smooth, or good on the big screen. 4-PLOT/PACING the plot has to many twists and turns and leaves some of the less cerebral most likely lost(not myself of course). The pacing is bad as there is one key action sequence in the middle of the film which did blow me away but the film never lived up to that particular sequence which is a shame, less morality and preachyness more ACTION! and on that note a spoiler which i do warn before hand, the ending i must say i disliked a lot, for lack of realism, depth and completion as it is left very much open of what happens to the joker character, my 2 cents please reply if you have maybe a differing opinion to mine, Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest comic book translations to films, as in the earlier batmans, (including returns) but this should never be uttered in the same sentence as a film like the Godfather, which i believe to be one of the greatest of all time, the greatest which i do believe is Once upon A time in America.
10.0~By Far now my Favorite Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mithrandir-Olorin1 Sign in Permalink I went in to see this movie with unreasonably High expectations and yet it still massively exceeded them all. Finally a Batman movie that truly felt like a Batman comic came to life on the Big Screen. There are so many details of this film that very specifically reminded me of things form the comics. And Heath Ledger's Joker did no Disappoint the totally should get an Oscar, and everyone else was awesome as well, Bale is definitely the definitive Batman, Eckhart was awesome was Harvey Dent, Oldman really stole the show as Gordon, Cain still rocks as Alfred, and Freeman fantastic too. And Maggie was definitely an Improvement as Rachel. It's 2 and half hours but didn't feel like an Hour everything flew by fast, it was perfectly paced and very tense and suspenseful, the whole films was a wonderful thrill ride. Finally The Joker has been done right as well as the Tragedy of Harvey Dent, and they even showed a side of Batman's character I NEVER expected to see in a live Action Batman movie. The movie definitely gets a 10, anyone who hasn't seen it yet needs to see it now, you will NOT be disappointed.
4.0~a good attempt but no cigar johnmschofield Sign in Permalink I noticed that a film I had not seen was riding high in the IMDb chart and being intrigued I bought my copy of The Dark Knight. I was fairly impressed with the special effects and the acting from the cast was good and it was clear that a certain amount of care, effort and attention had been put into the films production. Ultimately though I felt as if it was a case of a fairly good attempt but no cigar. The film could have been a classic but it simply isn't good enough. Personally I was glad I had watched it but will not be rushing to watch it again and its current position in the IMDb chart is way above where it should be. It is also clear that the film has numerous enthusiastic supporters and having watched the film I can see why. I think there are a lot of people out there who have got carried away with all the hype, marketing and advertising and also I think it may be a case of its cool to say how good it is and agree with the majority. Lets just see in say five years where this film figures in the various charts that are out there. This film is not bad but its not very good either. I am not in the slightest bit bothered about swimming against the tide where this film or any other film is concerned, if its not very good I will say so but what the hey as I have said before opinion is all and I would recommend that anybody watch it at least once.
10.0~Why I love movies, and how The Dark Knight brought that love back full force Bokili Sign in Permalink I can't remember there has been such a complete movie on Hollywood's A-List for awhile now, and I can't remember when was the last time I saw a movie that I wanted to see over and over and over again and still come back one more time. I thought I was crazy but then all of my friends and family who saw it said the same thing, and I'm talking very different people in every aspect - age, gender, taste in movies, professional/amateur background in history of movies - but all with one thing in common: Adoring Love For That One Beautifully Told Silver Screen Story. And if you add absolute perfection in casting story's key characters and exceptional music score, in my opinion, you'll get The Dark Knight. Of course The Story is what makes me so especially enchanted with this movie and I'm sure many things have been told/written about the storyline and its perceived actuality. For some that's precisely why they don't appreciate The Dark Knight so much, but that's why I would applaud it. The dialogs expressing characters minds and souls feel real, the fear and the excitement feels real, the rage and revenge feels real, luring wish for (at least temporary) unleashed chaos sure as hell feels real, and all those real feelings you've experienced during 150 min can't be denied. I loved the fact that I almost completely overlooked comic-book side of characters (Anti-Hero Dressed As A Bat, Villain With A Make-up Problem, Hero Turned Two-Face Crazed Vigilante etc.) and totally bought their stories. Every part of the story is on verge of unbelievable yet completely logical and understandable, and in that duality lies the perfection. That's our world as I see it. There is no pathos as so often happens with movies with big pretensions, only understanding and feeling that everybody have done what they were meant to do - and done that with some truly magnificent vigour. I am not sure who would be mostly responsible for this experience, so I'll just thank everybody who participated in making truly The Best Movie of 2008 (and in my list one of the best ever)
3.0~Chaotic and unlogic vandemaelekurt Sign in Permalink What is this? I can't explain all the enthusiasm for this movie as anything else than necrophilia. Let people die and suddenly everything they do is great. And indeed, Heath Ledger is great in this film. But he's the only one. And lucky for him he's good. Because he has done his share of bad acting in the past. Though I must say he was improving quickly in recent years. I loved him in the Bob Dylan-movie. I hated him in 'Brokeback Mountain'. His performance was too much of a performance there, a number of tics and tricks. Christian Bale is awful here. He looks, acts and walks in and through this movie as if he's the same character from 'American Psycho'. His character is a sleazy bastard, who thinks his money and his own vision is enough to save the world. The arrogance of the character is highly disturbing. And what is the character of Maggie Gyllenhaal doing in this movie. She's a silly women running after the wrong men and paying her life because of her bad taste in men. And are we supposed to cheer for Harvey Dent until he shows his true face? What an asshole. Is this one of these disastermovies which want to warn us for the disastrous future we're heading to? It's so sad to see all these positive reactions. Who are you people? Don't you see the aggression? And are you that silly to accept all the lack of logic. On the one hand this film want to be realistic and dark, over the top dark yes, but still... But then on the other hand it forgets all logic and reality whenever the screenwriters feel they have no logic explanation to give. How some characters suddenly survive when everything is burning and exploding, I don't know. And the whole movie we're after the Joker, but when they finally get hold of him, we don't get to know what is happening with him. I am a huge fan of 'Memento' and I also thought 'Insomnia' was a great and clever full. But as clever as the former films of Nolan were, as stupid is this one.
10.0~The Dark Night - this movie will be hard to top sadie3034 Sign in Permalink I was entranced by this film and all the actors/characters...it is truly a masterpiece. I was very impressed by Christian Bale's batman; he really made batman a "real" man with deep levels of personality and conflicts of his own, and especially since he was not perfect as depicted in other batman films. It does not hurt that he is super good-looking either. Now for Heath Ledger as the Joker...yikes, he was very disturbing, because not only is he viciously evil, but he enjoys it....the joker is twisted beyond repair and severely clever using his powers to warp people into following his lead and become evil themselves before they can realize it. The joker unnerved me tremendously - I was more afraid of him than that chainsaw guy, because he was so fearless himself there would be no way to predict his next move. Heath Ledger was a pretty fearless actor too in order to open himself up to such a level of evil...to give such control over to it....I've never seen an actor "go that far" yet. All in all the story is mesmerizing and I would see it again & again as there are plenty of clues to the nature of everyday humans reflecting back at us. One of my favorite lines is when batman says "you were so good, that he needed to know if you could fall". It hit me like a ton of bricks, because sometimes the best of people are attacked by evil so much that they wonder why, and I got it - evil only focuses on the good in order to destroy it. I have to see the movie again in order to get more information and it seems there is something for everyone to learn here - you have to see it yourself. I loved it for many reasons.
10.0~Undescribable Perfection yarden-malka14 Sign in Permalink Let's open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like "Batman Begins" expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be "152 minutes of pure awesomeness." Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isn't happy, but it's flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batman's loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batman's arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledger's acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and that's why it was so good. It's simply impossible to describe him: he's bold, insane, smart, twisted and he's so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I haven't mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing "Batman Begins" will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Face's appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action.
1.0~disliked this movie aiscoff Sign in Permalink Against all that has been said in praise of this movie I just hated it. Can't we get back to real movies without all the special effects? I walked out before it ended and can't think of anything I really liked. How could anyone suggest Heath Ledger could get an Oscar for his performance with his face covered in make up, he went through the complete movie with one expression.It is a very dark movie in all senses of the word with little humour and a boring and predictable storyline.The same thing has happened to the new Bond movies, ruined by special effects and a desperate desire to look modern, much of the humour has disappeared, Romance is hardly there, not surprising as the females spend much of the time doing Kung Foo or shooting off guns!As for the music well all I can say is that it is tuneless, which should make it to the top of the charts!
10.0~Batman at his best and beyond springsunnywinter Sign in Permalink Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to "confront everything he believes" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes. There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen.
10.0~A masterpiece - Likely to constitute a serious indictment on the Oscar system... vinnie_vegas69 Sign in Permalink First things first. This film is not a comic book movie. It is not an action movie. To reduce it to these archetypes would be completely unfair. To fairly represent this movie it must be seen for what it is - It is a dramatic suspense film that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the surprisingly long running time (surprising in that it goes by so fast, and also that the studio allowed Christoper Nolan to cut it this long) Batman Begins was seen by most to be a triumph in the comic adaptation genre. However, it did remain a comic adaptation in many ways. The Dark Knight goes beyond that. This film blows suspense up to a city-wide level, and raises the stakes to a breathtaking level. It recalls the suspenseful nature of films by the likes of David Fincher, Ridley Scott, and even the master, Alfred Hitchcock. It's crafted in such a way that each action seems both inevitable and unbelievable, and so even for fans of the comic book who believe they know where it is going, it is an astounding achievement. The film looks spectacular, thanks to Nolan's regular cinematographer Wally Pfister. Gotham city looks brighter, yet more ominous during the day, and danker and more dangerous at night. The performances are as spectacular as many had expected and/or hoped. Bale returns in fine form as the titular character, and can't be faulted too much. Eckhart debuts as District Attorney Harvey Dent, and the storyline effectively revolves around him and his war on organised crime in Gotham. There are fine supporting performances from the returning Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, as well as the newcomers Eric Roberts, Nestor Carbonell and Maggie Gyllenhaal (who thankfully takes over from Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes). However, if the action centres on Harvey Dent, then the action IS Heath Ledger's performance as the maniacal Joker. In one of the finest film performances of the last decade, Ledger puts in what will end up being an unforgettable final (complete) performance that will have almost everyone buzzing about a potential posthumous Academy Award. I cannot reiterate enough - Not only is this film excellent, and highly enjoyable to watch, but it is of such a fine quality that it should really transcend the typical box created for films that are deemed to not contain the correct "subject matter". Much in the way Rocky transcended the typical "sports movie", so this transcends the typical "comic book movie" - It is much more than that, and should legitimately be considered come Oscar season. If this movie cannot earn some consideration by the Academy, they might as well come out and call them the Academy Awards for slow-paced, moody dramas, because this is the best film I have seen in a long time, and that's including the crop that were nominated for best picture last year. In short, go see this movie. If you, or your friends, or anyone you know has been excited about this movie to come out, then just know that everything that they were excited for is justified. Go see it - You'll enjoy it, because it's terrific. There's not much more to say.
10.0~Unexpected and amazing hapiores Sign in Permalink After Spiderman's debut super heroes' movies have reached higher and higher, leaving the childish tone for which they were known throughout the 80's/mid 90's, to become complex productions, in a path similar to that followed by the comic books from the early 80's on, giving a depth to the stories and characters until then unknown. Batman the Beginning followed this trend and was already a well balanced picture, rooted in a sense of reality that made it distinct from it's contemporaries. The Dark Knight is one step beyond. Continuing the saga of Gotham's most known hero, The Dark Knight begins where it's predecessor had left: by now both Batman and Bruce Wayne know exactly what role they must play and the movie opens in full speed, with an intricate fast tempo, showing all the characters and building the plot from the very first frame. In the end it's simply impressive, the sheer sense of completion the movie has - something that puts it miles away from it's predecessor - which is partly explained because of the great script (the brothers have proved to be an excellent team in past movies: Memento, The Prestige) and the methodical shooting C. Nolan uses.The way the characters move in a perfectly real emotional landscape gives them an unexpected depth, from Batman to the Two Face, or - obviously - the Joker. Heath Ledger is perfect in the role of Joker and the character becomes simply daunting, the first time ever that the joker is not a silly sociopath, but a truly dangerous man, devious in everything he does and yet brilliant in his own game: the fact that he chose Harvey Dent to go after is the best example of his meticulousness; and he wins (remember that it was his intension to swap the addresses of Harvey and Rachel).
2.0~Don't GO!! momideerest Sign in Permalink I feel sorry for Heath. He has always been interesting and brings a light to the screen. Like Brandon Lee in The Crow, his horrible legacy is to be remembered as an evil, lisping, greasy villain in this uninteresting, worthless film. What a waste. What a waste of time, What a waste of money, what a waste of talent. Don't waste your time. Remember Heath Ledger for the excellent parts he has played in other films, and don't be taken in by the hype and shameless promotion of this actor's untimely death. The length of the film is obnoxious- the story could have been told in one third of the time. I just kept waiting for it to end.
4.0~Really doesn't know what it wants to be....... diurnalemissions Sign in Permalink Being a Libertarian wherein one debates the proper time and place for Force, dismayed at the level of government interference in people's lives, but also willing to do what is necessary to survive through defensive forms of Force, this movie does provide fodder for thought. Also, as a believer to some degree in the theories of French Absurdism as an avenue to proto-nihilistic philosophies I can perhaps understand that real life does not some up to an easily digestible whole, but a movie that is primarily entertainment should take you to some endpoint intellectually. Does the prior paragraph make much sense? To initiates, it probably does, for people looking for some action and a bag of popcorn maybe not. And that's the problem for TDK for me. It purports to be one thing, executes something much different, and become unsatisfying as either. If I'm in the mood for a shoot'em up popcorn movie, I'd like a little complexity, sure, but I want the good guys to be good guys and bad guys dead. If I'm looking for a treatise on the absurdity of life and also how man wrapped up in fear, real or imagined, will resort to all sorts of Force that is misplaced and misused, I'll watch something else. I can even at least see a movie that leaves you hanging quite a bit as the use of Art to prove a point, not only as the message but the medium as well. But I certainly don't want an examination of existentialism bound up with my popcorn movie. It just ends being a waste of two and half hours. Basically TDK can't be both a pleasant diversion and a deep philosophical movie about the death penalty, righteous Force, blind fear of the masses, thugacracy, and even more. A movie that has fast action fight scenes, with breaking bones and baddies being dumped over railings to some unknown end, a movie that maintains its limited view of action and consequence (like these baddies being taken off to a hospital for care or some such instead of being simply gone) and yet be a piece to evoke philosophical debate. Basically it can't have its cake and eat it too. The movie basically creates a character of pure nihilism in the Joker and then doesn't know what to do with it. What point is trying to be made? It almost seems the creative team didn't know either, or nothing they'd admit to. So I don't mind being philosophically open ended, but such doesn't in any way make for a satisfying action movie. And yet it still pandered to the action movie template far too often to believe that it was a serious philosophical movie. Basically it was a mess that more or less wasted two and a half hours.
7.0~Not as good as "The Dark Whopper" tastyhotdogs Sign in Permalink So Dean and I headed to Forest Hill Weds night to watch "The Dark Knight". Here's my controversial review. I'd been waiting to see this for a while, mostly because of how good "Batman Begins" was but also because of the rave reviews of Heath Ledger's performance, apparently his best since "10 Things I Hate About You". Went in expecting a truly classic cinematic performance...and i gotta say i was disappointed. The film starts out with a gripping bank robbery, done by some blokes in Joker masks. I got all excited when i saw William Fichtner as the bank manager who looked like he was going to foil the robbery, but alas his impact was minimal and he was soon dead. After his performance in "Go", he shouldn't be taking crummy roles like that. Anyway we're soon shown the power and craziness of the Joker and his desire to be Gotham's master criminal. Yep, the Joker is chilling but in what will be an unpopular opinion, I reckon you could have put Screech from "Saved By The Bell" in that make up, with those lines, and be about 80% as terrified. We're then introduced to Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, in his best role since "Double Jeopardy") , the District Attorney with no fear and free from any ounce of corruption and Gordon (Gary Oldman, in his finest role since "Air Force One"), the squeaky clean cop who is hell-bent on bringing down the city's crime. The Joker realises he must take down Dent,Gordon, as well as Batman to take the city over and hatches a brilliant plan to do so. Will he succeed? See it to find out. Now it was an OK movie, but way way over-hyped eg it's listed as No.3 on IMDb.com's all time best movie list. That puts it ahead of some pretty well known and respected movies ie Pulp Fiction, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Psycho and Taxi Driver just to name a few. I thought it was a decent script, with an excellent cast, but the film just got to clever for itself at times, or at least for a Batman movie. Having said that I missed one or two key moments of the movie, probably due to agitation more than anything else ie that Gordon was driving the van with Dent in the back. I just thought it was weird that the driver wasn't talking and must have been a baddie. It was way too long, at least by 30mins and didn't have enough Bruce Wayne time. Solid, but I still prefer Batman Begins. Some will love it, some may think it was a tad overdone. FInally, ledger's performance was good but let's not get carried away and put it up with DeNiro as Travis Bickle, Al Pacino as "Scarface", Anthony Hopkins as "Hannibal" or Keanu Reeves as "Johnny Utah".
7.0~Gotham City now Cliché City Troubleboy Sign in Permalink I've seen this movie once, but I've seen its make-up a hundred times elsewhere; Fox and Alfred introducing Batman to new gadgets in James Bond; 'unstoppable force meeting immovable object' (haven't heard that before); semi-trailers and high speed car chases through big city underpasses (that's creative, which 'Die Hard' or 'Terminator' did they clip that from); high-flying cable wiring and and bombs on hostages (how unique), my home town of Hong Kong in the story line (every second action film does that now); and, Joker standing down Batman in the street (seen that before in the first Batman!). And, as for the pre-Oscar chat for Heath Ledger; well, any reasonable actor can play a half-baked idiot, just ask Tom Hanks (Gump) and Russell Crowe (Beautiful Mind). Nicholson was head and shoulders a better Joker; as was Tommy Lee (Two-Face). This movie will set box office record from now until doomsday; my burning question is why? It's not that good and its all been done before.
10.0~Great! Mike-supr Sign in Permalink Finally I have seen it! I have read many good critiques and many excited comments. And they all are right!For me this is the best film of this year. Great actors like Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine. Excellent is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. And of course Heath Ledger. When you see Joker on the screen, you do not watch an actor Ledge, you see living Joker, the real being. Atmosphere is built and it is cold and dark. Ledger created amazing role. There are opinions, he should get Oscar for this figure. And I say: Give it to him! He earned it! Since now Joker is my most favorite villain. Harvey Dent is very likable and you want to cheer for him and you now, what happens to him a it makes you sad! Great movie! "Why so serious?"
5.0~Not really what people expected... ttasi86 Sign in Permalink I have to say the hype about this movie was much bigger than it should have been. I found it quite confusing that the story was quite hard to follow and the cutting was not good at all in my opinion. Christian Bale didn't deliver again, for me he doesn't seem like a good actor at all, you can actually see that he's just trying to act in most of his scenes, nothing original there, he's just saying the lines he has to say. Almost no emotions at all. And it was quite funny how drastically his voice changed when dressed as Batman, it was ridiculous. The only thing (the only person) who saved this movie in my opinion was Heath Ledger, his performance was quite good, he was intense, you really felt entertained when he stepped on the scene. Watching him play as the Joker was the only good part of this movie in my opinion. he actually sort of waked me up when he appeared, those where the only parts of the movie when everybody was strictly paying attention to what was happening. And I don't really know why didn't they stick with Katie Holmes as Rachel, Maggie Gyllenhaal to me wasn't pretty at all, and she's not as good as Katie anyway... That was so disappointing for me. To sum up things, there were couple of good scenes in the movie, but it was too long. And if you feel like the movie is too long, that means the viewer loses interest in the story while watching, well that's what happened to most of the viewers in the cinema as far as I saw it. The flow of the movie was also not really good, it was hard to stay focused what was exactly happening in some scenes and why was it happening that way. Even Batman Begins was better than this movie...
4.0~Best film ever? You must be batty! Doctor_Mongoose Sign in Permalink Obviously Christopher Nolan was trying to touch on one of the prominent issues of recent times. That of the environment. He did this by recycling tired old jokes and set pieces from many action films before, and the rest of the plot was salvaged from toilets and rubbish bins. He also comes up with the perfect formula to make a profound sentence, by taking two words that mean complete opposites and shoving them together. Joking aside, after almost nodding off for the first hour and a half the second half of the movie actually was pretty good, albeit drawn out until the ending which was very frustrating. They literally left the joker hanging while dealing with the completely pointless and irrational side-story of two-face. I'd have thought that a man of dent's resolve would have been made stronger by the events that took place, to get back at the joker and stop such events from happening to other people, instead of deteriorating into the monster of similar calibre to the joker. I really don't think the film got the best out of the actors involved, probably due to the script. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, but he is completely wasted as batman where he spends most of his time jumping about in a bat-suit using a silly voice, instead of displaying his incredible character acting skills in movies such as American Psycho and the Machinist. Heath Ledger's performance was the only real solid one in the entire cast, however at plenty of times he guilty of completely over-acting. His introduction to the members of the mob was farcical and the laughter in the cinemas was due to the awkwardness and stupidity of the situation. The main reason I think the film totally fails is Christopher Nolans approach of trying to make the film really realistic with an explanation for everything. A man running around in a bat costume and a man dressed up in clown make-up is just to surreal to try and be addressed in this manner. This is why I think the original Batman is a lot better because it didn't try to be ultra-realistic and took the comics and had a fairly serious tone with a very comedic undercurrent. Christopher Nolan undoubtedly has talent as a director, memento, the prestige and even insomnia are all great films but I feel his attempts at the batman franchise are far outshone by Tim Burton. Obviously the film is already a hit and there is nothing anyone can write to stop it from being so, however I must implore you to actually watch the film critically and realise its shortcomings, than get swept away in the hype.
5.0~Sadly Disappointing. harborrat28 Sign in Permalink Heath Ledger and the FX for the first hour were the only redeeming things about this movie. Ledger certainly deserves an Oscar for this film, not because he's dead but because he was amazing as the Joker. His performance as the essence of deranged evil, he was astounding, this despite the fact that the writer had him pontificating on the nature of man and chaos theory. It was the physical performance that was extraordinary. The scene of the Joker prancing around in the nurse's uniform was surreal and hysterical at the same time (but maybe that's part of surrealism. Once the movie reached a point where it seemed to be repeating special effects just to do so, it lost me. It was WAY too long, repetitive & pseudo-intellectual.
10.0~Definitively THE best Batman Movie Ever Made. Definitely Oscar Worthy!!! voicemaster71 Sign in Permalink And I thought Batman Begins was the best. It is rare that a sequel or follow up movie is better than its predecessor. But Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale have pulled it off. I've never before attended a midnight sneak showing of a movie, but when I read that it was an anticipated sellout, I decided not to wait until opening day. Good thing too. The Dark Knight is a true masterpiece. It is not only the best comic book adapted movie. It is not only the best crime drama movie. It is not only the best psychodrama movie. It is not only the best Batman movie. IT IS ALL THESE CATEGORIES ALTOGETHER!! I am personally convinced that the Dark Knight surpasses any comic book movie ever made in its history. The entire cast gave stand alone performances in their perspective roles. The cinematography was superb and you can't beat the musical score composed by the same two geniuses who scored Batman Begins. Unlike the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher movies, Gotham City looks like a real city, especially since they filmed in Chicago. Burton's Gotham looked too dark Beetejuice Edward Scissorhands fantasy and Schumacher's Gotham looked too neon gay. Gotham City needs to look real and not like some fantasy set and Nolan pulled it off! Christian Bale really pulls off both sides of the cowl as Batman and Bruce Wayne. It's great to see Michael Caine, Gary Oldsman, and Morgan Freeman back in their roles as Alfred, Gordon, and Lucius Fox. The best casting choice they made was casting Maggie Gyllenhal as Rachel Dawes since I felt she was more believable in the role than Katie Holmes ever was. When I saw Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, I realized that I saw him in a movie called Thank You for Smoking. The studio did wise not to reveal his appearance as Two Face. As to how, when, and where it happens, you will just have to see the movie for yourself. Thank you WB for keeping the secret guarded. But Eckhart really executes the role of the White Knight who eventually falls. Now saving the best for last. The late great Heath Ledger. While I was not really familiar with his work, he really and truly stole the show as the Joker and he did it without upstaging Batman like what happened in the Keaton/Nicholson movie. Ledger really vanished into the role of the Joker. He literally lived and breathed the part and his Joker is more of a frightening, terrorizing menace than any of the past incarnations. And he lives by no rules whatsoever. Now don't get me wrong. Caesar Romero will be remembered for the camp version, Jack Nicholson has the best Joker look and played the comical killer and Mark Hammill gave the best standout performance as the voice of the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series. But Heath Ledger's Joker will make you either forget the other versions or at least make you put the others on the back burner. In my personal opinion, Heath Ledger truly deserves the honor of a posthumous Oscar Nomination. Whether or not there is a third Batman movie done by Nolan and Bale is neutral for me. I would certainly enjoy it and I hope it eventually happens, but at the same time, I feel this is the best and I would hate to see a lesser quality movie to follow this one. Any future Batman movies, whether they bring in Robin, The Penguin, Catwoman, or any number of other villains, other heroes or supportive players should be done by another director and starring actor who will continue the franchise in the Nolan/Bale style. While I love both Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk both, I am convinced the Dark Knight is bar none THE BEST SUPER HERO MOVIE OF 2008 IF NOT EVER MADE!!! Perfect!! Two Thumbs Up!!!
10.0~not just the best batman movie,the best movie ever lavigne123 Sign in Permalink i saw this movie twice and the second time was as exciting as the first.batman begins was my favorite movie before this and then the dark knight just blew that out of the water.this is the most realistic comic book adaptation ever made.christopher nolan did another great job.this is definitely his best film and that is saying something cuz his past films are hard to beat.i like the fact that he used cgi as little as possible.this movie had some kick ass stunts.Christian bale did an astonishing job portraying bruce wayne/batman.if there was any doubt in batman begins,now we can say that Christian bale is the best batman ever.and now heath ledger.he will be unforgettable in his joker role.jack nicholson was awful in his joker role compared to heath ledger's.i will be disappointed if he doesn't at least get nominated for an Oscar.all in all,this is an instant classic.the best movie ever made in my opinion.is has all what u want in a movie:action,suspense,thriller,love,and adventure.THE BEST MOVIE EVER.
3.0~Bored of loving Batmans movies! Sakab Sign in Permalink The marketing worked well enough for this Batman. The viewers were convinced that they will see the greatest movie of all times. Ha! I'm not being surprised. Its Heath Ledgers death that helped to that kind of placebo. I deeply want to believe that those deifying ratings of imdbs commentators was only a short of homage to that admittedly great actor. I can understand that. But only that. Come on guys! Look into your mirror and ask yourself loudly "was this the greatest movie i ever seen?". It was just another Batman's movie and in my personal opinion a bad one. I spend 2 hours and a half of my life to see that crap and I'm trying to understand why all this enthusiasm? First of all the batman's voice turned the whole movie into a comedy. OK batman have to use another voice so they cannot recognize him. Nolan wanted a realism. Where is the realism when a little truck catches up and destroys the police's convoy, when only a policeman stays into the inquisitive room to watch over Joker, when Joker gets like he was invisible into a hospital where Dent's in there, when Dent shoots the car driver and the car capsizes but Dents gets out in full health and many other unrealistic things you can detect to the movie. From now on I'm not gonna trust again the ratings of imdbs users. The level went dangerously down. They put a second-rate movie upwards of masterpieces like like Pulp Fiction, Clockwork Orange, Taxi Driver. That's a shame. p.s.: Why an actor like Michael Cain prefers to play in such roles man? He needs so desperately money? What the hell? I will give him my credit card. Qualitative cinema needs him most.
10.0~A commentary on the inside of the movie -Batman The dark Knight samlamdevil Sign in Permalink When I walked into the movie theatre and saw the movie -The dark Knight, I was knocked speechless by the accuracy and the ferocity in the movie. The movie is a phenomenal film featuring some of the best graphical sensations in the world and also the devastating recreation of characters. The characters in this new movie of batman recall greatly to the original DC comic, they all resembled in some or all ways to the original concept of the Batman superhero. This as a movie that has a superhero that has "no special powers", Christopher captured the catch of the personalities precisely. The men in the movie are presented in a grim and eye-renting way(even batman and Harvey), it re-makes the sensation of the changes and alteration to the characteristics of the characters. The movie contains multiple scenes of gargantuan scale conflict, greatly re-knitting the feel of the grand scale of Joker's plan. A Story is not a good one unless it has the three great conquest of life : Love, power and truth. The movie Batman- The Dark Knight captured the turn and twist of all three great. On specific notes of the characters , the Joker is the by far the most interesting and outstanding one. He dresses in exactly different manner compare to Batman (batman wears all black and joker wears a purple jacket and colorful make-ups). He is completely nut in the squeal which is a fairly big contrast to the last squeal made about Joker. He claims himself to be a "mad dog chasing a car" in the movie, that "he would not know what to do when he catches the car", and yet, he rescued "Lao" the mob billionaire, and later on burns the money. He is frivolous, well-tempered(strangely) and terribly unpredictable. He strikes when you are most unexpected. In this squeal, the joker wanted desperately to prove that all man will be as savage as him when they are about to die, he once said in the film , " you know why I use knifes, because guns are too quick, you never get anything out of it. But knifes, you can see who a person really is before they die." He wanted to show the world that even man like Harvy Dent, the White Knight(which is a contrast to batman as the dark knight), can be corrupted and be driven into madness and blind justice. Batman as the major protagonist, resembled greatly to the previous batman except a lot more mature and yet more uncanny is his sense of authority and skill. He was more well equipped and scary. And most importantly, he has the mind of a criminal, that's one reason that he can put an end to joker, since joker is definitely not a guy that plays by the rules. This batman is a lot more bewildered in his mission to save Gothem and yet more convinced that "the day that Gothem will not need Batman" will come soon. In the movie, Alfred is more than just a house keeper but more of a adviser which is quiet a change from the original DC comic. Bruce is shown multiple times in the movie in his torn relationship between being Batman and Wane the billionaire. He began to seen his limitation as both batman and Bruce wane. With all that said, I conclude by saying again, a great movie, enormous success, and really deserves to see it in theatre. -Written in contribution to Heath Ledger and a great thanks to Christopher
10.0~A true Masterpiece emirdumani Sign in Permalink There are movies that everyone should see... like Shawshank Redemption, the Matrix...or the Lotr: Return of the King...having watched all previous Batman movies i couldn't say it for any of them...(yes even Batman:Begins) but Dark Knight has changed it. It took a superhero, who was the only serious thing in its universe and recreated that universe to fit the superhero...it began with the Begins...but i thinks it is safe to say that no one expected the change to be this swift... Christopher Nolan is a true genius for creating a Batman that everyone could like and a movie that everyone should watch. Finally i would like to add that acting on this movie was absolutely delicious...Morgan Freeman and Micheal Caine are true masters...but Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and especially Heath Leadger who ironically and unfortunately gave the performance of his life and passed away before he could get the praises he deserved was also tremendous. My only regret is not being able to give this movie an eleven out of ten...definitely a true Masterpiece
6.0~Background Sound Editing mushfiquelegacy Sign in Permalink When I started watch this movie... slowly slowly i realized that the background sound is the properly matched to the history and playing roles and fantastic sound theme and editing/mixing as I expected... and other things that the jokers character is really joss and dialogs of the joker 'whatever doesn't kill you...' is fantastic bat man's getup and play is quite improve than older but i think batman's motor bikes's design is not properly fit to that character, is something massive ... it should be thinner . the film is quit impressive and well completed to all specially the joker and the character of the batman to main character and the director....thank u
9.0~Joker darker than the Dark Knight kemboja Sign in Permalink I thought I would be disappointed after all the hype that surrounded the movie but I was glad that I was wrong. This movie rocks and by far the best movie in 2008. And I thought that Batman Begins was difficult to top! Heath Ledger gave the performance of his life. You really have to give credit to the man; he did came a long way from A Knight's Tale and 10 Things. His Joker was discomfiting, psychotic and confirms my suspicions about clowns! With his passing, it up the spooky scale a few notches. He held his own against the big wigs - well, I think he even surpassed a few of them. He has the best one-liners too! His lines spoke of chaos, death or the lack thereof. Art imitating life or vice versa. One wonders if he took his character a tad too far. To sum it all up, The Dark Knight has twists at every turn, exciting batmobile chases, cool new gadgets (and suit!), stellar performances, tight plots and witty script. This made for a very good summer movie. Go watch it or you'll be the last not to. And parting in the Joker's (now famous) line - "Why so serious?"
4.0~just read. thrashed1984 Sign in Permalink Well I had anticipated that it would be something like this, with all the hype about this movie. I gotta give one thing to them though, it was well commercialized, which is probably one of the causes for it's super god status. Now going into the movie, the first flaw that caught my eye, the most, was during the first 10 min of the movie when Batman takes a hard bang on a concrete wall trying to climb a van and then the dog bites he gets. Both of which were shown later in a scene where Bruce is stitching and mending his wounds. Now fast forward to the part where the Joker drops Rachel from a skyscraper and Batman plunges like he was Superman, both take a fall on a car and both are absolutely fine?! Come ON ! at least put some rope action or something, also why doesn't Batman go back to the top floor where all the guests are left with the "deranged" Joker? Or is it that Joker just said "oh Batman is gone the scene is over I should leave too?" ridiculous! So i relentlessly made myself forget all that , but then i realized that Nolan and Ledger were both too busy trying to darken the joker character to a point where they forgot that the movie is a batman movie and Alfred is a lot more important in his life than a butler. and that because it is a batman movie there should have been glimpses of Batman's dead parents, well at least once cause that is the reason he is Batman/ the dark knight. Adding more fuel to fire where was his bat-craft ? when he went to Hong Kong to kidnap the mob boss , why would he spend billions on a cargo plane and not on his own bat-craft, I failed to see the logic - cargo planes are slower and easily traceable where as the bat-craft is fast and can beat radars. I would call this missed opportunity for the movie. And then came the sonar phone thing now Batman said that the technology allowed them to monitor 2 or 3 million phones, does Nolan know how big a server you would require to do that? Given that you had access to all security protocols from alien ware. Instead they stuck in about 600 little LCD screens and 4 or 5 servers. in my opinion lame. Now comes the joker character : 1. he should have laughed hysterically all the time, if ledger had managed to do that, then it would have been perfect. he basically missed the craziness of the real joker. 2. Joker does not go around telling people how he got the scar . but it is true that he makes up a different story each time he says it, but this is when he is asked about it, he doesn't advertise it! even if i take it for what they did in the movie i think it was way overdone, joker seemed like a Joker merchandise salesman to attract kids buying the new joker t-shirts "Why so Serious?" and crap and by God it has worked, but that is not what makes great movies. Now few things they did get right : joker and batman confrontation at the precinct that was the best scene of the whole movie, joker's dialogue was straight from the comic books, but again minus the laughter. Gordon's character, as in his importance in Gotham was well portrayed although, it was very rushed. - forgivable.. Harvey Dent was good but two face lacked the intensity. over all i would say the movie wasn't made for the Batman comic fans but more for the people who like blockbusters. You should watch it cause its fun to watch and you will realize all the opportunities it had to make it an actual masterpiece in the comic book movie adaptation genre. Now looking forward to watchmen, superman: man of steel and the next Batman which could be Arkham Asylum !
1.0~ridiculous rating romboutroemer Sign in Permalink Another example of an over-hyped movie, but now in extreme. To say this piece of junk should be regarded as the best movie of 2008 is ridiculous. Basicaly it is just another movie about a man in a bat-suit who duels for more than 2 hours with another badman with a painted smile, and in the process some quasi profound remarks are exchanged. No humor in sight to make the movie better digestible. Big budget, good actors and some clever make-up artists are no guarantee for a good movie. In this case it resulted in a very boring one. As for the so-called performance of the year by Ledger; he is (was) a very good actor but this one-dimensional role is far from being special, but I guess the Oscar will be his, Nil nisi bonum. Why this movie should be on par with, or far better than true masterpieces like the Godfather 1&2 and Vertigo is beyond belief.
10.0~Mind Blowing nowego Sign in Permalink I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see. The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005. Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic. I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion. If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now. You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it. One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10.
10.0~On of the best Superhero film noriega0706 Sign in Permalink It was a wonderful experience to watch Heath Ledger's Final performance on the big screen. The film was fantastic along with the film techniques shown (especially the interrogation scene). The film itself is an is an extraordinary experience. It will keep you glued to your seat as you take in what Nolan had to offer it's audience. All the actors especially Heath Ledger as the Joker are an unforgettable. I am pretty sure the rest that going to view the film or have already seen it will agree. Although not a masterpiece, it belongs to be with the best films in history. I'd be shocked if Heath is not nominated for an Oscar, or any other film related Oscars such as Sound or Cimenitography, this film is a well notable film to be considered an Epic
3.0~A Major Disappointment pninson Sign in Permalink This movie was so wildly praised by critics and fans alike that it was hard not to have somewhat diminished expectations. It can't be *that* great, right? Right. I can't say this is a bad movie, just not a very interesting one. It begins promisingly with a superbly executed set piece, with the Joker staging a daring bank robbery. This is a very nicely done action sequence, and Heath Ledger's Joker does indeed live up to the hype. It's a genuinely strange characterization, and the story built around it should work. After that, the movie starts to drag. There are far too many long, talky sequences, followed by the usual slam-bang action scenes that are shot from a distance so you can't see what's really going on. What's really missing from the action is any sense of a story; there's just more of the same that you usually see in a superhero picture. Been there, done that. Another fatal mistake is one that happens far too often: too many villains. This was a major problem with the 90s Batman films: you have to squeeze the Penguin and Catwoman and Christopher Walken into one film, with no time left for anything like character development. In this movie, the focus is on the Joker, but that's not enough: we have Two-Face into the mix (who only becomes Two-Face at the two-hour mark, leaving only a short time for him to be dispatched by our hero). Two-Face was my favorite of the old Batman Rogues Gallery, and he deserved a story all his own. Throwing him in as an afterthought to the Joker (particularly when Ledger's scenery chewing overshadows everything else in the picture, including Batman) both makes the film far too long, and blunts its impact. Lost somewhere in all this is Batman, who almost seems absent from the picture. Although he has to make a tragic choice, there seems to be no character development, and Bale's performance is practically phoned in. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman contribute their customary gravitas, but again this just adds to the extreme length of the picture. Batman Begins was a strong picture, and I'm puzzled as to what I'm missing here. I saw this on Blu-Ray and found myself reaching for the remote every ten minutes or so, to see how much longer I was going to have to watch this. I finally hit Stop by accident at 2 hrs., but decided to just let it go. This movie failed to engage my interest on any level and I just wanted it to end.
6.0~...I didn't actually like it. Yeah, I know. sancorana Sign in Permalink Okay, so please don't immediately want to kill me for not liking this movie. And first, let me say that I thought that it was magnificently acted across the board, and that there were really excellent things about it. I understand why everyone likes it so much. But it just wasn't my cup of tea...as for why, I attempt to explain...and yes, THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE!!! While I may be alone in this, I wanted...how to put this...a more traditional superhero movie. I wanted the superhero to get the girl and defeat the villain. And honestly...in The Dark Knight, the girl died, and the villain won, basically. Which was kind of a downer, really. Also, I felt that it was a little jam-packed. With the whole fraudulent money thing, plus the two villains, plus all of the plot twists, it became one giant hell of a movie. There were so many random characters that were introduced that I found it difficult to keep track of all of them...for instance, the police detective Ramirez, and the man who replaced Falcone as the leader of the mob, (as well as less significant others) were difficult to keep track of. As a result, I did spend the first half hour being confused as to exactly what was going on. Also, in the same vein, I didn't see the point of having Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow) in the movie. His cameo was brief, placed in the middle of other action, didn't really add anything, and was too much, on top of everything that was already going on. Going off of that, a little, TDK had very little connection to the first movie. Obviously, as a sequel, it has license, but also as a sequel, I felt that it should have had a little more in common with the first movie. In Batman Begins, there was so much more Bruce Wayne -- It was mostly a Bruce Wayne movie as opposed to mostly a Batman movie. So much of the plot was devoted to Bruce's parents, and his training, and Rachel, and all the backstory, and that was partially why I really liked it so much. By contrast, there was NONE of that in TDK, and you kind of forget the bigger picture of why Bruce doing all of this (i.e his parents' legacy, Rachel...) This was totally a Batman movie, as opposed to a Bruce Wayne movie. Some people will undoubtedly like that better, and I imagine that Nolan did it intentionally, but I didn't like it as much. Although this is somewhat nit picky and couldn't be helped, I really didn't like that they switched from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenaal. In my opinion, Gyllenhaal is a much better actress. However, the Batman Begins!Rachel and the Dark Knight!Rachel seemed to have nothing in common except that they shared the same name. I didn't think that they had any of the same personality traits, few of the same characteristics, and TDK!Rachel didn't seem to have a lasting, intense attachment to Bruce like that which was seen in the first movie. Lastly...and this is something that many will disagree with me about, but (although it was necessary to facilitate Dent's transformation) I really didn't like that Rachel died. I felt like she gave Bruce a higher purpose, where there was something that was more important to him than being Batman, and there was something waiting for him at the end of it all that made it all worthwhile. Now, though, there is no higher purpose. Now, he's just fighting and fighting until the criminals are vanquished, or he dies. There's no bigger picture, and it's very bleak. While that was probably intentional as well, it simply didn't suit me. That said, this movie was wonderfully acted, and Heath was absolutely incredible. Some things about it are brilliant, particularly the black humor. So, while it was not for me, it is still a great piece of cinema complete with phenomenal performances.
3.0~Overrated, Over-Hyped Disappointment dfultonlv Sign in Permalink I can't believe what a disappointment this film is. Like everyone else, I too had very high expectations for this movie. I'm far from a movie snob. The only thing I expect from a big summer action flick like this is to be entertained--and I wasn't. I've very much enjoyed Batman Begins--in fact I own the DVD and enjoy re-watching it not infrequently. As I watched the Dark Knight, I felt like I was just waiting for the really good stuff to come that never actually did. The whole thing is full of story lines that go nowhere, unoriginal and uninspired action sequences that never deliver. The Joker is inexplicably indestructible, Batman is practically a bit part and the techno-gizmos are patently absurd. The only reason I'm giving this as high as a 3 is because of Ledger's performance, which was good but far from the pinnacle of acting that you'd expect from the hype. The success and acclaim this incoherent snore-fest has garnered just go to show how effective buzz and hype can be. Bottom line, this is truly a case of the Emporer's New Clothes 2008 edition.
10.0~I was really surprised lady-blacknemesis Sign in Permalink To tell you the truth, I was not a fan of Batman and I really don't like comics. I saw The Dark Knight because my boyfriend wanted to see it. And I'm glad to tell all the world around me - The Dark Knight is super, great and the unique one. I think it's not necessary to comment Heath Ledger and his role. In my opinion the main character in this movie is not Batman but The Joker. Ledger gave life to his crazy character. As I have said at the beginning of my comment, I was not the fan of Batman,but sometimes must man change his opinion. One special thank to Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard - The Batman soundtrack is phenomenal. So go and watch it, it's a breathtaking!
6.0~A movie without intelligence and without a soul amgown Sign in Permalink Well, a great movie if you think that DC comics are great literature. A plot with more holes than swiss cheese, with a level of intelligence and sophistication one might expect of a junior high school student (now exactly why were the Joker's handcuffs removed?). And let's not forget the de rigeur finale in an abandoned building and the laughable pseudoscience of the cell phone triangulation nonsense. Why were most of the "action scenes" filmed at such close distance that there is no sense of the entire scene, just close ups of cartoon characters getting struck, maimed, killed. (Apparently depictions of sadism are now a high art form.) And what a clever ploy to replace wit and intelligence in screenplay with interspersed explosions. After all, the louder the better, right? Please, give us back Michael Keaton. What made filmmakers like Hitchcock great was not their "boom boom" graphic depiction of violence but rather an ability to use film to engender tension and suggest violence by subtlety and anticipation in the minds of the viewer. Judging from the general acclaim to which this film has been received here and elsewhere, apparently today's moviegoers prefer to be literally hit on the head than be fed images and ideas that might grow in the head.
10.0~Amazing! inclementfilms-151-808869 Sign in Permalink Ever since this movie came out I've loved Batman! Great story, acting, action and everything! Love this movie more every time i watch it. The music of course is amazing, Hans Zimmer is the man! Joker is still one of the best villains in cinematic history. I'm just writing this review so IMDb says i've written a review before. So now I'm just stalling to make this enough words. Blah blah... This movie is amazing, but I already told you that. Everyone has seen this movie and no one reads a reviews from a movie that came out in 2008. If you're reading this you're a loser, my grammar is so bad right now because I'm writing so fast I just need 10 lines of text to finish my "review"
1.0~Throwing money at a crap story does not make a good film. paul-1106 Sign in Permalink How many times does a crook have to be caught and released over several boring hours to make a movie feel dynamic? Spoilers - if Joker has so few people in his 'gang' (especially if he goes around killing them on a regular basis), how does he get the large set pieces sorted out exploding buildings and boats etc! Yes it was fantasy that much is clear - but rushing from set piece to set piece drama, tension, explosion is poor production technique. But a 9.1 rating over 270,000 voters - this will be a lone voice probably in the love fest that has occurred around this title. Please no Oscar nominations. Glad I got that off my chest.
7.0~You know how they say that where there is smoke there's bound to be fire? Well, sometimes it is just some moron smoking ... LAntichristo Sign in Permalink You know how they say that where there is smoke there's bound to be fire? Well, sometimes it is just some moron smoking ... I went to the movie theatre with the best mood ever. I was happy, I had just eaten a nice meal, I had my soda (no noisy food of course), I had the best seat and I was in one of the best theatre rooms the city has to offer. So there I was, waiting a few moments more to see the best movie ever made. That is what I was thinking, that I went to see the most thrilling, clever, funny, serious, and deep movie ever made. I went to see spectacular performances, incredible gadgets, smart weapons and lots of witty dialogues. I WAS waiting after all for 3 full years to see this movie!!! All I got ... was a 7 The Dark Knight was a bit of a snoozer. All this wait for this? All this anticipation for that? All those numbers for THAT? It was as good as Superman Returns and as boring as Spiderman II. Well don't get me wrong. It is a good movie. It has spectacular moments, it has good actors and an interesting villain. But, there were long periods of time were I was literally falling asleep with my eyes open. Some moments were frightfully boring. Another thing, story wise, this Joker had little to do with The Joker in the comics. The real Joker wears no make up, he is deformed, his skin is bleached after an accident with chemicals. The Joker commits crimes with countless "comedic" weapons, which very little we saw in this film. Well this was a fine version, but I prefer the story in the comics so I would preferred it if they'd stick to it. Though they kept certain aspects of The Joker, like for example the fact that "he was lying so often about his former life that he himself is confused as to what actually happened" I would love to have a bit more of that. The Joker has some really smart and interesting stories about his past. In The Killing Joke especially. "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!" But anyway, this was not the problem with this movie. This is just an observation and a personal preference. There were other aspects that made this a good movie but definitely NOT a masterpiece. Heath Ledger, may he rest in peace, was good but not spectacular! Most actors could pull this part through (unless it was Keanu Reeves lol) And even if I accept him as The Joker I still prefer Jack Nicholson for this part, an actor with more experience and class. Christian Bale looked as if he was bored through the entire movie. He was gray through and through. Plus his voice annoyed me a bit. I got used to it but it was rather ridiculous. Something between Barry White and a lesbian truck driver. (for the record, I have no issues with Mr Barry White or lesbian truck drivers, as long as they don't try to imitate Batman) There was no depth in the story and the moral meanings were a dash tedious. But there were as I said spectacular moments. Mostly visual though. The scene where the batmobile transforms was unfortunately the only clever "gadget moment". I was excepting much more. This is batman after all and since he has no superpowers this is what we all expect from him, clever gadgets. Well there was not much of that. There were too many long chasing scenes, which made the movie seem too long. And when one feels that a movie is too long, most of the times it means it is rather boring. I am now convinced that the whole racket about this movie had to do with Heath Ledger's death. Otherwise, there is NO explanation why this movie is on top in IMDb. I find it offensive and sacrilegious for this movie to be on top of The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. I find it offensive even seeing it on top of Batman Begins, which, for my humble opinion, is the best superhero movie ever made. And after that is X-Men and then X-Men II. The Dark Knight is just a good movie. It is a hard solid 7. No more , no less...
10.0~Brilliant Film-making! ad_upclose Sign in Permalink There comes a movie once in many years that shakes up a genre with such intensity that it ends up becoming an icon. The Lord of the Rings trilogy did it for Fantasy/epics, and now The Dark Knight has done it for superhero movies. Yes its the best one ever! C. Nolan is one of my favorite directors, and he truly comes of age with this effort. Forget the fact that its a great superhero movie, its a fantastic crime drama. The direction is superb, and Nolan has churned out a fantastic screenplay along with his brother. I am glad he also pulled up his socks on the action department (which was lacking in Batman Begins). The chase sequences and the Hong Kong venture were terrific. Nolan remains true to the dark nature of Batmans character & surroundings (aided perfectly by the fantastic score). However his two Batman films have reached such a level of excellence that I would never want to re-visit any old Batman film. I cant imagine any cast replacing Nolans. One person that certainly deserves mention is the cinematographer. Considering how dark the film is (literally) its remarkably vivid (reminiscent of the under-rated Collateral). Christian Bale is the ultimate Batman. He once again smoothly plays his tormented character & his Interrogation scene with Ledger will go down as a classic. Speaking of Ledger, he truly overshadows everyone in this film, and his screen time is satisfying. The Joker commands attention in every scene he is in, and delivers lines that will go down in cinema folklore. Heath has made joker my favorite villain along with Hopkins Hannibal. Ledger literally made Jack Nicholsons version look like a joke (that is no small feat). His voice, walk, & expressions are just perfect. The most interesting & crazy thing about him was that he had no real agenda. He wanted nothing other than chaos. Hollywood truly lost a star in the making (and is a serious blow to the potential third installment); this was going to be his launching pad to greater things. His loss will hurt the Batman franchise since the jokers story is never concluded. I will not get carried away & say that they should hand the supporting Oscar to Ledger (we have not seen the contenders). However Heath certainly deserves a nomination. Despite the dominance of the Joker, the Dark Knight is really about a white knight, Harvey Dent, played smoothly by Eckhart; could be a career-changer. His is a sad story, going from a man who prefers conventional ways to deal with crime, to becoming the maniacal Two-Face. Though his evil side gets little screen-time his character got enough time for me to empathize with his transformation (it was not as bad as how Venom was handled in Spiderman 3). Moreover, I thought the look of Two-Face was a realistic departure from the comic realm (and also nothing like Tommy Lee Jones silly version). Overall, this is a masterpiece of a movie (the best of 2008 thus far). I do not see how even Batman 3 can improve on it. I hope TDK gets some healthy Oscar nominations (at least); Ledger for best supporting actor, best director, best screenplay, best score, and best cinematography. A must-watch & must buy for all movie fans!
10.0~Superhero Masterpiece gileo2 Sign in Permalink Think of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Gladiator, Armageddon, The Fugitive. And then there was one. The Dark Knight, easily the best movie in years, and quite possibly the best sequel ever made (sorry Empire Strikes Back), may be the first superhero movie to win Best Picture. You've read the accolades. Heath Ledger's demon-comic Joker has outshone filmdom's most frightening antagonists, from the mesmerizing and insane Jack Nicholson in The Shining (hey, wasn't he the Joker in Tim Burton's Batman?) to Anthony Hopkins' insidious, and hungry, Hannibal Lechter in The Silence of the Lambs. The Dark Knight's rating is PG-13, yet Ledger nevertheless one ups all other film villains by possessing a calculated, sneering and twisted soul whose heartless acts of manic aggression could even frighten Darth Vader. Witness 1/ the film's opening bank heist double cross and the Joker's Nitzschean misquote, when he places a grenade in the foolhardy and overzealous bank manager's mouth, telling him, "that whatever doesn't kill you, simply makes you STRANGER" (this immediately establishes the Joker's morbid and memorable insanity), 2/ the Joker's own horrific recollection to others of how he received his scars and the carving up of a gang leader, 3/ the planning of Rachael Dawe's untimely death and the birth of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart you were terrific too), and 4/ his disregard for greed and money (who else would burn his share of the stolen millions, then boldly state, "This city deserves a new breed of criminal, and I'm going to give it to 'em."). There's also the ultra bleak dystopia created by the brilliant Christopher Nolan. Not since Blade Runner has civilization seemed so dark and helpless. Where Blade Runner portrays the future as a destitute and empty society, Nolan places the Dark Knight's blackness in the heart of US. This present, and our Heart of Darkness, is a Gotham City so recognizable in its corruption that it strikes a raw nerve in every film viewer. The Dark Knight is indeed a dark movie, but sociologically and ideologically real to the bone. This Batman movie brings out issues that we see in the news daily: terrorism, unrelenting crime, cyberspace hijacking, even villainy in the best of us: does Batman give in to his emotions and pound The Joker to a pulp? Or does he become the sacrificial lamb of Gotham, the Savior that we deserve, and one who carries on his shoulders the sins of all our actions? In the end, both Commissioner Gordon and The Dark Knight realize they must preserve the dignity of the law and continue the good name of Harvey Dent. Batman not only races off with his sorrows, but also with the brunt of Gotham's problems on his shoulders, and his hidden identity of ultimate sacrifice. The greater good must be restored, and Batman knows this. That's why The Dark Knight is the ultimate blockbuster, the ultimate superhero movie, and the ultimate cinematic masterpiece that it will be cherished as. For its taut action, thought provoking moral drama, superb visual effects, pulse-pounding musical soundtrack and flawless direction, it rates an 11 out of 10. The Dark Knight is Cinema Art, and it will be Movie of the Year.
5.0~It's good but not anywhere near a 10. sven_nilsson-1 Sign in Permalink Man, I had expectations for this one. The greatest movie of all time?! Not really. Not even the best movie in the Batman series actually. The Dark Knight is by no means a bad film. In fact, it starts off really good. The filmmakers are very successful in how they depict the Joker. Good acting and serious crimes will make it easy to hate the villain this time. But from the top, it is a long way down. The storyline isn't smooth enough to make it interesting. Fairly good acting throughout only partially helps to compensate for the many flaws. What unfolds lacks credibility to such an extent that it does not help that Batman is a fictional character. There seems to be no limit to what the Joker can do, and there must be an endless supply of criminals willing to help him. Half of the police force is corrupt, and at times it all seems like one big quarrel. Since no one can be trusted anyway, let's shoot in every direction and blow up some buildings! But there are definitely some ups along the way. A few scenes shot in Hong Kong are just excellent. The big budget is apparent - nothing looks fake. Explosions and destruction look like real, and I heard that most of it actually is. Some high tech stuff lacks credibility so much that you will laugh. Distibuted cellphone based sonars? Not really :) The Dark knight fails to surpass Batman Begins, which is better in almost every aspect, except for maybe the CGI/special effects. I give Batman Begins a 7/10 and The Dark Knight does not deserve more than 5/10.
10.0~The new era Batman raymee-arry Sign in Permalink Batman has got a new life. It has got a new identity. With Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan, its a beginning of a masterpiece series. The first movie of Batman, Batman Begins already proved the caliber of the two. But when you see this movie, there is one actor who takes the aura of Batman away. Its the Joker, played by Heath Ledger, who expired after giving such a huge performance. When you see him with his scars, and the unusual makeup on his face, u may get scared. And not only the make-up, but the acting of the Joker, with such brilliance, and the dialog, "why so serious???" will make a mark in your mind. Other than the Joker, of course the Batman, and the Two faced man, played by Christian Bale, and Andrew Eckhart, out stand their performances. No doubt, the director, Christopher Nolan got the perfect combination and was able to make every actor outperform his capabilities. And the film got what it deserves, a huge opening in the box office and the highest rating. And this movie asks to be watched twice and thrice, and i am sure, every time you watch it, it will show something new.
6.0~There are so few good films, The Dark Knight looks like one. auberus Sign in Permalink I fail to see what is so brilliant in Batman "The Dark Knight". Is it the title? Because it certainly not the film itself. Let's start with what is (if not Oscar worthy) goodIn "The Dark Knight" the acting is not at stake. Special mention to Heath Ledger; he managed to do something interesting with the character of the Joker. Tough job as the Joker's past is indeed a mystery. All we know in the film is that his motivation is fairly limited. He just wants to bring chaos not so randomly it seemsIt is hard to embody someone with as little background elements as water in the Sahara desert and a motivation as thin as air. Plus the script did not really help with the endless version on how he got his scars. However Heath Ledger manages to deliver a good performance by playing a pretty generic sadistic psychotic. Christian Bale is hard to judge. Spending most of his time in a bat suit doesn't really help to determine whether or not his performance is good. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman do so little than even the credibility they are supposed to provide is inexistent. Finally Aaron Eckhardt plays a rather uninteresting Harvey Dent; His "Two-Face" part is too short to indeed develop his character. To close the acting chapter I have to point out how poorly written the script sounded. I didn't get away with one memorable quote. Not a good sign On to the film itself: very well shot even though one has to regret in the opening shot the reflection of the edge of the helicopter in the building's glass. Moreover did you notice how generic Gotham is depicted? Some would have you believe it was a deliberate choice to make Gotham looks more realI tell you it was driven by laziness and zero artistic vision. This is symptomatic on how seriously the film is taking itself Secondly I profoundly questioned the coherence of the film. Let me push forward my evidences by throwing at you the questions that popped in my head while watching the film from the most trivial to the more important ones: Why can the dogs chew on the bullet proof bat suit? Why a witness could pull a gun on a Lawyer while being on the witness stand? (body search anyone?) How the Joker manages to keep a pencil straight on a table while a dozen of gangsters are trying to reach out to him for a good old hand to hand Fight. Why the most famous patient of a hospital under terrorist threats can't be evacuated? Why the Joker would sets fire of a dollar bills pyramid? He said that money is not important to him. What's important to him is bringing chaos. But then why would he rob banks for a living then? Why is Bruce Wayne so obsessed with an ugly girl? How does this Sonar thing works? How could two Ferry Boats live the shores full of petrol barrels without any crew members noticing a thing? How can the Joker blow out an entire Hospital despite announcing it? Can someone explain the strategy of Police Commissioner Gordon who pretends to be dead so that the Joker will focus on Harvey Dent instead? Why is Harvey Dent mad at Police Commissioner Gordon and Batman more so than mad at the Joker? Would you? Why is Batman endorsing the crimes for Harvey Dent? Couldn't Gordon and Batman agree to use the Joker as Scapegoat? I know it seems like I am writing the "Cantique" of Nitpicking but there are way too much small incoherent things in the plot to make the whole film stands on logical ground. Christopher Nolan wanted to redefine the notion of Hero by proving that there isn't such thing as PerfectionThe Dark Knight proves if need be that everybody has flaws. Batman has flaws he has a dark side. The bright shining knight, Harvey Dent has flaws. Both of them can become as dark as they were shining onceBut are we ready to be confronted with the dark side of our Knights? Are we ready to rage War on Terror? Are we ready to give away some of our Freedom? Things will get worst before they get better. But during those darken days our very Society will be at stake. Christopher Nolan did a very good job in refreshing the Batman Series. Certainly I liked the job he did with the first one, encapsulating the film's Mythology in some kind of possible contemporary Reality. But too much is too much. Here it appears ridicule at best, chocking sometime and often incoherent. As a director scaring people is an easy thing to do. Depicting the process of Fear is way more difficult. Time of hardship is here. We don't know where we're going and it's quite something to live in fear. We need a light, we need Knights. But do we need darken Knights? One thing for sure, there are no "Shining Knights"... So at the very least we need to understand how fear transforms into courage sometimes and how the control of this courage and the course of action are important and can't lie in the hand of one Man or a few. The problem is, Batman "The Dark Knight" lacks any understanding of the danger of Fear. Whether it is the Fear of one Man or the Fears of a given Society
7.0~more hype than anything Grusso1972 Sign in Permalink if it wasn't for ledgers performance i would have given it a 6/10. i think he gave a great performance & we finally saw a joker that wasn't more of a Clown than anything else....i also think the way he looked in the make up helped him sell the character, there were times just looking at him was freaky.... Batman Begins, the first movie was better in my opinion. this movie got away from batman's stealth/ghost-like/strike fear character. he's running out to fight criminals & walking threw night clubs clobbering guys to get to the mob boss in one scene. remember in Batman Begins, in the asylum when the thugs crapped themselves if he was a ghost or could fly, then the lights went out. Batman started pulling guys up from the ceiling.....then he would vanish, pop up behind another thug & take him out, then dip into the shadows, take out another thug, etc.... NO.....in this one he no longer does that or anything he was trained to do by his secret society friends....there was a scene when the joker crashed a fund raiser with a hand full of his henchmen.....would be much better if the lights shut down, one henchman gone....another out cold.....there goes another flung across a table, boom....the lights go back on & batman is right behind the joker, standing all alone.....INSTEAD he runs out there & sucker punches the joker, gets into a scuffle with his goons, one guy catches him w/ a shot & drops him to one knee (this is the same batman that took on a 1000 ninjas in the first flick?!....lol, well u know what i mean) anyways.....same mistake as spiderman 3......love triangle was draaaaawn out, too looooong of a movie by at least 20-30 min, what was the point of 2face if your going to kill him 25 min later....BATMANS SCRUFFY VOICE was annoying!!!! he had waaaay to much dialog in the movie & shouldn't have been yapping that much to begin with.....the drawn out scene toward the end w/ joker hanging upside down not only got people a little dizzy, but NOBODY TALKS THAT LONG UPSIDE DOWN, lol, I don't care how crazy u are! was it a bad movie , no.....was it worth all the hype......NO......it was definitely blown up over ledgers death they should have stuck to the Batman Begins Character & Not made the same mistakes Spidey 3 & Superman returns did
5.0~Warning: Moral Spoiler Ahead! Jneil Sign in Permalink Don't worry-- this review doesn't contain any plot spoilers. You can't spoil a movie that doesn't have a plot. As I was walking out of the theater I asked another man who had just seen this movie, "What did you think?" He said, "I liked it." "Why?" I asked. "There were really good performances in it," he said. "And the special effects were great." This made me feel a whole lot better. The moral perversity of this blockbuster movie which had sold out all shows at the theater I saw it at, which is breaking box-office records, and which was applauded by the audience at the end, apparently went over the head of the audience. I realized nobody actually expects good storytelling or anything approaching moral rectitude from a movie anymore. Moviegoers are happy if the movie has high production values. Look, this movie lives up to its hype. Heath Ledger's final performance is brilliant. The movie is a spectacle from beginning to end. Things blow up and cars fly through the air. Lots of people are killed in creative ways. I started yawning about halfway through its 152 minutes. It's not that there isn't good versus evil in this movie. There are scenes that any member of the clergy could use to illustrate a Sunday sermon. The problem with this movie is that there is one and only one character who has a clear and consistent moral vision, who is heroically dedicated to his chosen mission, who is strong and resourceful throughout, who is always one step ahead of his opposition. Where's the problem, you ask? The problem is that this character isn't Batman, who is about as morally tortured as Hamlet. The problem is that the only character with any moral certainty in this Batman movie is the Joker. True, the Joker's mission is the generation of chaos and random destruction. He tests the moral fiber of the heroes and by the end of the movie has compromised all of them. I commented to a friend while walking out of the theater, "I hate this movie for making me feel as if I'm living in Germany in the 1920's." He answered me "That's why I love it. It's a documentary. You are."
6.0~Boring cynthia_008 Sign in Permalink What a disappointment. After reading all the rave reviews, I thought I was going to see something different and what did I get? Just another day in the life of Batman. Yes Heath Ledger was good at the role of the Joker and it's worth seeing him play a different role so well, but the storyline was lacking. We've seen all this before. Batman is as stiff as a board, how any woman (apart from his mother) can love such a creature, I don't know. I'll give him some credit, his lips move. Effects aren't enough to make a movie worth watching. Could have got this one out as a DVD instead. Sorry Batman fans who gave this top scores, I don't think it deserves it.
10.0~Believe the hypeThis IS the Movie of 2008. danguest2005 Sign in Permalink Believe the hypeThis IS the Movie of 2008. No question about it. Maybe even one of THE best movies of all time. In fact, it's not just the movie of the year, The Dark Knight is now a milestone in cinema history. It will change how future summer blockbusters will be made. Every Hollywood film maker in the world should now have this mother of a movie in the back of their minds when creating their new movie. Trying to work out what on earth Christopher Nolan did to make not only a fantastic summer blockbuster, but a brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and brilliantly intelligent masterpiece. With The Dark Knight, it's hard to decide where to begin explaining why it's so amazing and why it's one of the finest films ever made. But, we've got to start somewhere so I'll start with my favourite element of the movie: The Joker. The Joker is not only now my favourite movie villain of all time, but he's also now one of my favourite movie characters of all time, up there with Arnie's T-800 and Weaving's Agent Smith. The character is all what you would want from a movie villain. He's scary, DISTURBINGLY scary, he's funny, DISTURBINGLY funny, intelligent and very witty. But what is also very intriguing and very important is that he has no motive. He doesn't want money, He doesn't want revenge. All he wants, in the words of Michael Caine, is to "Watch the world burn", and he doesn't care who he hurts or what he does to accomplish his goal. There's just SO much more to talk about with the Joker, i.e. the make-up, the costume, the dialogue and his memorable scenes that you could fill an entire page with detail, but I need to talk about everything else as well so unfortunately I should move on. One last thing though about the Joker. I think it's a massive shame that the actor portraying the Joker, Heath Ledger, died shortly after filming, because I'm sure he would had had a fantastic career ahead of him and is sure to win Best Actor at the next Oscars. Lets move on to Batman himself. The character of Bruce Wayne and Batman are pretty much the same as they were in Begins, only they've obviously learnt a lot over the time that has past. With the character of Batman, it's great to see that he's still developing his suit and gadgets and is in progression of fighting crime, not just Batman fighting a super villain over a clean city. His new suit is awesome, his Batmobile looks better than ever and the Batpod is just incredible. As you may know, The Dark Knight has two villains: Joker and Two-Face. When I first heard that they were having two villains, I immediately assumed that Two-Face's reveal would be left until the end of the movie and that we would see him as the central villain in the third film, similar to how Begins ended with the Joker card. How wrong was I! Two-Face, or Harvey Dent, is a very important character throughout the entire film and is portrayed brilliantly by Aaron Eckhart. The face make-up and CGI used to create the 'Two-Face' are phenomenal and the whole use of the two headed coin flipping is brilliant. It's hard to believe that Tommy Lee Jones played the same character in Batman Forever as Eckhart's portrayal is a massive contrast! I'm really glad Nolan didn't leave his reveal for the end, as I don't believe the character could match up to the Joker in a third film and don't think he could hold the villain role on his own. There are so many great and different characters in The Dark Knight it's impossible to go into detail about every one, but here is a quick run down of all the other notable characters. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who portrays Rachel Dawes, is probably the weakest actress and character in the film. She isn't awful, but compared to the rest of the cast she is the weakest. Michael Caine gives a great and funny performance again as Alfred, Morgan Freeman does what he does best as Lucius and Gary Oldman returns as Gordon, the only clean cop in Gotham. There are so many memorable scenes in the film, but a few that are definitely worth mentioning are the opening bank scene, the Batmobile/Batpod chase, Two-face's burn, reveal and coin tossing, every scene involving the Joker (especially the hospital sequence) and the final action sequence. After seeing a film like this, it's hard to believe that anything I will see now will surpass this. The film has surpassed all expectations and has done what most sequels fail to do frequently: Surpass the original. Not only does it surpass it, but it also introduces an entirely different style of film. The only thing left to think about now is what is in store for the third in Nolan's Bat Trilogy? What style of film will we see? What new villains will we see? The Riddler? Penguin? Catwoman? One can only speculate for now, but one thing is for sure, and that is that it's going to take something extremely special to surpass a sequel that has been ranked high with classics like The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. Overall, The Dark Knight is one of the finest films ever made and do not let any one tell you any different until you have witnessed this masterpiece for yourself at the theatre. A MUST SEE movie for everyone!
3.0~Over-hyped and disappointing. hitman57 Sign in Permalink I hate this movie. But I can deal with bad films making a lot of money and even getting praised by professional critics. What I can't deal with is the fact that it's being touted as the best picture of the decade, and drawing comparisons with Godfather 1&2, and Good,bad & ugly. That's unacceptable. The script was a mish mash of some pretty good ideas. But the writers lacked creativity to expand on it. To do justice to all the substories/supposed psychological struggles/phony moral dilemmas, it needed a runtime of 1 hour more. Yet it had many sequences which were cut short abruptly and needed further explanation. Acting was nice overall. Bale without ever evoking memories of Micheal Corleone (as some guys led you to believe) got the done as best he could from the weak script. I haven't seen much of Eckhart but he was impressive as both Dent/Two Face. Heath Ledger stole the show as Joker, but didn't turn in the best performance of the year. His umtimely death robbed Downey Jr. of the best chance he's had to get an Oscar. I would've liked to see more of Morgan Freeman who's screen time was depressingly short. Direction, Editing and Cinematography were the traits which let it down the most. Nolan's style is suitable to thrillers like Memento and The Prestige, but not for a film which says "I want to be an epic" right from the start. Thanks to some poor editing, some very important scenes get confusing. It's hard to make out what's happening in the scenes set at night(and there's a lot of them). An ending which had Godfather written all over it was brought out of thin air just to make us feel the film is indeed very dark and epic. It almost felt like cheating. Overall, its an over-hyped and disappointing film, which can't even compare with spiderman films, let alone the all time greats.
10.0~One of the Best movies ever!!! gibsonmarshall_sg Sign in Permalink I don't have a reputation on here (IMDB) at all. No one knows me and no one has any reason to listen to me. However, rest assured that I am one of the critical people who will find whatever problems they can with a movie just so that I don't have to admit a good movie... I know it's not something to be proud of but tonight, even someone like me CANNOT act that way. Even if we want to... Batman Begins was a refreshing restart to the Batman series and I thought it was amazing. I heard the announcement of a sequel and I was tangled inside. Should we make more and possibly mess up this series as well? Or will it be better... Well if you haven't already figured it out, it was the latter that took precedence in the theater. This movie was truly enjoyable and the whole 2.5 hours rushed by almost instantly. I felt almost every emotion throughout. Hatred, love, pain, sorrow, delight, shock, pity, and admiration... It was an emotional roller coaster and I loved every minute of it. The aspects of the film quickly became more of pieces of art work rather than entertainment. The whole movie had a point everything happened for a reason and was important. The acting was superb, the movie was great, but beyond all that, the story was enthralling... It took all of maybe 5 minutes for me to be lost in the world of Gotham City and at the end I had nothing but love for the past 2.5 hours. I dare say it may have arguably been the best 2.5 hours in my life and I would have gladly paid double to see this movie... It's one of those movies that make you wish you could see it again for the first time just because of how good it was... I hope everyone who sees this movie enjoys it at least half as much as I did and then everyone will be quite pleased cause that's how much I loved this movie... I guarantee I will spend a lot of money seeing this in the theaters and it will be money well spent. I'm sorry if you read this and decide to go see it and don't like it. I only say all these things because they're have been VERY few movies I have felt half as strong about as this movie. I hope the world enjoys this movie for what it is... A work of art...
6.0~Pop Corn lovers st894004 Sign in Permalink Okay, I hate to have to do this but....this movie really was not that good. First: Ledger was good, a few times I felt he was unsure of his performance but other then that he was everything the Joker should be, dark, witty and sickly humorous. He is the only thing that makes this film worth watching. Every time he was on the screen I wanted more of him and every-time he left I lamented and got bored with pop corn action stupid high budget film affects...far from what traditional film making tenders to. Too bad the old method acting left him sleep deprived and well, no longer alive. If there is one film for him to end his career with it is certainly this. Second: Maggie Gylenhal is not hot, Wayne should have gone after the three girls he pulled up with in his copter, wow. Third: The thugs in this movie sucked, i was not scared of them what so ever, really all their performance did was make me laugh. Fourth: THERE WAS NO BAT CAVE....enough said. Fifth: There were too many stories going on at once, never did they fully develop into what I hoped they would have...Somewhat similar to The Prestige NOlAN. Sixth: Harvey Dent was okay, however when he turned into 2-face he just looked flat out stupid...and to me funny. Don't GET ME WRONG HERE. I HAVE BEEN RAVING ABOUT THIS MOVIE, SAW IT LAST NIGHT AND WELL GOD....IT DID NOTHING FOR ME. I base a films worth on how it makes me feel, in the end, I felt annoyed the Joker was not more of the center piece to this film. EVERYTHING WAS PREDICTABLE....I guess I should expect this with a postmodern popcorn flick ( all too centered around spectacle) concerned only with instant gratification and no digging to figure out latent meanings. Sure...in the end Batman will stay in the shadows, thats all the ending tells us. Didn't WE ALWAYS KNOW THIS????? I really cant go on...Batman Begins was a much better film. All you people had it so strongly in your head that this film was destined to be great that no matter what the end result was, your head tells you it was that very thing...great...when really it was a cliché action flick highlighted by Mr. Ledger himself. They should have called this film "The Joker" or of course, "Why so serious?". And of course like I said, focused more on what is one of the most original performances of the year in Ledgers. Nough said, pop corn lovers.
10.0~Anyone want to see a pencil disappear? powerslave06 Sign in Permalink IMO, this movie didn't meet my expectations at all. In fact.... It surpassed and exceeded them. As I walked into the theater, I found myself mentally cursing myself for watching all the previews and movie updates fearing that I had spoiled myself. Simply put, I was wrong. The major players here are Batman (Bruce Wayne), Harvey Dent, The Joker (duh!), Rachel, and Lt Gordon. Those are the characters (with the exception of Joker) are the only ones really worth mentioning because of the growth they go through in the movie. You see Bruce suffer through things that would make anyone else either kill themselves or go insane. His darkness isn't portrayed as clichéd brooding or angst, but a certain level of darkness which I can not even find the words for. Whatever it is, Christian Bale pulls it off beautifully. Then we have Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart); pretty much the same as Batman, but in a different sort of light. He wants to tackle crime and make the city a better place. His crusade eventually leads him down the road of hell as the Joker takes a personal interest in destroying him. I cant give away too much, but Eckhart really shows his versatility as he plunges into an even darker hell of what Bruce goes through. And then we have the Joker (Ledger). Without a doubt, the best performance I've seen in a long time. He really steals the show. I will be quoting his lines for the next two weeks and mimicking him around my friends for the next few weeks. His performance made me laugh at things that would normally be sick and demented, but strangely I felt OK to laugh at a hospital being blown up. The Joker has a sick sense of humor that would (and should) make Jack Nickolson and every other Joker player be proud. Then there's Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhal). If you walk into the theater and expect an Mary Jane, damsel in distress stereotype think again. She has those moments yes, but she makes it work for her. Her love triangle between Bruce and Harvey adds a welcome relief from the chaos that surrounds them. Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman) delivers some of the most surprising performances, and I think one of the better ones of his career. He plays the down to earth, sensible guy who desperately tries to keep his sanity for the sake of the city. Keep a close eye on him for he (and Harvey) will throw you some curve balls. And those are just the major players. Caine, Freeman, Roberts, and a host of other talented actors and actresses only add to the epicness. That plus the plot which will give you glimpses into this world and almost makes you believe that they're real. And if you're expecting a happy ending, think again. This is one of the most depressing endings I've seen in a long time. The drama, the action (ever see a diesel rig flip over nose first?), the dark humor, and much more easily makes this one of the best films of the decade and really raises the bar for not just comic book adaptations, but movies in general. 9.5/10.
6.0~Very good movie, but lets stand back and take another look. {Spoiler} OliverT Sign in Permalink What fantastic set pieces(the escape in the Chinese office building was as good as you'll see) and stunning performances all round, also visually brilliant but I thought that the plots were over cooked, there were just too many twists and turns for my liking, to me it seemed like the quantity of twists and turns would give it more merit in the eyes of the director. It almost seemed like two or three movies rolled into one, yet there was no great plot. There was a very rushed character development of Dent to two face.. just up out of his hospital bed straight into a killing spree really. The movie was two long, the pacing was a little scattered at times and some of the dialog seemed old hat to me, I thought it started to lean more toward a Tim Burton take on the franchise, I did love the Burton movies but I loved what Nolan was doing too, his raw back to basics model added grit and a very dark reality. It bothered me that it was borrowing heavily from the James Bond "Gadget Demo" scenes when they were inspecting the gadgets and Bruce accidentally sets off the device is told "It would help to read the instructions master Wayne" rings very much of "Be careful Bond" to me, what's next.. X-Ray specs?... and remember this is what the Bond Franchise themselves moved away from. I did of course think it was well worth seeing but disappointing after the hype I suppose. We really didn't get to spend any time with Bruce Wayne himself. Also Christian Bales Batman voice, it sounded waaay to put on, laughable in fact. All this said I'm simply trying to put into focus what I've seen, it is very good but not the greatest film ever made. Thanx, OTCii.
1.0~WORST film in quite a few years jaq-4 Sign in Permalink This is the 3rd-best film on IMDb?? Just came out of the cinema and couldn't believe my eyes! What a waste of time, money & human creativity... This is so far the worst film I've seen this year & easily the worst film Christopher Nolan has directed. Why do great actors like Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Michael Caine accept such roles  are they in it just for the money?! That's totally okay, but then they should refrain from jazzing up this piece of crap and just say what it is  a shallow, pathetic off-the-rack exploitation movie for brain-damaged teens. I had a hard time piecing that pseudo-heroic dialogue together  at times it seemed to come straight out of fortune cookies; at times I didn't even know what the h**l the people on-screen were talking about... never mind the totally unimaginative camera, storytelling, action scenes... everything! Everything was just... so... SEEN BEFORE. Laughable. Enough said. Voted 1 out of 10 just for the OK & above-average acting of Heath Ledger.
4.0~Should have rented this boring movie grathy Sign in Permalink This movie must skew toward males, as I thought it really lacked heart and a decent plot line. Maybe when men go to the movies, they don't care as much for a carefully crafted story line. Perhaps it's adrenaline that makes guys go to the movies. This movie did have that. In particular, the chase scenes in the tunnel were quite exciting, but to me, action is not enough to carry a film. I didn't find it emotionally engaging at all, except for the curiosity factor of seeing Heath, who did a great job. Christian Bale, in my mind, was out of his element in this movie. I don't really view him as any sort of an action hero. Spiderman gets my vote over this media-hyped disappointment. At least you're dealing with well-developed characters, some emotional depth, and the dissection of moral issues. I blew $25 dollars at the theater with this, which would have been a month of Netflix. Now I know why I stay home most of the time to view films. I watch at least a movie a day, and this was a waste of an afternoon.
7.0~Not one of the best of all time mihaivplesca Sign in Permalink I just watched this movie, I been looking forward to seeing it for some time now, and I can't say that I've been disappointed but this is not one of the best of all time, not by far. Except for the Joker all the other characters have nothing fascinating about them. And to be honest : the performance by the late Heath Ledger is a good one, but not to be compared to Hopkins's Lecter , or Javier Bardem from No Country for Old men or Al Pacino from The Devil's Advocate. Most of the dialogs are trivial, the story is pretty predictable and the morals and principles of the hero ( Batman ) are expressed in a very common and cheap (this is my opinion) way. This is a pretty good movie, but let's face it : it's just a box office movie , not a artistic one. In my view, it shouldn't even have made the top 250 movies. In closing I want to say ( and this might sound cruel ) that if it wasn't for the sad death of Heath Ledger this movie wouldn't have receive all the positive reviews.
9.0~all star cast all star results chalker1 Sign in Permalink for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up
10.0~The greatest movie of all time Dash_Jr Sign in Permalink No words alone can describe how awesome TDK is. From the Joker's first appearance up until the very last scene, TDK is like a thrill ride that makes you want more when it's done. Sure, Begins revamped the franchise, Batman TAS set the tone for Animation, and Mark Hamill became recognized as the best Joker...until TDK came along. I was very critical at first when Ledger was cast, but after seeing TDK, I am speechless. TDK is the GREATEST movie ever. I mean, we have superhero movies like Spiderman 2 and Ironman. But come on, who wants to see a nerdy teenage become emo and dance or a billionaire CEO flex around in a plastic suit? The Dark Knight shows how you can make a superhero movie look realistic and still be believable. After watching TDK, there really needs to be a law forcing everyone to watch TDK at least ONCE every week. That's how damn awesome this movie is.
7.0~The Joke's On Us johcafra Sign in Permalink ...for, simply put, this is to comic book/graphic novel adaptations what The Godfather, Part II is to gangster movies. Relentlessly dark, brooding, tangled, mythic, disturbing, none of that alternating, and then some. Long, too. It is neither uplifting nor a place to park the kids. I devoured my share of comic books when much younger, and felt obliged but not compelled to sample their motion picture adaptations. In particular, no fan of the Batman series am I. Tim Burton aimed for weird and hit the target. Joel Schumacher aimed for Ken Russell and missed oh so wide. Christopher Nolan and company got the keys to the franchise and did something certifiably different. Hat's off for that. In sum... About a half-hour too long, and that final half-hour was action-packed befuddlement capped by not one but two unnecessary speeches that were effectively blotted out by that packed action. Heath Ledger's performance will echo in your mind for some time to come. It had to have echoed in his own. Grant the man rest. So will, or should, the performances of everyone else, most notably Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman for their respectively surprising turns of character. With age Eric Roberts looks like Willem Dafoe, and Nestor Carbonell looks unnervingly like Peter Mark Richman. I believe we're close to breaking the sound barrier of digital FX, where you don't appreciate them 'til they're hurled at you and can't appreciate them when you do. I've heard my share of edited gunshots and explosions for the year and quite possibly the next two or three. But at least the violence wasn't stylized. If I wanted that I'd rent A Clockwork Orange. What awards this film will win will be well and truly earned. All the same I can't guess where the franchise will go next. I sincerely hope it's left where it is, with the goal of applying the same considerable attention and resources to finding, learning, articulating and displaying something novel. The participants in this film are surely capable of all of that...
10.0~I cannot find words to describe the brilliance of this film The_Amazing_Spy_Rises Sign in Permalink In short, The Dark Knight is everything any Batfan could have dreamed of. It is the best of 2008, the best comic book film of all time, and one of the greatest action films ever made. It is carried by the titanic performances of Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart, and stands for more than it seems on the surface, much like its hero. To be honest, I really don't know where to begin. The film has NO flaw as far as I can see (although Bale's take on Batman's voice was noticeably more annoying here, maybe because he spent more time in the suit than he did last time). Christopher Nolan's craft and aptitude for understanding this story...the Batman archetype...is unparalleled. This is not just a comic book film. It's a story of what will happen when you leave the race of men no choice. It's a story of what will happen when desperation takes over the souls and minds of all. And lastly, it's a story of how a man's bond and love for his city affects him. This film is going to undoubtedly going to end up as my favorite film of 2008, and is the only film this year so far to receive a 10 out of 10 rating from me. I know you're all itching to see what I think of the acting, so without further ado, let's go there. Though this is a Batman film, the film is not about Batman...it's about Harvey Dent. It's about his struggle, his pain, his life...and there is no greater actor to play the part than Mr. Aaron Eckhart. An admirable performance saves the film from being too lopsided in the favor of a certain clownish psychopath. Eckhart's show is deep, riveting, and when he inevitably becomes Two Face, emotionally disturbing and destructive. Definitely the most surprising show of the film. Christian Bale's take on Batman...well, I never thought I'd say this, but he didn't actually improve on anything here. It's not in Bale's top 5 as far as performances go, and I got a bit of a wooden vibe from him occasionally. Overall, however he is good enough to the point where he isn't completely overshadowed. The next best show would be from Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. He really is the only truly good character in the movie, and Oldman's immediate warmth and likability make his show a great one. I enjoyed brief cameos from Cillian Murphy, Bill Fichtner, and Michael Jai White, as well as the performances of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman (although, like Bale, it's more of the same). I think I'm forgetting someone... OH YEAH! Maggie Gyllenhaal totally erased the memory of Katie Holmes from my mind. Gyllenhaal was excellent as both the fierce and dedicated ADA Rachel Dawes, and the fragile love interest of Bruce and Harvey. Great all around. I still can't help but feel as if I've forgotten something... The action in this film...well, needless to say, it's jaw dropping. Though there was less emphasis on the hand to hand fighting and more on the big bang booms, it was more than understandable because the villains are not as skilled of fighters as our dear Batman is. The film refuses to relent, and borders on horror-like territory numerous times in the film. Despite the length, I never found myself bored or wanting it to end. On the contrary, I was sort of hoping that Heath Ledger would never leave the screen. Oh...THAT'S what I forgot... Ladies and gentlemen, here's the night's entertainment. Without the titanic, terrifying, riveting, and masterful performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker, this film sinks. The film rides on the shoulders of Batman's arch-nemesis, and Ledger takes it and runs away with it. I have trouble finding words to describe how Ledger's Joker made me feel both as I was watching and after. To put it simple, and I'm not lying, Ledger had me shaking for hours after the credits rolled. His voice, his posture, his delivery, his demeanor...all of it makes for the best villainous performance since Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, and arguably the best villainous performance of all time. Though the viewer hates The Joker with every fiber of themselves, you can't help but be in awe of the mesmerizing show put on by Mr. Ledger. You won't be able to take your eyes off of him. A battle between good and evil doesn't describe the tension between Joker and Batman...it's more like a battle of completely opposite ideals. The Joker, who reigns and revels in anarchy, and Batman, who aims for order and planned course of action. I've never seen a better realization of the relationship between these two comic book titans. However, let us not forget that this movie is more about Harvey Dent than the others, and that most of Joker's actions revolve around Dent's actions, not Batman's. In fact, Joker reminds us that Batman is actually an obstacle to get to Dent. Really, I don't know where to end this review, so I think this is a good place. The Dark Knight is everything any cinemagoer could hope for, and more than anything a Batfan could ever dream of. Though the ending will certainly be controversial amongst Batfans, I don't think it could have ended any other way. Packed with extreme action, a bajillion plot twists, and the most terrifying performance in years make for the best film of 2008, and possibly one of the best of all time. The Dark Knight is perfect film-making, and I plan on seeing it at least 3 more times before it leaves theaters. Oh, and it goes without saying that Ledger deserves an Oscar win for this film.
10.0~Read the book: Beyond Good & Evi l- Friedrich Nietzsche(1885) harvej Sign in Permalink Its all there, the heroes, the artificiality of Belief, the fear of loss of an absolute morality by the masses, a solution to the problem of Evil in our Nietzschean 21st century. Old Nietzsche really hated Chrisianity, totally disliked the German bourgeoisie, and considered other philosophies just plain wrong. The hard part of dealing with translations of his books into English is that so many of the words have become clichés: 'ubermensch' did not mean people who were physically strong, it actually meant what we would call self-motivated or self-realized. He wasn't anti-semitic and considered German anti-semitism an example of bourgeois delusion in German culture. He wrote a number of books with odd titles, like 'The Gay Science' where the phrase God is dead appears (a better translation is 'The Happy Science', another example of bad translation).
10.0~Farewell Heath Ledger, And Holy $#!T. rillovickwr4 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight has been the most hyped up movie in a VERY long time. And so many people were saying the movie was amazing, so I had enormous expectations going into the theatre. WHOA! It even still far exceeded my very high expectations!!! This is easily the greatest film of the last 10 years, maybe 20. And hands down the BEST Batman movie ever made. Christian Bale was again terrific as Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was great as Harvey Dent, and Maggie Gyllenhaal was even better than Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman were all excellent once again. Who am I forgetting? I know I'm forgetting someone...hhmmm, who the hell could I possibly be forgetting... OH YEAH! Heath F***'n Ledger. WOW! Ledger's performance as The Joker is possibly the greatest job of acting I've ever seen in ANY movie. That's right. Truly astonishing. The movie follows Bruce Wayne (Bale), and Lt. David Gordon (Oldman), who have teamed up with new DA Harvey Hent (Eckhart). The three men fight for justice against a wild new criminal known only as "The Joker" (Ledger). While The Jokers crimes become deadlier and deadlier, the city of Gotham spirals into chaos, and panic, and there seems to be no way of stopping him! The main message behind the story is about how people act when things get ugly. It's about order and control vs. anarchy and chaos. About good vs. evil. About Hero vs. villain. Batman and The Joker complete one another. If one existed without the other, this movie would have no reason, no plot, no nothing. And that's exactly what "The Dark Knight" is about. Overall this movie is impossible to forget and will go down in history as one of the very greatest. It is most unfortunate that Heath Ledger died shortly after the movie was filmed. He truly went out with a bang! If he'd died after Brokeback Mountain I would've felt so bad. He would always be remembered as the queer who almost gave Jake Gyllenhaal a ******. But instead, he will always be remembered as "THE JOKER", and there could be no greater honor. Heath Ledger has cemented The Jokers place as one of the most notorious movie villains of all time!!!
4.0~Terrible bryan-mccarthy Sign in Permalink I really don't know what went wrong with this movie. This is the worse Batman movie ever. The only good performance was Aaron Eckhart's. Now for my warning of what to expect if you want to see this movie. Christian Bale was simply terrible. His Bruce Wayne portrayal was similar to Adam West's. His Batman portrayal on the other hand sounded like he had lung cancer mixed with a rip off of Kevin Conroy's portrayal. He was good in Reign of Fire, but he was terrible in this. They should have gotten Kevin Conroy to do a live portrayal. Now for Heath Ledger as the joker. Yes, I know he is dead. Boo hoo, give it a break, he was like Cesar Romero on steroids. He also seemed like a Mark Hamill rip off. His performance was terrible. You never wanted to laugh with him, you didn't feel anything for him. Now I seriously hope that someone else can redeem this role in the live action portrayals. Now for the supporting cast. Michael Caine, I preferred him in A Muppets Christmas Carol. He just seemed to bland as Alfred in this, to much like Alan Napeir and Efrem Zimbalist Junior. Personally I think they should have gotten David McCallum to do this role. Gary Oldman, he was good in other movies, specifically Bram Stoker's Dracula. But in this once again, he seemed like a modern version Neil Hamilton's portrayal mixed with Bob Hastings portrayal. Nolan should have hired Jim Meskimen for this role. I already said that Aaron Echart as Two Face was the thing that almost saved this, so I won't repeat myself.Now for Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachael Dawes. Now I must say that she is better than Katie Holmes, so she too almost saves this movie. Morgan Freeman was unfortunately not good in this, I don't know why they couldn't have gotten Kevin Michael Richardson to do this role in live action. Eric Roberts was fantastic as Sal Maroni. He is one of the few to have given a good performance in this. Colin Mcfarlane was also one of the good actors in this. The action scenes were just going overboard. No more is needed as an explanation. The story, it was bland, boring, and colourless. I can't believe I payed good money to see something like this. Well now you know why not to see this.
10.0~Best Superhero Movie Ever Baldrick44 Sign in Permalink Most superhero movies are made to give you a feeling of escapism. THat webbing through rooftops or having claws for hands would be great and wishing that you yourself had that power. Not this one. The Dark Knight begins where the last one left off, with the theme of escalation.Batman ( Christian Bale ) and Liutenant Gordon( Gary Oldman ) with the help of the new District Attorney Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) have smashed crime to the point where they are beginning to run scared. Batman himself is beginning to think that soon he may be able to hang up the cape and the cowl for good and reunite with Rachel Dawes ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ). However, the mob has one last resort up it's sleeve, and it's a proposal by a rising criminal known only to the citizens of Gotham as the Joker ( Heath Ledger ). The Joker, however, has an agenda entirely of his own and soon begins to cause terror on a massed scale which has even Batman lost for ideas. The Dark Knight is a really amazing film, which utillises real live stunts to great effect, making seem so much more gritty and dark than it's neon-lit competitors. Be warned that it is not a film for kids, as the violence, in particular perpetrated by the Joker is confronting and at times very twisted. Christian Bale, while still not quite of the level of Michael Keaton's Batman, still does a very good job while Michael Caine is once again great as his stoic butler. Morgan Freeman is good and Aaron Eckhart brings a great element of tragedy to the role of Harvey Dent. But it is Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger who truly excel. Oldman's Gordon is a conflicted character who is put through the wringer throughout the movie by both his allies and his enemies while being nothing more than an honest cop- one of the last ones. But everyone here is playing second fiddle to the Joker. Heath Ledger brings him a menace and an edge which is so tangible that at times it is truly terrifying. His laugh is bone-chilling and his sense of humour is both funny and incredibly twisted as his 'philosophy'. He deserves every amount of praise, as it is a truly awful foe for Batman to face. The Dark KNight is a superhero film full of twists and turns that never lets up. Instead it graps you by your lapels and drags you into its dark majestic splendour.
1.0~The Dark Knight, Over-hyped and much overrated (imdb) egjweb Sign in Permalink I saw The Dark Knight last night. And although the movie itself isn't too bad, its not as good as the batman fanboys would like you to believe. The film has still a lot of flaws and the playtime is just too long. I've seen people walk out 30 minutes before the movie ended just out of pure boredom. If they would have made the film at a faster rate it would have been a lot better. Then there's batman's voice... Its absolutely absurt. Nobody talks like that. Well maybe Ned from Jimbo & Ned (SouthPark). But really it makes the whole movie one big joke. The side-characters get far to little attention, I can't remember any of their names. Only positive thing about this movie is the Joker, who makes an interesting bad-guy. I would have rated this movie a 6, because its not awful. But im going to give it a 1, just because the current rate (9,2) is totally overrated.
10.0~outstanding renehincapie Sign in Permalink direction 10 of 10 script 10 of 10 (once this story catch you, it won't let you. how many movies mix comedy, drama, action so well??? it's a non-stop roller coaster) lines 10 of 10 actors 10 of 10 (they are terrific. i want to sum up a 10 for each) actress 1 of 10 (sorry Maggie, you did a regular role, but you aren't pretty) fx/makeup 10 of 10 (i'm still wondering if it was makeup o fx. you'll understand me) photography 10 of 10 sound 10 of 10 music 10 of 10 delivers/fulfills/achieves its purpose (i don't know how this category should be named) 10 of 10 ------------- 91/100 oh man 100/100 i love this movie, the film started at 11pm, and ended around 2am, but i disagree with it being top 250 #1. it deserves #2.
7.0~Just OK, didn't live up to the hype. DarthPaul85 Sign in Permalink I must be the only person (or part of a measly 9% of people) who didn't think this was the best superhero movie ever. ACTING: all good, especially by the leads. However, I don't like Bale's choice to put on such a fake voice as Batman. It comes across as over-compensating for something. PLOT: Decent for an action movie, although at many times repetitive (the middle of the film especially gets repetitive). I wished there were more of a mystery present. Similar to the Loeb/Sale graphic novels, but without knowing the characters thoughts, falls flatter on screen. SCRIPT: A mixed bag. Some jokes are funny, others are painful. Often characters will deliver "on-the-nose" dialogue. Kudos to the actors for making it all somehow believable. VISUALS: Good. Although I still don't like the new Batmobile. Stunts are just right. BATMAN: Not quite. Bale's Batman is sincere, but he's still not yet the "Batman" I expect. This could've been called "Batman: year two" more appropriately, because he's still not the master detective yet. Also missing is Batman's uncanny ability to anticipate his foes and use their weaknesses against them. I want a Batman who's resourceful and cunning, not just strong and loaded with weapons (speaking of which, Batman has way too many physical advantages over his foes, something they actually make fun of at one point in the movie). Overall, it's a fine movie; the plot involving Harvey Dent is genuinely interesting, and Ledger really does give an Oscar-worthy performance as the Joker. Still, I reserve higher ratings for a Batman movie that gives me a more fitting image of the dark knight.
10.0~Heath Ledger is a ledgend! rustyalex2 Sign in Permalink Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while. Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it. The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion. During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself. The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch. Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed. Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time. This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now. I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!
9.0~Best comic book film - no, best FILM of the decade Kallithrix Sign in Permalink If Batman Begins was excellent, then Dark Knight is Superb. It was ambitious in its scope and depth, but it never fell short, and surpassed every expectation - not just as a comic book film either, but as an intricately plotted crime film, a hard hitting gangster film, and an edge of your seat thriller. It just hit the mark in every aspect. The acting is superb across the board, but with special mention for an utterly breath taking performance by Heath Ledger. He didn't just disappear into the role of the joker, he BECAME the Joker, chillingly so. Christian Bale once again brought integrity and subtlety to the role of Bruce Wayne, not to mention powerful menace and kick ass moves as Batman. I don't think anyone else who has played the role is even in his league. Its like all the others were impostors, and now the real Batman has stood up. The script is not only intelligent, well plotted and so insightful at times its almost profound (especially in the psychology of the Joker) it is completely gripping for the entire 2 and a half hours. I don't remember the last film I saw I could say that about. And although with some action films you get the feeling that the set pieces are just slotted in to look good for the trailers, in this film every action sequence is not only awesome to watch, its essential to the plot. But the thing I love most about this film (although its hard to pinpoint exactly) is the fact that it makes Gotham come alive as a real city. Its no longer the Gothic fantasy land of the Burton films (which then descended into burlesque farce in the next two unmentionable sequels). In Dark Knight Gotham is portrayed as a city you could believe exists, and that invests everything with a greater sense of credibility, realism, and consequently danger. Every punch, impact and explosion makes you wince, because it doesn't feel like staged fantasy violence anymore. People really can (and do) die, actions have serious consequences, and Batman is not an invulnerable superhero. Unlike with the pre-Nolan films, you never once question the plausibility of a man in a rubber bat suit fighting bad guys with advanced gadgets financed by his billion dollar empire. There is no self-consciousness, no tongue-in-cheek references to Batman's comic book origins to apologise for anything that seems far fetched. Because nothing in this movie seems far fetched at all. Thats what lifts Dark Knight above just a 'great comic book film' and makes it a true masterpiece of cinema.
7.0~good movie but way overrated suley1 Sign in Permalink come on guys lets be serious.... its got an overall rating of 9.6? this places it at #1 in the all time ratings? now that is sheer madness... yes it is in fact quite an enjoyable movie, with a decent plot and with some great acting... heath ledger has done a phenomenal job with the joker... it was breathtaking at times... the rest of the cast do quite a good job as well especially the batman himself... however for a movie to be considered the best of all time it requires much more than great acting... and on many other fronts this movie, although reaching quite a high level, should not even be deemed one of the best movies, let alone the best movie, of all time... well thats my opinion anyways... and its a sad sad day that the godfather has lost its number one place...
10.0~One of the best films of 2008! thebengalimafia-1 Sign in Permalink Comic book movies as we know them are over. Gone are the special effects laden cartoons like "The Incredible Hulk" and "Fantastic Four." Consider this the "official" death of a movie like "Superman Returns" which was beyond terrible. "The Dark Knight" redefines the comic book movie and changes all the possibilities of where superheroes go and what they're capable of. There should be no doubt that the driving force in this film is the ever maniacal Joker. I wouldn't doubt the fact that he's probably going to go down as the greatest comic film villain of all time after being portrayed so brilliantly and effortlessly by the late Heath Ledger. The Joker never fails to deliver the most diabolical and sinister games that force all the film's heroes to have to make sometimes painful choices. In his own words, "I'm an agent of chaos." Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) realizes that to stop the Joker he has to become something he swore never to be. This results in an interesting turn of events that really can't be put into words, but I will tell you it involves a chase scene. The film really crosses the line in terms of the traditional comic book film in it's exploration of human nature and raises implications on social, political, and moral levels. The last time I saw a movie with that many themes was the multiple Academy Award winning "Children of Men." Personally, I've always felt films that use fiction to explore the current reality we live in or the ramifications of our decisions usually give us a cold, harsh, reality check. Christopher Nolan's screenplay and choice of dialog is more complex than any comic film, not to mention considerably more poetic. Gotham City let Batman operate without having to answer to the law. What happens when you give one man all the power? Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) explains, "When their enemies were at the gates, the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was considered a service." His girlfriend, who also happens to be Bruce's ex-girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), shoots back, "Harvey! The last man to protect the Republic was named Caesar!" A lot of these implications wouldn't be relevant if we weren't living in post 9/11 America, so I recommend you read up on something called Executive Unitary Theory to get the full effect of giving one man all the power. Apart of what made this film so hard hitting was the stellar performances. None of them were actors this time, they were actors who completely lost themselves in the characters they built, every one of which we come to care about. Lieutenant Jim Gordon's (Gary Oldman) promotion to Police Commissioner is well deserved. The movie also allows Oldman to take Gordon to new heights and really shows how Batman and Gordon are in this together, and Gordon as a character really comes of age. "The Dark Knight," in the end, wasn't merely about good and evil. It was about the fight for Gotham, and showing the city's people that you could overcome evil with good. Early on someone mentions that Harvey Dent is Gotham City's "White Knight." Dent is a handsome, well educated, elected official. The people paint the picture of him as this incorruptible force of good. Batman on the other hand, is a vigilante; a man who exists outside the law. People end up having more faith in Dent than Batman, but Dent fails. It's because Batman is there to take the fall that Dent, as a symbol, continues to thrive. People had faith in Harvey Dent and he fails. As Batman puts it, "People deserve to have their faith rewarded, even if it means we have to hide the truth I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be." This is what makes him the real hero, as Gordon puts it, "He's Gotham's protector; our Dark Knight." This is one of the year's best films. Go see it now!
10.0~No words would do it justice... rawanabusalman Sign in Permalink No words would do this movie justice...And I thought Batman Begins was great! It was-don't get me wrong...but when this one came to life, I think it put all other movies-including great Batman Begins-in its small pocket... Definitely the best movie of 2008 (so far;no one knows what the future holds), and definitely among the best movies of all time...Acting was superb..Christian Bale did an amazing job as the 'dark night'...the late Heath Ledger, the Joker, simply redefined the standards by which such roles would be judged...his performance was impeccable...Its among the very few movies that will make you root for the bad gay (to a certain extent). Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were excellent, as usual, in role and character...Gary Oldman was great too as Gordon...So was Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, respectively... As I said, no words will do this movie justice...great acting aside, the plot was amazingly smart, interesting, thought-provoking, and most definitely, entertaining... A MUST WATCH to all...will keep you in awe and amazement for the entire 2 hours and 20 minutes..guaranteed! And the one request you might have after those 2 hours 20 minutes is for the dude inside the booth to rewind the tape and play the movie again! Watch it...you won't be disappointed... 11/10 had that been an option :)
8.0~Very Good, But Yikes, Let's Keep Things in Perspective evanston_dad Sign in Permalink Whatever else it may be, "The Dark Knight," Christopher Nolan's follow up to his "Batman Begins," the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made. The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens. I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly. The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish. So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since "Citizen Kane." Grade: A
10.0~R.I.P. Heath Ledger. This portray of Joker will never be forgotten. mdolz1374 Sign in Permalink Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth. This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close. Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight. The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen. There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc. No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!
10.0~Fantastic! krazycrukids Sign in Permalink Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen

5.0~too much hype bkinpdx Sign in Permalink This film was too hyped up...by the time it opened here in Hong Kong it had been praised to high heaven, including here on IMDb. (one reviewer said that it was close to being a masterpiece!) Heath Ledger's death played a huge part in that I suppose, and when compared to the dreadful "Batman" films of the recent past one might be tempted to be impressed. BUT in my opinion: this work offered an opening scene which really grabbed me only to go slowly downhill. There was lots of mainstream American-style action and some nice performing by Ledger, but I couldn't get over the corny acting of Aaron Eckhart (playing Harvey Dent), and the lame Christian Bale (Batman). I thought that they ruined the film. Dreadful. Maggie Gyllenhaal (playing Rachel Dawes) was so unattractive that it was actually hilarious when she was referred to as being lovely in the film. I really had trouble watching her in this role. Is her face melting or something? Whats with that huge pimple thing? Sorry, but really...she is not a pretty woman. Not even close. I was thrilled to see Cillian Murphy early in the film, only to realize that it was a cameo! Morgan Freeman? Michael Caine? Whats with that? Perhaps I see too many independent films to appreciate this kind of production. It seems as if loads of people are raving about The Dark Knight, and I respect their opinion...but I give it a 5.
4.0~Overrated...not Batman infosurf64 Sign in Permalink Well, it's been a few years, but I might as well warn future moviegoers. This is the movie which so many critics and viewers raved about, yet I couldn't see what for. Let me explain: I'll be brief because I don't want to reveal too much of the plot. The film is basically where the Joker sets out to corrupt the Batman and to prove that 'chaos is order' through death and destruction, and Batman goes to his limits to defeat him. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne goes through an emotional crisis as Rachel Dawes is now dating Harvey Dent, who later is scarred and becomes Two-Face. It sounds good like this, but it's not. The two main leads are terribly irritating and not at all like the comic book and cartoon versions. Instead of a deformed, conniving, sinister clown, the Joker is a painted emo who preaches about chaos while he senselessly murders people to no apparent aim except to cause that Batman turn to the dark side. I'm not sure if his plan was to pretend to be crazy so that he could conquer the crime syndicate, because it never clearly states any actual goal of his. He acted like some generic psycho, not the real Joker, and I could get ten times better on Criminal Minds. Meanwhile, the Batman is constantly whining about how terrible his life is, and pining after Rachel, and several rushed scenes leave it ambiguous as to whether he wants to be Batman or not. It seems to be a poor rehash of Spider-Man 2, which did this story-line much better. The Batman is the one character in the superhero universe who sacrifices personal relationships for justice more than any, so this is an inherent contradiction of his character. The worst part of all this, though, is that he actually believes some of the Joker's moronic pseudo-philosophy, and acts as if he will somehow be exactly like the Joker and go around murdering people needlessly if he kills him. Really, though, Gotham would be better off if the Joker died, yet the Batman saves him even though, in the final fight, killing him is in self-defense. I didn't get any sense of the bitter rivalry between the two. The rest of the movie doesn't fare well, either. Harvey only becomes Two-Face later on in the second half, after the mob deforms him and kills Rachel. The Joker is responsible, of course, yet, he goes after a few corrupt cops and then Gordon's family. They give no back story to him or reason for his actions, and he is killed off accidentally by Batman. Plus, the love triangle angle is never fully developed anyway (although, because I never really liked her, I wasn't sad when Rachel died). Sal Maroni is a minor secondary villain, but gets more involvement than Alfred or Lucius (they're just minor roles here). Gordon is the only consistent and interesting character in the whole movie. The film is too dark (literally, because everything's in shadows), and the actions scenes, while sometimes good, are hard to see, and seems misplaced anyway. He travels to China to capture a mobster who's not really important, and destroys half of Gotham in a pointless chase scene. The Joker magically seems to be able to blow up bridges, a hospital and ferries, and hack into television broadcasting, without notice and with unlimited resources, but his acting makes this all too unbelievable. His idiotic master plan is to rig two ferries with explosives and see who blows who up first, and the Batman defeats him by magnetizing the city's cellphones to track him. And, in the end, the Batman pretends to be responsible for Harvey's crimes after the latter's death so that the Joker's doesn't win the battle for Gotham's soul (although he and Gordon commit corruption, so the Joker does win, anyway). The musical score is fine, but it's the same one from the last film. All in all, it's just boring and dull. All the philosophy was nonsense, and felt forced. They just used the Batman franchise to sell a film which would otherwise be panned by critics (so why it wasn't, I don't know). I don't recommend that you don't watch, but don't be sucked in by all the hype.
1.0~one of the dumbest movies of all time mrkafk Sign in Permalink I can't believe this movie got so high ratings! Have you all lost your minds?! This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, and I'm not talking Batman's kicks being more than match for bullets! This is a comic-based movie, suspension of disbelief is due with regard to things like that or cops cooperating with Batman (cops don't like sharing *any* power, and neither does the govt apparatus, which would rather have Joker murder a hundred of civilians than let one vigilante like Batman go free). Where suspension of disbelief is NOT due are the movie's messages that it dumps in truckloads on viewer's heads! Aw the poor corrupted cop who did this because of her mother's hospital bills! Aw hear ye the socialized medicine is needed! Aw! Aw we do spying on people where necessary but it's still wrong! Aw! Aw we never kill villains, even when they wrong-do us! Aw! Aw the prisoners are at heart good people, we just should re-socialize them more! Aw! The scene that topped all the other in hypocrisy and idiocy was when one of the prisoners has thrown the detonator for the 'civilian' boat through the window. In real life he'd be pushing the button in a second. This is where the movie gets it all wrong. Or perhaps it lies to us but in such way that we should notice? After all, at the end of the movie we are lectured that some things are more important than the truth? Like, having a hero with bad taste in women? Speaking of which, you don't really believe that Brucey and Harvey would swoon all over the mediocre-looking Rachel? In real *real* world the two would rather be jointly gang-banging the Russian ballerina (which was a stunner) than trying to get Rachel's affection, who in turn had a misfortune of a scriptwriter getting her spout the mandatory post-feminist line (oh Bruce don't make me any chance blah blah), but let's put this aside and come back to make-believe real world. Strangely, in this movie the only character with an ounce of sanity was Joker, he just did not let that sanity get in his way. Have you noticed this? He was the only character that the scriptwriters let tell the truth; how things were in his view. Everyone else was a puppet with mind tied up by shallow politically-correct slogans. So even here the movie got it wrong: the Joker *was* sane, just evil. All in all, this was not the epic battle between good and evil, but between dumb and evil. Perhaps that is why this movie was after all so *boring*. The characters are shadows of their former selves from previous Batman movies. This is a version disinfected from everything that has mental life, like in one South Park episode where the directors digitally replaced all the guns with walkie-talkies in their movies. This movie has had that kind of surgery applied to it at the scriptwriting stage. The result is a neutered cat instead of a tiger. Tragedies portrayed in it are fake, we feel that characters portrayed in it do not feel what they exhibit, but exhibit what they feel they *should have been* exhibiting, because they feel watched all the time. One of reasons the movie is not believable is precisely because good guys do not pull the trigger. The good guys are PC pussies with lawsuits worrying them more than bullets. The dumb ideology, and yes, politicized world-view, emerges even in selection of the main hero: a lawyer. Lawyer as a hero? Puhlease. Everyone is a walkie-talkie for some false line, you get the idea. This is a movie staffed with mannequins instead of characters. I had a gnawing suspicion somewhere at the back of the head when I was watching the movie that all of it was result of cold calculation, that it was all just designed to pull emotional strings of naivetés with whatever calls, once to "never kill a villain", then to "tax-funded health-care is Good!" thing, then whatnot. This movie does not believe in itself. Why should I believe in it then? And don't tell me 'it's just a movie'. Yes, it's just a movie. Just an exceptionally dumb one.
10.0~The Batman of our dreams! So much more than a comic book movie Smells_Like_Cheese Sign in Permalink I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like "What are they, kidding?", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen. Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the "Classy Villain that Gotham needs", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's "White Knight" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain. All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker. 10/10
10.0~Christopher Nolan masterpiece ngav127 Sign in Permalink This is one of the movies of all time. There's action beyond belief and humor that breaks down the tension that really works. There also enough emotion to round out the experience. The joker is one of the best characters of all time. He's truly amazing. R.I.P Mr. Heath ledger. Christian bale is of course one of the best actors ever. It's truly a gift to watch them on screen. See this movie it will make you a better person. The ending is perfect and amazing. Every time I watch it pick up something new. There was a lot of effort put into this. Better than batman begins but not as good as inception. It's actually surprisingly under rated.
1.0~wow Scenic80 Sign in Permalink I feel like Im in the Twilight Zone. Is this what passes for movies now? Since you are reading comments, stroll by the voter demographics. Highest ratings are in the youngest age group. Thats not to say all young people are voting 10/10, thank goodness. Some are smart enough to have seen older movies and cant believe the INSANE over hype, but too many just weren't around for the good stuff - before overuse of CGI, or back when there was actually a plot, the characters were developed or there were plausible reasons for things. Do people honestly think this is perfect? Will it be remembered as a classic 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now? No. The more I think about it the more irritating it becomes. In the grand scheme of things, who the hell cares what movies it beats out because those classics *did* survive decades upon decades and this is just temporary infatuation. What gets on my nerves is that movies were doing so well for so long. People cared about making quality entertainment... for the most part. Its hard to put my finger on it because I kept dozing off during the movie, but the Dark Knight is really flawed, and to think (that with this undo attention) that this will set the new trend trend for how movies are made is agonizing to anyone that lives for movies. Thanks a lot Nolan. I think now Ill take up drinking as a hobby.
1.0~Had to do it... resident1155 Sign in Permalink Sorry folks...this one gets the one star. It is a great movie, but the fact that it is number one on IMDb is just an outrage. I think one of the other posters on here said it best: "Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it." Heath Ledger was the only phenomenal actor. This movie is unoriginal. End of story.

10.0~One Of The Best Movies With Good Acting fearfactorfan128 Sign in Permalink This movie was simply amazing. It was not boring for one minute. I could go on and on about how I love it but some things could be better. I think when Heath Ledger is an Oscar nominee, it should be for actor in a leading role because batman failed to lead up to his part. Batman was not very good in my opinion but the joker was exactly what it should have been. He did a tremendous job. The one thing I thought was terrible was two-face his character was simply annoying and I didn't even want to watch it when I saw him. Before I saw this move I was thinking I don't have any want to see a 150 minute movie about batman. But it is one of the best movies ever in my mind.
10.0~Amazingly, lives up to the hype and more Mr_PCM Sign in Permalink For the second entry into the (very) successfully rebooted Batman franchise to live up to expectations was never going to be easy. Batman Begins had met with critical acclaim and set the tills ringing at the box office, so people were already expecting great things of the follow-up, and with the death of Heath Ledger shortly after the completion of filming, it ensured that all of the world's attention was going to be on this film. So expectations of a great film were high. To a large extent, The Dark Knight not only meets, but exceeds those high expectations. With Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman all returning, much of what was good about the first film remains, and the addition of Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal have proved to be successful moves. With the performance of Heath Ledger however, objectivity was always going to be difficult, with talk of a posthumous Oscar circling the film's promotion almost immediately after his death. It seems to be said of any sequel, particularly in a comic book franchise, that the second installment must be 'darker'. Sometimes this is indeed the case, sometimes the label appears to be applied as a knee-jerk reaction. The Dark Knight however is the first sequel in a long time to genuinely deserve this adjective (an impressive feat given that the first film was hardly brightly coloured!), all the way to the ending, to the extent that the film has met with criticism for its family-friendly 12A rating in the UK  some of the 'darker' scenes and plot elements are particularly intense and could be considered certainly unsuitable for children under 12. Yet The Dark Knight is still possibly the best film of the year so far. As for the plot itself, The Dark Knight revolves around Batman's desire to step down and allow new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) to fight the criminals out in the open. However, the rise of the Joker (Ledger) forces Bruce Wayne to return to his alter-ego, and go even 'darker' in order to bring him down. For a runtime over two and a half hours, the plot never gets too convoluted but is involving enough so that the long runtime is not felt too much (although shaving a quarter-hour off wouldn't have hurt). However, although The Dark Knight is a superb ensemble piece (as was Batman Begins) with some terrific action set-pieces (including car chases and explosions) the film's star is by far and away Heath Ledger, in what has proved to be a tremendously fitting swansong to a promising career cut way too short. Even allowing for all the inevitable hyperbole following his death, Ledger's performance is absolutely superb. He truly makes the character his own, and resists what must be a great temptation to overact and try and echo the performance of Jack Nicholson, yet still manages to capture the maniacal quality that is the Joker. Which makes it all the more tragic that this career-defining performance should be seen after his death. But in all of the furore over Ledger's death, it would be easy to overlook the performance of the Caped Crusader himself (and bonus points for Christopher Nolan for managing to crowbar in that nickname into the film without making it seem too camp). But Christian Bale as the eponymous hero matches Leger's joker for intensity and the always-required darkness. It is his performance that makes the Joker such a perfect match for Batman, and probably the greatest comic-book villain ever. And in Aaron Eckhart a new star has been discovered, as his role as Dent the DA and his descent to Two-Face. Meanwhile Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are all as reliable as ever. Best of all, the ending leaves open the possibility of a completion to the trilogy  and although so-called 'threequels' are almost universally a disappointment, the unparalleled success of this reboot to one of the greatest comic-book franchises of all time means that it would be a completion eagerly anticipated. Memories of the ridiculous camp of Adam West, and the catastrophe of Joel Schumacher are now well and truly banished. Exciting, adrenaline-fuelled, compelling, and, yes, darker. The Dark Knight is a fantastic film, and in a summer over-filled with comic-book adaptations, needs something special to stand out. And in Heath Ledger's tremendous performance it has it. Maybe the posthumous Oscar would be justified after all.
7.0~Aaron Eckhart Shines in a Good (but not Great) Flick LaurieMann Sign in Permalink This movie tries very hard and has brilliant casting, often brilliant special effects, and some genuinely frightening make-up effects. Heath Ledger is very good, but I was particularly impressed by Aaron Eckhart, who's gotten extremely little notice for a very tricky part. Eckhart starts off as an extremely sincere Harvey Dent, but if you know anything about the Batman story, you know Harvey Dent has...eventually...issues. You can also figure out how Harvey changes during the course of the movie, and the director and screenwriter handle this part of the movie very well. I'd also like to give some kudos to Maggie Gyllenhaal whose Rachel Dawes had a little more oomph than Katie Holmes' version did three years ago. Perhaps the basic problem problem with the Batman movie is that, in many ways, it's the most grown-up comic book movie ever. But, it's still a comic book movie, so it's violent in places and weighed down by chase scenes and wild hostage situations. I enjoyed Iron Man very much earlier this year, probably because it never took itself completely seriously. The Dark Knight takes itself quite seriously and mostly succeeds. But, a few less semi-tractor trailers flying through the air would have been very much appreciated.
7.0~The Dark Knight Movie Review luvas Sign in Permalink Before going to see The Dark Knight, I had heard a lot of rumors about how easily this movie had surpassed the hype around it. Yet, I didn't take all those favorable reviews for granted and decided to see the movie for myself without knowing that I was going to be in for a special treat by Christopher Nolan. Somehow, the director himself managed to keep the audience both entertained and thrilled during the two and a half hour duration of the whole movie, which I highly appreciate because only a director in full possession of his senses could deliver such a quick yet coherent story of the superhero we all praise. It would be a huge shortcoming not to say anything about the acting, especially which of Heath Ledger as the Joker. I wasn't surprised the least bit to see Heath, who played one hell of a character, steal all the spotlight from other characters whichever scenes he was in. He kept the tension accumulating slowly with his ability to face everything in a creepily calm way as if he was the mastermind behind the whole plan supposedly developed by the police force. The story went flowingly due to the Joker's plan to turn Gotham into chaos, Heath did such an unconventionally perfect portrayal of the Joker that all the audience kept finding their jaws dropped throughout the entire movie. However, in one or two scenes,the Joker was taken by utter surprise; such as when he thought the citizens of Gotham city would turn their backs at each other and pressed the button triggering a deafening explosion to save their own lives on the ferryboat; but they didn't because no matter how chaotic the situation they were in, they did realize that everyone is human being and no human being should risk other people's lives to save their own. Christian Bale as the Batman also did fulfill his role as the protagonist, the superhero of the movie. Batman himself has two identities: the playboy millionair and the man behind the batsuit always ready to fight against the evil. The complexity of the character's inner feelings requires not only a great but also sensitive actor to truly understand it and, fortunately, Christian Bale acts as if he were born for the role, born to be Batman. For many moments, viewers were feeling so insecure about the menacing Joker with his malicious laughter that something credible had to be done to put their minds at rest, and that was when Batman appeared. No one else other than Batman can confront the Joker, and like Joker said, Batman completed him. And no one else other than Christian Bale has enough whatever it is that makes Batman to make a comic character so alive. Christopher Nolan's knack for storytelling techniques paid off quite well in this second installment of the brand new Batman series. He is gifted in keeping us viewers at the edge of our seats, guessing and predicting what was coming around the corner while the plot unveiled deliberately. For a moment for two, I thought I knew what was to happen the next scene but the unprecedented plot twists insisted on proving me wrong. Christopher Nolan is known for his scenes of intertwinement of past and present timeline and this trademark move of his adapts perfectly to the end of the movie. A movie this great doesn't hit theatre everyday, so make sure you have already booked a ticket for the earliest showtime in the nearest movie theatre. I salute you, the Dark Knight crew.
4.0~"The Dark Knight" should be named "Life With Batman" damonous Sign in Permalink This movie should be named "Life With Batman", because by the end of it you will have felt like you've spent half of your life with Bruce Wayne & Co. I am really surprised that there are SO many glowing user reviews here. This movie has its moments, but it really is WAY TOO LONG & SELF-INDULGENT!!! I generally like comic books & comic book-movies, but Dark Knight really misses the mark for me. Someone should've had the courage to tell Christopher Nolan to reign this in a bit and trim things down. I had already set low expectations for this, as it is the usual over-hyped sequel. For a while the movie pleasantly surprised me and exceeded my expectations handily. Foremost, I did not expect Heath Ledger's performance to be as good as the hype. But, he definitely did pull off a brutal & realistic portrayal of a terribly disturbed psychopath. The scenes with Joker should have stayed. The "extra stuffing" should have been trimmed (namely a whole mid-movie sub thread with Two-Face, and unnecessary exposition with Gordon & others). While "Batman Begins" was a flawed but excellent movie, "The Dark Knight" is a flawed but monolithic schizophrenic of a movie. From an early scene with 'copycat' heroes & villains, to bad Two-Face makeup & his unbelievable subplot; this is a movie that wants to be "so Serious", but should take its own advice from Joker: "Why So Serious?" --This was a problem that peeped its head out in the first movie (an incredibly realistic portrayal of Batman, marred by silly fantastical leaps-from-reality like "remote control bats" to "Batmobile indiscriminately crushing cop cars --the good guys-- to save his girl"). In this movie, these type of moments are multiplied 10-fold and really do a disservice to all the good scenes that ARE in the film. Performances are all up-to-par, with Ledger stealing the show, but Maggie Gyllenhaul really PALES in comparison to Katie Holmes. (What, did Cruise have her under lock-and-key like the tabloids say?) Katie is way cuter & sexier, and just a better fit for the role. Here again, in the utter sincerity of the acting, this just makes the end scenes with a hopelessly silly melodramatic plot device make fun of all those great Caine, Ledger, & Bale performances that came before it. I wish I could make my own cut of this movie. With some judicious splicing (and some large removals of Two-Face scenes), this movie could be a 90min wild ride with standout performances & great cat-and-mouse play between Batman & Joker. Instead, it's an overlong ode to Hollywood excess and over-indulgence that (in its end, although no were near AS bad) eventually reminded me of Spider-man 3's "lost ways".
1.0~This is one awful suck-ass movie unknown07 Sign in Permalink I am not a comic book reading loser or a fanatic of the Batman films. However, I did think Batman Begins was somewhat entertaining, so stupidly I believed that since this film had made so much money in so few days, there had to be something to it. Well, there wasn't. This is a boring, slow, cheaply made movie. The entire budget seems to have gone into making the Batmobile/motorcycle, some explosions, and not much else. The city of Gotham is clearly Chicago. There wasn't even an attempt to make it look any different! One can actually see the word "Chicago" on one of the buildings during a scene. As for the acting, Batman's costume looked cool and no acting was really required by him. The Joker character was o.k., but his voice was really gay. And what's with the guy with the eye liner? I think he was supposed to be the mayor. Was he gay, too? He should have gotten together with the Joker. The worst of the group was the ugly woman who played Rachel (the slut that led Batman on while dating that irritating Harvey Dent.) She was so hideous I had a hard time looking at the screen. Seriously. Is there a shortage of actresses in Hollywood? What fool cast this creature? This "movie" is about three hours long. It seemed like ten. And for most of the time, NOTHING HAPPENS! People were suckered into this crap by the hype and the marketing. One could sense the disappointment in the crowd when it was over. I've never seen so many looking at their cell phones during a movie. People paid to be entertained and got a long, slow, stupid, boring, mean spirited, disgusting, ass-numbing piece of crap. The Dark Night SUCKS.
5.0~A most personal opinion. May contain spoilers and cute fuzzy ponies. Kefka_8203 Sign in Permalink And thus it has been watched; one of the most talked about movies of latter years. The crowning achievement of Nolas career and the apex of Heath ledgers movie history. So is it worth the praise? Does it live up to the expectations set? In short, no. In long: Noooooooooooooooo. The Dark Knight should, at heart, be about Batman and his eternal nemesis the Joker. But Nolans uneven film-making assures this is not the case; The movie has more subplots than three full seasons of "Days of our Lives"; and most of the subplots feels as relevant as that show. To put it simply: This movie tried to put too much into too short a time. To move on to more specific details: The story has enough plot holes to sink Titanic; How does the Joker finance his operations when he seems unwilling to use cash? How does he get an army of loons to work as a cohesive and highly fanatical religious unit? How does he smuggle vast amounts of explosives onto two boats and one hospital? Another weak point is bad acting and just stupid plot movement; Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne, he is however horrible as Batman. His completely hilarious attempt at distorting his voice sounds like a severe case of throat cancer. It is of little consequence however as he's delegated to the role of sidekick anyway. The actor who played Harvey Dent is in the long run pointless; He is of TV-quality and can't handle his role .Then again, he does it better than Tommy Lee Jones did. Gary Oldman has something of a broken look over him; he seems to wish out of the movie as soon as possible. Michael Caine as Alfred isn't that good compared to the old Alfred, but he suffices. Morgan Freeman does what he does best; Speaks with an authoritative voice. And now..To the name of the movie: Heath Ledger, who's untimely death has elevated him to the sort of cult status only death celebrities gets. WHich is unfortunate for while he was a good actor his role here is NOT that good. His version of the Joker is decent, but looses itself in some sort of misguided attempt at realism. In the end the only thing it manages to come across as is boring. The Joker is realistic, and yet gifted with overwhelming superpowers which allows him to do pretty much everything he sets his mind too. And I mean anything; Build up a criminal empire strictly on IOU notes? Check. Smuggle several tons of explosives into what one can be assumed is heavily guarded ferries? Check. Do the same to a major hospital? Check. Convince the man who's wife to be he just murdered brutally that he isn't responsible because he's just "A dog"? Check. Damnit, this guy could probably convince Batman that he really does have feelings for Robin. Overall TDK is a uneven movie: It is hampered by poor acting, lousy effects and a horrible script. But it has some bright spots in mood and overall theme. In the end, it isn't enough and I cannot for the life of me understand why this movies is hailed as the second coming of Christ.
2.0~Over Rated Garbage movnut Sign in Permalink TDK is a long and tedious with themes common in superhero action movies. Some examples: 1. The hero who's not sure he wants to be one: Same as Spiderman 2, Superman 2, X-men, and even the previous Batman 2 movie. 2. The hero who must chose between the woman he loves and his duty to be a hero: again, the Superman movies, Spiderman movies, etc, etc. 3. The theme where the characters have to make a choice between two unappealing options: Every SAW movie. 4. And of course, the hero as martyr. "Why is he running Daddy, he didn't do anything wrong?" "He has to son. He's the hero we need but not the hero we want." Oh for the love of....blah blah blah. This was the entire theme of Spiderman 2. Waste of time and over rated. Come on folks. Let's demand a little more originality in our movies!
10.0~awesome film, pure modern cinema victuki Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is the best film of this year, that is for sure. It is hard just to highlight one of the many good things of it. The cast is fully committed to their roles, specially Bale, as a more mature Batman/Wayne. Freeman, Caine and Oldman, as expected, are not just supporting roles, but they have their own history within the whole picture. Regarding Heath Ledger, his performance is overwhelming. It is quite a pity he passed away, because his talent in this film could have increased so much; not only in a possible sequel, but in future projects. His joker, in the half part of the film, is pure and charismatic chaos, and his line about an unstoppable force of nature is superb.finally, the technical aspect of the movie is simply spectacular: the score is worth watching the movie, and the use of IMAX cameras in certain scenes result in a highly crafted film-making. I can only say that Th Dark Knight is pure cinema, and from this moment on I shall refer to Cristopher Nolan as Sir Cristopher. Thank you for teaching us the magic and pleasure of real film-making.
10.0~Batman hits my top ten! brad-mills Sign in Permalink This movie is definitely in my top ten favorite flicks of all time. First off I want to say that Heath Ledger was absolutely incredible as the Joker; he played such a convincing bad guy and his character broke boundaries in psychotic villain appeal. I truly have to applaud him for being such a versatile actor and making this character so believable. All the pieces fell perfectly to create this brilliant masterpiece. The chemistry was great, as was the dialogue. The special effects did not disappoint either! all of it... this is just an amazing movie... take out a little bit of cash today go down to your local movie theater and see this movie! its totally worth it!
1.0~Are you nuts? monkey_in_a_man_suit Sign in Permalink OK, I've heard enough of people saying this film is the best thing ever, you guys must be madder then the joker. This film was terrible, the only good thing being the way it was shot. The plot is poor, the writing terrible... I wanted it to end half an hour in. Worse yet this film destroys all the cool of the Joker, if shaking your head and laughing lots makes for good acting... I must be some kind of philistine. Comparing this to the original films Joker, you wonder what happened to make the writers feel this was a better image ...At least Morgan Freeman was good in his role as Morgan Freeman. This film was in fact so bad that I have been working to implant the false memory of giraffes into certain scenes, in order to distort and destroy my recollection of this rubbish, and to forget the money I wasted going to see it.
9.0~Simplicity is beauty. chr_botor Sign in Permalink The simpler it was the better it became. The movie just showed me what I need to do in oder to become like him. That's how great the movie was. A real detective story minus the character's cape and horns. The movie's complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple story. I like the way Bruce Wayne was portrayed, a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat. This is just a good way to hide his true identity, by being what people expect him to be. Like the Art of War, when you are strong you pretend that you are weak. A true player of the system so he can continue with his work. The Joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting. When you begin to see the character and not the actor, you begin to understand that Heath did a great job on the Joker. I remember the Joker not Heath. The movie's theme and music became my last-song-syndrome, great score by Hans Zimmer. The theme was really thought off and studied well, understood the need of the story. All I can say is this is what great movies are all about.
5.0~Decent Movie.... thats all Kummando Sign in Permalink I have to say I'm quite surprised that TDK has such a good rating here on IMDb. This movie is, without a shadow of doubt, the best superhero movie ever (at the moment), I don't think there's much discussion here, but let's face it, the standard superhero movie is a 2/10. I can understand why the masses like this movie so much, batman is a well known superhero, there's action, explosions, the plot is easy to follow, there's a love story, all the clichés. But that's exactly why the movie is just a cool summer movie, and not the best movie ever. The plot is minimalist and usually wanders off in useless sub-plots that bring nothing to the movie. Except from Ledger (that was outstanding), all the actors are mediocre to say the best. The lines they make these actors say are the final nail in the coffin, the dialogs sound fake and sometimes ridiculous, the pseudo philosophy someone tried to put in the movie is just sad to hear. In the end there's nothing I learned from watching this movie, there's nothing new in there. After all it's a decent movie to watch, but you cannot compare it to great classics, whoever thinks this is the best movie ever should really watch more cinema or maybe get a brain.
5.0~If this was dinner, I'd get indigestion swift-swift Sign in Permalink This review is influenced by hunger. I didn't make the time to properly eat before watching this film. That meant sitting for 152 minutes feeling hungry. Warning: this review contains food metaphors. A great director is like a great chef. Great chef's understand how to balance a menu and keep your tastebuds dancing through your meal. Great director's understand how to balance a great film, they know how to keep an audience hanging on every scene, line and twist on the screen. The senses work in harmony with anticipation. It's all about knowing what to add in and what to leave out. It's also all about mixing your ingredients, making all the elements work together to create an experience for your customer. A sandwich and a glass of juice can be just as enjoyable as a 7 course tasting menu, a straightforward revenge film can be just as exciting as a blockbuster trilogy. It all comes down to the balance of ingredients and the way they are put together. As with any film or meal I watch or eat I try not to decide before experiencing it. The proof is always in the pudding. First impressions count. The opening scene was promising, this was a neat little appetiser. As bank job scenes go, this was one of the better efforts. My first thought was that to make a villain more dangerous, show them in stark daylight  not dark shadows. It was a pleasant surprise to see The Joker in bright light. For some reason Batman has to be 'dark' - I appreciate that the original comics were 'dark', but I can't help thinking that a really brave director would play with that. Whenever the Joker was placed in harsh daylight that made him much more haunting than scuttling around in shadows. It was impossible not to watch the film without analysing Ledger's performance in a deeper way. His death was a tragedy and quite obviously added a macabre twist of reality to the film which the studio chose to run with. Some may feel uncomfortable with that, I don't. I'm sure if he were alive Ledger would want it that way and I am also sure he would welcome honest opinions of his performance. There has been talk that he should be nominated for an Oscar, to me rather than respecting him in death it actually belittles him. After the film I asked myself whether his performance merited an Oscar nomination; to me it didn't. It was obviously a great role to play and he played it excellently, but if that proves to be Oscar worthy, then I will find it hard to respect the Oscars as a standard of film excellence. What am I comparing against? Last years screen villain Javier Bardem. He set the bar for deranged psychopath. I asked myself; who would I not want to be in trouble with? Anton Chigurh every time. After Ledger it was a case of 'the rest of the film'. To me it was a let-down. The constant loud music and sound effects drowned out the mumbling of the actors. It was hard to follow what was going on and that may be the reason why I left wondering what the actual story was. There seemed to be too much going on, as if sticking to one clear plot line was a risk. As with the last film Michael Caine stole the best lines, Morgan Freeman also had his moments. Sadly Christian Bale seemed to sleepwalk through the film. I may be the only person in the known universe who thinks he was more wooden than a Welsh dresser. This was a big shame for me as I believe he's got what it takes to be a screen legend. Maybe it was the way he was directed, or the script? There were some clear absurdities running through the film. I can suspend disbelief enough to live with a caped billionaire flying around buildings and I can even let them get away with not putting a bullet into the Joker after about 15 minutes of the film. What I can't get is how Rachel Dawes was supposed to be 'really beautiful'. I'm sure Maggie Gyllenhaal is a lovely lady, but just as I'm not really handsome, she's not really beautiful. This had me confused. On top of all the other confusions that was where I lost the plot. If this film was dinner it would be a huge one course bowl with the tasty appetiser buried at the bottom. There would be nothing but rich fatty meats, chili's and heavy fish and egg sauces piled as high as possible and then covered with more sauces. Some beer would also be hoyed in and maybe some more sauce. There would be no rice, no veg and definitely no Brussels sprouts (not such a bad thing) It was as though nothing was allowed to breathe, there was just a relentless assault of set pieces and noise all resulting in a tasteless mess. Obviously a dish like that is going to be popular with some, I totally understand that, but I'm looking for something else. With the ingredients available I was disappointed with this film. With a more direct plot and story, breathing space and pacing (was there any?) this could have been so much better. Nolan obviously has talent, but I was left feeling as though he is much smarter than the film he has just released. Was he under pressure to tick studio boxes, has he lost sight of the trees? If he gets another crack at this franchise I hope that he strips away the extraneous mess and delivers a more direct, better balanced Batman which is worthy of a top 3 IMDb ranking.
5.0~Nowhere near as good as the hype darrjo23 Sign in Permalink Overall disappointed probably due to all the over-hype surrounding it. I had heard statements like best 'Superhero movie ever' which is way off the mark, its not even the best this year (See Hellboy 2 much better). I'm probably making it sound bad which it is not, its a good film but I thought 'Batman Begins' was much more original and interesting, this is much more like all the other movies in the genre with nothing particularly unique going on. As to Heath Ledger's performance as 'the Joker' again well over rated, Its certainly a good solid and convincing performance but its not an Oscar winning performance. That said its the highlight of the film and much better than Bale's Batman who sounds like a telephone Pervert.
9.0~Amazing film, Dark but great joshc616 Sign in Permalink Batman continues to wage war on crime with the help of Alfred, Gordon, and Lucius Fox. Yet someone is silently pulling the strings, laughing while he does it. THe Joker. He forces Gotham's White Knight to the edge of his sanity and pushes Batman to the point where he may cross hisonce fine line between hero, and Vigilante. Overall excellent film for Batman not exactly a family movie but definitely something to spend your money on. Bale is a natural yet we can't ignore Ledger who takes up the mantle of the Joker perfectly. A must see film. 10 stars.
8.0~I loved it. It was much better than Cats. I will see it again and again. sioenroux Sign in Permalink Best. Batman. Film. Ever. My faith in the Nolans was amply rewarded. After "Batman Begins," I was concerned that Hollywood had more effect on them than they had on it. But this film had a much better story than the first one, not quite as Hollywooded-up as the first one, darker than the first one, and Heath was achingly good. After every one of his scenes, I found myself doing a nervous, creeped-out laugh because of his chilling portrayal of madness. The action sequences were chaotic, poorly choreographed and boring, except for a couple of times when they focused on clever maneuvers by Batman (good idea, as that's all we really care about, not a bunch of random violent punching and kicking nonsense). But the good news is that there were not as many action sequences as I expected -- the story turned on plot, not on what happened with stupid car chases and explosions. I actually wondered, by the end, if the Nolans weren't a little bit making fun of the genre with the way they handled the action. It was a caricature of itself, overblown, impossible to follow and really boring -- and yet the movie was freaking incredible anyway. It kinda shows you that a good superhero film doesn't really need action sequences. Back to the important stuff: the story. The moral tangles that unfolded were smart, just a little bit complicated and very nicely handled. Not as much macho-crap bravado and "honor" nonsense as the first and more actual dilemmas about the consequences of our behavior, both good and bad. The focus on morality combined with the strong story turned what could have been just another good superhero movie into a piece of cinema history that transcends its genre -- this is a three-act opera, a tragedy of epic proportions and a dark, nasty comedy. Overall, bravo! And thank you, Nolans. I'm glad you did better than "Begins."
10.0~A Super Hero for Adults and Kids Alike dglink Sign in Permalink Finally, a super-hero film for adults. Avoiding the cartoon-style exploits of such super-heroes as Superman and Spiderman, director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a sophisticated, but hugely entertaining, take on the equally impressive Batman. "The Dark Knight" is witty, intelligent, and fast paced. The action scenes and effects are spectacular, but do not dominate or overwhelm the film. Nolan does not linger over gratuitous explosions and lengthy chases. When a scene has communicated its purpose, he wisely moves on. Despite the film's 2½ hour running time, the movie seems tight and has little excess. Although Batman has no Robin, he is surrounded by a fine group of villains and supporters. Michael Caine underplays the quasi-butler, but delivers some amusing lines, and Morgan Freeman is solid and reassuring as another of Bruce Wayne's employees. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman ably hold up the public servant side of the equation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine as Rachel Dawes, although few demands were made on her talents. In the central role, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne/Batman. His icy-perfect face and pumped-up body are physically all that a Batman should be. Yet beneath the glossy exterior, he manages to breathe life into the crusading vigilante. Then, of course, there is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger's performance steals every scene that he is in. Behind a crude childish makeup, he is at once demented, evil, funny, and over-the-top entertaining. However, even when he is delivering a humorous line, the villainous edge remains. When Ledger flicks his tongue, plays with his hands, or rolls his eyes, he captures the audience and holds them with his magic. Future super-hero films undoubtedly will be measured against "The Dark Knight." From Batman's stylish costume, his motorcycle, and the Batmobile to the dark, glistening cinematography, the stylish art direction, and the state-of-the-art special effects, the film rarely falters. With a sterling cast and a gifted director, "The Dark Knight" sets a new standard for summer action flicks. At last, a comic-book super-hero film that will not only grab the key pre-teen male audience, but also bring in discerning adults who may never have read a comic book or attended a movie in the summer. Way to go, Batman.
1.0~more mainstream and overrated than Britney Spears... nikpapay80 Sign in Permalink I saw batman begins and liked it although at the beginning i had a negative feeling. For the dark knight i went to the movies with the greatest expectations, after the big commercial that followed heath ledger's death everyone seemed to have liked it. What a disappointment that was. The movie is not bad but the critics make me hate it. Seriously i think that there are some movies ine the top #250 that are overrated but this one takes the cake.... From where i have to start? the action scenes are nothing spectacular, even tim burtons movie had better ones... The music doesn't fit at the most of the sequences there's a repetitive tired to death theme that makes in almost every sequence( that's the feeling i had ). Batman's voice is like robocop is talking or something like that it's not even clear what he is saying in some points. I think it would be easier to say what i liked on this movie cause there are not many things i liked.... Well heath ledger's acting was good although i think that jack nickolson's acting was more close to what i had in mind of joker character, more sarcastic and funny in a crazy way. Heath made a good bad guy but he is more serious than a joker should be, so why so serious? Avoid this movie there are a lot of better movies out there, it's just a trendy hype that i hope in some years will fade away.
6.0~Good but saying its the best movie ever is retarded Nclaw Sign in Permalink I was never a fan of the batman comics or the cartoons but found batman begins extremely entertaining and certainly did revive the franchise. The dark knight was good but again over-hyped due to mainstreams movie viewers saying its best movie ever so they look cool. Im sure there's a lot of you out there calling this the best movie ever who said the same thing about transformers, transformers 2, pirates of Caribbeans etc. Those people really need to stop because it does not make you look or sound intelligent or have good taste at all. Let me start with the pros. The designs in this film is top notch, from the batman armor to the bat mobile and particularly the joker. Some of the stuns were actually pretty good also (eg. Kinapping Asian mob accountant from hong Kong. Christian bale who is one of my favorite actor was good enough, not brilliant, just good enough. The joker played by ledger was funny and at the same time repulsive. For instance when he interrupted the mob meeting, placed a pencil on the table and said "you wanna see a magic trick?" and preceded to smashing a bodyguard's head into the pencil. It was a very nice touch and established the jokers personality earlier on. OK, now onto the bad stuffs. Aaron Eckhart was never my favorite actor and again this film reminded me why. Its not the fact that he cant act but you can never quite take him serious enough, which is bad in a movie as dark as this.. The only annoying thing i found about him was his voice when he is batman, i know he is trying to hide his identity but the growling was just overdone at times. Also, the story was Way too long, very choppy with some elements completely unnecessary, like the bombs on the 2 ferries at the end. And whats with batman and getting his ass kicked by dogs, i mean hes got all these Fancy gadgets but doesn't even have some sort of taser to deal with the dogs? instead he rolled around on the ground looking like an idiot while the joker hit him with a steel pipe doing no damage at all. Hardly good actions in my opinion. In conclusion, The dark knight is an OK action film with its shares of good and bads. But as always its the story development and length which stopped it from becoming a great film like its predecessor. That being said, it is certainly a decent rent worth its money just don't believe the hypes and 10/10 comments by these hypocrites.
10.0~What a thrill! pro-basketballer Sign in Permalink I haven't seen a better movie for a long long time! The acting is perfect, the cast is perfect, the plot is perfect and the way it gradually picks up a long with the movie makes it a masterpiece! I simply love this movie and you will too! Heath's joker is indeed scary! but people say he's not funny but he is! When he did that "pencil" trick it made me chuckle a bit cause his insanity does give you the case of giggles but yet he still manages to preserve his joker as one mean, psychotic killer. I think Bale so far is the best batman so far, i didn't like George Clooney's batman or Val Kilmer's batman. However Micheal Keaton did prove as a good batman when he fought against the joker in 89's film. This movie is all what you can ask for, go see it, enjoy it and keep your finger's crossed that Nolan and Bale will make a sequel together because those 2 make a perfect team.
6.0~Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin ran away........ lizziebeth-1 Sign in Permalink Sigh. They almost got it right, and with the right franchise too (Batman as the HUNTED hero had the most potential as allegory for the male human condition). Unfortunately at some point the fact that this is a reboot (of a reboot)^3--in just the movie series alone--is a problem. It implies a serious weakness in the CONCEPT ITSELF. As I was writing this review I asked myself just when did I drop out of this movie? -11 minutes in. By then there were already enough annoyances to have induced my disengagement. Here are some of them: 1) The reboots(!); 2) the bank job prologue (opening scene) which adapts the basic story of 44Minutes:The_North_Hollywood_Shoot-Out(2003 made-for-TV docudrama); 3) wasting William Fichtner in a nothing mobster role all over in a second; 4) too many red herrings with the ridiculous faux "Batdudes"; 5) Batman's audio-"soured" voice; 6) Lt.Gordon(Oldman)'s similarly but accidentally audio-"soured" voice in the vault scene as he says "we'd have to hit all the banks simultaneously, SWAT teams..." (we DID notice,sorry) --and all this within the first 11mins!! Then there was the manipulative attempt at confusing the ignorant in the audience with the ruse about Commissioner Gordon. Anyone who knows this term will not accept LIEUTENANT Gordon's untimely death, but it's enough to turn us against the screenwriter. This is called "ratcheting" the plot, aka "yanking the audience's chain". And there's a lot more where that came from in this movie--that's its main problem. One admittedly unavoidable problem was caused be the basic pull--antagonism--in a graphic novel adaptation into live action: superhero comics naturally venture into the fantastic, and it's hard to show the impossible for real. If you're trying to insert fantasy into a police procedural, you cannot get gross or outlandish in the way you represent this. For instance, during the transportation scene with Harvey Dent(Eckhart), although it already rankles that the truck-driver's offsider does nothing to prevent the hijacking during the VERY OBVIOUS criminal misdirection with the burning firetruck, the over-the-top nature of the graffiti'd word "SLAUGHTER" on the side of the attacking rig just makes you lose patience with their abandonment of their previous police procedural tone. Ebert likes this installment best. I know why; it's because this sequel tries so hard to be both realistic and allegorical towards society's ills, but it's at junctures like the above hijack scene that if they get it just a little bit on the "wrong" side for people like me, they take us out of their picture. And I have bad news for the filmmakers: sooner or later we will all be thinking like this. It's a function of their having raised the bar, but just not far enough, so it undermines its own standard. For people like them, CGI is a trap like catnip. It's all in the tone that you strike; and if you decided that it's OK to depict Two-Face's face all in CGI, revealing teeth underneath the skinless CG-muscle and tendons on that side, then you deserve the flak you're going to cop for it. Here it is: what a SHODDY, mistaken choice that was! It makes your almost-great movie into an embarrassing piece of "shlock"--YES, there is a word for it. Shlock. Or shtick. Where is Mel Brooks when you really need him? More examples of wrong tonal balance: 7) the dinner debate scene about Batman's future role in a democracy is theoretically very admirable, but misfires because it's misplaced at the table amidst all the verbal fencing between two couples(!)--its gravitas is lost in the shuffle; 8) Bruce Wayne's awful speech pillorying Harvey Dent undermines our faith in him too, which he tries to undo for Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal's annoying replacement for Katie Holmes again smacks of "rebootism"). His venom was unnecessary, what was his point?; 9) (just a little bit) more screen-time should have been paid to the emergent concern of Harvey/Gordon's prisoners in the traffic snarl, so we could emotionally join in on the ferry for the scene's significance for humane compassion. The battle of wills with The Joker about this was significant, but the audience doesn't get to chew over the so-called Prisoner's Dilemma (from game theory); 10) Two-Face was too rabid in his scenes. He/Harvey used to be well-adjusted, so the (ratcheted) petrol burn and the accidental loss of his fiancée simply didn't justify why he became so violent. Without showing his back-story, it's irresponsible to either kill him or turn him so deeply and irrevocably psychotic, all in one picture. Where's the deep significance of "what he lost"?; 11) Dent's hospital-room yelling is implausible: he shouldn't have enough strength to roar at Gordon, let alone have the option of rejecting skin grafts. No ER patient would be given that option. Since this is completely implausible, why ruin our disbelief?; 12-A) Dent's skeletal musculature CG vision is also wrong within the Batman mythos. But burn victims never have clean muscle afterwards anyway, so why depict a falsity when you could have just applied practical prosthetics? -for obvious directorial (self-)indulgence given access to cheap CGI; 12-B) there was no plotwise reason for the deep burn either, since Batman was rescuing Dent from the flames. Why was Two-Face burned? -Again, purely directorial self-indulgence with CG (I would've loved to hear the screaming-match in the Exec Prod's office about this); 13) the darkened interrogation cell for The Joker was also audience-manipulative directorial self-indulgence. The room, if you recall, was darkened excessively during Gordon's interrogation, just so the Batman reveal could shock the audience. Completely implausible; wouldn't have worked in real life because reality can't control "the fourth wall" (the audience's POV). Overripe and ridiculous. B-TDK(2008) does contain several great points, but I'm not wasting word-count on them. Suffice to say that "Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin (CLEARLY) ran away"...
1.0~Uttter dross jm-116 Sign in Permalink I don't know what film i saw - but i know i wasted 152 mins of my life. There's virtually nothing positive about this film Perhaps it's the over hyped that's ruined an average film. The film obviously suffered from the loss of Heath Ledger - though it's unclear at what point in the filming this happened (if at all). Maybe it's just been terribly scripted and badly edited. There's no suspense - every idea in the film has been seen before. I think the whole cinema sat in disbelief in how bad this film is - at the end there was only relief that it had finished. Caine is superbly cast as Alfred, Bale lacks from a poor script and a empty storyline, which is a shame, because Batman Begins was pretty good film Maybe this film appeals the American audience - but on the opening night at my local cinema in N London - 99% of people walked out very disappointed
5.0~Makes me sleepy. Giallo1963 Sign in Permalink I've been trying to see what's so great about this movie and I still don't see why it's so great. I find the movie dull and each time when I watch it I get sleepy and fall asleep halfway through the movie. When I'm not asleep I usually start doing something else, like some push-ups, think about the meaning of life or cook some food. I mean, I find it boring because everything has to be explained down to the smallest detail no matter how obvious it may be which make the movie too long and dragging. It's not bad but it gets boring when painfully obvious things get explained by the characters to the audience. The only times I seriously get interested is when Heath Ledger is on screen. He was mesmerizing as the Joker as well as creepy, he had a strong presence on screen. Unlike Christian Bale as Batman, boy he was so boring if you ask me as he was in 'Batman Begins'. His portrayal of Batman is in my opinion the dullest to date he has done as an actor. He's by no means a bad actor and his portrayal of Bruce Wayne is in my opinion the best portrayal of Wayne yet, but he fell flat as Batman staggering around like an amateur boxer in the fight scenes and taking himself too seriously. Not to mention the voice. But anyway, the plot as in 'Batman Begins' isn't that interesting. It's basically like 'Batman' from 1989: Stop the Joker and ruin his scheme. It's not a bad premises but maybe they could have gone with something more original. Story wise I think it is boring compared to the story of 'Batman Begins', I feel the story didn't bring merits of Batman and instead made him more boring compared to 'Batman Begins' and it was more like a repetition of how Batman was portrayed. 'Batman Begins' showed potential of being able to go places where previous silver screen portrayals didn't go but we got the sub-plots to stretch the basic formula instead. I didn't care for the sub-plots either since Two-Face was boring as well if you ask me. Also the movie's tragedy lost power when the woman playing Rachel was played by another actress. I felt completely indifferent to Rachel and Harvey. Which is kind of a pity. Also "Why so serious?" Seriously why so serious? The movie is so serious it barely have any sense of humor, it takes itself so seriously that it makes me sleepy by the thought of watching it again. Also Chrisopher Nolan still don't know how to film fight sequences, we just get shoddily shot and edited fight scenes where henchmen and Batman stagger around. If the crew kept saying Bale was such an awesome fighter I would have loved to see it. It also still has that stupidity of having goons mindlessly run towards Batman, whilst pointing guns at him without ever shooting him although they have the obvious advantage. Surely Americans who are gun fanatics would have turned Batsy into Swiss cheese in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Not much for me to find merit in this movie but 5/10 nevertheless for the cinematography and its bleak darkness.
7.0~#1 movie of all time, is this a Joke? A_Tuluie Sign in Permalink 5 star reviews from respected movie reviewers. Rated #1 on IMDb as being the best movie ever made. You could at least say that I was excited to see this movie. The thing Christopher Nolan does and does very well, is giving his movies a certain type of gritty dark mood and 'The Dark Knight' captures this mood better then ever before. The action sequences, music and specially the exceptional camera work combined make this movie a joy for the eye from start to end. Also as we explored the character of batman in ' Batman Begins', the movie starts with a quick pace and holds on to this through the whole film. Also the acting in the movie is surprisingly above average. While Christian Bale does a descent batman (not much screen time as Bruce Wayne), is the Joker played by Heath Ledger a delight to watch. Also Aaron Eckhart who is among the top (with the likes of Josh Lucas) of non-charismatic actors, is surprisingly good as he portrays the inner turmoil of the character he becomes. Where the movie fails is the fact that there is no clear choice made whether the purpose of it would be to entertain, educate or do both. The Joker is on a rampant mission to destroy Gotham city, but we never know why he does this. We know it is not for the money, it is a zero sum game to him. But is it then because of the problematic childhood or just because the man is crazy? Second thing is that while the action driven sequences are very descent, but never mind-blowing at all, and in many cases already done in other movies. You cannot exclude the fact that the director at least seems to be 'inspired' by sequences from 'Heat' and 'Mission Impossible III'. Even at the big finale the Joker seems to put a morality test in the hands of some cons and civilians which could directly come from a 'Saw' movie. After two and a half hours (WHY?) I can conclude that while this movie absolutely supersedes any previous superhero movies like the Spidermans and the Supermans, it is nothing more then a genuine summer blockbuster which many will look back at over a few years and wonder 'did we really rate this movie as better then the Godfather?
8.0~It was the best of movies; it was the worst of movies skay_baltimore Sign in Permalink 1. This movie at least attempted to be more than just a glorified cartoon -- by focusing on some exquisite moral choices/dilemmas, beauty/ugliness, loyalty/betrayal, etc. That is its main strength, IMO. 2. This movie -- as others have pointed out already -- has SO MANY plot inconsistencies/totally unrealistic sequences (even for a fantasy flick), it falls BELOW cartoon-like in that regard. That is its main -- and most annoying -- weakness. As far as the acting goes -- the Joker clearly stole the show. But the problems weren't really with the acting -- they were with the totally unrealistic way the plot evolved. Way too many subplots; not enough glue holding the whole thing together. You have to give the director credit for trying to create something of epic proportions, but you also have to hold him accountable for failing to deliver on that potential.
9.0~If not 'the dark knight'....then nothing prudviraj Sign in Permalink I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for....
2.0~Don't believe the hype.not even close as good as Ironman unseenforcez Sign in Permalink Should have been titled The Joker as his character is the only interesting thing in the movie.Hokey fight scenes,Batman talking under his breath in every scene.Plot was typical crap.Joker was good for the most part.The district attorney was a joke,his g/f was sleeping with him and Batman at the same time(this is good ideas to put in our kids minds eh?) This movie got a whole bunch of PR but did not deliver,luckily for the movie creators there are a lot of ignorant people out there willing to pay for this garbage.Christian Bale lowered his integrity as an actor with this one.Ironman and Spiderman 3 are so much better than this its pathetic.If Heath Ledger didn't die during the filming i wonder how many sales it would have made.
4.0~I can't believe the hype overdrive opalcomp Sign in Permalink It is unnerving that this film has received one of the highest rankings I have seen or heard of at IMDb, although I am a part-timer here. My experience has been that even the best films of the last century are generally in the 8.0 - 9.0 range. Anyway, let me go beyond analysis of reviews. I saw the movie last night, and was struck first by how difficult the voices were to hear. My son, who is 19, spontaneously offered the same comment to me. And there were no British accents (that I recall)! It was the loud, ominous music pulsing in the background, and possibly issues in the theater (which appeared to be very well maintained, however), that seemed to obscure the dialogue in many places. Now, the guts of the movie: this film falls into the category of slightly better-than-average kids/fantasy movie. The top in that field was indeed Lord of the Rings (all three), and I also consider Terminator 1 and 2, and the first Matrix, to all exceed The Dark Knight by quite a margin in enjoyability and quality. So, I am not set against fantasy as a category of entertainment or creativity. However, this movie was fragmented with many sub-plots that did not seem artistically to jell well together. There was also a typical lack of subtlety in the actors (and their scripts) that you might expect in comic book fantasy, and during my watching of Dark Knight I constantly missed movies such as (to name just a very few) Dr. Strangelove, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Swept Away, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life, which all exceeded Dark Knight in wit, dialogue, acting, or humor (or all the above). What were the strong points? Well, again, it was not so bad for the genre - the acting was workmanlike given the one-dimensional or unreal dialogue. The Joker (Heath Ledger) really was performed with great intensity and is probably the standout feature the breaks the limits of the rest of the film. The characterizations were far from terrible - touches of humor with Alfred (Michael Caine), the love interest that had some sensitivity and adultiness to it, and again, Joker's performance. When does our public have a chance to see real movies of quality, and learn to distinguish expensive, earnest, but childlike efforts from masterworks of adult art, whether comedy, adventure, or tragedy? Apparently not very often. Despite the noticeable islands of quality in Dark Knight, my sense was that of having been swept away by a wave of excess and hyper-drama, and I came away feeling that there were a wide variety of better ways I could have passed three hours.
10.0~Simply Incredible CeruleanRosex Sign in Permalink The film was awesome, but what was the deciding factor? Ledger. Heath was incredible. I can't even believe it was really him. He looks like him, like Heath, under all that makeup, but he IS the Joker. He isn't an actor portraying the Joker. He IS the Joker. He is perfect, spectacular, amazing, chilling, terrifying, beautiful. Never will there be a more incredible performance by any actor in any role. I hope that Heath will be remember well, as one of the bravest young actors there has ever been. For his first real breakthrough part, he took a role as a gay cowboy. A man needs to be incredibly comfortable in himself to take such a risk, and everyone should have utmost respect for the help he was able to lend to show the straight community that gay is not a disease, a defect, or a problem. It just is. And for his next breakthrough role, the Joker. Enough said. "Brevity is the sole of wit." -Polonius-
9.0~The Best Superhero Movie So Far thomas-allen10 Sign in Permalink I've really enjoyed Christopher Nolan's reinvention of Batman. I recently saw Batman Begins and I thought it was the best Batman movie of the series.The origin story was handled very well for such a loved comic book superhero. And now, Batman is back! The Dark Knight centres around Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale), Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman)and new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) trying to track down the crazed and murderous psychopath, The Joker (Heath Ledger) and stop him from causing chaos and havoc in Gotham City. The Dark Knight is not only one of the best movies of 2008 so far, it very well might be the best superhero movie yet. The performances in the film are terrific and serve the story well. The best actor has to be Heath Ledger as The Joker. In my opinion, he's the best actor to have portrayed and capture the philosophy of the character. He's really put his stamp on it and made it his own. It's horrible that he didn't live to see what a fantastic job he's done. He deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. After seeing The Dark Knight, I can't wait for the next Batman movie, that's how great this film is! 9/10
3.0~Totally overrated g-leno Sign in Permalink Quite possibly the most over hyped and overrated pile of junk in my lifetime. Batman Begins was a fine movie and apart from the frankly terrible scarecrow, was an enjoyable watch. The Dark Knight was hailed as as masterpiece, I disagree. Heath Ledger was not a Joker. If it had been a villain called something else i would not have had a problem but this is so far away from the source material that it makes no sense for them to even refer to him as the joker. Jack Nicholson was better in every way. Two face was good but hardly used at all. On top of all of that the whole idea of making a film about a comic book 'realistic' is pointless, the whole idea of batman is unrealistic, just the way it should be. To all those people who say 'this film is darker which makes it better' you are all forgetting what happens, the joker actually dies in the 1989 film, no one dies in this. If you are a fan of classic batman, DO NOT watch this film, stick with the vastly superior Tim Burton film!
10.0~Slaughter is the best medicine. channelgathers Sign in Permalink The sequel did not disappoint. "The Dark Knight" is a carefully constructed action movie -slash- morality play, something you don't see quite often in genres such as this. The films are always some monstrosity caused by the bad guys, the hero tracks them down and saves the day. Here, as much as the hero is flawed as he is redeeming, the villains are multifaceted and just as ordinary as we are. The movie starts, of course, with a bad thing -- a mischievous bank robbery orchestrated by The Joker (Heath Ledger). Where else does he get his funds for ammunition, anyway? The act leads to some knee-trembling within the bad elements of Gotham City, who are becoming increasingly handicapped because of "the triumvirate": Batman (Bale), the police force led by Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and the new district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The thugs desperately need to restore the "natural order of things", and The Joker comes along and offers them a solution. The Joker loves anarchy. A series of chaos ensue, and the city has turned into a virtual ticking time bomb, unpredictable as to who the next high-profile victim or innocent casualty is. District Attorney Dent, brimming with idealism, vows to prosecute the criminals and rid them of the place. Commissioner Gordon, who has been fighting crime all his life, straddles on the fine line. Batman wonders whether all this recklessness has been the result of his doing, and ponders on giving up the battle. This particular story is the centerpiece of the film. Beyond the amazing action scenes -- and there are a lot -- the "morality play" I first mentioned is deeply evident in the actions of these three men. How much are you willing to sacrifice for the greater good? How strong is your conviction? That these men, impenetrable as they may seem are fallible too. To say that "The Dark Knight" is a gloomy film is partially true. Apart from the dark undertones and violence and bleakness, there is still some humor inserted alongside, sometimes in the more unexpected situations. There is one scene with The Joker in a hospital that is particularly hard to forget (and laugh about). What I love about the movie is the moving pictures themselves. Being the first full-length movie shot entirely in IMAX definition, the shots are very clear and crisp that you don't have to squint to look for clues because everything's visually exciting. Chicago is turned into a 360-degree underworld. When Batman travels halfway around the world to Hong Kong, you can just marvel at the astounding skyscrapers and take a breathtaking view like a virtual bungee-jump as he suspends himself on one. The cast, main and supporting, gave a very strong, stellar performance. Bale is effective in portraying Batman's vulnerability, and is downright amazing in the action sequences. Gyllenhaal takes one notch higher from Holmes' Dawes and gives it more personality and assertiveness. Eckhart earns major chops for portraying a very impassioned Dent (and then Two-Face), because it makes for a good character study -- is he a villain or simply a hero gone astray? There is certainly no other man to reprise as Gordon than Oldman with his subtlety; and Caine and Freeman makes the most of their screen time as Wayne's dependable counsels, at the expense of wit. The cast also includes Eric Roberts as a mob boss, Nestor Carbonell as the mayor; and if you observed earlier in the film, Cillian Murphy returned in a split second as "Batman Begins" nemesis Scarecrow. The one character I have evidently missed out is mentioned especially last, because he is the best thing about "The Dark Knight". Heath Ledger gave a terrific, superlative performance as The Joker. When I first heard news that he was cast as the new Batman villain years ago, I felt skeptical about it. He never really played the bad guy in films, and I couldn't imagine himself undertaking such a major role as this. I was dead wrong. Every tic, every enunciation, every line is simply pitch-perfect. He essayed the role of The Joker so well he was unrecognizable. He stole every scene he was part of. I laughed a lot because he played The Joker with delirious delight that it was infectious. To think that this his last movie is saddening indeed, because if he were still making movies, I'm sure that he would've made his succeeding roles as great as this, and showed everyone his full potential. Overall, "The Dark Knight" is one I'd definitely recommend anyone to watch -- if you're looking for a great story, great action, great scenes, great cast -- I have never seen a better movie in years. --- Read my entire review at http://www.cinemaroll.com/Action/The-Dark-Knight.175381
9.0~A Batman Of Shakesperean Proportions littlemartinarocena Sign in Permalink Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. "The Dark Knight" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!
6.0~Unpleasant without redemption PipAndSqueak Sign in Permalink If I'd been sitting at the end of a row in the cinema I would have left after 30 minutes. I've sat through enough hard hitting films to know the difference between meaningful grit and wanton hatefulness. The production values in this film are so high that the 'terror' that is deliberately laid down seems genuinely possible in its evilness. The killings and explosions however do not support the supposedly 'psychological' subtext. Two men sitting either side of the same coin...or as Gotham DA's coin shows....both the same side... is not adequately developed. The story's many conflagrations and large set piece explosions cannot possibly have been set up by one man (The Joker) in any reasonable timescale - and certainly not in the one suggested in the film. The whole thing is just preposterous - it is just an exercise in slash and burn without relief. I had one hell of a headache after seeing this film - I can't have been the only one. One other patron I heard afterwards was positively spitting with rage and contempt over being made to see a film about 'some psychopathic sociopath not Batman'. Heath Ledger evidently had to do himself in in order to kill off the blasted character seeing as Batman wasn't going to.
10.0~One Of The Greatest Superhero/Comic Book Films And Sequels Ever Made. A True Classic From Christopher Nolan. jcbutthead86 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is an absolute classic and is not only one of the best Superhero/Comic Book films ever made but also one of the best Sequels ever made. Filled with Powerful direction,Brilliant Acting performances and excellent Action,The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan at his best and most powerful. Set after the events in Batman Begins,The Dark Knight now tells the story about how now Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)has to not only deal with the Mob,but also has to deal with a psychotic criminal named The Joker(Heath Ledger)who wants the destroy Gotham City and make the innocent corrupt. The Dark Knight is a powerful and unforgettable Classic that came out month after Heath Ledger's tragic death which cast a shadow over the film and with or without Ledger presence The Dark Knight is still an excellent film. With The Dark Knight Christopher Nolan has created an unforgettable cinematic experience,giving viewers a bigger and larger film than Batman Begins because when you look at Batman Begins as great as it is you feel like Nolan was taking a test drive with a car and trying to know the Batman world,but with The Dark Knight Nolan does not a take a test and knows this world from the ground up. With TDK Nolan gives viewers a true epic scope raising the Superhero genre to another level and makes a complex film filled with tragedy and sadness. TDK while definitely a Superhero/Comic Book film has much more in common with a Crime Drama because of gangsters and the Mob always in the film and the Cops and lawyers that are always trying to stop them and The Joker while also dealing with Money and corruption. You feel like you are watching a Superhero film if it were directed by Martin Scorsese or Michael Mann because like the Crime Dramas of those two films TDK deals with many characters and themes such as the crime,corruption and moral ambiguity. In other words TDK has more in common with Epic Crime Dramas like The Godfather,Goodfellas,Casino,The Departed and Heat than say The Fantastic Four films. Nolan creates a world in TDK where there is a since of doom and dread all around where the city of Gotham is being held hostage and just filled with tension and falling apart and waiting to explode in a shred of darkness. Batman and The Joker in this is a true story of Good and Evil with Batman trying to defend and protect the citizens of Gotham City and trying to bring some good into the city and does not kill,but The Joker is different because The Joker is true evil that just wants to see Gotham City burn and corrupt the innocent people of the city including Batman himself. The Joker believes that people in general are not good and can be brought down to his level of darkness. The film is battle but a complex one because Batman asks himself this question:What can I do at all costs to stop The Joker? Can Batman do it the right way or could Batman kill The Joker and be brought down to The Joker's level? TDK is a chess game and also a Cat and Mouse game where Batman is not only trying to save Gotham but trying to beat The Joker. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan is superb with dialog and scenes that are something William Shakespere would write because the film is filled with sadness and darkness all over. Although the film is long at 2 Hours and 32 minutes the movie moves by so fast you would think that you were watching a 90 minute film than a two and half hour film. The Action scenes in the film are masterful and are much more intense than in BB. The Action is filled with great suspense and jaw-dropping visuals and will have you glued to the screen. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and like I said before this film will have you glued to the screen but also on the edge of your seat leaving you wanting more. It is a great,sad and tragic conclusion that will leave asking questions and prepares viewers for The Dark Knight Rises. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent once again as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing depth,toughness and sadness to the role. The late Heath Ledger earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant and terrifying performance as The Joker. Ledger's performance is scary,menacing and masterful making Ledger's Joker one of the greatest villains in movie history. Aaron Eckhart is great as Harvey Dent,an idealistic lawyer. Michael Caine is great once again as Alfred,Bruce's Butler. Maggie Gyllenhaal does a good job as Rachel,Bruce and Harvey's love interest. Gary Oldman is fantastic once again as Officer Jim Gordon. Morgan Freeman is great once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Eric Roberts(Maroni),Anthony Michael Hall(Mike Engel),Richie Coaster(Chechen),Cillian Murphy(Scarecrow)and Nathan Gamble(James Gordan Jr.)give good performances as well. The direction by Christopher Nolan is masterful and brilliant,with Nolan using great camera angles and giving the film a haunting and beautiful visual style and also does great job in the Action scenes. Great direction from Nolan. The score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is excellent,dark and intense and matches the gritty and grim tone of the film. Amazing score by Zimmer and Howard. In final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I Highly suggest you see The Dark Knight,one of the best sequels ever made and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.
1.0~hyped garbage kmartipawn Sign in Permalink This movie is seriously over hyped crap. From a completely technical view it has some merits. It's well filmed, the shots and cutting are phenomenal. The plot has some merit although there was a whole of one thing I didn't see coming throughout the whole film. The one scene I enjoyed is on the boats, a deep look into humanity's fragile tempers. Christian Bale is terrible in his role of batman. His voice is so forced, he makes it way too gravelly and just botches the whole thing. He allows absolutely no subtlety and the love story angle is so contrived. God he was terrible. Oooh now we get to the poster boy Heath Ledger... OK I do have to grant that he did a fairly good job in his portrayal of the joker, his lines are well delivered and his acting is good. But this idea that he is now the holy grail of acting is just stupid. He died so now everyone feels like they can't critique him. When did death make you amazing? Fine then Hitler was a saint cause he died, we aren't allowed to say he messed up.... ever. He did a good job but there have been far better actors. I feel the writing was almost as important to the character as his acting, doesn't matter how good you act if the writing sucks the movie sucks. On to a one Aaron Eckhart, decent acting. Far better in Thank you for smoking but that's besides the point. I don't have much to say other than he started really strong and finished off pretty weak. After one of the plot twists his acting just gets mediocre. All in all this movie would have been really good, I mean phenomenal if it weren't for all of the hype around it. I saw it in theaters a day or so after opening and enjoyed it.... until about the 4 millionth "why so serious?" half an hour after it was over. It was good but it belongs in maybe the low hundreds on the top 250 list not top 10.
7.0~Amazing But Over-rated baron-tockey Sign in Permalink I won't argue that The Dark Knight was an amazing movie done with the most beautiful effects and some amazing acting. The cast was almost perfect. However, and this is where most people will disagree with me, it was over-rated beyond all belief. This shouldn't be considered the top 100 by any means on this website. I thought the movie was great but I nearly lost it when I saw this fact. So many films deserve the nod over this. Classics such as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Witches of Eastwick, Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs, A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and multiple others are literally defining films in this industry. Unfortunately, this movie was nothing but entertaining. It had no features that made it defining or noteworthy.
3.0~For Action Film Fans Only GeneSiskel Sign in Permalink In the old days, film-makers told stories. Now they create effects. That tells you pretty much all you need to know about "The Dark Knight." If you like car chases with flashy digitization and sonic booms, you'll love "The Dark Knight." Otherwise, stay home and read a book. Admittedly "The Dark Knight" looks spectacular on an Imax screen, and Heath Ledger has to be a hands down winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. There are also plenty of familiar faces passing through the production -- Michael Caine, once a leading man, doing his by now standard Gielgud imitation as a butler, Morgan Freeman doing his by now standard role as God/CEO/Chief Technology Officer, Maggie Gyllenhall as the prim sexless object of everyone's affections, Christian Bale as the trust fund guy himself, Aaron Eckhart as an untouchable prosecutor. They meander and lurch through a plot so turgid that it isn't even worth diagramming as they face assorted actual and threatened explosions, free falls, assaults with deadly weapons, shattered windows, fires, and the aforementioned vehicle chases. For 152 minutes or so until finally, at long last, the closing credits come up, and everyone can go home. There's no magic, no mystery, no glamor, no insight, no humanity in this movie. It's all "BANG," "POW," ZAP," "CRASH," "BOOM." And it's all pointless.
10.0~The Dark Knight IS Film Perfection FrightenedInmateNumberTwo Sign in Permalink After 3 long years, it has finally arrived. The sequel to 'Batman Begins', the highly anticipated 'The Dark Knight'. And it in no way disappoints. How does one describe THE DARK KNIGHT? Revolutionary? Sheer masterpiece? It's safe to say that THE DARK KNIGHT is everything, even more than what that I wanted in the sequel to the 2005 masterpiece BATMAN BEGINS. Throughout 'Batman Begins', I sat there wondering how Christopher Nolan was going to top this. When the Joker's card was revealed at the end of the film, I knew that the next installment was going to be something to remember forever. And boy, does Nolan deliver! It's dark, it's gritty, and it's excessively violent, even for a Batman movie. But thats what makes it so darn good. Gone are the days of slapstick Batman. Nolan is ushering in a new era of the Caped Crusader, with adult concepts, brutal fight scenes, horrifying villains and a realism that makes this latest installment, the best comic book film yet. But in the end, this movie is all about one particular character: The Joker. Of course, the death of Aussie Heath Ledger, who plays the Joker in this film, casts a shadow of minds of viewers yet to see the film. I can guarantee you, that Heath's final role as the psychotic clown, will be remembered forever as the standout film of his career. Rarely ever, do audiences ever see a movie where the actor COMPLETELY embodies the character they are portraying to the point of no return. Heath Ledger succeeds here, creating one of the most amazing characters ever captured on film. Under his grotesque make-up, and behind the spine-chilling, laugh, there is Heath, but you wouldn't know it. He is so unrecognizable here, that by the end of the film, you still are not convinced that the late star was really there, playing one of the most chilling, vicious, cynical, amusing and straight out entertaining villains ever. There is absolutely no doubt, that at the 2009 Academy Awards, Heath Ledger will win the Oscar for Best Actor, and leave his legacy in Hollywood forever. Each of the different actors in this film help build Nolan's vision of the Dark Knight. Alfred, played by veteran Michael Caine, does a wonderful job of sending Bruce Wayan (Christian Bale) towards the right path of cleaning Gotham's criminals and scum from the streets, as does Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox, Batman's weapons expert. Aiding Batman in his quest for Gothams survival, is police aid led by Lt. Jim Gordon (the brilliant, yet under-appreciated Gary Oldman), and the new DA, the 'White Knight' of Gotham, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, yet another brilliant choice of casting). Rachel Dawes, Bruce's love interest, also returns in 'The Dark Knight', yet in the sequel, she is portrayed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who does a wonderful job of filling Katie Holmes position, much to the annoyance of fans who loathed the casting of Maggie as Rachel. The twists and turns that take place throughout the film are simply brilliant and well executed, and the action pieces are a marvel to watch. The constant one-liners by The Joker are amazing, and the added bonus of Two-Face, another central character is purely emotional. If anything, Aaron Eckhart needs to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars. He simply plays '3' different roles, and embodies them all perfectly. However, his appearance as Two-Face, although awesome for the fans, is not for the faint of heart. Quite simply, Nolan's Batman franchise is a success because he believes in every fine detail. Characters are given huge backstory's, that help us to understand their motives, and why they believe in what they do. The detail in the sets, the costumes, and the dialogue is executed to perfection. I believe this to be, the perfect movie. The film is not too short, not too long, ending on such a brilliant cliffhanger and well accompanied Batman theme, that sends chills down your spine. You can't help but grin like the Joker upon the end of the movie. It was completely worth the wait, and I cannot wait to see it again, and quite simply, it is now my favorite movie of all time. It is THAT amazing. A perfect score, 5/5.
7.0~Overrated and Two Face has no face karydacunha Sign in Permalink This Batman installment isn't a bad one it's just been completely overrated since the passing of Heath Ledger. Secondly there was way too much material to be packed into the three hours alloted. If anyone knows anything about the back story of Harvey Dent/Two Face they are just left feeling empty and the character itself unjustified. I understand Nolan was trying to do something different with the Joker, but why disrespect Two Face? Also, there was really no Batman/Bruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film. Overall a good action film, but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection. Hopefully Nolan brings back Two Face in the next film and gives him a face.
9.0~Over-hyped and Convoluted bluekarma06 Sign in Permalink seems like the comment on the front page was written by someone who must of been paid by the studio, Jesus! It wasn't that good dude! Get a life or at least get out of Malaysia! The movie was trying to be too many things. It should of focused more on just being a action movie and not so much psychodrama! Heath was brilliant but Nicholsons Batman was also great. I couldn't see myself watching this again. Once was enough! And the Batmobile was down right bizarre. It didn't look like something created by a rich man like Bruce Wayne. I liked the performance of Eric Roberts as well as Heath Ledgers. I believe the last batman was better. 7/10 as a followup on this day Aug 30th, 2011, I have watched the movie a few more times and YES it is a GREAT movie! If grew on me and even after I met Gary Oldman at a high-school football game and commented on how well this movie plays on repeated viewings because the acting is so good, he agreed. Heath was brilliant and the movie does work on many levels! I rescind my previous review!
10.0~Excellent Action Thriller thebrenman Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight was a marvelous film. It shows us what a city might be like with potentially "unstoppable" criminals and corrupt police officers. My favorite content that the movie had was showing us what can really happen. Corruption has taken over GPD, and Gothem is becoming a horrible city. Some of the criminal tactics are just horrific. A world where the police have "no power" can scare the bejeezus out of anyone. The cast and soundtrack were also excellent. My favorites were Morgan Freeman(Lucky # Slevin) and Aaron Eckhart(The Black Dahlia). Christain Bale was also excellent in the film. The soundtracks were terrific. Hans Zimmer(Pearl Harbor Soundtrack) made the movie come to life. Everyone knows that a movie is not a true movie without an excellent soundtrack, and The Dark Knight truly proves that point. Imagine the movie "Titanic" without the music. It would not be as good. Same thing applies for any movie. The movie was an excellent action thriller. 10 out of 10 stars is not enough!!!
9.0~Believe the Hype! stevoc Sign in Permalink As A Kiwi living in Aussie, I was skeptical about the level of sentimentality surrounding this film after the passing of Heath Ledger. I tried to go into the screening last night without having my expectations too high. I have to say though... I was blown away. The reports say Ledger is brilliant and takes the Joker to a new level. They are absolutely right. This is a an intelligent, dark film, far removed from the neon colours and slanty buildings of the Burton-era films. This is certainly not a "kids" superhero movie, it deserves the M rating it received here. It's a thought-provoking and subtle the film explores the Dark Knight as a vigilante, not a hero. A force of good that needs the opposite force of evil to exist. The scenes between Batman and the Joker are fantastic and riveting. The Scene stealing Joker's manic yet understandable musings are that of a new "smater" villain that doesn't rely on too many jokes or tricks take this to "Great Films of All Time " territory. a must see.
10.0~The Only Movie that Doesn't Need Defending. CrazyLazy99 Sign in Permalink A lot of movies I like I have to admit have faults; This is not one of them. You can say whatever you want about this film to me, I don't care. This dark, twisted, incredibly smart masterpiece has not left my mind since I first saw it a week after it opened. Naturally, I was hyped up, but not expecting it to surpass the excellent Batman Begins (with the memory of Spider-Man 3 STILL ringing in my ears), but this movie kills my pessimism. From its crime drama undertones, to its fantastic set-pieces, it all perfectly melds together with thematic depth that most films period, can't fathom. Also, every character is solidly explored, and the film never sacrifices story for character and vice-versa, nor does the action or plot interfere with each other. Every action sequence is just an inevitable confrontation to move the plot and the characters forward, a move that summer movies and Academy-Award films both shamelessly reject. This may be my favorite movie. Don't tell me how its "just" an action movie, or how The Godfather is the most complex film ever: it is boring and unimmersive. The Dark Knight is incredible.
7.0~Best "Batman"? Yeah. Best thing in it? Both role and portrayal of the Joker. editor-131 Sign in Permalink One of the things that makes young actor Heath Ledger's death from an overdose last winter most grievous--apart from the gratuitous loss of any young human life--is that he, and his role as the Joker--are the best things about "The Dark Knight"--the latest in the Batman film franchise. Both the role and its realization by Ledger represent the most credible portrayal of a movie villain in films that are based on comics, or that, like in the James Bond franchise, are usually cartoonish. (Consider that the typical Bond villains are what Mike Myers, most notably, parodies in his Austin Powers films, in the portrayal of "Dr. Evil." These quintessential miscreants who, often, seem to be motivated by world domination and or great riches, nonetheless seem to be inexplicably single-minded, blindered, and one-dimensional in their badness.) By contrast, the role of the Joker as written in "The Dark Knight" offers one of the most credible, well articulated visions, rationales for this antagonist's motives and actions. And, as has been more or less universally noted, Ledger's realization of the character is incredibly masterful, even nuanced, despite its obvious grotesque and larger-than-life qualities. The soliloquies in which the Joker articulates his dedication to cultivating chaos, vs. the well-laid plans and, he avers, "schemes" of society are among the most successful articulations of a point of view and impulse to dedicated psychopathic evil-doing. What's more, in a testament to the vision of those who came up with the story, this version of the character, and his lines, his apparent "backstory" is carefully crafted as a red herring. In one tete-a-tete, the Joker explains one origin of his disfiguring scars, which suggest a mocking grin. But wait--while threatening co-star Maggie Gyllenhaal with a similar disfigurement, the story is entirely different. While some films legitimately seek to humanize real or fictional figures as, while perpetrators of horrific crimes (think of "Monster's" characterization of murderous prostitute Aileen Wuornos, for one), the device in the case of Ledger's Joker rightly deprives him of an unwarranted overhumanization. At the same time, the writing and portrayal keep this Joker in the realm of something potentially real--still ineluctably human--as opposed to Jack Nicholson's and Cesar Romero's past, overly stylized and cartoonish creations. Obviously, the awesome makeup and costume design for the character support these effects, but they would hardly do the job on their own. Other than on those merits, the film is good, maybe very good; not great--typically, not worthy of the hype and anticipation these kinds of presumed blockbusters generate. And I say that with no lack of regard for Chris Nolan (I love "Memento") and the film's other creators. It's just that I, perhaps more than more typical moviegoers, just can't work up much genuine buy-in to these comics-based extravaganzas. In this case, the film is long, and, at least for me, has too many interim climaxes. Of course, the first capture of the Joker is just too easy to be final ... but the number of reversals and resurgences and climactic twists that require heroic resolution and which propel the plot ambulations, were, to me, eventually emotionally deadening. At least the film discards some classic story and film-making conventions in order to further the story--like the kind of breakthrough risks "Seinfeld" took in its willingness to have really bad things happen to people, as the setup for the conceptual humor of the initially revolutionary sitcom. (E.g., an attractive and sympathetic character's experiencing significantly disfiguring, botched cosmetic surgery, as a foil for George's and Kramer's neurotic propensities. Numerous other examples could be adduced.) Ultimately, while the film seems less hokey and far-fetched than most in the genre--less so even than the plot line of, and caricatures populating, Nolan's initial venture in the franchise--it finally descends thereto with the fate of Aaron Eckhart's crusading do-gooder prosecutor character, Harvey Dent. ("Dent" as in his chin cleft?) Further, while the overall arc of the movie offers to explain how Batman came to devolve from a mere outlaw vigilante theoretically wanted by the law but really covertly valued by Gotham as a whole, into a true outcast--a reviled figure who is perceived as having made too many moral compromises in order to give the apocalyptic city not "what it deserves, but what it needs"--it churns through a lot of bodies, special effects and somewhat wearisome exposition and development getting to that moral. Christian Bale's somewhat flat characterization seems hardly to carry that theme--his flippancy as Bruce Wayne and menacingly gravelly voice when he's Batman just don't flesh his character's demons out in a meaningful way. While the film is mildly satisfying in view of that theme (like the last-produced "Star Wars" movie was in its depiction of Anikin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader), the true enjoyment comes from watching Ledger. Fortunately he's on screen a great deal. I stayed through the credits to make sure there was a gesture made to his loss and memory. There was. It is, in the universe of filmed entertainment--with the thought-provoking lessons it can, at its best, offer--quite a loss indeed.
1.0~The dark knight falls: Nolan prooves the art of marketing & commercialism .... Zaphod2000 Sign in Permalink Well...First of all ,the whole story and plot got nothing to do with the original comic-book story (which already makes it even more unauthentic and unwatchable then it already is...). The Joker basically had some help killing the mobsters of Gotham City along with other 'freaks' /Batman's foes like him -like Two Face ,Poison Ivy etc'). Second ,the movie changed the whole atmosphere and story into a shallow script with too much special effects and CGI not mentioning big stunts and the same predictable and uninspired below mediocre kind of plot common to most action movies and comic-based movies these days. And besides ,the acting and direction were just bad and some characters seemed not convincing and stupid not mentioning the way the writers changed some important /key characters like the Joker (Heath Ledger was just weird...he didn't fit to the Joker's role). In conclusion : a complete waste of time including your brain cells ,an endless and unwatchable crapfest--an overrated and over-hyped lame knight who is not a gentleman ,nor a good movie or a good comic book adaption.
1.0~Basic entertainment - nothing more yaizapez Sign in Permalink I'm sorry but I don't get it. Why is everybody so crazy about this movie? Is it because of the effects? We have seen better, even in old movies. This one didn't impress me. Is it because of the story? We have seen better! The story and the characters in this movie seem to be taken from an old-days Disney fable. OK.. Is it because the actor who plays the Joker died in real life after finishing it? If that's the reason, why is that exciting? And anyway, then it has nothing to do with cinema itself! I admire the performance of the two main male actors: both Bale and Ledger play very well indeed, as usual. But unfortunately their job can't compensate for the flat performances of their colleagues, specially that of Maggie Gyllenhaal, nor for the many deficiencies of the script. The result is an unbalanced movie: the interactions between the characters is awkward, they move around in a world that doesn't seem to fit them. A bit predictable, a bit overloaded. For a movie to be a classic, it has to give you something, it has to make you grow and it has to grow in you. This movie is definitely not in this category.
10.0~Wicked on_the_can Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan and his team have really done something spectacular with The Dark Knight. They've taken a character that everybody in the world knows in a genre that is getting more exposure now than anything else and elevated it to something different...this is not just a superhero movie, this is a crime thriller and damn good one. In the comics and great animated series of the 1990's Batman is the world's greatest detective. In most screen incarnations however he's been portrayed as just a high flying superhero with an arsenal of James Bondesque gadgetry. This isn't always a bad thing, don't get me wrong, I'm still a huge fan of Tim Burton's original two Batfilms. But The Dark Knight carries on from Batman Begins, portraying our hero as a brooding tortured force who collects evidence and thinks out missions and defenses. He's not an entirely one man show either, he talks with cop buddy Jim Gordon, enlists help from his only two confidants (butler, Alfred and CEO Lucius), and gets involved, albeit from the shadows, in city politics, trying to get close enough to the new DA to determine if he's worthy of entering the Batfold, and something entirely new and unexpected, Batman holds out hope of bestowing enough peace on the city that he can hang up his cape and cowl. All this gets threatened of course by the new kid on the block. The sadistic and psychotic Joker ingeniously played by the remarkably well cast Heath Ledger (he manages to be hilarious without the use of one liners and sight gags). The Joker sets up and pulls strings all over Gotham city making life a living hell for everybody and he does it with such glee you'd be cheering him on if you weren't scared of him at the same time. It's also because of his presence that you can never even guess where the movie will take you next. He's so manipulative and conniving in his criminal plot and insanity that almost everything you are led to believe will happen doesn't. There is one twist after another between fights, chases, murder investigations and bent tension. The only issue I can really take with the film is Maggie Gyllenhal's replacement of Katie Holmes. My gripe isn't with Maggie personally, just with the unfortunate affect I think it had on a key plot point of the film. I've never liked it when characters are recast in sequels anyway but the role of her character Rachel Dawes though maybe smaller in terms of screen time from the first one plays a very significant role in the plot and her actions in it would undoubtedly carry more weight if we could see her as the same character we met previously and not be forced to accept a new face as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend. In an otherwise excellent film though, this is a small complaint. The Dark Knight does not disappoint. I can't wait to see the next one.
10.0~DARK KNIGHT makes no funny business for the Bat. vip_ebriega Sign in Permalink My Take: A bold, visionary modern classic. No joke here! THE DARK KNIGHT, the new Batman thriller from Christopher Nolan, has a lot of buzz that comes along the merchandise and the marketing, but it avoids all the shortcomings, and even in fact going beyond audience expectations. After Nolan's own brooding and realistic version BATMAN BEGINS, audience expected a similar approach on DARK KNIGHT. The arrogant Bruce Wayne, the darker vigilante Batman, no nipples on the Batsuit, all that is fulfilled in this new film, but this is also darker and much better than anyone in the audience expected it to be. In fact, it's the darkest, deepest and most significant and exciting one in the series since BATMAN RETURNS. While it takes a different path from the original series (although thankfully, staying much away from the awful BATMAN & ROBIN), this is the new Batman for the new ages. Christian Bale reprises his role as the most arrogant (and best) Bruce Wayne, and alter ego Batman, who once again sets out to restore order in the crime-ridden streets of Gotham City (not exactly the land of opportunity), as it is once again leaking with criminality and injustice, in the form of the evil Joker (the late Heath Ledger, who makes a brilliant performance in his last film that made the evening news) and crime lords who terrorize and make their own circus of chaos. It's up to the Bat to put a stop to it all, but this time, it ain't juts gonna be his job. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the hero without a mask who lends his own hands to keep Gotham in high stands against crime, despite the every growing urban chaos. Dent also happens to be dating Bruce Wayne's best friend Rachael Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Mrs. Cruise Katie Holmes), blooming up a little love triangle that doesn't go corny at all. Nolan's Batman worlds are fantastic and effective ones. Whilst not the visually eye-popping Blade Runner-era Gotham City that Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS was, but surely much closer to the reality of current situations. This time, the threats are real, and the solutions to the problems are far more desperate than kicking ass. Crime is real, crime is bad, and Nolan emphasizes on every frame. The absolute reality of the picture is one of the reasons why it's the best and most topical Bat-film to date. But DARK KNIGHT is a mere subject discussion. The excitement comes in waves, from chases down the dark streets with trucks, vans, and the Bat's own Batmobile (which transforms into a speeding motor-bike when it self-destructs), or battle sequences that are intense as they are well-made, DARK KNIGHT satisfies as pure entertainment. The screenplay is bold and daring, venturing into a subject so much deeper than where it usually settles upon (enough to make you forget the fiasco BATMAN & ROBIN was). Then there are the performances, mentioning the late Mr. Ledger's performance front and center, are excellent and nearly flawless. To date, it may be the best performed superhero flick I've ever seen. All-in-all, THE DARK KNIGHT is the superhero mainstream of the summer you have got to see if you see no other (and I may doubt that you'll see more). No joke! Rating: ***** out of 5.
10.0~Perfect movie mattaaron Sign in Permalink A perfectly made movie, with Heath Ledger at his best. Batman Begins started the trend of 'dark/serious' movies, and just when you thought a movie couldn't be better... The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger. As much as you hate the Joker character in the movie, in the end you truly feel bad. Every scene he's in gets so intense with your eyes glued to the TV, it's really hard to get side tracked by thinking of something else! Sadly The Dark Knight Rises wasn't that great, this movie still stands as one of the best movies out there.
2.0~Lemmings to the Cliff petervenkman57 Sign in Permalink Is most of humanity on serious drugs? This film is a mess. The script rambles, the characters come in and out of the film for no reason, no one does anything that makes any sense. This was written using a Vegetamatic The writing is bad!! This NOT a good film and yet the population heads for that cliff like Lemmings. Have the studios turned our brains to mush? BATMAN BEGINS is GOOD... This is BAD. OK, so Heath Ledger does a good job in the film... that still doesn't make it a good movie. Demand better!! Seriously... Now. Put that potato chip bag down, call the Office of Homeland Security and tell them Jihaadists have taken over Warner Bros. and are pretending to be David Goyer (a great writer most of the time). He must be being held captive by the guy impersonating Paul McCartney. Is putting on a black cape and some cat ears all it takes to amuse the populace... This is down right Orwellian.. God Help us!!
10.0~One of my favourite films rebecca-ry Sign in Permalink When 'The Dark Knight' was first released everyone was going to see it even if they hadn't seen the previous 'Batman Begins', simply because it was Heath Ledger's last completed role - and what a role it was. When you watch the film for the first ten minutes when you see Heath on screen you remember how he is sadly no longer with us and are reminded of the tragedy. However, when the Joker visits the mob and performs the 'pencil trick', Heath becomes the Joker. It's a rare occasion when you find a character so well performed that you forget it's an actor, but Heath did this astonishingly well. It's hard to find a weak link in the acting in this film. Christian Bale adds an almost comical edge to Bruce Wayne with his hints of mockery when it comes to talking to or about Harvey Dent. Bale also performs Batman well despite the odd voice which you get used to. Aaron Eckhart is another actor whose performance is excellent. His noble character of Harvey Dent is great but it's when he becomes Two-Face that you really see Eckhart's skill. It's a shame this side of his character is only shown for the final part of the film but he, like Heath Ledger, is able to totally immerse himself in the character. The familiar characters played by Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are welcomed again in this sequel and Maggie Gyllenhaal's replacement of Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes is also not controversial and Maggie acts very well. The script itself is full of twists and turns and leaves you gasping for the finishing half of the entire film. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job with this film. Perhaps not his best ever script but it's definitely his best film so far, it will be difficult for him to create the sequel for this film as he has simply made an excellent film here which is difficult to beat.
1.0~Darth man, Breath man, Badman, Bedman, what is this? jack-964 Sign in Permalink Normally i don't read comments from others before a movie, but now i did, cause i was wondering why this movie got such a high rating. A lot of people say its fantastic and i read some people who really hated it. Im not a Bat Man fan, though i had bat toys as a kid, a long time ago, so i went in pretty open minded. I still don't know why this movie got such a high rating. I fell asleep 2 times during it. OK, I'm a bit tired lately, but a good movie sure keeps me awake. The story is kinda lame. The classical batman story is good versus bad, pretty simple and straightforward, but the writers chose to abandon this theme more or less, stating that 'good' will always turn to 'evil', given enough time. Yea, sounds pretty deep, but isn't. Go read Nietzsche. I found it all pretty predictable and where it wasn't, it was too far fetched to ever be realistic. It leans on the psychology angle to pressure people to chose 'bad' over 'good', kinda like 'Saw' (and others), but not as good as that. Actually that theme gets worn out pretty fast. The pace seems way off, in the beginning i was like "Huh, whats all happening?", going way too fast, other passages are too slow (prolly where i fell asleep). The art of telling a story - any story - is to take the listener (or viewer) along for the ride with all possible means. This just doesn't happen. It's not the worst movie ever, but surely not the best either. The acting is pretty OK, Freeman and Caine always deliver. Batman obviously has a cold as soon as he puts his cape on, or watched Darth Vader too often and replicates it as a 10 year old. The Joker is totally not funny and where he should portray the madness, the only thing he knows to show is to stick his tongue out periodically. Didn't find him scary at all, not funny, nor interesting. They nominated the guy for an Oscar ?!?! The only reason i can think of why that is, is cause he's dead? I'm not saying his acting is bad, but it's by far not *that* good. "You either die a hero, or live to become a villain", has to be made true by awarding a posthumous Oscar? Effects and stunts are OK, but nothing new or exiting. All in all its doable, but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone over ~13. Gave it a 5, cause its not all bad. Maybe i just outgrew Batman. No, we're not destined to do this forever and in fact, before redoing a Batman, you need a really good angle on it. So think twice.
4.0~boe_dye sez: Surprisingly, this is more like Batman 2.5 boe_dye Sign in Permalink Let me first say that I myself am surprised for only giving it 4 stars. When I first saw this film, and first reviewed it I had given it 10 shiny stars... However upon my second viewing of it, something turned me completely off to it. Now, in all honesty this movie for me could be looked upon like a very expensive sushi dinner: Everything is beautiful: All the players involved were amazing. The scenery was incredible, the dialogue (with the minor exception of Christian Bales' 9000 cigarette a day Batman voice) we not over the top in any way. The story line was well thought out, and well played. I mean from that standpoint you really can't say anything bad. It had substance, and wasn't just all fluff. It really was a 10 star film! So why do I only give it 4 stars? Well, like any high class restaurant, appearance and presentation, and quality of the food is simply the the beginning. And this film had it all, really it did. However, it lacked one thing for me, and that is... Taste... It simply left a bad flavor in my mouth and it took me the better part of a day to figure out why. With a film that is so incredible on every level, it did exactly what so many films before it has done, and failed miserably at every single time. Trying to fit in too much. The "more bang for your buck" mentality. I was simply enjoying Heath Ledgers performance, and honestly did not seem him on the screen anywhere. He was Joker all the way. Sinister, psychotic, mad. Simply amazing. But where it killed it for me was with Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Yes he acted it well, yes the makeup artists were phenomenal. I mean everything about him was good. Except that all of his character should have been saved for Batman 3! Partway through the movie, it almost seemed that The Dark Knight could have ended, and another film began. It wasn't one particular point per say, but more of an overlapping of ideas. Here we are following the Joker, and then the Joker's story starts to overlap with Harvey Dents story. Like Venom in Spider-Man 3, Harvey Dent while integral to the story became an after thought. A very strong after thought mind you, but an after thought none the less. They could have done so much more with his character and the end result of The Dark Knight could have very easily been incorporated more into a third film. But instead they chose to cram as much as they could into one film, and there you have it. Had I done it, I would have had the transformation of Dent as the cliffhanger to the Dark Knight, and made an entirely different story line based more on Dent/Two-Face in a 3rd film. It is this reason that the film left a bad taste in my mouth. Petty? Over reacting? Nit Picking? Maybe so, maybe not. However, as most avid film viewers know it usually only takes one thing to screw up a great film, and for me, this was it.
3.0~Why so serious, indeed? sillybuddha Sign in Permalink Those looking for some fun, a bit of entertainment, will be disappointed by The Dark Knight. It's almost as if the director is trying not to make a superhero film at all, its desperate attempts to make everything plausible and gritty ignoring the fact that the two protagonists are actually a mad clown and a man who dresses as a bat... Fair enough if you don't want to make a superhero film, but if you don't want to make said film please don't pick one of the most famous superheroes of all time to drag down into an overlong grim-fest with far too much standing around and discussion of the film's plot. As with the (superior) Batman of Tim Burton, once again the Joker dominates the film. The problem is that Ledger's Joker does not really play any jokes, have any gadgets, or try to make anyone laugh. The Joker should be scary AND funny, and Ledger fails in this regard. Bale's Batman is also portrayed as a thug, beating up an imprisoned Joker and dropping a villain out of a building. Isn't Batman supposed to be the 'World's Greatest Detective'? Isn't he supposed to use his brains and intelligence to outwit the villains, rather than just pounding them to a pulp? Perhaps this is a reflection of tactics deemed acceptable by the War on Terror but it isn't the Batman I admire. Dark Knight's claim to realism is also blown out of the water by the Joker's merry band of mental hospital patients (!) managing to install huge amounts of explosives in hospitals, ferries, offices etc without anyone noticing till the conveniently dramatic crucial moment. Finally, the Batman rescues the Joker from falling to his death, because, after all, Bats is a hero. Sadly this contradicts his actions in Batman Begins where he refuses to save Ducard from certain death on the stricken Gotham monorail. Overall, the film leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. For some viewers, the darker the better, and as a teenager I'm sure I would have loved this film. But if you want dark, watch a horror or a thriller, and leave superheroes alone to be larger than life. I'm not advocating a return to the days of the Joel Schumacher neon-nightmares, but this film should have allowed Batman to have a bit of fun, and be less of a thug.
6.0~Ledger saves pretentious, overwrought superhero movie dfranzen70 Sign in Permalink Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy. As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays. Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim. Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right. And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here. The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City. But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham. So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.
10.0~Batman is finally talking sense and nonsense at once Dr_Coulardeau Sign in Permalink Finally the new generation of Batman films has arrived and he is on the run. The film is long and there are many moments when no action happens, when the hero or the people are there to reflect upon events, to go down deep into themselves, to show us their feelings, their fears, their hopes. The film becomes a lot more psychological, mental even. It is talking of people, real people and how they react and live in a tense situation. The best moment of the film is when the people themselves have to decide who is going to die, them on one side or the others on the other side. They can do it on both sides and neither sides do it. They vote overwhelmingly for killing the others and yet they don't carry out their decision. Democracy is the worst imaginable regime because a majority is always found for the least ethical decisions that more or less demagogically please the masses, caress them in the right direction. And yet it remains the best because in these worst situations imaginable the people kind of react against the horror and the terror and do not follow the majority rule or reveal another layer of majority rule deeper and finer, well hidden but always ready to come out. The film shows how what is at stake is not what the masses are going to do in a crisis situation. It is what are the few individuals who have power and the means to use that power going to do, or rather become? And there the answer is super-negative. Individuals are always corrupted by the forces behind the terror that swoops down onto the masses. That's politics and that's well seen. And yet that's false when the film pretends these few corruptible people can be stopped. At least not the way the film says. They are never corrupted alone and they move into that corrupted state along with quite many people, armed forces, security forces and even more. The film is deeply reflecting on recent events but the diagnosis is wrong and the solution is wrong too. It will not be enough to get rid of the corrupted individual. It will not even be enough to get rid of him and the inner circle of his legion. You will have to explain why at a certain moment that man captured a vast majority of the people in elections or just public opinion. And you'll have to provide a way to reverse that fact and to prevent it from happening again. And then you will find you cannot prevent that because such massive support to evil when it is draped in a long shining armor of good is long lasting, very long lasting. The next solution is to turn that corrupted person into a dead hero. But then you have to turn your best friend into the fiend the masses require. Think of president Saakashvili in Georgia. He took the decision to send troops into Ossetia. That was a bad decision showing how he had been corrupted by his re-election and the anti-Russian feelings of some. You can even say he had been influenced if not directly manipulated by the Russians, or even by the West which more or less promised support, even military, another manipulation of course. His mind got corrupted and he provoked the big northern neighbor and he got what he deserved: his two military bases destroyed, the main airport destroyed, the main harbor destroyed, the basic infrastructures disrupted, the pipelines stopped. A military, economic, social and political catastrophe. Then what? Oust him and turn him into a hero? Follow the call of the hard liners among the people and start a guerrilla warfare adventure, provided the Russians decided to stay in Georgia? Send Bush to bury him deep and under a thick layer of concrete? Punish the Russians with isolation, as if they gave a damn about it because we, in the West, need their natural gas and their oil, not the reverse. This film is thus discussing this fundamental issue of what do we do with corrupted leaders who have commanded at some time in their careers vast support from the masses? The solution proposed is unrealistic. But the film is superb, especially because the Joker is really vicious and dangerous, really blood curdling and sickening, whereas with Jack Nicholson he was a funny clown. This time he is not a clown at all. And that is true: terrorism, even criminal terrorism and not political terrorism, is not funny, is not a game, is not a show. And it has means to get under the skin of most people. And then there is no solution, except an innocent fiend who will be on the run forever, like Ben Laden? We can wonder if our enemies, fiends are not such illusive evil beings who are not that evil but are necessary for the real evil ones to be kept in place. And are there even really alive, are they really real? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
10.0~The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made LoneWolfAndCub Sign in Permalink I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film "Batman Begins," The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect. I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with "Batman Begins." Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here. Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age... All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously ("Thankyou for Smoking") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations. Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff. Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie. It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent ("Superman" and "X-Men" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction. 5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!
9.0~Late TDK review jetblack242001 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight I know that everything that needs to be said about this movie has been said, but I write this after having viewed The Dark Knight for a third time. I truly believe this film to be one of best Blockbuster films to come out in some time; An elegant, intelligent film about the extremities of good and evil and most importantly, about faith that the better angels of our nature will prevail in mist of an unjust world. For that, the film ingrains the Batman mythology into our vision of American pop-culture, where archetypes Bruce Wayne/Batman, The Joker, and Harvey "Two-Face" Dent can be re-imagined for the perils and anxieties of our times. Wayne is portrayed as a man living in the skyline of his city, unaffected by the violence and mayhem that Gotham endures. His only newsworthy events are tabloid fodder, escaping in the ocean with a beautiful Russian dancer(of course all of these are alibis for his true motives). He is how we see the rich in this country, unattached but undeniably compelling and drawn to them. The Joker is re-identified as our worst fears, the random whims of destruction that can possess our lives in a deeper, morally unclear platform. He is a pure example of Terrorism, a man eager to play his chords while a city is engulfed in flames. Unlike some popular origins in which Joker is born from a fall into a batch of chemicals while encountering Batman (Alan Moore's The Killing Joke, for one), here he has no background, and appears as random as a Tornado in Kansas. He is similar to Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men, an uncompromising force that has a disturbing view of humanity without losing a peculiar charisma. Batman is the guard of Gotham's safety as well as a launching pad of criticism for the methods he employs to combat crime, including a sonar device that can detect the whereabouts of Gotham's citizens in order to stop The Joker. His actions are vaguely parallel to our government's war on terror, where our protection has severely compromised our personal liberty and begs to ask if the presence of a Big Brother, even for the sake of good, is a high price to pay. The structural lead character of this story, however, is Harvey Dent. A valiant, benevolent civil servant, Dent is a classical tragic hero that has his convictions turned against him, permanently transforming his face and his soul into a grotesque amalgam. His rise through the political ranks as a District Attorney resembles a youthful, energetic promise a fresh candidate with engrossing ideals brings, which perhaps resonates for us to the fascination we have for current Democratic nominee Barack Obama. But the ideals are irreparably tarnished when a personal tragedy destroys the will of this great man. As Two-Face, Dent's view of fairness relies on the flip of a coin, a final betrayal of the alliance between himself, Batman and Gordon. The sadness of Two-Face's rationale is that the world is indifferent and that random chance is the only balance of justice, where in fact the ability to change the world lies in the decisions we make. In that argument is where this movie transcends from a very good action thriller into one that reflects and questions our own morality and the role we play in society. Should we or shouldn't we be neutral in a moving train?
10.0~Joker Stole The Show koop-beyondthemask Sign in Permalink I've always been a fan of the Batman legacy, and when the hype was going around about Batman Begins and a fresh start for the Caped Crusader since Tim Burton's movies, I was looking forward to the movie. But at the movie's ending, a sequel was guaranteed. When I went to see The Dark Knight on the day of it's release I thought it was brilliant, a great sequel, Christopher Nolan did an amazing job once again. Christian Bale was excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman again, Aaron Eckhart was also brilliant as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, he made that part his own and pulled off the good guy District Attorney role brilliant, and he pulled off the evil coin flipping Two-Face brilliant also, so I can only applaud Aaron on a brilliant performance. The person who stole the show was the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. When it was announced that Heath was to portray the Clown Prince, everyone was unsure on Nolan's choice of actor, including myself. But Heath proved everyone wrong, he did a brilliant job as The Joker. With Jack Nicholson's unforgettable performance in The Joker's first big screen appearance to compete with and no doubt Nicholson is a superb actor, a true legend. But as much as Nicholson did a good job as The Joker, Heath Ledger's performance puts Nicholson's in the shadows. To change the character from Nicholson's joke filled, funny man persona to Ledger's sick, twisted, psychopathic persona was brilliant and the actor pulled it off brilliant. The way he captured the insane clown personality was perfect, the character was brilliant, taken away from your normal villain, who robs banks for money, trying to take over the world, blah blah blah... But Ledger's Joker was the villain who if he had the money he'd burn it (like in the movie), he don't care for world domination, Joker's only interest was to as Michael Caine's (Alfred) line goes, "Some men want to watch the world burn" which is what Joker wanted, he don't care for anything or anybody, not even himself. Which was genius, his performance as the Joker will go down in history as one of the best, and will not be forgot for a long time. As for the rumours going around on the net on threads saying Nolan should cast the Joker character in a 3rd Batman Movie (if there will be a 3rd) I think they shouldn't cast another Joker, even though the Joker wasn't killed off at the end of The Dark Knight, they shouldn't re-cast a Joker for a 3rd because I don't think that any actor in the business can fill Ledger's boots as Joker. Even though there are some brilliant actors out there, they should introduce new villains for a 3rd and let the superb performance Heath Ledger gave us be remembered for what it was... Excellent And just adding I've read some threads and rumours surrounding a 3rd movie, about Philip Seymour Hoffman as Penguin and Johnny Depp as Riddler, for one, Hoffman is a brilliant actor and would be brilliant in the part. Depp don't need my praise his work speaks for itself, the man is amazing. So I'd give the nod to those two for those roles, but the rumours around about a possible return for Eckhart's character Dent/Two-Face would be good too, with Eckhart still playing the role, but if they keep Eckhart as Two-Face they should cast another villain and not cramp it up with too many characters like Spider Man 3 did which was poor. Anyway, Brilliant movie, amazing work from Nolan, brilliant performances from the cast, mainly Ledger, and here's to a 3rd movie. Rest In Peace Heath Ledger
6.0~Dark Screen (finally) regular8 Sign in Permalink This movie is too long by about 30 minutes. I was happy when the screen finally went dark. A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under 2 hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurting. It's a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great, but still, some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters. The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex, he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real characters. The story was very hard for me to follow. I don't appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie. I am still not sure why Mr. "Two Face" went sour and frankly I didn't care that he did. There is a very heavy thematic effort here; much of film is trying to clearly define good vs. evil and the shifting ambiguity of that, to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated. I applaud this kind of effort in an action film, but here the authors take just too long to get there. I was itching to get out of my seat and had to force myself to sit through to the very end, and that's not good for any movie.
6.0~I had to concentrate on staying entertained. A.N. Sign in Permalink Good movies should create "the willing suspension of disbelief," meaning you forget that it's just actors and special effects. This movie failed to deliver that for me. I kept waiting for it to match the review hype but it only had random moments. The Eastwood/Devil voice of Batman needed explanation. It was too far off from his regular voice, like a crank caller. Was it just assumed to be an identity trick? It was hard to work up empathy for either Wayne or Batman. The best acting I've seen from C.B. was in "The Machinist" (a far more disturbing and better film than this). Excessive lesions on C.B. and M.G. were distracting in close-ups but that's not unique to this film. M.G. isn't what I would call hot, and it's unclear how she got to be the object of rich desires. She added a dowdy effect that dampened the felt urgency of certain things. Many special effects went beyond fantasy. Vehicle mass defied inertia laws in crashes; like the Bionic Man pushing a building. The bat-cycle was ludicrous in how it could blast every obstacle out of its way. The cellphone sonar was logistically absurd, if even technically possible. I like special effects with some chance of realism. The half face, half sinew thing was well done, but the sudden meanness of the D.A. seemed forced. I found the opening bank scene the most engrossing, promising part. The guy on the street corner dangling the mask had a spookiness I was expecting from the rest of the film, but it washed out. Where was all the "darkness" reviewers wrote of? I guess he kept kid audiences in mind. The Joker was well done but no more menacing than random creeps interrogated on C.S.I. Most importantly, the plot didn't feel naturally driven by events (see title of review). I think a rare combination of hype and the death of H.L. carried this film to a higher status than it deserved.
10.0~Wonderful. How superhero movies should be made! warthogjump Sign in Permalink Quite simply "Dark Knight" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a "proper" superhero movie, so let's forget about that). Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't "just" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of "dark" and of perception of "society." I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not. Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these "abilities" about him which are soooo unrealistic. So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable. The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic! I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it! Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special. It's cool It's original It's awesome I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him
6.0~Well, it's "okay", I guess, but a "masterpiece"? No. mtess-1 Sign in Permalink I just HAD to comment on the Dark Knight after reading all these hyped ratings and reviews. Watched it last night; generally like superheroes and comic books; really enjoyed Batman Begins. Now, to make this brief, here are my beefs: 1. So what if there are multiple big names in this movie? Some of the best movies ever made starred next to nobodies. I do not assume a movie will be great because the budget could afford "big names". These performances were good, granted, but not the stellar masterpiece some would have you believe. 2. The story was awesome - every fan loves a back-story. But come on, the effects for Two-Face were disappointing at best (i.e. flesh burned off his face and the left eye still perfectly fine and moving around as if it didn't need a good blink every now and then? Also, in the opening scene, why would the bank manager lay there without removing a supposed explosive from his mouth? ALSO, the cliché struggle of the female lead, "torn' between two men...come on....been there in Spiderman and I personally thought she was a tramp for bouncing back and forth between them. I think I'll stop there: I wrote this review only out of utter astonishment that it is currently rating a 9 out of 10 with over 300, 000 votes. I guess you could argue that makes me the exception and therefore wrong, but come on folks, this is not MUCH more than more Hollywood garbage and we keep sitting down at the table to shovel in more. UG! I think the movie is good - 6/10. Heath Ledger's performance is the best part of the movie - the only reason I give it a 6/10. But the day a movie like this rates higher than the "classics" (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Blade Runner, The Thing, etc) in actual quality has not yet arrived in my opinion. Rent it, yes, but don't be fooled the adolescent, feverish enthusiasm of comic book "aficionados" that has made people think this is one of the best films ever made. This is another superhero movie...plain and (very) simple.
1.0~The biggest Joke, this film being so praised. T850 Sign in Permalink My lack of faith in the audience is justified, how can this film be so highly rated when it's total garbage. Batman was my favourite comic book, the dark tortured hero really appealed to me. But this film really is a mess. Where do I begin? Probably the biggest problem of any bad movie, the characters. BATMAN The one we're supposed to identify with and feel his plight, is so wooden in this film that I could mistake him for a tree. Christian Bale's Batman seems devoid of any emotion or any internal plight, Plus in a film that is supposed to be about him, Batman seems relegated to a supporting role. In TDK he's merely a goon with a bad case of laryngitis. I know he's supposed to disguise his voice, but it's so over the top it's laughable. This is were Keaton and Conroy got it right, he seldom talks, when he does the voice change is subtle. Not sounding like a goon on a sugar high. The JOKER, The main villain. Heath Ledger's performance is good with what he's given, But the writing for the Joker is all wrong. Joker in this film is actually a very generic psychopath. If it wasn't for the make-up I would have never guessed it was supposed to be the Joker. The Joker isn't supposed to be a nihilist. Everything to him is a big joke, even murder has to be funny to him. Ledger's Joker lacking virtually any sense of humour, he's more akin to Jack the Ripper who seems to have an obsession with knives and scars. Also what put me off is how the Joker always looks physically ill. Constantly hunched over, waddling about, constantly licking and smacking his lips like his saliva is on overdrive. This simply doesn't work for a clownish criminal amusing himself. With the exceptions of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, the actors in the film just seemed rather lazy. Like they wanted the film to end as quickly as possible and collect their pay cheque. Why in a film where characters are supposed to be the central focus be so wooden and one dimensional with them. The film flops completely on it's characters The directing was equally sloppy. A lot of pointless noise and generic action scenes that seem to be put in as filler in order to extend the film to the 150 minute mark. Excessive cuts that make the action difficult to follow and often in poor light where we can't see anything. Equally pointless was the plot, in fact it's more a collection of subplots, none of them with any closure or resolution to them. With the sloppy cuts, it also leaves enough plot holes to sink this film into an incoherent mess. Yet I hear this film heralded as a masterpiece, I see critics and fan reviews who just gush over this film. Has the standard of film making really reached this low? 20 years ago, a film called Robocop came out. A very silly concept at it's core, but the characters are what made the film work. We could identify with Robocop ironically enough.Tim Burton's despite it's plot flaws, The characters were well created and acted and kept to the spirit of the source material. TDK has no such redeeming features.
1.0~Not disappointment... ironking Sign in Permalink This movie wasn't a disappointment, because I didn't expect anything better. This pointless piece of... shortened my life about 2,5 hours. Total waste of time and money. Cesar Romero was much better joker than that untalented schoolboy. If I could go back in time, I would warn myself about this... movie. Considering how this movie has been rated, internet, movies and television should be prohibited for anyone under 30. Make the right decision. Don't spend your money. Minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text. So I have to write some random gibberish.
3.0~Are we there yet? Speedtrip Sign in Permalink I'm all for action, I like action movies, I really do. Honest. Big explosions, car chases, fist fights, spectacular stunts, all good. But this is just taking the p**s! This is 10 minutes of plot stretched to 2 hours 32 minutes!! 2 HOURS 32 MINUTES!! One seemingly endless action sequence followed by another with a plot which could easily (and has been) be fitted in a comic book. I found I was looking at my watch more than the screen, and thats not good. And as for Heath Ledger's performance, is it pork? Is it bacon? No, its just plain old HAM! Sorry he is dead and all but really, please, any talk of an Oscar is just silly.
1.0~Just so...so bad diablogtr7 Sign in Permalink It is inconceivable that this movie is anywhere near the Top 250. It is 2.5 hours of a coarse voice, explosions, cheap one liners, and terrible plot. Batman Begins, I thought was brilliant. It had genuine pathos, its characters were very believable and had depth to them. The acting was phenomenal. But this piece of crap, is completely the opposite. I have seen spaghetti westerns and children's cartoons with better acting then The Dark Knight. With the exception of the Joker, by Ledger, who was decent. There is no screenplay. There are explosions. I think Michael Bay actually produced and directed this. There is a random side plot to Hong Kong that had no purpose or place in the story. The cell phone tracking technology is the dumbest and most far fetched thing I have ever seen in a film. The only reason this movie gets any recognition or praise is because of Ledger's death. That plus the Batman and Joker fanboys that flood IMDb to give this crap a 10. They like how 'cool' Joker was, and sided with him, and they feel bad for Ledger. A + B = in top 10 of IMDb. This movie is completely forgettable and deserves no awards and none of your time. It DOES deserve to be an example of a horrendously written, poorly shot, poorly lit, pathetic excuse of a movie.
5.0~The Dark Hype come2whereimfrom Sign in Permalink So much has been said on the latest instalment of the revitalised Batman franchise, dead stars, posthumous Oscars, arrests at premiers, will it lead to a rise in knife crime? Etc. but the only relevant question is it any good? Well Hamlet this is not so all those five star reviews and people intent on gushing all over it can calm down. Yes its dark, yes Batman is plagued by his demons, yes Heath is great, it's not comparable to Michael Mann's Heat, when all is said and done this is an OK superhero movie but considering it cost $185 million its hard to see where all that money has been spent. From a bank heist beginning that meanders to a pointless appearance of the Scarecrow to Bale flying on to the screen it seems to push all the right buttons and at the point that the Joker does his magic trick you could still be forgiven for thinking this is a five star visual feast. But unfortunately the set up doesn't really lead anywhere, there are no set pieces and at times it is even incoherent in its plot which could be from trying to cram too much information in an already overlong film. The twists, yes there are a few, are boringly obvious and I'm really not sure what happens to Bruce Wayne's voice when he dons the Batsuit but it changes to sound like a sort of vaudevillian heavy breather. That said Heath did make me laugh, he is not the most iconic screen bad guy since Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, but he is good and the supporting cast all put in fine performances. The musical style has been borrowed from a Michael Mann film and the direction is brilliant in parts but as a whole it doesn't seem to gel together. Ironically the Jokers catch phrase is 'why so serious?' And if all involved had maybe listened to him and not be so serious, pretentious even then it may have been a much better film all round. Worth watching but not, as according to the IMDb, the greatest film of all time.
10.0~Beyond my expectations samratskr Sign in Permalink Yes, I loved THE DARK KNIGHT. It is a moody tale about the struggle of good and evil, and everything in between. I want to go on and discuss particular scenes that I found to be powerful, but I really think you need to go into it as fresh as possible. Surprisingly the trailers which seem to give too much away, don't really come close to revealing what happens throughout. But what does happen, is just as enticing as the brief glimpse during the preview. One complaint some may have is the length. It is around two and a half hours, but frankly, I didn't feel it. In fact, a friend of mine who attended the screening with me, looked at me after the end credits he wanted to watch it again right then and there. I guess with any movie, you should try and not build it up too much, because there is always someone who won't like a certain film no matter what it is. Yet in the end, Heath Ledger's Joker, Aaron Eckland's Harvey Dent, and a phenomenal vision realized by Christopher Nolan makes TDK easily one of the years best.
10.0~BEST superhero film ever made? VERY likely. ckpie Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight, superb in every aspect, surpassing its predecessor; Batman Begins in every way possible. Pulling in the audience with an excellent cast, starting with Christian Bale; as the charismatic Bruce Wayne. His performance in this film was more deep than that of Begins, and Bale really delves into the character, distinguishing his separate personalities and the troubles that come with it. Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, Maggie Glyllenhal and Morgan Freeman work together to provide a very solid foundation for the true star of the show; Heath Legder. Ledger ends his career(sadly) with a blast out performance as the joker, a psychotic, evil and 'smart' Batman nemesis. A truly memorable job, he steals every scene he's in, leaving the audience stunned, amazed, frightened, so captivating that he seems to be a constant presence within the film, as we are still thinking of him even after he has left the screen. TDK's soundtrack is also to be commended. Subtle enough to not dominate the film, yet powerful enough to leave a lasting impression on the audience and also to complement all characters and settings, further enhancing the dark mood and atmosphere of Gotham City and its inhabitants. Finally, the real hero of The Dark Knight, Chris Nolan must be mentioned. From all his films, especially Momento, he has proved to be an exceptional director. He shows his skills once again, nailing Batman's theme and atmosphere with his perfect direction. Combining the well-done script and cinematography, he creates a work of art, a masterpiece. 10/10. The Dark Knight is flawless in every way, creating the very possible, best superhero film of all time. It may be a batman movie, but yet it is so much more than that. Multiple viewings highly recommended, as it is packed with so many things that one cannot fully appreciate them all without seeing it more than once.
9.0~everything I wanted it to be, from a comics freak TheBlender Sign in Permalink Well I wanted a Frank Miller style movie and I got one. Just got back from the Montpelier VT hosted premiere, presented by Senator Leahy and WB CEO Barry Meyer.... Heath's haunting portrayal as the Joker was captivating; this is the wild, anarchist, and truly disturbed loon we've been waiting for. I'm glad they kept any concrete origin out and instead opted for explaining Joker's existence as a necessity to Gotham's order and control. From the Killing Joke' "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!" He wails on Bats in one scene with cane and knife, using the strength of a madman, contrasting sharply with Batman showing restraint just when you really think he might lose it. The development of Two-Face played out well, showing his transition from strong public leader Dent to the duality driven, obsessive Two-Face, raging against free will. I'm proud to report he didn't rob the 2nd Gotham Bank at 2pm on the 2nd of February. Batman/Bruce give us what we expect from where Batman Begins leaves him; as a very very busy vigilante. It is nice how little change he goes through as Bruce, against how detached he must become, and how far he must fall as the Batman. Other than that, cool gadgetry from Wayne R&D of course, almost all of it believable. Sonic suit, cell phone hacking- a glimpse of ORACLE? wait till you see the bat-bike show up --- (eruption of cheers) Hardly any confusing effects, stunts or fights. Well choreographed and executed.
8.0~An excellent followup to Batman Begins Maddymadeline Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight was a very good follow up to Christopher Nolan's first batman film Batman begins. I watched this last night and enjoyed it pretty much but it didn't really blew me away as compared to Tim Burton's version of Batman. I enjoyed it particularly because of the acting, music, atmosphere which were phenomenal. I gave it 8 stars because I wasn't really into this whole "dark" batman thing and Jack Nicholsan as Joker was deeply etched in my memory ever since I watched it when I was only 6. The movie started of with a bang with Joker(Heath Ledger) as he robs a bank and killing his accomplices one by one so which led him to leaving with the entire amount of money robbed that day. Joker wasn't actually in need of the money, he was robbing mainly for the thrill of it as could be seen later in the movie when he burns down a mountain of cash. Heath ledger did an amazing job as acting the downright evil, corrupt, insane, psychotic nemesis of batman as he goes all out his way against what batman upholds: justice, even to the point where he made Harvey Dent aka half-face( Aaron Eckhart) a villain to Gotham city who was previously deemed as "white knight" of Gotham. Comparing it to Jack Nicholsan's rendition of Joker, Heath Ledger's version of Joker was more scary, evil and less funny which was similar to the later versions of the comic book. Besides Heath Ledger, the rest of the cast were excellent. Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our Caped Crusader as he struggles between his 2 personalities of being a rich heir and an upholder of justice which also puts his relationship with Rachel Dawes on the rocks. Aaron Eckhart also did an amazing job as "white knight." His sense of justice was also what brought him and Rachel Dawes(Maggie Gyllenhaal) together. However, the loss of his love and with Joker's mind-playing, he was drove to insanity and became the villain that he would have previously hated. Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent's as he struggles with emotions, justice and insanity brought Half-face to another level.Maggie Gyllenhaal did great replacement for Katie Holmes as Wayne's love interest Rachel Dawes, as she shows more sensitive and caring side towards Bruce but chose Harvey in the end. Michael Caine(Alfred) also delivered as the loyal butler who cares and took care of Bruce as well as Morgan Freeman(Lucius Fox), aiding Batman in the remake of his batsuit, batmobile and use of equipments and technology. Gary Oldman( Lt. James Gordon) also deserves an applaud as Batman's sidekick and police officer as both track down Joker. In short, this is probably one of the best 2008 films but not without its flaws. Firstly, there were too many characters for the given time. Both Joker and Batman were supposedly the main cast but so was Harvey. I wished that he was given more screen time as half-faced because the ending seemed a little rushed. There should be more acknowledgement to his role. Secondly, there were times where I got confused as the film progresses and I couldn't understand the discussions between La(Chinese mobster)and Bruce as well as the significance of Joker's killings. True he killed them to lure out Batman but I couldn't understand why he chose them. I feel that this film will appeal to audiences of a larger age group or those who read the comics. Teenagers might find it hard to understand. I had problems with it initially but after the movie, when I pieced everything together, then it started to make sense.
1.0~Frankly, I can't imagine how anything could spoil this tripe any further birck Sign in Permalink I went to see this godawful turkey because the reviews were good and I thought maybe there was something there worth seeing, but, alas, my instincts were correct: it was made to be delivered to the Faithful, who prefer their characters flattened out and wrapped in plastic against a blue screen, delivering the usual predictable, crappy comic-book dialogue. There goes another five or six hours I'll never get back. One of the worst aspects of this movie experience was the ever-present, omnipresent, ubiquitous, portentous, ominous and and and redundant symphonic music! Every single second of screen time is infused with impending dread....! Christian Bale stares longingly into Maggie Gyllenhall's eyes; tremulous, haunting minor chords. Christian Bale glances away at the darkened spires of Gotham; slow crescendo on B flat. Etcetera. I guess this film was just marketed too effectively; I was convinced, and went. The first Batman film starred Michael Keaton as Wayne, which was an inspired casting choice, much like casting Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man: it would be impossible, I think, for either Downey or Keaton to yield up a flat performance. In this case, though, Christian Bale's performance (primarily grim determination) has been flattened out to match the furniture, leaving only Heath Ledger and, of course, Michael Caine, still standing as convincing characters. Is that enough to make the film worth watching? It's up to you, but (A) I knew it was the last I would see of Ledger, and(B) the script for Michael Caine just isn't THAT good. On balance, I can't recommend it.
6.0~Oh, come on, people, this is not one of the 250 great movies of all time airfoyle Sign in Permalink I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images. This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives. I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing). There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously. I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst.
5.0~It's been said already but this is way overrated. zarrod Sign in Permalink Well, this film is the most overrated movie I can remember but that doesn't mean it sucks at all. It's well made, with great shots and good acting (at least by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Heath Ledger). The action scenes are filmed more coherently than Batman Begins and that pencil trick was awesome. Still, there are too many ridiculous scenes (like flying out of a window with a cable attached to a plane and cell phones turning into radar machines) and completely unnecessary plot lines. Do I really care if Commissioner Gordon plays dead for half the film and his wife gets mad at him or some Chinese guy is hording the criminal's cash? No. Give us more confrontation between the hero and villain. Lastly, the dark themes this film deals with are taken a little too seriously for a movie about a superhero of sorts. He wears a cape and a mask and fights crime as a symbol... don't try and get me emotionally involved in any THEME greater than that. Develop the characters and make me care about them. The animated "Batman and the Mask of the Phantasm" did a better job with that. Whatev, i've rambled long enough. It's still a very enjoyable movie and if I see it again i'll probably like it more but there's no way this deserves all the praise it gets. I'd really give it a 6.5 out of ten but we can't do .5s and this definitely does not belong in the top movies of all time. Too bad because it might be worthy of a 7 or 8 had it not been hyped up like it was the gift of Zeus.
9.0~For those who didn't like it........... bongsu88-1 Sign in Permalink Reading some of the comments I was surprised to find quite a few people that didn't find this film all that good... Their arguments was mainly the plot holes and the screening time.... (Or, just my opinion they wanted to counter flow all the praises that this film is getting... There are always those critics who just want to go the other direction) Well to say the least this is not enough to put a film down.... I have to agree there was some inconsistencies in the plot and some of them were unrealistic but you have to get it in your freaking brain that this is a comic/fiction/fantasy film... Batman does not exist or will never exist in real life, as well as the joker (scary dude).... With this said the script writers could have done anything they wanted to do even make batman fight with bats or make joker strip naked or whatever..... Instead they have created a fantasy that cannot be judged in the micro level but has to be seen in the macro level of things..... and damn right did the macro hit me hard, with the lessons you can learn from good and evil, the film was deep, meaningful and artistic.... If your soooo annoyed like a little kid that the film didn't go according to plan or didn't go your way then i believe the directors purposely did it to annoy you, and grabbed the hearts of the more intellectual and emotional audience..... Secondly the running time, well yes it was long, but it was long for a purpose.. It obviously follows that if you didn't like the script in the first place and thought that you were all so smart and knew what was going on it is natural for you to feel that this movie is long... so to add this to another reason why you don't like this film is just a waste of time an pointless... That said I agree to all the comments that were on the more positive light... I cannot name them all, but man this movie was something else... And to those who didn't like it, your answers are somewhere above along those lines.... Believe me I would argue with you anytime.... The Dark Night rocks!!!! RIP heath!!
7.0~Lets get a grip mike-3819 Sign in Permalink OK , first thing , no way this movie should be averaging 9.1 , don't get me wrong its a good movie , but it sure ain't a classic. If you have seen any other Batman film , then you know exactly what you are in for , no surprises , predictable storyline. All the acting is OK , Heath Ledger is OK as the Joker , no better than Nicholson all them years ago and indeed no better than Cesar Romero in the original TV show. Christian Bale is fine , apart from the stupid voice he puts on when he is Batman , reminds me of Jim Carey's alias "Hank" in Me Myself and Irene. I don't want to be too negative because its a decent movie , but some folk just get carried away and it puts a skew on the whole rating for the film. Go and watch it , I guarantee you will enjoy it , then come back here and give it an honest rating , and that is what this site is all about.
10.0~Lets put a smile on that face Mattissimplythebest Sign in Permalink The opening moments set in motion everything you need to know about a villain: amidst a bank heist each criminal takes his turn to blow away a fellow criminal until there are just two left, the idea being that their share of the loot grows with each death. At this point the Joker reveals himself to be one of the last two and promptly kills off the final thug leaving the money all to himself; the grenade he leaves behind as a thank you only emphasises the evilness of the deed as the Joker calmly drives a school bus full of money into a stream of other school buses to complete his getaway. Not since Darth Vader strolled powerfully onto the screen in 1977 has a shadow character been so menacing, and the audience knows that Batman is going to be given a torrid time in dealing with an enemy that proves to be a force of nature. If that wasn't enough then on the other side of Batman is the White Knight: Harvey Dent who as Gotham City's District Attorney seems to finally be cleaning up on the shadow world. If the Joker is a chaotic trickster character then Harvey Dent is the epitome of the truth and righteousness, a true hero. So in spite of the Joker's presence Bruce Wayne starts to consider whether he needs to continue as Batman and even envisages a day when Gotham doesn't need him anymore; naturally this dream is complicated by the fact that his long term love Rachel Dawes is Harvey's girl at the time, but never the less Bruce is really taken with Dent's ideals which after all hold the possibility of his own redemption/reward. So into this arena steps the Batman and I can safely say every event that follows draws emotion and inspiration then turns them into horror. I think for the first time we see why the Joker was created originally, twisting the laws of logic into a grotesque and anarchic vision of how he believes the world should be. For me when a character is so well defined and then translated onto screen the best part of what you get out of their performance is connection and questions; questions about your own morality and how we choose to live our lives. In my opinion these questions are most apt when coming from a good villain, after all the evil in them is the repression that haunts us all. The problems they create and things they destroy lead ultimately to an affirmation of the hero's ideals and help him to define what his role is with greater conviction. In this the Dark Knight delivers it all and has left me running back over and over it in my mind since last night. This is an outstanding piece of work from Christopher Nolan and his brother and I don't say that lightly because the last time I was this affected was after the first Lord of the Rings film back in 2001. Make no mistake this is not a kids film by any stretch of the imagination and my advice to parents is to seriously consider not taking anyone under twelve as the subject matter requires more maturity; that said this is a movie of wit and guile that will fully deserve multiple awards next year.
10.0~Why calling this "The best superhero movie to date" is an understatement Movie_Muse_Reviews Sign in Permalink To talk about the strengths of "The Dark Knight" as a superhero film and why it's probably the best superhero film yet, would be to sell it incredibly short. This film is more than about satisfying comic book fans, action junkies and thrill seekers: it is a gripping tale of corruption, crime and justice that tries mightily to pry at an understanding of human nature. Director and writer Christopher Nolan has made his case for why the superhero genre can be just as capable of delivering a view and critique of society as a crime drama--and still leave room for a plenty of explosive entertainment for dessert. Of course "Dark Knight" is no "The Godfather" (though Bale's Batman voice often becomes as raspy as Marlon Brando's), but it's still wildly successful at addressing crime in its own way-- through impeccable and frightening characters like The Joker and scene after scene of chaos and mayhem. Unlike its predecessor "Batman Begins," this film paints a grimmer Gotham City that feels more like real life and less like the pages of a comic book--and it echoes throughout all aspects of the film. Chicago proves an excellent city to serve this purpose too and it's amazing what they allowed this crew to do in their streets. No worries though, the real life feel doesn't sacrifice the thrills of a superhero action film. Nolan and his crew do unbelievable stunt work (the CGI is incredibly scarce) and The Joker schemes up some stuff that results in terrific fight scenes and action sequences, all of which are way better than the first "rebirth of Batman" installment. The script, though true to the constantly thematic-focused material of "Begins," is also more sophisticated and even less cheesy this time around. It's sheer genius and best of all--it doesn't try and do too much like so many over-hyped superhero films before it. The story takes place with Gotham back in a place of corruption, but when new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) shows up and starts putting guys behind bars (with some help from Batman and Lt. Gordon (Oldman)) the crime lords turn to The Joker (the late Heath Ledger, whose performance will go down in the books and define his short but excellent career) in order to put an end to it. The only thing is that they don't understand The Joker-- he's motivated by pure desire for chaos and that will make him Batman's most formidable foe. With the amount of intriguing characters and great actors involved, the focus shifts away from Bruce Wayne in this movie and it becomes more about identifying Batman's role in the crime-fighting puzzle. This focal shift makes "Dark Knight" a true ensemble piece. When The Joker is on screen, you won't take your eyes off of him. Ledger captures his chaos, his theatricality, his crude sense of humor and channels it towards the themes the script pushes. His lines are the best in the film and not only in delivery but pure craftsmanship. He's the glue of this film--not Bale/Batman. Eckhart is an excellent Harvey Dent and a solid Two-Face. Filmgoers (specifically Batman fans) should know that his role is very central to the film and his emergence as Two-Face ends up being the whipped cream and the cherry. Not only do you get the story of a strong hero challenged by an incredibly complex villain, but you get an origin story of a man turning from good to evil. No superhero writing team has ever put so much complexity into a script and made it work without becoming a disappointing train wreck, but the Nolan brothers do. There are some bumps, but you're so sucked in it doesn't matter. So it's easy to label "The Dark Knight" the best superhero film to date, because it delivers everything you want with an artists touch on every piece of it. What I will dare to say is this film is one of if not the best crossover between entertainment and crime drama. Combine that with the most successful and biggest viral marketing campaign ever and this film has changed the way we watch movies. But most specifically, It's thematically bulletproof and those who love superhero movies that explore the deepest depths of its themes will easily name "The Dark Knight" one of their favorite films.
3.0~The Dark Knight-mare lomaran-1 Sign in Permalink When this film came out, I initially expected it to be just as good as its predecessor, or better. I found Batman Begins to be a very enjoyable movie, with likable characters, terrible adversities, and a fittingly dark atmosphere. After seeing The Dark Knight, I don't see how it can compare. The main problem for me is that this film turned out to be another mushy, woe-is-me pseudo-epic in which the hero does little more than gripe about his problems. Granted, every hero can and should face problems of all sorts, as that is what a story is all about. But all Bruce Wayne does in this film is monologue about how his alter ego has become a new villain (which I never understood) and how he is considering hanging up the cape. So much whining and so little crime-fighting makes Batman look weak. Heath Ledger did a fine job portraying a crazed psycho-killer, but I have to ask the question why he bothered to play such a deranged character at all. I saw the Joker as a villain with a sense of humor, who did terrible things to the citizens of Gotham while throwing off rather lame one-liners and laughing crazily. Ledger's Joker has no sense of humor as far as I could tell, and there is not a single one-liner (lame or otherwise) to be heard. The only time Joker ever laughs is when he is about to cut into another victim or when the Batman is kicking him around the interrogation room: one of the few scenes in the film where the Batman really does anything. Heath Ledger's Joker is also all-powerful. He engineers enormous schemes, almost all of which involve rampant use of explosives, and pulls every one of them off without the slightest snag. He's always at least ten steps ahead of his enemies throughout the movie. The police mindlessly fall into every trap he sets for them almost as though he could see into the future and therefore act accordingly. The Joker is never really stopped, either: in the end, the writers really leave his character hanging... literally. In between Batman's depressing homilies and Joker's demonic mischief, the rest of the film's uncomfortable length is packed full of purposeless explosions, graphic deaths and a cool but needless car chase, all of which do nothing to further the almost nonexistent plot. And to top it all off, in the end Batman flees from the police into the shadows in one of the most confusing endings I've ever seen. The film plays out like a nightmare, not only because it is filmed in such a manner, but because it leaves the viewer with the depressing message that, at least in Gotham City, evil always triumphs over good. In summary, it is a nightmarish and overly long film that could have been a lot better. Great special effects, no plot. 3/10
5.0~Over hyped agmoldham Sign in Permalink I think those media representatives from the film company can pat themselves on the back for the job they've done with the Dark Knight. The hype surrounding the film has been fever pitch for several months. The furore on IMDb to get the film to be number 1 is a prime example. This is the second instalment of the latest Batman franchise. The sad death of Heath Ledger has led to a clamour for an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. Whilst it may be the best acting performance of the film I personally think his previous work was much more rounded and deserving of Oscar recognition. The Dark Knight is a classic summer blockbuster ... all action, but not quite enough substance. I personally enjoyed the first instalment more, as this focused rather more on Bruce Wayne. It seems his Batman really needs to go and see the doctor this time because that voice sounds very bad. It would have been a much better film if one of the set pieces was dropped in place of adding some depth to the characters, but I'm sure a lot of the people who loved the film would violently disagree on that point. This is definitely a film for the adrenalin junkies.
10.0~The Dark Knight godzillandg Sign in Permalink I loved Batman Begins. It was my favorite Comic book movie, because of how closely it stuck to the origins and how well the script worked. I thought that Christian Bale was the best Batman there has ever been. I see now how low they set the bar with the first movie. When Heath Ledger was announced as the Joker, I didn't know what to think. I had never really watched his movies. But when the trailer came out for the movie and I saw the first glimpses of him, I was shocked and excited. I knew then that the movie was going to be amazing. I annoyed my family with my constant talking about the Dark Knight. I like to know a lot about movies so I checked my sites for news. And then I heard that Aaron Eckhart was cast as Harvey Dent. I went into overdrive with my anticipation for the movie. It was all I could do to keep from talking about it every waking moment. Now I'm not one of those people who dresses up like the characters from the movie. But I was excited none the less. I've seen the movie four times. Three in conventional theaters and once in I-MAX. I loved it each time more than the last. The acting is superb, the story phenomenal, the dialog was some of the best I have ever heard. It can be said that this could be a really good set up for the next one, or they could stop right here and people would still be satisfied. I have to agree. I would love another Batman pic following this theme. But if they decide not to I will not be disappointed. The movie works on so many different levels. There is not a plot hole in the movie. Go see the movie if you haven't already. And if you have see it again. This movie is #1 in my book.
6.0~Holy bat pablum, it's overrated! mscherlen Sign in Permalink It's an OK movie, but it shot for the stars and hit the footlights. Yeah, Heath Ledger is dead and it's a shame that there is one less drug addict in the world, but, that doesn't mean that this was the best performance ever filmed, with that grating fake-y voice it seemed that he was acting the part, not ever becoming it. I really did like his take on the role however, as it was a fresh take on an old role, but still, he is no Cesar Romero. Having Christian Bale as Batman was an error in casting as well, not that he couldn't look the part, but with that constant effeminate lisp when he talks (and yet, Two Face is missing half his lips and can speak clearly), he made Burt Ward's version of Robin look like vintage John Wayne. Now we know why he chooses to save when he is forced to make a choice. Maggie Gyllenhall is a decent actress, but is no leading lady. To pretend that Batman could find her attractive is really stretch fantasy even in this fantasy based popcorn movie. Even that horrible movie Catwoman had the sense to give us Hallie Berry in Vinyl. I know the movie was supposed to be deep and psychological, and I'm sure research on the motivation of the characters even included reading the dust-jacket to some college Psych 101 class, but it definitely fell short in the compelling and deep sections. The cinematography was really nice for most of the movie but even it could not work magic on the lame fight scenes, or the CGI crap of the Batguy hang gliding between buildings. Hell you were in Hong Kong, couldn't you stop by Jackie Chan's place for a little choreography help? The score to the movie sounded great but was instantly forgettable. Dany Elfman did the Simpson's, why not let him work magic on this cartoon, too? Finally the bat-car sucked! Lets see, put the tires up front, because they'll never get shot out there, even if it does make the Bat mini-van look buck-toothed. That's OK though, if they do shoot out one of the tires, there is a fifty percent chance it won't be the one attached to the bat-moped. At last we find the bat man is the Dark night because he beats his mom, and still maintains a sibling rivalry with his sister. I guess the bat-dude hasn't really evolved at all.
6.0~Extremely Overrated... thisnamestoolong Sign in Permalink OK, I know my opinion may not be the most popular, but after recently watching the Dark Knight again, I am forced to air my grievances with this highly overrated, nonsensical farce of a film. It can certainly be entertaining, and Heath Ledger turned in an above average performance, for sure, but that is pretty much all this film has going for it. The plot has some gaping holes, the characters are paper-thin, the acting is atrocious, the writing falls flat, and the whole thing is entirely inconsistent. To unpack this a bit -- let's start with some of the glaring plot holes. The most noticeable one is right after the Joker crashes Bruce Wayne's little get together, and Batman jumps out the window after Rachel Dawes. OK, he got Dent out of sight and he rescued the girl, but what about the murderous villains that are still in his home threatening all of his guests? There is not even an attempt to explain this. Then there is the Joker's fortuitous luck -- he was expecting that robber to be standing in just the right spot to get hit by the bus? How does he escape from jail all of those times? He escapes by setting off a bomb? We see a shot of an explosion and then we see the Joker cruising down the street in a cop car. What? The whole Gordon faking his death thing is ludicrous, topped off by Gordon being in exactly the right place to put the shotgun to the Joker's head. Batman taking the blame at the end of the movie is also absurd -- Dent murdered 5 prominent people and Batman thinks that there will be no evidence at any crime scene to link them to Dent? I could keep going, but I think you get my point. As mentioned before, the characters are all paper thin, which was perfectly acceptable in the 1989 rendition of Batman, which was set in an entirely fictional world. The biggest problem here is that Christopher Nolan takes the same one dimensional characters and throws them into a realistic setting, making them much harder to swallow. I don't have much to say about the acting other than the fact that it made me die a little bit inside to see Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman turn in such awful performances. I did not expect much from the likes of Christian Bale, but I was positively shocked to see Morgan Freeman play such a flat, uninteresting role. Heath Ledger was certainly good, but I would have a hard time going so far as to call the performance great. If you want to see great, go pick up the Silence of the Lambs and watch Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, that is a great performance. Heath Ledger's Joker was good, but very far from great. Oh and as a side note: what is the time frame for the events of this film? A month? A year? It really seems like a random string of events, there is no sense of time passing or any sort of real things happening whatsoever. Again, in a less realistic setting (Tim Burton's Batman), this becomes irrelevant, but it is very important in a real world sort of setting as we see in the Dark Knight. All in all, this film was extremely inconsistent and entirely overrated. I would recommend that anyone who thinks that this movie was intelligent go out and rent 2001, the Godfather, and the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and then compare them to this solid-gold turd.
1.0~Who payed the critics gwsa Sign in Permalink I am deeply shocked. I am really shocked that this film made it all the way to the top. It's OK with me that it is a huge success at the box office. I can cope with it that many, many people do not have the same taste as me. Even though it is a little sad because I think this somewhat strange taste of the comic buffs will influence the movies in the future even more. There are interesting articles about the influence of the bloggers and hardcore fans on producers and directors. What really shocks me here is that many, many acclaimed critics fail to see how bad this movie is. They write about hidden stories, meanings and messages. The war in Iraq, the war against terrorism, a reflection of American society and so on. They write about hilarious performances of the actors. They write about stunning visual effects. Some of them may even write about the tremendous script. Fortunately so far I did not read anything about the scriptwriting. So I try to begin with that issue. Well, the script is so down, down, deep down below that I don't even know where I shall begin. I guess the guys who are more in the comic stuff will tell you that Jonathan Nolan really did a good job in adopting the stories and the mood of the comic books. But for me this is no reason to write a story that lacks everything and is so brain dead that I'm gasping for air. The plot is annoying and predictable. The characters are written really poorly. First of all Harvey Dent. His turning into a fallen Angel is so incredibly incredible. It may result from the way that the brains of the comic buffs work. 9 Pictures or less per page. I that time you can turn from a white hero into a black devil. But this is a movie. And no 9c trash book. To say it clear  and you may have noticed  I am no comic fan. But I like for instance Sin City very much. It is a very good adaptation into a now medium. And it is visually very interesting. Visuals. As I said Sin City is visually very interesting. The dark Knight is not. Totally not. Almost two decades before we saw TerminatorII. Oh my god, this was something new. And Two Face  Aaron Eckhart looked a little like the wrecked Arni back then. Don't get me wrong the make up apartment did a very good job. It is just so sad that we already saw it all before. (Just like the inspection of the new weapons Is this a scene of one of the Bond Movies?) Or take the Matrix (Part1) about one decade before. Visually the dark knight is not one tick better or more interesting. Maybe on the same level. Sin City was something new. The dark Knight shows us common techniques in a slightly higher perfection. The directing is average. Not outstanding. It must have been a logistic masterpiece, OK. But we have seen it before. The acting. I can't even say if the actors are bad. I think it is the story that is so poor. The Joker is good. Heath Ledger is good. Not brilliant or something like that. It is solid work. And he is the only character that is somewhat interesting and not full of pathetic crap. Well to draw the conclusion again. I can live with it that this movie is that successful at the box office. I can not live with the super high praising comments of professional critics. For action entertainment this movie is too long. At least one hour is simply annoying. (Again the writing.) So, who ever has some bucks left go see this movie and see what brain damaged means.
4.0~Dark and Dreary kenjha Sign in Permalink Although an average film, "Batman Begins" had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolan's dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome. Time to make "Batman Ends."
4.0~Wou, wou WAIT!!!.. No, seriously guys.. n-adzic Sign in Permalink This ain't no masterpiece.. I mean the film is not bad, but it's far overrated.. And i believe it's not worth your time either. Special effects are great, certainly a lot of money is waisted on them. The plot is boring.. I mean I liked "Batman and Robin" more than "Dark knight". All those high rates for this film are spoiling reputation of IMDb. That is my opinion, no insult. If you have time to waist, and you are that guy who must watch everything from the film industry, this is the right film for you. And if you don't.. than it ain't worth watching, honestly. ********************************************** this comment will help anyone, honestly ;) Nikola
10.0~A game changer for the superhero genre noahfroude Sign in Permalink Everything about this film from the acting to the screenplay to the cinematography is just brilliant.
4.0~Not Very Good theonepf Sign in Permalink I waited until the DVD came out and the initial media coverage had played out. This movie made money only due to the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. Throughout the movie I transitioned from "when is this movie going to get good" to "when is this movie going to end." Christian Bale is a fine actor and we were able to see his talents in the first installment. He had very few scenes where the audience could see these talents in this movie. He was regulated to the Batman Costume and his Clint Eastwood voice impersonation. This was unfortunate. Heath Ledgers performance was good, but not award worthy. He kept sticking out his tongue while speaking to make his character look crazy. Gary Oldman has played much better bad guys in his day and Heath Ledgers performance does not match any of those or Jack's for that matter. Maggie Gyllenhaal was fine but her role was so limited that they could have pulled all her scenes from the movie and the plot would not have skipped a beat. She is a fine actress but we did not get to see much of those talents in this movie. Aaron Eckharts did an excellent job however his characters transformation into Two Face was rushed. It was kind of like they ran out of time and had to rush him into the bad guy role because they spent to much time elsewhere. I will probably check out the third installment when the time comes, but I hope they get back to the format of the first movie. They let the the actors do the work in that version vice putting all the emphasis the superhero & bad guy characters. If they are not going to let Christian Bale act then they can put anybody into the batman suite and it will not matter. This installment is also getting to the borderline where far fetched gadgets are concerned. It's unfortunate this movie made so much money as it will give the production team a false sense of accomplishment. If they repeat this performance they will bomb next time around unless they catch another break with another unfortunate off set tragedy.
9.0~Is this is a Comic Book Movie? citizen118 Sign in Permalink Let me preface this comment by saying I'm not a huge fan of comic books or comic book movies by default, but I do enjoy the genre if it's done well. I really enjoyed Batman Begins, and the Frank Miller take on Batman in the Dark Knight Returns. As much as I liked them however, they felt like a "comic-book". Not to deride the genre, but if you read a lot of comic books you probably know what I mean when I say this. There's a certain level of cheese and immaturity associated with any character that straps on tights and an animal-themed costume to battle crime. However, the question that kept going through my mind when watching the Dark Knight was "Is this really a comic-book movie?" And I think that's no accident. Chris Nolan is certainly a master of his art and every choice that was made in this movie seemed to spring out of this idea. The sepia tone is out, replaced with a more ultra-realist look: when it's night, it's dark and when it's day it's light. The characters are somewhat over-the-top but ultimately believable: the word superhero and supervillain is never used in the movie, and even their comic-book names seem to be rarely (if ever) uttered. And the action is cool, but hardly over-the-top. The only thing that's really "comic-book" about the movie is Batman's costume, which is made about as practical as possible while still staying true to the character. It's all tied together with a rock-solid script that asks tough, thought-provoking questions, yet never gives way to a dull moment (in fact, it was so intense I think it gave me heart palpitations). Certainly a risky move to pull in a film that's appealing to an audience that is generally looked down upon by the mass media. But I think Nolan (and his brother) give their audience much more credit than the typical movie maker and it pays off--well, it did for me. What I'm trying to say is this movie is good. It's so good you may, like me, find yourself questioning your definition of "comic-book" movie.
10.0~A film where everything just works. hannibal_lusty Sign in Permalink So here it is. The most hyped-up, talked about and acclaimed superhero movie in... well, ever. Was it worth the wait? Yes Did it deserve the praise? Yes Did Heath Ledger surprise viewers who have had people nibbling in their ear about his portrayal for months now? Definitely yes. The film pretty much succeeds everything it sets out to do, and that's a lot. An epic crime film that has the similar layered and extravagant plots of something like Inside Man, The Dark Knight is far from a typical superhero film. There are psychological character studies of the Jokers anarchic destruction, Harvey Dent's shining savior and last but far from least Batman's role as the Dark Knight, the man who is above and below everyone else to do what they won't. The discussions in the film about who Batman is really defined what the character is all about and when the words The Dark Knight concluded the film I completely understood it's meaning. This incarnation of Batman is also the darkest. While Burton opted for Gothic quality, Schumacher for colorful campyness, Nolan has decided on a gritty and unsettling look at Batman. The story is unbelievably tragic and while I won't say much the film has far from a happy ending. It may not be the most entertaining superhero flick out there but it's certainly the best.
9.0~Powered by Ledger's performance. drawlife Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's followup on Batman Begins delivers. This time around, Nolan raises the stakes and provides more energy more tension and a lot more flare. Aside from The Avengers, The Dark Knight is a film that I had eagerly anticipated and also had unfairly high expectations, all thanks to the easter egg scene at the end of Batman Begins. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne and he does a commendable job. He again masks his real persona to the public and he longs to be with Rachel Dawes and sees Harvey Dent as a suitable replacement when Gotham no longer needs a hero who wears a mask. This time around Bruce Wayne is under more pressure and he faces his toughest challenge yet as Batman as he is put into impossible situations by his foes. The supporting cast brings the best of their abilities. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers her lines a little more effectively than Katie Holmes did. It's a shame for Holmes, a bad career move to not star in this, as I didn't completely dislike her in the first film. Michael Cain also provides an excellent supporting role as Alfred, again supporting Bruce in his crusade on crime. Morgan Freeman again provides the film's humor and brings in some levity to this dark film. Gary Oldman again is sharp as Commissioner Gordon, helping Batman on his war against crime. Eric Roberts also has a meaty role as mob boss Sal Maroni. Things always get worse before they get better in Gotham. So with that in mind, lets talk about the villains. I mentioned before that Liam Neeson's Ra's al Ghul is overlooked, I think Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is the second most overlooked villain. Eckhart's arc in the film is beautifully handled and Nolan does a nice job showcasing his corruption and downfall. Harvey Dent is Gotham's "White Knight," their savior. Working with the Batman and Gordon, they cleaned up the streets quite well, but to see all that mean nothing as soon as he becomes Two-Face is just depressing, and when he is Two-Face, he is truly menacing. A tragedy indeed. Speaking of tragedy, it's a shame that Ledger died before the film's release. This is Heath's movie. His Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actor is rightfully given. His win is also not just a pity win out of his death, but because he really outshine all the other nominees that year. Right off the bat Ledger steals the film in the opening scene. I did not see Heath Ledger in this film, but only the Joker. He completely disappears in the role and it's just a thrill to watch on screen. Nolan and Ledger's take on Batman's arch-nemisis is full of complex layers. The Joker's stance on chaos, anarchy, order, and mortality of an ordinary human being makes it psychologically interesting. He has no order, he is all about chaos, he doesn't care about money, as a matter of fact he has no typical criminal motive, all he wants is to watch the world burn. Ultimately, in this film the Joker has a point and that is scary, something uncommon from a villain in most comic-book films. Nolan does a great job of balancing Joker and Two-Face very well. One would think Two-Face would not get enough lime light, but he does, so credit to him and his team of writers. This time around Nolan and his cinematographer Wally Pfister do a better job showcasing the fight choreography. Now one can finally see Batman show off his martial arts expertise. Nolan again shows that Batman is more than a fighter, but also a detective and he's got more arsenal in his hands. The action sequences are a lot more action-packed and paced extremely well. Each action set piece will have you tensed up. I remember I was literally gripping onto my seat as I watched it the first time in theaters. I only had two gripes about the film. One of them is Bale's Batman voice, which is common among many. To be honest, I really liked his Batman voice in Batman Begins. It was intimidating and I would imagine that it'd actually scare someone. But here, I mean, did Bale not watch his own performance in Batman Begins? I've gotten used to it now, but I recall it bothered me the first couple times. Speaking of Batman, even though Ledger's performance is brilliant, this film is essentially very Joker focused. I feel as though Batman gets the short end of the stick. Even the Harvey Dent/Two-Face subplot feels more coherent and apparent than Bruce Wayne's arc. I think I was definitely spoiled by Batman Begins, for my taste I think the film could use a little more Batman in the film. Nevertheless The Dark Knight is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking. It's very Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Pt. II like. This movie is seemed like an impossible task, but a group of extremely talented people managed to make this film work. The pacing is brisk and it doesn't even feel like two and a half hours. There are tons of suspense as Nolan keeps you on the edge, just when you think the story will end up in one particular way, it does a 360 and completely throws you off on multiple occasions. You'll wonder how it'll all play out by the end of the film. The Dark Knight is a landmark achievement. It is a film where it showed many general movie going audience that the superhero genre is capable of being much more. Deep, complex, exciting and a rich viewing experience, The Dark Knight is definitely a film that deserves it's merits and rightfully deserves to be in the top five discussions of the best comic-book adapted superhero epic. 9.5/10
1.0~Worst S&M ever! dick_james Sign in Permalink So... What I'm getting is there's this Dominatrix running around with a cape, funny ears, and a husky/scary/arousing voice. Who also beats up guys in parking garages, but none of them got aroused, so the story didn't go anywhere. She probably should have whipped them. also there was this rich guy who it showed a lot, but he didn't really have anything to do with the story. It was strange. But on the other hand there is that buxom green haired lady who gets beat by the Dominatrix and then dresses up as a nurse. I'd buy that for a dollar. Anyday. I think the Dominatrix probably should have got slightly naked, she's got some big pecs if you know what I mean and I would have liked to find out if the carpet matched the drapes. Like, That's the stuff I would bump into on the street "by accident". That Gordon guy had a moustache that made me wonder... But I digress, there was a lot of teasing, without any climactic moments of trepidating fulfillment, or masochistic zeal. I was appalled, disappointed, and, finally, ashamed. It almost makes you wonder how director Christopher Nolan even thought he was making an erotic film.
10.0~Astounding lisa-cena Sign in Permalink No words could give enough justice to this film. It is truly a masterpiece. Me and my friend decided to go to see this film in the cinema as we wanted to see Heath Ledger in this final film. I am so glad I went to see this movie. I'll admit that I wasn't sure whether to go and this film at first as I'm not really a big fan of Batman and have never seen any of the other movies to do with Batman. I am glad I took the chance to go and see The Dark Knight because it was such a treat. The Joker was my favourite character (and not because Heath Ledger portrayed him). I found myself feeling sorry for the Joker and then not liking him and there has only been one other movie that has made me feel that way (The Godfather). Christian Bale was great as Batman and in my opinion they could not have cast anyone better for the part. Heath Ledger really did go out with a bang as he astounded me with his acting. The Dark Knight was truly his best role that he has played, well at least that's what I think. My list of favourite movies always changes but I know that this one will stay at the top for years to come. Hope my review helped.
10.0~Perfect ! andygibb617 Sign in Permalink This is a film that quite simply cannot be topped. Don't read anything else here because all you are doing is delaying the moment you see THE superhero film. Plot, casting (yes, he does deserve an Oscar nomination), direction, imagery and dialogue are all spot on. Despite being over two hours there isn't a wasted moment or scene. You will believe that they could be real people in real places by at times blurring the lines between right and wrong instead of the standard, hard and fast, good against evil. Before you say no, just look at the news in the papers. A fitting epitaph to Heath Ledger's short career is that he took on an iconic role and made it more believable, realistic and therefore frightening.
1.0~Kill The Actor Bolesroor Sign in Permalink I think its adorable that certain members of an unspecified generation find "The Dark Knight" (aka Batman 2) to be a Masterpiece of Contemporary Cinema. Is 'adorable' the right word? Christian Bale reprises his role as the humorless comic-book hero and Heath Ledger joins the cast as the humorless comic-book villain ironically named "Joker." Ledger's "Joker" is about as much fun as an emergency spleenectomy, which means to say he never laughs, never makes anyone laugh, and never jokes. Are we having fun yet? The film takes place in the same Gotham City from the previous film: flat, bleak, black, dark, foreboding, menacing, pessimistic, intense, sinister, colorless, numb, petrified... is this the fun part? Bale- an otherwise fascinating actor- manages to create a black hole as both Bruce Wayne AND Batman, leaving the audience without any protagonist for whom to cheer. Christopher Nolan's solemn direction is the same as in the first- he's working so hard to convince us that all of this is ABSOLUTELY REAL that there is no chance for any fun. Fun in a superhero movie? I must be out of my mind. What's sad is that poor Heath Ledger took the role of Actual Psychotic so seriously that it contributed to the man's death. No film role is worth your life, and if playing the villain in a comic book movie messes with your mind, you're doing it wrong. No offense to the late actor- whose performance here would have been great in a dramatic or psychological film- but Jack Nicholson nailed The Joker in '89. It was nice of the Academy to give Ledger the posthumous Oscar, but I think we all would have preferred he not die before his time. This is not to say the movie is terrible... it's still an above-average action flick with some nice moments: the sunset prison transfer is beautifully done and the scenes at Wayne's cocktail party border on subversive, but the generally dour approach to the popcorn-flick leaves me depressed, and I can't help returning to the thought that a man gave his life for this... Maybe that's what certain members of an unspecified generation want... maybe the Imagination is so damaged they don't believe a movie character is killed unless an actor really dies. I find the death of creative thought rather frightening, and I keep coming back to an old horror catchphrase: "It's only a movie, It's only a movie..." GRADE: C
10.0~THE DARK KNIGHT IS An absolute masterpiece spidey_man-1 Sign in Permalink This is the batman movie I've been waiting for for a very long time . BATMAN BEGINS raised The Bar, THE DARK KNIGHT went above & Beyond . From the moment The Dark Knight begins you are sucked into Gotham City; from the beautiful opening shot, to the end of the opening scene, establishing, the Joker one realizes they are in for something different. THE STORY: Christopher Nolan knows how to get the Job done; along with his brother and David S. Goyer the team have created, replaced and revised making a almost perfect story. This isn't Iron Man folks. If you want to see a story thats predictable and as simple as 'good vs. evil' then go see Iron Man. This film's story is going to challenge what YOU believe in. There are so many grey areas that sometimes you can't even be on the heroes side. You watch the film wondering "if I was there what would I do?" and while you may have an answer, can that apply to what these characters believe in? Along with the deep moral thinking the story is filled with some great crime oriented ideas. Joker isn't your average; shoot here, hide there villain. While he claims not to be a guy who plays and says "I just Do things" Joker has some pretty serious ideas of how to get the job done. And when Joker wants something done; he gets it done. This isn't the story where the hero narrowly stops the villain, oh no, Joker will be successful at several points of the film. All the while making the film more interesting, you honestly don't know whats coming next and you FEAR for everyone. THE ACTION: The main disapproving argument for Batman Begins was that it was lacking action. Well Christopher Nolan and crew have made sure that one cannot repeat that same statement. The action in this film is more REAL and more INTENSE. The opening is intense; the first Batman scene is intense and the Chase involving the Tumbler Joker and eventually the Batpod is what you go to action movies for. The new Batsuit comes in early and it allows for Batman for more maneuverability as Luscious Fox (Morgan Freeman) says "You want to move your head". And much more can be done in this new suit; for the first time we see Batman fighting in wide shots, allowing us to see exactly what he's doing. And the 'new' fighting style designed in Batman Begins is seen more in The Dark Knight. The story's action is relentless; just when you get a break something else terrible happens and the action picks up again. It's a roller coaster ride for roller coaster rides. THE ACTING: This is where the movie is sold the most in my opinion. I give the four biggest nods to Heath Ledger ,Aaron Eckhart,Christian Bale & Gary Oldman . Aaron Eckhart's Dent it totally believable; thusly, making his story all the more sad When he becomes Two-Face. You're going to really Believe in Harvey Dent when watching the film. Gary Oldman is Gordon; this guy makes virtue and doing the right thing, in a world filled with doing the wrong thing, look like candy. His virtue is SO true and his want for a better Gotham is SO real that you love the guy. Oldman is one of the best actors of our time; his portrayal of Gordon is JUST SO GOOD! Finally Gordon does more than just calls Batman with the Bat-signal to help with a situation that is impossible for G.P.D. to deal with on their own. like in the previous films with Burton & Schumacher. I loved Christian Bale back as The Dark Knight, he really embodies the character well . IMO he is the only live action Batman that really captured the true essence of the Character of Batman/ Bruce Wayne that has made him so popular among fans for the last 69 years in the comics & other Adaptations . The only other Batman actor to have accomplished such a task is Kevin Conroy from Batman: The animated series, the definitive voice of Batman . Getting back to Bale I happen to love the voice he has the growling/deep dark voice it's much more believable. It's shows both the anger he still feels from his parents murder & it serves a purpose It shows how far one man will go to be Intimadating. It's so animalistic and aggressive. Which is just what BATMAN is . He's a creature of The Night, A silent guardian, a watchful protector... A DARK KNIGHT... Heath Ledger (first may he R.I.P.) Oh My Goodness. I thought I knew what to expect, I was one of the many, who had been following the viral campaign for 14 months, doing every scavenger hunt, looking at every leaked photo, seeing every trailer, every last commercial, video clip, dissecting his voice, and movements frame by frame, Thought I knew what to expect and I was still Blown completely away. I'm not one to gush over acting too much; I usually say "good acting" but this was PERFECT. There is no point where you look and see Heath Ledger, that thing on the screen IS the Joker. From every last twitch, licking of lips, and word he oozes anarchy and genius. What Ledger does for the Joker is something I couldn't think of in my imagination. Ledger is right up their with Mark Hamill in my book as The best version of THE CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME . forget this review GO SEE THIS FILM NOW; STOP READING AND JUST GO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10.0~A marvellous masterpiece kalendra274 Sign in Permalink I came to watch "The Dark Knight" at the IMAX Cinema yesterday. Even though I'm not a huge fan of Batman, but knowing this movie was hugely popular all over the world and has such good reviews, I was desperate to see the magic that has raised this movie to have full stars. And fortunately, I did. Everything was perfect, the performances, the script, the special effects and all the other aspects of the movie. Therefore, it was hard to see a negative point about this movie. I was completely blown away by it, it just kept me at the edge of my seat, staring at the big screen for over two hours. The IMAX graphics were incredible. Visually, I felt like being part of the movie and I have to say, it delivers the 3-D of the highest standard. Absolutely realistic. Heath Ledger (The Joker) was the heart of the movie, he was descended to play the part of "The Joker" as he did some very amusing and excellent performances, if there was an Oscar for the best actor of the year, he definitely should deserve it. He delivers the most energy than anyone, leaving the audience to be entertained. Christian Bale (Batman) did some fantastic performances too, like Heath, he was the PERFECT choice to play Batman. To be honest with you, his fighting was the best part about it, his punches and kicks spread the whole cinema with anticipation. It looked very very realistic. I thought the script, was the backbone of why the movie was the best of the summer. It was well thought out and you can tell the writers did a phenomenal job in producing it.Normally, I'm not a fan of long movies, but the writers tried so hard to make every minute count and successfully they did. It just kept me in the edge of my seat throughout the movie and at the end, it didn't feel like the movie was 2 hours and 32 minutes. But at the end of the movie, I felt like watching more and more. I wouldn't mind if it went up to three hours, as long if it is enjoyable and never runs out of energy for the audience. The special effects dazzled my eyes, especially the explosion of the hospital, which seemed to struck lighting at the audience. It truly should deserves an Oscar. To bring it to a conclusion, it was such a true masterpiece, with incredible performances, script, special effects and whatever else was put in the movie. It was just the best film of the summer. Trust me, you won't be disappointed by this epic, you'll be stunned.
8.0~The history of The Batman has always been drowned in darkness. somewhereovertheturnip Sign in Permalink The city that spawned the violence that gave birth to the Dark Knight himself; the psychotic emulators that Bruce unwittingly coded; the constant struggle within to maintain a strict moral code - not to lose himself completely to the darkness he shrouds himself in out of necessity... all these elements add to a dark, brooding and violent mythology that Nolan manages to capture perfectly without ever giving in to the gratuitous. While the film is gloriously over-the-top (which is of course fitting for a comic book universe), Nolan manages to ground the larger than life characters and story arcs just enough to add a chill and striking reality to them (Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker is especially stunning). A perfect example of violence (both the physical now and the mental histories) and tragedy handled with real care and attention, TDK stands as testament not only as a marker for other comic book adaptations, but as an expert example of how to do darkness without dealing in the absolutes that shallow the usual attempts. A chaotic and brilliant masterpiece.
4.0~Ummm... not the "masterpiece" the marketing dept at TDK wants you to believe. biggsterboy Sign in Permalink I saw this movie opening night, a fan of Batman Begins, and eager to see the next installment of a promising franchise. I purposely avoided the "hype" prior to watching - I like to watch a movie with as little preconception as possible. After having seen the movie, I am blown away... by the 30-something pages (at present) of cloned reviews stating that The Dark Knight is "a masterpiece" "an instant classic" "epic" "better than the hype" "legendary" "oscar-worthy", etc. It wouldn't bother me so much except all 30 pages of reviews say *exactly* the same contrived things. Not until after you get past these "glowing" marketing reviews, do you see 10 pages of real honest reviews buried in the back. The real tragedy is that I used to feel that this website was credible, but now I'm not so sure. A few hundred picture perfect reviews here are worth multiple millions in next weekend's ticket sales. That's an easy decision for a marketing department to make. But back to The Dark Knight and back to reality. Here are just a few of the problems with it: Poor character development. With the possible exception of Harvey's character development (which was too rushed) you don't really feel any sense of growth, change, or evolution of the characters. In each of the many acts in this film, the same conflicts are presented over and over - the characters are stuck in a loop - the main thing that changes are the locations and who gets blown up. In some cases you have no idea what the motivations of the characters are. The Joker is insane, maniacal, twisted... but ultimately with no explanation of why he does what he does. Shocking behavior without a point is... well, pointless. Poor storyline development. There is no beginning middle and end. Nothing is actually resolved (aside from the fate of a few characters); again it's just a series of loosely strung together conflicts that happen over and over again in various iterations during the course of 2.5 hours. The ending is very unsatisfying as there is no sense of resolution. The action/fight sequences are filmed too closely and irritating to watch. The fast movement and the close up shots are indistinguishable and you can't tell what's actually happening. While it's visually stimulating (in an MTV kind of way), it's not very intellectually captivating to watch body parts of one unknown person striking the body parts of another unknown person for minutes at a time (I know this because I had to keep checking my watch). The cinematography was too dark. While this was obviously a choice for establishing the mood for the film, it made the film a strain to watch. The very few scenes shot in brighter light or daylight were a relief to the eyes, but these were few and far between. The above paragraph applies to the theme of the movie... it was so pervasively dark, grim, and depressing, with almost no contrast, it made it very exhausting to watch. I typically enjoy "dark" films, but the successful ones manage to infuse variation and interesting counterpoint throughout. For all of these reasons the film is just too long... films can be interesting for 2.5 hours but in light of all the problems above, this film just dragged on and on. The "social experiment" reminded me of an assignment you might get in a first semester college psychology class. "Discuss what people might do if they're in a boat..." It was just a bit too contrived for me and I found it a bit laughable. The result was even more contrived. Heath Ledger: Great performance but impossible to view the film and not feel the impact of the actor's untimely death as you watch him on-screen. His interpretation was excellent and his actual dialog was well-written, but his character could have been so much more interesting if there were some basis for understanding the origin of his insanity. I really wanted to love this film as much as Batman Begins, but unfortunately I found my interest drifting at times. It was not a bad movie, and there were some great moments as well, but just not the "masterpiece" the marketing types want you to believe.
5.0~Overrated, just average Mr_W Sign in Permalink The movie wasn't exactly bad but certainly doesn't belong in the top 250. I'm not a big fan of Nolan's view of Gotham City. Tim Burton made the city look very surreal in his two Batman movies, whereas Nolan wanted to make a very realistic and dull looking city. The film's biggest problem is the plot. The movie felt at least an hour longer than it actually was because of it. It has way too many characters and elements, and it's ultimately a long and boring mess. It doesn't even have a proper ending, it just hints at things to come. I also was longing for more action scenes. The movie only has like one slightly longer action scene, and even that isn't that great. There are smaller scenes here and there, but they are usually ruined by crappy editing, which doesn't allow you to see what's actually happening. The best part of the movie is Heath Ledger's Joker, even though the character suffers from poor development. We only learn that he had a difficult childhood and that's it. Ledger still manager to make him a very disturbing character. Don't believe the hype and make your own conclusion.
10.0~Intense, Amazing, Near Perfection popedarren Sign in Permalink When I walked out of the movie I was asked what I liked about it. "Everything," I answered. Everything was nearly perfect about this movie: the action scenes were intense; the plot was easy to follow to enjoy the movie, but deep enough that it merits a small discussion with a group or multiple viewings; and the acting... my god, the acting was incredible. I found myself laughing out loud, not because the movie was particularly funny, but because Heath Ledger NAILED his performance in every scene. The Joker's character nuances were hard to miss and easy to love. After his first and second appearances in the movie I found myself just waiting for the next scene with The Joker. I've seen the movie twice now and can't wait to see it again just to see Ledger's acting. It's not that the other characters didn't do their part, because they did. As always Christian Bale delivered a performance that is hard to rival. Aaron Eckhart, I feel, has thrown himself into a realm where those who see this movie will be hard-pressed to forget him. I've always liked Eckhart, and now when I talk about him others will know who I'm talking about. The only complaint I had is that the movie felt compact. Yes, it was long; no, it wasn't rushed. I just felt like there was so much more story to be had. It's like when you're reading a really good book and you see the number of pages narrowing and you just don't want it to end. My thanks and congratulations to everyone who made this movie. TDK deserves its spot near the top of the greatest movies ever made.
10.0~Does the hype let the viewer down? franz-57 Sign in Permalink So, the hype is relentless and the calls for Heath Ledger to get an Oscar had me wondering if this was Hollywood unashamedly plugging a film. I wondered if, on a visit to the cinema to see the film, would it fail to live up to expectations. And I was feeling a bad taste in my mouth over the anticipation that Heath Ledger's would be good but not have the wow factor. So, I went to see the film last week. Wow! Quality film and an amazing performance by Heath Ledger. Even a cynic like me loved every single minute! It's a two and a half hour film that never slows down and allows you to check how long it has been running for. Who cares - just keep on going. That felt like forty minutes filled with pure entertainment. I don't know if Heath deserves an Oscar but, should he not get it, the performance that is awarded the Oscar will be for an incredible display from another actor. Heath Ledger, without any sentiment to the actor due to his death, puts in an incredible display and is dark and comical. All the actors were superb in this film. In the UK it has a 12A certification but I'm not sure if I would take a 12 year old to see it. It is a fantastic departure from stereotypical Hollywood American-dream drivel that is so often churned out. Brilliant!
10.0~Heath Ledger makes you forget Jack ever played Joker! cafesmitty Sign in Permalink This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker. I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences. But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains. Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute. Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted "Dark Knight". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight.
1.0~Crappy film, fine aftermath. CineCritic2517 Sign in Permalink A below average film which went on far too long. Heath Ledger didn't completely fail at portraying The Joker, but to compare him with Nicholson and favor him is insulting to both their careers. He's essentially just playing a rather generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker and can't really dazzle anymore after a scene or four. Christian Bale is like a fossilized chunk of wood in his role as Bruce Wayne and as (the) Batman just seemed to be in the wrong movie and desperately in need of some antibiotics. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were fortunately able to add credibility to it all and when they appeared on screen, the movie was actually pretty great. Pity though that they only got about 1 % of the movie's screen time. Aaron Eckhardt was given nada to work with and was equally wasted. But who can really be surprised watching a movie like this. Just too many inane plot turns which just pulls you further and further away from wanting to find out where it all was heading. I Walked out after the 100 minute mark to get a smoke and just couldn't bother to walk back into the theater. The evening was saved approaching a charming girl at the cinema bar serving ridiculously overpriced, yet abhorrently tasting cocktails. We ended up at her place and we danced to K&D until the first rays of morning sunlight found their way through the ragged drapes covering a cracked windowpane. As she peeled of my clothes as if I was an overripe tangerine, she whispered softly in my ear a mantra of passion. Film: 1/**** Night: 4/****
1.0~Overrated... marijn82 Sign in Permalink Okey I went to the cinema for this movie with the idea it was higher rated then the godfather and pulp fiction... Well i just registered to IMDb to say I was very disappointed about this movie. Just because the flaws in the movie some. Here are some really stupid things in the movie: 1. Batman can bend a gun barrel whit his bare hands. 2. Dogs can chew true batman Armour but bullets can't. 3. The Joker can do everything: 3.1 He drives a school-bus into a bank and drive away without being noticed by anyone. And the bus had no scratch on it. 3.2 He can get into everything even on a parade with 100 of cops and the cops just ignore him there not even thinking about where there college's are. (But cops don't think in this movie they just panic when 1 guy takes a shot at the mayor) 3.3 The hospital that is guarded by lot of cops, Joker just walked in, the explosives are just there and he just walked out and blows the whole place up. He gets on a school bus and vanished into fin air. 3.4 He has tons of explosives on ferries that are heavily overcrowded. 3.5 They lock him up with a personal guard but they also lock him up in a general jail. Did he wanted room-service on his jail or was the personal guard to prevent him from getting bored? (but again cops are stupid in this movie) I had a lot of moment in the movie with:'Just shoot the Joker!!!!!'. Gotham was not Gotham but some city in the USA. Batcave was some to big ugly place under the ground with to many lights. third degree burn wounds just put a blanked on it wait some days and its all good but ugly. And god he was in pain I really noticed that... Balistic testing with some big ass gun why do you need a machine gun to fire 1 shot at a time for testing. This movie is just bad. But there some good things one is the joker was good he missed some good Joker jokes but at least is was evil. And really that the best thing I have to say about the movie. I give it a 1 against all those who gave it a 10... normally I would give it a 6/10
10.0~best superhero movie ever made. mmc_1589 Sign in Permalink honestly, i never truly enjoyed any other superhero movies i've seen before the dark knight. most of them don't really expose you to brilliant acting and the dramatic presence of dark knight. so at best, most superhero movies are just "cool" because of all the crazy fight/action scenes... but wow, dark knight is easily the darkest, most well-made, and most adult superhero flick ever. not that batman begins didn't do that, it's just that the dark knight did it 10 times better. i know everyone is talking about heath ledger as the joker, and it's no surprise to me, because he was amazing. i wasn't planning on seeing the dark knight on opening weekend.. maybe not even in theaters. but all my friends went to the midnight shows on Friday and convinced me of how amazing it was, that i saw in Sunday afternoon. and even on the 3rd day, the theater was sold out. i know what you're thinking. i'm just giving ledger a good review because he died. but to be honest, i never payed much attention to heath ledger before, because i really didn't think he was that great of an actor. so to me, it was weird how much praise he was getting when he died. then again... this happens when any actor or actress dies. no matter how good or bad people thought they were before, when they die, it's like people feel bad and say only the nicest things, like "she/he was the best actor of our generation"... even when they probably weren't. but god damn... heath ledger was absolutely amazing in dark knight. never seen him like that before, and didn't know he could commit to a role like the joker the way he did. going into the theater, if i didn't know "heath ledger is playing the joker", i still wouldn't know until i saw his name in the credits. it's not so much that he was playing the role really well, it was more like heath ledger had disappeared and HE WAS THE JOKER. it's hard convincing your audience, and making the joker a believable character in this very dark and realistic version of batman, but ledger did it flawlessly. the dark knight is heath ledger's swansong. his best role yet. it's just a shame he won't be around for the 3rd film. he completely stole the spotlight in the movie. as a member of the audience, you find yourself wanting to just see more of the joker. he steals every scene he's in, and you wish he was in every scene he's not. i swear, this Halloween... you won't see kids in the batman suit. you're going to see kid's with white face paint, fake scars on their cheeks, and purple suits. i wouldn't be surprised at all if he got an Oscar nomination for his performance, and if he did, i'd expect a win. Christian bale, as expected, delivered another great performance as batman. only this time, we saw a whole new side to the cocky, confident billionaire, Bruce Wayne. Gotham city is going through it's toughest time ever, and you see that in bale's discerning batman. i can see i'm writing on and on here. so i'll just say this about the crew and supporting cast- Christopher Nolan - visionary director, made Gotham city darker, deeper, bigger, yet more beautiful than ever. Aaron Eckhart - truly portrayed what you would expect of the most realistic version of two-face. Michael Caine - after his performance in batman begins, you'd only expect the best from Caine as Alfred, and that's what we got in dark knight. Maggie Gyllenhaal - great acting ability tops Katie Holmes portrayal of Rachel Dawes, for sure. Gary Oldman - what do you think? Morgan Freeman - Lucius fox in his most powerful moments. 10/10 - best superhero movie.... ever.
4.0~Not impressed jmaycock Sign in Permalink I know I am going against the tide here. And I am happy that so many people had a good experience watching this film. I didn't. Maybe I just don't get it? I'm not sure, because I am a fan of superhero films in general. I think perhaps what I don't like is a superhero film that tries to be so serious as to make us believe in it. Batman, and previously I would say Unbreakable, fall into this category. If you want me to take you seriously then tell me this. How the hell does a guy with his face painted run around a city causing mayhem without getting caught? How does a guy who kills his accomplices continue to have support? I mean he even burns the loot so money isn't the answer. How does a guy who claims he doesn't like planning (because he's too crazy to care about planning) manage to get so many barrels of oil and dynamite positioned all around the city with ease. How does he get said equipment on to the two very important ships? A city that is on high alert? Was there nobody to check? The list goes on and on. If the film wants to be taken seriously, I think it has to fill these holes. If it doesn't, then no problem. There can be as many holes as you like. Another bad point was the length of the film. Far too long. On the plus side the acting was very good, although I didn't like the overly put on voice of Batman. However, Ledger deserves all the praise he has been getting for this.
5.0~for me,it doesn't even touch Batman Begins disdressed12 Sign in Permalink i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.and with stratospheric hype this newest film had,combined with the trailers i had seen,i knew i had to see it.many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype,so i expected something earth shattering.to say i was disappointed is an understatement.there were moments where i was bored,and hoped it would end soon.Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me.it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel.either that,or had a bad case of laryngitis.maybe there was a reason behind this.but all it did was annoy me.as for Heath Ledger,and his performance as The Joker,i found it OK,but i wouldn't say it was award worthy.i mean no disrespect by this.when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre,neither the the character of The Joker,or any aspect of the movie stayed with me.bottom line,i didn't find anything profound in this movie.i was massively disappointed.it doesn't even touch Batman Begins,in my opinion.for me,The Dark Knight is a 5/10.
1.0~Dark...very dark! milosengle3 Sign in Permalink OK. First I am a BIG fan of BATMAN and especially batman villains. To me JOKER is even bigger than the good guy. And I have 5 elements that are the key to a great movie: direction, story, music, acting and atmosphere in the movie. And the Batman saga is all about atmosphere. I watch all 6 BATMAN movies. Tim Burton was good. Joel Schumacher had some good moments in the 3 but blow up at 4 batman. Christopher Nolan is bad. His Batman Begins was bad. The Dark Knight isn't bad...it's dead. THIS MOVIE IS DEAD! Shore it's a expensive project but do something with the money!I don't wanna pay a ticket to see a trailer lasts 2.5 hours.The story is the center not the stupid special effects!I love Batman and I still believe in Hollywood,but he is bringing me down and down... Dark...very dark!
9.0~Curtain Closes On The Joker - One We Will Never Forget djvale Sign in Permalink You know the score. This film was destined to be #1 on IMDb. This film is destined to be one of the highest grossing films in years. This film is destined to be one of the "best films" ever. Why? Well - you know why. *wink wink nudge nudge*. The Dark Knight is without a doubt the best film I've seen this year, and in fact, a long time. Giving this work of art 10 stars would leave a bitter taste in my mouth, because I know it does have some flaws, but its a solid solid solid film. What I can say is this, is that its without a doubt, the best Batman movie that has ever been made. And thats pretty damn good in my books. Batman Begins was pretty awesome - but this film, it takes Batman Begins by the neck, pulls and tugs at it and dangles it like childs play. Simply put, The Dark Knight will go down as one of the best comic book conversions this millennium. The balance between humour, action and drama is spot on - and that makes such a pleasant change. Christopher Nolan has gone down the route of his trustworthy Bale & Caine team that he has used in his last 2 films (Batman Begins & The Prestige - both by the way, awesome films) and they still do not disappoint. Bale is the perfect Bruce Wayne, funny, diplomatic and arrogant, it was if he was born to play that role - whilst Caine, plays the intelligent yet lovable butler and close friend of Bruce, Alfred. Morgan Freeman also turns in a delightful performance as Fox, partner of Bruce in "Wayne Enterprises" - whilst also providing Bruce with equipment and suits for Batman. Harvey Dent aka Two-Face - is probably the weakness of this film, almost Spiderman 3 in many respects, bringing in new characters towards the end segments spoils the party, but it was a decent performance from Aaron Eckhart - don't get me wrong! I felt as if his character didn't have enough depth to it - and wasn't given enough time to develop his anger and mental image that Two-Face develops in the comics. Gary Oldman as James Gordon is also a sure fire hit. He completely knocks his Batman Begins appearance for 10, and gives us vintage Oldman. The star of the show - as you may have guessed it, was The Joker. Heath Ledger in his best role to date - and unfortunately, his last. Heath's portrayal of The Joker is dark, clever, disturbing and mischievous. The Joker appears within the first 5 minutes of the film, and you already begin to sense how it will pan out. Twists & turns all the way through. The more of The Joker you witness, you begin to realise what an interesting character he is, and how he makes Batman realise that he is just the same as him. A renagade, a vigilante, a nobody. The body language and charisma from Heath Ledger is spot on. Jack Nicholson is well within his rights to tip his hat off to Ledger, as he has done a fantastic job. Every scene with The Joker shows different sides of how fascinating an actor Ledger really was; from the delightful intro, to the "magic trick", the prison sequence, right through to the lorry chasing and the climax. Oscar worthy? Why not, there hasn't been a villain THIS beautifully crafted since Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal. All in all - this isn't a one trick pony - its a fantastic film in its own right. Plot twists, surprises, fantastic pace, perfect balance of drama and action. Why 9 stars? I felt it could of been darker and aimed more towards the adult fans. I felt it could have been bloodier and I felt that the Two-Face character was somewhat premature and the final Joker scene felt unfinished in some respects. I honestly think giving this #1 on our list is somewhat tedious, but it does hold its own spot in cinema history as being one of THE best comic book adaptations I've seen in a very long time. So when you put that into context, thats damn good. Heath Ledger has stamped his mark on the genre, and raised the bar so high now, you just hope that if there is a next installment, that the next villain will be able to step up to the palette. R.I.P Heath.
3.0~Surprisingly incoherent and boring colossus24 Sign in Permalink I don't think that in my quarter century of living I've ever felt more disconnected from the pop-culture at large than after seeing this movie. With all the hype and uniform praise I thought beforehand that this is at least a solid piece of cinematic craft, maybe embellished slightly by Heath Ledger's unexpected death. Unfortunately, this movie is rock solid proof that sometimes mass delusion can strike an entire society at one time. There is absolutely no way that this film can be regarded not just as a masterpiece, but even as half-way decent. Let's get to the point. First - the plot. It's just unconvincing as a whole. Batman is basically a side character with little to do as he takes backseat on the Joker train. He whines incessantly about how no one needs him and how he needs to hang up his cape. Do it already! His troubled relationship with Rachel Dawes has zero chemistry and it's hard to care about the outcome. The idea of Joker being an anarchist, goalless and malevolent force sounds good on paper, but it translates to aimlessness on the screen. Joker shows up out of nowhere seemingly with no one backing him and then... snap! It seems like the whole world is at his service. Not only he has no trouble hijacking a school bus (and then blending into a line of school buses after driving out of a half collapsed bank), hacking into the public TV feed or rigging an entire hospital with explosives; he apparently does it with such ease that the creators didn't feel the need to reveal a shred of information about how he did it. Many events in the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example - what was the purpose of Lt. Gordon faking his death? And why did they make a point of showing the scene where his family is informed of the death - was that just to get the audience to buy into it as well? That's just dumb and a waste of time. Why did Harvey Dent become evil all of a sudden? Sure he was badly burned, but he had to know the risks going into this business and he had a steely resolve just minutes prior. There are many other plot issues, but it's pointless listing them all. They are there and easy to spot. The acting in the movie is a-OK, but most of the actors just don't have any good lines as their characters are irrelevant puppets. Heath Ledger is good for sure, but his take on the character gets tedious after a while - mostly from overexposure. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good actress, but she's just so wrong for the role. She's a nice-girl-next-door type and as superficial as it sounds, it's hard to believe that she would have two hotshots like Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne chasing after her. Christian Bale has zero material to work with and they've turned Morgan Freeman into a moralizing nerd. Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and especially Michael Caine do a decent job considering the script they were given to work with. The screenplay is atrocious, incongruent and messy. It's like the movie was cut-up into a thousand pieces of varying length, reshuffled and then strung together. There is no natural progression of events and subsequent scenes frequently befuddle. It takes a couple of minutes to figure out what the hell is going on or why should we care. It's just poorly done. For all the car chases, fight scenes, and giant explosions, the movie is just unforgivably boring. It's a combination stemming from a poor script, naive (or barely existent) plot, flat characters (that can't be remotely identified with much less loved or hated), and a general lack of good sense. There is also an annoying feeling that the creators had a rather low opinion of the viewers intelligence or maybe they just rushed the movie and had to come up with a lot of material in a little time, hence the low quality. Before I end this overlong diatribe, let me just mention three scenes that I absolutely cannot get over with in terms of their pointlessness and stupidity. 1. Batman is riding his wicked-cool motorcycle approaching an aftermath of a multi vehicle crash and accelerates aiming it straight at the Joker. What he is trying to accomplish is never explained. One thing certain is that at the last moment he veers right, barely avoiding the villain, and drives his bike without touching the brakes, straight into a wall. I mean he drives it into a wall (or overturned truck, can't remember) full speed like a blind man. Had he even chosen to hit the Joker, how the hell did he expect to stop? 2. This one actually occurs a couple of times at least. Batman leaps out of a 20th story window and falls onto the ground unharmed. Unharmed! He didn't have a parachute, a bungee cord, and he didn't even spread his cape on the way down. He just hit full blast and walked away. And on one occasion his squeeze Ms Dawes fell with him and experienced a similarly puzzling lack of after-effects. Filmmakers, needless to say, didn't find it prudent to even try to provide some explanation. 3. Joker enters the hospital in a nurse uniform. That should present a logistical problem by itself, but OK. However, not only he seems to move around the hospital freely, he also does it still wearing his face paint. I mean the lower half his face is covered by a protective mask, but the rest is clearly visible. What's even funnier is that Harvey Dent looks at Joker straight in the eyes and the face paint doesn't give him away until he takes of the mask. Is this a cartoon?
10.0~never seen nor will see a movie like this!! sahabrandon Sign in Permalink It is a movie made by a passionate film maker ,whose passion could be sensed in every set pieces and story elements .I happened to be very fortunate to get to watch it on its opening day 18 july ,2008.And whatever ill assumption I made before entering the theater was completely vanished and i was speechless ,from its glittering imax footage ,action chase sequences to human emotions , everything is top notch ,I hardly believe ever there could be any film made with such perfection. This is not an ordinary movie which is made from computer graphics footage but believe me the stunts are for real and performed under strict guidance and a lot of practice and a lot of hard work . Talking about the story , you could sense minute details of human emotions and it feels so refreshing that you would definitely be not forgetting at all .It seems pretty rare for some blockbuster movie to offer that thing. 10 on 10 from me!! worth more than 100 time watch!!!
10.0~This is one of the best movies of all time ehortav Sign in Permalink This Is a movie that nailed the balance of being a superhero Flick , a thriller and a psychological drama... Everything feels real, you forget this Is a superhero movie.. There have been great superhero movies along since 2008 .. But the bar set by Nolans Epic it will be imposible to match .. Logan got somehow close though..
1.0~This is ridiculous big_anand Sign in Permalink This movie is good, but not the best movie ever made. Not even close to being the best movie ever made. Why has IMDb allowed anyone and everyone to vote. This is insane. Prestige by the same director and cast is far far farrrr better. The background score is a killer. Thats what sets the mood of the entire film. The movie should actually be called "The Dark Clown", because the Joker is just one of the best characters played on screen, in a long long time. Heath Ledger has the soul of the character in his grasp. As for batman, where is he? I hardly saw him.
6.0~This Contains A Lot of Spoilers... If You Haven't Seen the Movie, You Probably Won't Want to Read This clouded_eye Sign in Permalink I know it's a little cliché, but Batman has always been my favorite comic book character since childhood. I loved watching reruns of the 60s TV show in the 80s, but as I became a teenager, I needed something with a little more substance. Then came along a series of graphic novels and a movie (yes, just one with three embarrassing entries following)which gave me that. Now, as an adult, I find myself still needing more. Batman Begins gave me a taste of the Frank Miller and Alan Moore I liked so much as a teen. It was a start, and a good one, and The Dark Knight continues in that trend; giving more. People are right in saying that The Dark Knight is much more than a comic book movie. And true, it does fit well into the crime-drama genre, but it isn't as good a film as some I've heard it compared to (Heat, Scarface, The Godfather)... One thing about this series of films is that they are well cast. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Cillian Murphy; all good or great actors although if I were Cillian Murphy, I don't think I would have returned for that tiny little cameo; a minute and a half of screen time, two-thirds of which was whining (maybe he just really likes Christopher Nolan). Even usually mediocre actors like Michale Jai White and Eric Roberts turned in surprisingly good performances. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a marked improvement over Katie Holmes, but still I must admit letting out a sigh of relief when they killed her character off (I told you there were spoilers)... There are a few issues I have with the film, though, the first of which is Two Face. Two Face is one of Batman's classic enemies. They spend two and a half hours building character development for him and for what? To kill him off at the end? What a terrible waste. And he looked pretty impressive. Too bad. Second, although the Heath Ledger was great in his role and even though I think he looked great (some of my comic-geek friends hate the look), the Joker should have been slightly more playful or flamboyant. If they had just incorporated a tiny bit of Jack Nicholson, the character would have been perfect. Not over the top like Jack, but just a taste of looniness... Last are issues put forth by other reviews that I have an issue with. 1. The movie is geared too much to American audiences... Batman is an iconic American character and has been for 70 years. Shut up. 2. It's too long... It's only 12 minutes longer than Batman Begins... Again, shut up. 3. It's too dark and violent... I respectfully disagree 4. The Joker is too scary and he's not funny... aside from what I said above I, again, respectfully disagree 5. Bad writing, bad directing, bad acting... Must not watch a lot of movies... Anyway, I really liked the film, but I'm honestly looking forward to Iron Man 2 more than Nolan's Batman 3...
10.0~Batman's better than ever!!! pico_shaolin Sign in Permalink Holy Cow! Batman's back! And this time its not only our Caped Crusader who gives an explosive performance, but believe it or not his arch-nemesis, The Joker(wonderfully, unimaginably, brilliantly portrayed by the Late Heath Ledger) is the actual show stealer. The movie keeps you hooked on to the screen from the very beginning till the credits start rolling. Christopher Nolan Proves it yet again that when it comes to movie making, he is THE Best!!!(Memento, Batman Begins & The Prestige proved it too) But The Dark Knight surpasses them all. With the kind of standard Batman Begins put, it was inevitable that The Dark Knight would deliver so much! The cast was amazing, as it is in any Nolan movie. Ledger's performance as the menacing, psychotic, scary, and every other word that can be used to describe a mad-man, was way, way, beyond amazing. Christian Bale's role as the multi-billionaire Bruce Wayne and as the Dark Knight was a hundred times better than any other person who have portrayed Batman.(No offense to Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney) The supporting cast was undoubtedly fantastic. Maggie Gylenhall added a lot of substance to the character of Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart was simply outstanding as Harvey Dent and the Two-Face. Sir Michael Caine, well, was as usual as his very great self as Alfred. Morgan Freeman put a lot of substance to Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman gave a stunning performance as Lieutenant and later on Commissioner James Gordon. Special effects were ground-breaking. Edge-of-the-seat chase sequences were one among the the many best parts of the movie. Also, Batman returns with a much more gritty and bone-crunching style of combat. Bottom line: A must see for any die hard fan of the Batman franchise, for those who wished that Batman Begins could have been better, to those who do not want to miss Heath Ledger's last and the best performance, not only of his, but also of any actor of our time. The Dark Knight will keep you on the edge of your seat for a long, long time!!!
4.0~Gimme A Break verseczy Sign in Permalink This is the future comic book adaptations are headed? THEN WATCH...ME..GO. What a sucker punch. I had such a big hopes (mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop), that it really hurts me to say, the biggest disappointment in 2008 was this movie. (Although, I still can't say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldn't see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!! Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super hero's outfit, however for what they used here, I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween. Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldn't even move properly in it,(heck, he couldn't even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light. How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every 5 seconds, scary? try Retarded (No offense) Imitating raw home made camera footage, once invented by Blair Witch Project, in a News-break part was when I almost smashed my TV. (Again, where the money went in this film???????????????????????) I'll tell You where. Paying all the critics for a few favorable words. Shame, on You Hollywood. Sure, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were Over-The-Top, But-Man, did I love their use of colors and mood, it was a visual treat. Dark Knight: was it a bad movie?, No, it wasn't. Disappointment? You betcha'a! Long Live Jack Nicholson.
10.0~Best Screenplay of all Time vardhana Sign in Permalink We have seen a lot of Super Hero movies but "The Dark Knight" is different from all other super hero movies, that is Christopher Nolan, I Wonder why they don't give an Oscar for Best Screenplay writing.
10.0~I'm gonna make this pencil disappear....... skarphayse Sign in Permalink After seeing the film you will be unable to get the above out of your head (no pun intended! You'll know when you see the film). I really dislike fan-boys so it makes me sick as a parrot to have become one myself - The Dark Knight makes me rabbit on like my wife whenever someone discusses the film and foam at the mouth like some sort of rabid pet that needs to be put down. It's also the only film I have seen at the cinema more than once (three times and all at IMAX at a cost of £30). Chris Nolan has somehow created a film which makes me denounce anyone who doesn't love it as an infidel who is not worthy of life. While a tad extreme (just a tad) I honestly believe we have here not only the best comic-book adaption (by a country mile or twenty) but one of the best films full stop. I'm sure everyone has already dissected Heath's amazing performance as the Joker so I'm just going to say please see it at IMAX at least once. A gimmick it is not and it enhances one of the best films ever immeasurably. Watch it now. Go on. Go on, go on, go on ,go on, go on.....
5.0~Wow, this is a REALLY bad movie! Spoiled Batman Begins.. ernils Sign in Permalink If I could give this movie less than a 1, I would certainly do that. I had read and heard so much about it that I was sure this would be a defining work of numbing minds to make a bad story look good with cheap tricks. I was game and we thought it can't be as bad as the critics said - you know critics. Sure enough... Give me a break with the awful acting (OK excluding Heath..), horrible camera work, poor use of the budget (that has been mentioned over and over again). I've seen better on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. It's the Director and the Producer that makes films work - they choose the teams. That's it. If they don't put it together and make it work...it simply won't. So, they didn't - and it doesn't. Worst part is that I know this group can do good work... I just had to take the time to write this review...though I'm sure the film crew and the half crazed fans doesn't appreciate this review - I hope I'm doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well. Good luck. Final Word: The polar opposite of Batman Begin's awesomeness.
1.0~Can't beat original Batman (1989) BY FAR hoodie232 Sign in Permalink Compared to the original movie: 1) No Batman movie can beat the original Batman (1989). 2) There's not even a Batwing and Batmobile. 3) Heath Ledger did a very good dark version of the Joker, but unfortunately there is no better Joker than Jack Nicholson. 4) Danny Elfman could not do a better job making the soundtrack. 5) The 1989 Batman "Main Theme" has an unforgettable, recognizable classic. 6) Christian Bale's voice as Batman is always grumbling, which just sounds horrible every time he speaks. 7) Christian Bale's head wearing the Batman mask does not even fit him, looking ridiculous which he fails in the role of Batman. 8) Original Batmobile is a classic car. Vehicles used in The Dark Knight? Enormous large sized wheels under an ugly armored piece of steel. 9) No Batcave. 10) Christopher Nolan, you're out of order with these modern Batman film series. 1 out of 10 for The Dark Knight (2008)
10.0~The Dark Knight- Best superhero film ever made ChaseIsPro Sign in Permalink This movie can be put into so many words, but here's just one...EXCELLENT. Once again Christopher Nolan teams up with the wonderful Christian Bale with also some other new characters like The Joker which is definitely the best Villain I have ever witnessed in my life. Heath Ledger(1978-2008) gives his best performance ever in this movie, totally Oscar worthy. Harvey Dent, which is played wonderfully by Aaron Eckhart, especially when he becomes Two-Face. And then we have Maggie Gyllenhaal who gives a terrific performance as Bruce Wayne's love Rachel Dawes. Please do go see this film you will be very glad you did.
1.0~Insulting, boring, and one lazy movie dullfinboy Sign in Permalink This is not a Batman movie. It is just wrong. Again with the realism! Batman isn't supposed to be realistic and when you make Batman realistic it doesn't feel like Batman anymore. This movie is full of speeches! All the Joker does is vomit up dialogue. He also doesn't even look like the Joker. The Joker is supposed to use toy-like gadgets and weapons not all real weapons. Now onto Batman. Christian Bale is once again terrible and is not fitting in the role. His voice is the worst voice ever! This also has to be the most overrated film of all time. People rave that this is the best Batman movie ever. No it isn't! This doesn't even feel or look like a Batman movie. This is even less creative than Batman Begins. It is also even more boring. I am so sad to see my favorite superhero be reduced to a growling, dancing, and uninteresting character. Nolan is to into making his Batman films realistic that he forgets one of the most important that make a Batman movie and that is creativity. You have to be creative when making a film on any superhero especially Batman. It is just something that lacks in his Batman films. This is such a bad movie.
10.0~What a movie...!!! Maroun-Sader Sign in Permalink I was waiting for this kind of movies, simply WHAT A MOVIE!!! The plot is amazing, the action is thrilling, the casts just rocks, and the dark environment gave the movie what we are waiting for...a 10/10 movie!!! You will see a new different kind of Masked-Superhero movie, you will be so attracted to the movie, like you never did before. When you go out the cinema, don't be surprised that you need to want it again, IT WORTH IT! The movie shows you how bad,evil man can cause a destruction, spreading fear all over the Gotham City, in a real "close to reality" way.On the other side, one man shines and fights him in an amazing "Good vs Bad" battles,turn up to become WAR!! The movie is 152min, and you will never notice!!!!
10.0~That's A One Heck Of A Masterpiece helalever Sign in Permalink Just got out of the movie , and WOW!!! ..... It Reminded me of the thrill I felt after getting out of the "LOTR The Return Of The King" Just a few words for the "Knights" who carved this masterpiece : ((Christopher Nolan)) ...> You've made history, if you didn't take the Oscar then the Academy Awards Committee must go and find another job ...,,... ...,,... ((Heath Ledger)) ...> If you were still alive, You should have been awarded for every scene you appeared in this movie...,,... ((Gary Oldman)) ...> Sir, you made the BEST cop role I've ever seen in my life...,,... ((Aaron Eckhart)) ...> You really deserve to be called as "The White Knight" ...,,... Last but not least ...>>> ((Christian Bale)) ...> You have proved that you're the best actor played the role of Batman, Salutes .......... .......... ........... ........... Don't want to make it a long comment but I'd like to thank each and everyone of the people worked in this movie **Thumbs Up** Thank You
10.0~What a Great Movie!! dimitrisalomao Sign in Permalink It's hard for me to rate a comic book movie 100%, the only movies of the genre that deserve this are "Superman(1978)", "Spider-Man 2", and "The Dark Knight", but why? Right in the beginning, we see the joker robbing a bank with a plan that is, for me, as good as the final plan of "Ocean's Eleven", and this is only the first scene, you'll see , in the movie, at least 2 equally brilliant plans. The Joker's philosophy is so well made, that in sometimes you'll forget that he is just a maniac, and even think that he is right. Despite the fact that Cristian Bale is not very good playing Bruce Wayne, it's not that bad, he's just there. Now let's talk about the Ledger's performance, Of course it deserved the Oscar, of course it is awesome, but I think that it's not only him that made this character great, I mean, almost every lines that comes out of the joker's mouth is memorable, and it's not only because Ledger's performance, it's the excellent script that makes this. Like the critic Pablo Villaca said " See the vulnerable and tragic figure of Batman diving in the shadows of a city desperate for heroic figures is one of the strongest and saddest images that the genre ever produced ", this complexity is what makes "The Dark Knight" different that other good superhero movies, like "Iron Man". Verdict: With an unusual complexity, "The Dark Knight" puts superhero movies in another degree of film-making and storytelling, now go watch this!.
8.0~Did he lives up to the hype? la_544 Sign in Permalink I had high expectations for this movie and went straight after work last night. Once we got passed the undercover cops with night vision goggles and got to out seats 'The Dark Knight' didn't disappoint... Well not too much anyway. With all the hype about Heath Ledger was it as good as everyone talked about? Heath's performance was fantastic. He was creepy, insane and the close ups was where he really shined. He had this quirk where he kept licking his lips. There is a wonderful part of the movie that will make you laugh and shudder at the same time. We'll leave it as The Joker dressed as a woman. Personally I think his performance is up there with all the hype, but does he deserve an Oscar? I'd say he'd be high up there. Unfortunately we'll never know if he deserves it on his acting ability or his death. This was his best performance. Christian Bale, Gyllenhaal and Freeman all played there parts well, but they all just seemed like a fill in for when the Joker wasn't on screen. Gary Oldman was great and Aaron Eckhart shone as Harvey Dent. I actually thought we'd see him transform at the end and he'd be used in the next movie. It was a nice surprise to see his alter ego come out. He did look like terminator though. The movie was fun, dark and I didn't expect it to end the way it did. I came out a little disappointed that I'd never see Heath again and also felt a little underdone with Christian Bale in the movie. Heath simply steals the show as the joker you'll be left wanting more. Sadly the movie as a whole almost felt like a fill in for an even bigger sequel.
6.0~OK OK OK, let's not get carried away..... jay-jay8513 Sign in Permalink First of all so many here are praising this movie as it is the best movie ever. For me, I don't rate it like that. It was an okay to good movie. I rate it 6 out of 10. And here are the 4 missing points of the movie: 1.) They changed Katie Holmes in the movie to Maggie Gyllenhaal. Katie Holmes did extremely well in the first part as Rachel Dawes. I would've preferred Katie than Maggie. 2.) Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent who transformed to Two Face. When his half of face was burnt, how can he talk normal when his face was showing some skeleton and not even feeling any pain at all?!?!?!?! That really made me wonder why :S 3.) Why was Cillian Murphy AKA TheScarecrow in the first scene and didn't act throughout the movie as one of the enemies? 4.) The Joker did a good job but not too perfect. But then again, why would everyone think that no one could do it better than him? Of course every actor can. That's my personal point of view. And hypothetically speaking, ff he was to be nominated and win the Oscar, it would be because of so much sympathy. All in all, an "OK to GOOD" movie.
7.0~Good summer movie. No masterpiece. barberoux Sign in Permalink It is a good movie. It is not a great movie. After all of the hype I was a bit disappointed. I enjoyed the movie but thought it was just a run of the mill superhero action flick. The performances were good. All of the actors were believable and Heath Ledger's Joker was a great character but it was a one note performance. There was no real depth to the character for me. Each time he appeared he acted in the same psychotic manner but there wasn't an exploration as to why he was doing what he was doing or where he planned to take the story. The story was just a simplistic hatred of Batman and a want to unmask him. Sorry, same old, same old. Superhero movies suffer from clichéd story lines. Superman in each movie will be exposed to kryptonite. Profess his unfulfilled love for Lois Lane, (why I don't know. She is usually portrayed as some skinny, ambitious harpy), and is eventually saved from the bad guy by some babe. Spiderman yearns with unfulfilled love for his girlfriend and fights off some bad guy while reminiscing again about his Uncle, who we get to see die again. Batman will struggle with his demons while fighting off another bad guy punctuated by corrupt cops and double crosses. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a fine actress and is attractive but she is not an outstanding beauty who would attract the Joker to her in lieu of all of the other babes in the room. It is not helpful when the script has to tell you that the character is beautiful. The character's looks should tell you she is beautiful. Monique Curnen was there to provide the corrupt cop. One of many. She was wasted. Give me something new and fresh. Not a new gadget but a new story line. Explore more than the obvious. This movie was a series of vignettes of action scenes and simplistic twists. There were way too many deus ex machina moments and the twists did nothing but provide excuses for more action scenes. SPOILER ALERT. The scene with the cop being goaded by the joker to beat him up was clumsily telegraphed. Gordan appearing again at the exact opportune moment rang false. Aaron Eckhart's accident and metamorphosis into Two-face was rushed and hardly used. It became more of a distraction from the main story of the Joker. The Joker's character could have been examined in more depth. As it was the ending felt like it was there only to provide grist for the sequel. Heath Ledger's unfortunate death, which added hype to the movie, also destroyed the ending of the movie. There was no closure. It seems more like coming attractions for the next movie. Don't get me wrong it was a fun movie but it is just a summer popcorn movie and not a wondrous masterpiece it is being touted as. See it, enjoy it and then forget it until the next installment.
10.0~A Magnificent Saga DeltaParadox Sign in Permalink I am a big fan of Batman Begins, but when watching The Dark Knight I was amazed at how well crafted it is, how the character evolve, the themes and emotions portrayed in the movie and the amazing performances. This is truly a masterpiece and one of the best crime saga's ever made. A perfect 10. When watching The Dark Knight you get introduced to a dark and violent world filled with all types of emotions. The story get faster as the movie proceeds and soon you are lost in the world of Gotham City. The dark tone of the film fits the new antagonist "The Joker" perfectly (who is portrayed in a marvelous performance by Heath Ledger)and as the story moves on you start to understand all the character and their inner darkness. I cant really say much without spoiling it but everything in this film is done to perfection- the story, the style, the acting, the music and the technical aspects. Also the film has numerous mixed emotions as the story progresses that truly make you think and analyze the events, and many moments in the film can only be described as epic. This is a must watch for anyone who enjoys movies as i can assure you you will be pleased and will want to watch it again. 10/10
1.0~Confusing, ultra unrealistic, inconsistent tonedef1 Sign in Permalink No one else I've ever talked to in person about this movie has disliked it. All my friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, random strangers on the street that I pass by... they all LOVED it. Not liked it a lot, or thoroughly enjoyed it.. they LOVED it. And I couldn't stand it. Honestly it made me feel like a bit of an outcast. So it was with great pleasure that I found that even though this movie is on the Top 10 movies on IMDb, there are a plethora of reviews containing exactly the same qualms I had with this film. I registered with IMDb just so I could post this review and lower this movie's rating a tiny bit. (+1 to all the negative sentiments in all the negative reviews of this movie)
6.0~Puts you to sleep, upside down, like a bat. karl_consiglio Sign in Permalink Not all too sure what the fuss was about. Could not really follow all that was going on. At times the over use of effects were loud enough to cover the conversations between the actors. But I like how Batman is a dark and serious looking figure that however represents order in Gotham, whereas the Joker with his "smile" is an agent of chaos, this is well balanced out and the two need each other, its very yin yang. I saw the film unnecessarily long though, and I had to go to sleep towards the very end, something I very rarely do. I think the film was a bit over hyped, maybe due to Ledgers death, he was good, but not all that, certainly not the baddest criminal I seen on screen I think one's death often makes people appreciate their work all the more, as though it starts being seen in a different light. Some nice scenes of Gotham here, The Batman is far too James Bond-like with his toys though.
10.0~The Dark Knight, an Oscar worthy masterpiece. MairegChernet Sign in Permalink The problem is not that this film is so good, yet it's that I don't know where to start. Every aspect of 'The Dark Knight' is beyond extraordinary. Every tiny detail in this movie is done with utter brilliance. Let's start off with the acting. Though the star of the film is Christian Bale, who plays the caped crusader known as Batman, I think we all know who the real star is. The late Heath Ledger, playing the psychopathic maniac, blew everybody away with the best performance of his life(that's just my opinion, some of you might have liked him better in Brokeback Mountain). When I say best performance of his life, I am not being sympathetic, although he does deserve the sympathy of every movie-goer for his tragic and unexpected death, when I say best I mean best, I have never seen a villain being played so wonderfully. Jack Nicholson is no way near to being as good as ledger for the joker's role. Nicholson would have made us laugh and we would have just looked at him as our relative with a bipolar disorder. However Ledger's performance is in a completely different world. From his creepy make up and scars, to his wicked sinister laugh. The Dark Knight has to be the best movie of this summer and perhaps the whole year. Everything in the movie is wonderful. The acting was top notch....I couldn't have asked for better directing techniques nor could I thought of somebody who could have played the roles better. In comparison with the 2005 film 'Batman Begins', I am pretty sure we all know which is better.Every aspect of The Dark Knight is better than Batman Begins, the gadgets are modified, the villains are more intricate, and the action is more satisfying(although I was hoping to see Katie Holmes in this one). A solid script combined with great action make this film an outstanding one, and as for Christopher Nolan, he gives us another Oscar worthy flick, R.I.P. HEATH LEDGER.
2.0~Aren't we a little overblown about Dark Night movie? laserdude Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already. It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again. The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones. This movie made me tired.
10.0~Ama...zing chunkz29 Sign in Permalink Hmmm... what can i say about this one, it's a master piece, Joker all the way, and great action packed Super villain Movie, really, nothing for batman to do, it was the joker show all the way, but really, he rocked. The dark Knight took me by surprise, i was never interested in batman and i didn't quite like the first one, n also wasn't interested in this, but just when it released, my young brother told me to see the first part, and i did see it, and it did not turn up well. But when i saw the trailers of the Dark Knight, i took my brother to the theater to see it first, and now i'm the biggest Batman, i mean the Joker fan. May his soul rest in peace
10.0~Much More Than a Batman Movie parke-1 Sign in Permalink With this film, where do I begin? The Dark Knight was one of the greatest films I have ever seen. The directing, writing, acting, and visuals were all incredible. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was chilling, eerie, and believable. Everyone else was excellent as well. Nolan is now one of my favorite directors of all time. He has proved himself as a director, and will go down as a legend. This was much more than your average Batman movie. It was a more dark and on-the-edge- of-your-seat crime drama than a superhero movie. Plus, there are relieving comedic moments that keep the film entertaining, along with all the action sequences that keep you begging for more. This was a speechlessly brilliant masterpiece. Recommended for everyone! 10/10
7.0~It's no Batman Begins and certainly isn't one of the 10 best films of all time benroberts007 Sign in Permalink How can you say it surpassed Batman Begins in all ways, I was disappointed because it wasn't nearly as good as the last film. It lacked a plot at times, dragged on and the whole two face bit was a waste of time. It had potential to be a really good film but it just didn't cut it for me. Shorten the film and remove two face (alternatively not kill him off to set him up for the next film) and it could be brilliant. It certainly doesn't deserve to be in the top 10 films of all time, in fact I wouldn't put it in the top 250. Don't get me wrong, there were some good scenes and Ledgers performance was brilliant making it a good film, but certainly not as good as some people are making it out to be.
3.0~Laughable - Batman trying to be an art-house movie! badajoz-1 Sign in Permalink Batman is a comic strip! The Dark Knight thinks it's Dostoyevsky! Over long, exceedingly tiresome and boring, one note performances, stale CGI stunts with a script that is more pretentious than portentous! Director Chris Nolan gets some marks for subtly taking the rise out of Bush and America, and convincing a very large audience they are watching Fellini, Tarantino, M. Mann and Carol Reed all rolled into one! Yes, folks, if it's dark, it must be a serious film!!!! I loved the holes in the plot(must be deliberate), when The Joker says he is an anarchist, who does not plan, but then produces several stunts that would have required Rand McNally precision and hundreds of accomplices! And please,I know he died under strange circumstances, but Heath Ledger, although not bad,is miles behind Jack Nicholson. As for the rating certificate, the British censor should be thoroughly ashamed of himself, or did he think it was just a Tom and Jerry comic cartoon?
1.0~Wow... cpbockman-1 Sign in Permalink Good cinematography and special effects makes a perfect movie??? Well, according to most people, I guess so. But for people like me (unfortunately there aren't too many of us individual-minded thinkers left), it takes a good STORY to lure us in. To me, this movie tried noticeably hard to pack everything together and failed... of course unless good cinematography and special effects gives you a hard on. A way-overdone story with an unrealistic genius villain loaded with shattering glass and more shattering glass is what I got out of it. One thing after another made me feel like I was watching "Batman: The Law & Order Miniseries." Oh yeah, for one of the best, if not the best movie of all time, this thing didn't leave me in awe for a second or raise the hair on my arm one bit like so many movies with a believable, likable story. Funny to think how well this film would have done if you could take away let's see... the cinematography and special effects.
7.0~It's good, but let's not get carried away macateer4 Sign in Permalink The second Christopher Nolan batman movie marks an improvement on the first but only just. The film, like so many other comic book adaptations and action movies just tries to pack too much in. And also suffers from the same Achilles heel of a lot of modern films conscious of sequels: it doesn't know where to end. What ever happened to two guys having a fight and one of them dying? The Heath Ledger performance rightly gains all the plaudits, but his was the easiest part. The supporting cast are strong, with Gary Oldman particularly strong. The film tries to introduce too many villains, the original Tim Burton movie got it right, one film = one bad guy. As a result all scenes without Heath Ledger seem like a distraction from the main attraction. And for some reason Christian Bale puts on a Dirty Harry-esquire rasp while donning the black cape. The real same of the movie is that we don't see more of the Bruce Wayne character, when Mr. Bale puts on the stiff rubber suit his acting becomes stiffer. Great comic book movie, yes. Great movie, no.
1.0~No worth the money friendsof-imdb Sign in Permalink My comments refer only to the 2008 USA release, aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 widescreen version (not the IMAX aspect ration 1.44 : 1, which could potentially be better) Sorry but the movie was AWFUL, Not worth the money! Special effects aside, gadgets, and the Batmobile which is a dream automobile, the movie runs 152 minutes too long, unnecessary ending, but most importantly does not have any resemblance to the original Batman series or the comic books, neither in character, nor intent. Best of the movie is the director Christopher Nolan,his attention to detail and superb sequences,i.e: bus braking out of the bank, the capture and return of Lau (Chin Han), the explosion, and the capture of the Joker (Heath Ledger). The characters are very intense, especially The Joker, Bruce Wayne/Batman, & Harvey Dent/Two-Face. The best and worst of the actors, I'll start with the worse. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both accomplished actors they are probably two of the finest alive, Sir Caine was the worst of the supporting characters, neither of the two were convincing, they failed in their craft both were consistently bad actors in this film. The best was Heath Ledger hands down, his performance was top-notch, consistent, but above all spectacular. There will be a sequel to Batman: The Dark Knight which sincerely hope will be better.
5.0~Didn't Enjoy the Whole Movie Lwills093 Sign in Permalink I didn't enjoy the whole movie and the parts I did enjoy still didn't make up for this letdown. Plot: Nothing new. Seen it all before. Bruce Wayne fights the bad guys in Gotham City while disguised as the batman. Boring. Of course the police chief, the mayor, the district attorney and some rich guys are all there as usual doing the same old thing - politic'n. Boring. The fight scenes: unrealistic. Bruce's punches are too slow for a fist fight let alone that the bad guys had guns and in real life would have easily shot Bruce many times. If they thought bringing in fine actors such as Michael Caine (Alfred) and Morgan Freeman (Lucias Fox, the "gadget specialist") would help, it didn't. They could have cast anyone as those characters and it wouldn't have mattered overall. Parts I enjoyed: Heath Ledger as the Joker was a whole other story in itself. Mr. Ledger owned that performance and to me stole the show. All of the scenes were filmed with amazing quality and skill. To bad the storyline was boring.
1.0~Entertaining, but NOT a masterpiece. Uh-uh. Not by a longshot. bluebot Sign in Permalink Wow. Can't believe how high the rating is for this film on IMDb. Did we all see the SAME film?? Wow. Okay, just got back from seeing this, and I gotta say, I was very, very disappointed. Overall, the movie had its moments, but maaaan oh maaaan, was this movie WAY TOO LONG. And unnecessarily so. So far, Christian Bale has proved to be a satisfying Batman, but NO ONE has lived up to my vision of what Batman should truly be up on the big screen. That said, let's move on. THE VIEWING EXPERIENCE: The WORSE PART about this movie for me was the editing. It was unforgivably choppy. Too many scenes ended too abruptly and I guess a whole lot of stuff happened off camera because there were a considerable amount of "GAPING PLOT HOLES". THE ACTION: Very intense from the beginning which was great, but the movie peetered out toward the end. That whole scene with Harvey Dent holding Gordon's family hostage was just way too long and too over the top. Dent's transformation into evil happened too quickly, which made his descent into "Bat-Villain" unconvincing. It was like he was having a very bad tantrum, that's all. He needed to be spanked or hugged. Nope. Despite what you may read, there wasn't ANYTHING poetic about it. Sorry, Freudians. COOLEST SCENES: I really liked the confrontation scene at the jail between Batman and The Joker. Great, great stuff. Batman was extremely close to "losin' it" and I thought for a second he just may kill him, he just might snap and do it. But nah. Batman isn't nearly as amoral as ol' Clown Face. Another scene I liked was when Batman was in Hong Kong kickin' some baddies asses, then he grabs the head honcho Asian dude(can't remember his name, sorry), launches some balloon thingy in the sky, hooks himself and the baddie to an oncoming plane (which of course was all arranged...I wonder who was flying the thing? Lucius?) which takes off into the night sky. That scene was TIGHT. Executed brilliantly. MOST MEMORABLE SCENES: The Joker making that pencil "disappear." The Joker walking away in a nurse's uniform as bombs go off behind him. Classic. Those images will stay with me for a long, long time. COOLEST TOY: The Batpod. Geeks will cheer. PERFORMANCES: Heath Ledger was good, yes. Did he give me chills and simply blow me away? Sadly, no. But perhaps I was expecting WAY TOO MUCH. After all, the buzz on his performance as The Joker started way back in January. Does he deserve a posthumous Oscar? No. An Oscar nomination should more than suffice for the "kudos" he's been getting. His death is what has swayed, or rather, "manipulated" people to say this is the most incredible performance ever seen on screen. Don't be so gullible. It's a good performance, don't get me wrong. But it's not history making. However, Heath now makes Nicholson's Joker look as campy and as ridiculous as Cesar Romero. Christian Bale had his moments; so did Aaron Eckhart. Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine will always be veterans of their craft. Everyone else could have phoned it in. THE MUSIC: Not memorable. And in some scenes, shrill and annoying. Where or WHERE is Danny Elfman? WHAT BUGGED ME THE MOST: Batman's gravelly, and super LOUD voice. It sounded completely ridiculous and over-amplified. Not menacing. Just ridiculous. I thought the script tried too hard to send a message. What we got was sophomoric rhetoric which was overly "preachy". THE ENDING: A dud. Even though the movie was an agonizing 2.5 hours, I still felt something was missing. Batman being "hunted down" by Gordon and the GCPD was lame. The Nolan brothers should've written a much more satisfying ending. I felt cheated. There was not enough of a satisfying denouement for The Joker. He was just left hanging there upside down, giggling like a school girl on crack. They should've given The Joker a much more satisfying final scene. Like that last shot of Anthony Perkins in "Psycho", staring chillingly into the camera. Joker's exit should have been just as memorable and just as SCARY. What they gave us was WEAK. Pure and simple. And that really, really SUCKS since it was indeed Heath's final scene. His final image up on the big screen doing what he loved the most. They could've given him a better tribute than that. WHAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN: The Joker being FUNNY. Come on, people! That's what The Joker has ALWAYS been about. Not campy, but funny. Heath's interpretation of The Joker was nothing like in the comics. I understand the Nolan brothers wanting to be dark and all that, but let's get real and stick to story origins, okay? The Joker is a demented psychopath yes, but he's also supposed to be wickedly funny. You know, laughing at his own sick twisted humor. We got NONE OF THAT from Heath's portrayal. What he played was a character who should've been named The Sicko. Or The Money Burner. Or Chaos Man. In any case, the Nolan brothers, to me, failed to give us The Joker we all really wanted to see. Again, I liked Heath's performance. I did. But there was still so much missing. OVERALL REVIEW: I was entertained by this film, but was sadly disappointed with the pacing, the editing and some of the gaping plot holes. And what sucks is that I'm a HUGE Batman fan. HUGE!!! I SOOOO wanted this film to be a masterpiece, but it wasn't. Not by a longshot. I actually gave this movie a 6 out of 10 stars, but most of you made this movie's rating on IMDb just unforgivably TOO HIGH.
7.0~Who ever said becoming was better than become? Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday Sign in Permalink It's an unwritten rule that in superhero movies, the sequels rarely to never live up to the standards of the original--how many of us were spellbound by THE MATRIX only to be jilted by its disastrous sequels? THE DARK KNIGHT squashes any presumptions that nothing could ever surpass the original, whose wholesome darkness, originality and excitement made it possible for comic book adaptations/blockbusters to become more than the sum of its genre. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself in every way possible. BATMAN BEGINS was about Bruce Wayne's roots and his journey to becoming Batman. Very interestingly, the emotional arc of THE DARK KNIGHT is not on Batman (though Christian Bale is still solid as both charming Bruce and his darker alter ego), but rather on Harvey Dent's (an excellent Aaron Eckhart) crusade against corruption and how own eventual dark journey that, by either chance or choice, will shape him into a hero or a villain. The love story between Dent and Rachel Dawes, who cannot wait for Bruce anymore, is also what supplies THE DARK KNIGHT with its human heart, and what makes the film's dark turns all the more poignant and suspenseful. Everything about THE DARK KNIGHT is edgier, from the music (the screeching buildup is at times unbearable) to the violence (the Joker's disappearing pencil trick will shock you). A great deal of this is indebted to Heath Ledger. If Ledger hadn't died tragically young last January, the sold-out midnight/3 am/6 am showings probably wouldn't have been as momentous, but the kudos for his performance still would've been higher than the skies. To say that his performance is majestic isn't enough--it transcends Brando and Cagney and de Niro and Malcolm McDowell's astonishing performance as Alex de Large. A film critic for Entertainment Weekly once wrote about Christian Bale in RESCUE DAWN that "I've never seen the actor look more at home with his own taut charisma." That praise has to be passed on to Ledger, who seems so comfortable with his madness it's truly terrifying; When I was in the crowded theater I thought, "this must've been what it was like back in 1955, when REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE came out, just after James Dean died." Ledger will become a cult figure, there is no doubt. This will be his biggest hit, it is inevitable. But once you surrender yourself to his exquisite madness, you're able to forget the fact that Ledger is gone and that the ghost on-screen is the last of what will remain. The only quibble I have about THE DARK KNIGHT is the recasting of the Rachel Dawes character. Katie Holmes got a lot of unfair publicity during BATMAN BEGINS because of the media firestorm around her relationship with Tom Cruise. She even got a Razzie nomination. She is not this generation's answer to Bette Davis, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is actually the better actress of the two. But having already set up this character who is very crucial to Bruce's life, it's awkward to have another actress cast in that role. It's like trying to imagine anyone else but Ingrid Bergman falling in love with Humphrey Bogart during the Paris flashbacks of CASABLANCA. However, the role, already small and somewhat insubstantial, is a more diminished in this film than its predecessor, and it's only a minor annoyance to a practically perfect movie. This is the film we've all been waiting for, and it's the film we deserve. I hope you all take in the unforgettably exciting atmosphere of the crowded theater, and remember the greatness of Heath Ledger that is lost, but with this film, it'll never be forgotten.
9.0~He who laughs last laughs best matlefebvre20 Sign in Permalink To be perfectly honest, I'm not the kind of moviegoer who waits to see the critics' reactions or to witness the box-office numbers in order to determine if I go watching a movie or not. Usually, my mind is made up several months before the release. I love Batman movies, but I expected to wait until the DVD release of "The Dark Knight" to get hold of it instead of going to the theater right away. But after hearing about the numerous laudatory reviews about the movie and witnessing the box-office records being beaten one after another in so little time, you'll understand that I couldn't resist. And now being able of talking about the movie in a retrospective way, I can tell you that I would have regretted my first choice. If "The Dark Knight" is that much praised and that much seen, it's because it's well deserved.. Whether a moviegoer is a fan of Batman or not, whether (s)he's curious about Heath Ledger's final role or (s)he doesn't give a damn, it'a movie that can satisfy anybody, independently of what's looked for. The story begins shortly after "Batman Begins" ends. How much time, exactly? The movie isn't very clear about that, but we quickly figure out that there hasn't a lot of time spent between the end of the first movie and the beginning of the second one. The Wayne Manor is still under re-construction, so Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and his servant Alfred (Michael Caine) have to live in a penthouse for some little time. Meanwhile, criminals haven't been totally eradicated from Gotham City's map. And one of them, the manic and schizophrenic Joker (Heath Ledger, in the role of a lifetime and a death-time) appears and doesn't take much time before spreading even more chaos and terror in the streets of Gotham. Harvey Dent (a surprising Aaron Eckhart) is the new district attorney in the city and his energy, his ardor, his determination and his intelligence fascinate the inhabitants of Gotham. He has fallen in love with Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Bruce's childhood sweetheart, and he works closely with the few honest cops of the city, all personified by scrupulously honest Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman). Obviously, when you think about the Joker, you can imagine that it won't be an easy game to win. But even if you're anticipating a lot from him and his performer Ledger, let me tell you that you'll be completely spellbound once you see it for real. Many journalists and professional critics imagine that Ledger could be granted a posthumous Oscar for his performance. Even if there are a lot of movies that will be released until the ceremony, and that many great roles will be unveiled before that date, I have to say that if Ledger receives a nomination, I wouldn't be surprised at all. I can imagine many of you having a suspicious look about the possibility of seeing a comic book villain awarded with an Oscar, but believe me, Ledger's performance is breathtaking and will silence many skeptics. It's simple: Ledger didn't play the Joker, he WAS the Joker. His appearance is very convincing (thank the make-up artists), but his voice, and especially his twitches with his tongue demonstrate the whole scale of his role. It's too bad that he's dead, because Ledger had everything he needed in order to become a new Brando or De Niro. But the biggest drawback about Ledger's performance, it's that he steals almost all the publicity, while another actor who deserves some recognition is almost completely overshadowed. I'm talking about Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, transformed at the end of the movie into Harvey Two-Face. Eckhart is astounding and he also delivers the performance of a lifetime. He is completely convincing as Harvey Dent and he is even more as Two-Face. As for his facial make-up, you can see it, but you can't believe it. It completely flabbergasted me for the rest of the movie. I think that "The Dark Knight" deserves a nomination for Best Make-up. The story is particularly complex and the movie, with its two and a half hours, may be a bit too long. Some would say that the movie is impossible to follow, that he contains a lot of useless characters and that some scenes could have been shortened up. I shall acquiesce to these complaints, but I also think that director Christopher Nolan deliberately created a film based upon the Joker's personality: manic, chaotic, merciless and full of surprises. Nolan proves once again his great mastery of mixing action scenes with the psychological side of his characters. The cinematography here is even more extraordinary than in "Batman Begins". Here's another man who should be awarded with an Oscar in a more-or-less distant future. Besides Ledger and Eckhart, the other actors play their own role with professionalism. My only complaint concerns Maggie Gyllenhaal, who I think is totally miscast, especially after that Katie Holmes played the role of Rachel Dawes in the first movie. If you compare both pictures, it looks like Rachel has aged of about fifteen years between both. This film makes us realize two things. First, Heath Ledger had a lot of potential and his premature death will earn him a place in the category of the stars dead too quickly, among with James Dean and River Phoenix. Second, Ledger's performance, paired with Jack Nicholson's one in the 1989 "Batman" proves that the Joker is the #1 villain in all of the comic book medium. "The Dark Knight" will probably be venerated as Heath Ledger's swan song and as Aaron Eckhart's breakthrough. It will also be probably treated as cursed, considering Ledger's death, Bale's arrest and Freeman's accident. One thing is sure, it will forever be a great movie and the immutable testament of a legend gone too quickly. Hence the saying: "Only the good die young."
6.0~Not as good as most people would have you believe robert-dawes Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot. Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him. My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that. The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going. As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be.
4.0~The most overrated film ever antileft Sign in Permalink This is by far the most overrated film ever , and this is supposed to be even number 1 on the IMDb 250 best films ever ? Better than Star Wars , American Gangster , Starship Troopers , Indiana series , Aliens to name but few ? On the basis of well-paid film promoters and their 'opinions '? Unbelieavable! What is good in Batman : it is , rightly centered on the character of Joker , and the performance of Mr Ledger is , rightly, great ,as he is portrayed as the sadistic scum , who likes to destroy , maim , generally blow up everything , not for some ideology , or , even worse , money, but for the fun of it ( He even says : I like simple things , like a stick of dynamite ), and other performances are also acceptable , but when the idea of a character Two face enters the spiel , the fun abruptly ends and falls into the philosophical abyss, consequently extending this film to the unbearable 2 h 30 minutes, ending with the , mind this , Batman as a main villain ?! Has Mr Nolan become a great fan of a modern philosophers like Zizek from Slovenia , where the most illogical and inconsequential is the norm ? Fie to this ! And visually , besides a minor 3 minutes of car chases with the Batmobile , there is virtually an empty space !Bring back Jack and T. Burton !And the famous bat dance with the Prince's tune !
10.0~Swan Song of Heath Ledger - Dark Clown could teach Pennywise new jokes AirBourne_Bds Sign in Permalink How can you fight an evil that is purely psychotic for sheer randomness? This film could easily be a commentary on USA's War Against Terror, and how the hunters are not so different from the prey... If it was not said Heath Ledger was playing the Joker in all of his satanic glory then I would not have known who it was at all! The man finds the nastiest way to make sure he has no dividends to share for a successful heist and makes the robbery look like part of an innocent field trip; he uses a pencil in ways most of us would never even dream of in our wildest nightmares... Two new catchphrases have now evolved from the Joker - "Why So Serious?" and "Let's put a smile on that face!" How can you catch a man like that? Fetch another man who knows no boundaries nor jurisdictions, has immense funds to source his projects, his conscience is so passionate he appears cruel yet he wants to save lives - Batman, the avenging hero who walks in shadow, the Dark Knight! Christian Bale as the vigilante saviour who seeks to right the Joker's wrongs is an excellent reflection of how too far right is left in the War Against Terror. I feel for his voice when he grated it as Batman and used a normal register as Bruce Wayne. Seeing Aaron Eckhart play a Two-Face who did not care for his looks was a refreshing change for once, I did like that departure from the comics. Having him play a character that was an unmasked version of the Bat is rather intriguing, pity more could not have been played off of that aspect. I was annoyed that they chose in the end to kill off Two-Face/Harvey Dent, apart from the fact he did not die in the comics, he was also a thorn in Batman's conscience as the Dark Knight felt responsible for Harvey's recreation into the coin-flipping redresser of injustices via corruption. Gordon's rise to Commissioner was understandable yet a bit rapid, Gary Oldman playing a man far younger than he really is shows his talent for acting. Well-choreographed acting from a talented ensemble cast, near seamless directing from Christopher Nolan, the film is a bit long (nearly 3 hours) yet very much worth it - hard to believe they had even more planned for the late Heath ledger in this same flick... His replacement has a deep dark clown-nose to refill, if possible. In fact, can there be any more without him?
4.0~I guess it had its moments wtxx Sign in Permalink I am sincerely confused by all the hype around this movie. It just didn't seem that great to me. No characters had any personality or motivation whatsoever, except the Joker. There was no plot structure at all... the entire thing was just the Joker threatening to kill people and everybody freaking out, then repeat, then repeat again. No break in the action, no climax. And all this for at least two hours. By the end I was TRYING to fall asleep. Not to mention the really, really stupid plot devices. (If you don't care to hear my rant/list of these, which may include SPOILERS, skip to the next paragraph!) Being able to remotely transform all cellphones into high-resolution sonar devices? This idea is just stupid. Wayne chooses "taking a boat ride with the entire Russian ballet" as an alibi? Because somehow he trusts all these near-strangers enough not to blow his cover? That entire plot device was clearly an excuse to fit in at least one scene with scantily-clad women. And the Joker escapes from jail because they didn't bother to put his handcuffs back on after Batman took them off. How lame is that? As soon as he got into jail it was obvious he'd escape, because that's how these stereotypical plots always go, but I at least hoped it would be because of Joker's cleverness rather than because of a completely unrealistic and inexplicable lack of security. He was an infamously dangerous criminal, obviously an entire police station wouldn't be so lax around him. And when he holds his knife to an officer's neck to make demands, another officer about ten feet away is pointing a gun and has a clear shot at his head, and a reason to shoot, but he doesn't. Why not? This movie follows SO many other predictable plot stereotypes. Like the fact that as SOON as Harvey is disfigured, it's completely obvious that he is going to become a villain. Because you can't be disfigured without being evil... Only the handsomest of men are heroes. The most annoying thing is how they didn't even feel the need to explain his lighting-quick transition to being a supervillain with no convincing motivation except for showing his burns, because as soon as you saw that his face was burned you just knew he was evil, end of story. It's just like the way that as soon as you see a child in this movie, you KNOW that group of people won't die, because children never die, of course. The audience might be offended. Also, both protagonists are totally infatuated with some boring girl for no apparent reason, which is a pretty good sign that a movie isn't very thoughtful. Some of the ridiculousness and predictability of the movie's plot could have been forgiven if it wasn't so very tedious. Two hours of the exact same continuous action sequence with no breaks to allow for deeper plot or character development is just too much. Unless you like watching violence for its own sake regardless of plot, and have a really, really long attention span, I can't understand why you like this movie (and you probably do, everyone does, apparently). Not to mention that this long tedious action sequence mostly consists of the exact plot of the first half being reused as the second half (Joker's setup on the boat and the hospital were the same story, it's as if they couldn't decide which one to use and then thought "hey, let's make this movie REALLY long and just use both of them, one right after the other..."). It did have some redeeming qualities. The joker WAS great, the nihilistic spin on his character was well-done. The beginning was relatively interesting, before they got into the repetitive action sequences. And toward the end they killed someone who I really didn't predict would die. But, I would never, EVER sit through this again.
10.0~Thank you. towards-the-within Sign in Permalink The last movie I commented on (luck made it so that it also was an action movie), was Wanted. My remark on that movie was that 'if you have to give an action movie a plot, please make it so that it's worth it'. And here we are, the Dark Knight. I could write about this film for hours and hours and hours. Dethroning my personal favorite (the good, the bad and the ugly) from my top-10 list, TDK offers something to all movie fans to enjoy. To the action-movie fan: Restrained yet beautifully done action scenes. No exaggerations, no cars flying into trains. No need for pointlessly placed excessive stunt men. Just the right number of it all served within the movie's theme and as part of the plot instead of the usual action film approach which is "let's put some beat'em up scenes in so that the people'll hopefully forget about the shallow story we're offering them" To the movie-plot fan : A movie that offers up a solid storyline. Used before in other films yet never to this extend. Each and every character are tied to the plot and contributing in their own manner. This is not a railroading storyline that you know its ending from scratch. This is a mad roller-coaster ride that even though you have a hunch it won't have a happy ending, you take it fully to its destination. To the acting-performance fan: I am not as eloquent as other people who've praised performances in this movie. From Mr.Ledger, to Mr.Caine, all I can say is they've done the best impersonation I've seen. Of good, evil, chaos, law, and the eternal struggle. An extra word for Mr.Ledger as he remains the most solid evil character impersonation that I've seen on the big screen ever. To the movie-soundtrack fan: The perfect score for a chaotic film such as this. It ties, it sticks in your mind, it makes you hum it as you walk down the street and as you do hum it the entire film goes through your eyes again and again and again. To movie-direction fan: Anything I say or put here will be pointless. Photography, colors, scenery, dialogs, scenes and the prequel tying to the sequel. Watch it for yourselves and see. 10/10 out of me. To the Batman fan: The Nolan brothers do this for more than just money, I can assure you. They love their work, they love putting their ideas to paper. And they respect the symbol that one of the world's greatest superheroes is. Not only that, but they also respect the villains and the entire world of Gotham. This project couldn't be in better hands. As an epilogue, I'd like to state two things. First a big thank you to everyone who brought us this movie in a period where Hollywood mostly makes us bang our heads on the wall and wish we were blind. I am not sure if there should or should not be a sequel what with Mr.Ledger's tragedy. But I am sure the Nolan brothers will make the right choice. If the sequel (if there is one) is not directed by them, I will surely not sit and watch it. Second to any directors out there or to anyone from the Hollywood movie industry that might take the time to read this (even though my hopes are not so strong on it :). Watch and learn. Watch and realize what an action film that respects its genre should be like. It takes more time to make than a future DVD-trash like Wanted that only gets some glamor due to the strong acting names involved in it. But the end result will still fill your pockets with good cash. And will keep the people that go out for a lovely movie weekend satisfied and happy. To the point that they might say : That was 10 bucks well spent, let's go again next weekend. I know I have and will do so again.
1.0~Not a good Batman film. Over-rated in the Extreme. brownish33 Sign in Permalink damn i cant believe the reviews for this film. I've only seen this twice and don't plan on seeing it again anytime soon, and this coming from a lifelong batman MOVIE fan (note the emphasis on MOVIE, not COMICS).I've seen the original film 200000 times and i loved all the sequels, even the "campy" Schumacher ones. but boy did they take this franchise in a reverse direction. JUST because batman & robin was terrible and silly doesn't make Christopher Nolan's films the comic book equivalent of the "godfather" or gone with the frigging wind. if anything, they only show how amazing Tim Burton's 2 original dual pictures are, and how utterly lame the Nolan ones are. not only is "the dark knight" worse then batman begins, its downright ridiculous! you feel like you need a degree in law to understand what the hell they are talking about. its like CSI meets Gotham city. you might as well call this movie GCPD or GCPD Blue, or any of those law and order-type shows that this movie seems to copy from. its even more silly when you look at the lengths the director went through to make this batman movie as boring as possible. they seem to think "if the story is engaging enough, we don't have to make the movie visually appealing". thats like saying "if the story is good enough, we don't have to make batman look awesome in the comics". lets get this review started shall we? first, the joker. we are all familiar I'm sure with jack Nicholson's classic portrayal from the original film. it was truly amazing, he made the character eerie, funny, and charming all at once. yet he seemed to understand that this character is based off cartoons and as such you cant take yourself all that seriously. this is the complete opposite of what heath ledger does with the same role. but i guess you cant really blame the actor entirely with Nolan wanting to change up batman and his world to the point that the characters aren't really who they should be. first off, joker doesn't fall in a vat of acid like the original, he puts on makeup and cuts his own smile and dyes his hair green. i would hate to see his joker in the rain, he would look rather pathetic as a joker. i can guarantee that if Nicholson didn't already do this classic comics origin 20 years ago in the awesome first film, fan boys would be crying that joker was turned into common serial killer done a million times over in other films and not the funny amusing comic book clown prince of crime that everyone is more familiar with. oh, but since Nicholson already played THAT version to perfection, Nolan was somehow able to get away with turning joker into a common killer that we've seen time and again. Heath didn't really even play the﻿ Joker, he played "generic serial killer bad guy #13314". for those who would defend ledger by saying he was "really scary and terrifying", sure ill give them that, but to say he was better than NICHOLSON?!? JACK FREAKING NICHOLSON?!? PLEEEEEEEEEEASE!!! The role was virtually MADE for the man when he was born.﻿ Nicholson captured the true essence of the Joker; a psychopathic man child out not to prove a good damn thing, but to kill and mess around with people all for the laughs. THESE are traits that define the Joker, not some cliché ideal of wanting people to accept that evil exists in all of us. and that brings me to another point, whats with this jokers anarchist pseudo-philosophic rambling monologues? boy Nolan LOVES these cardboard deep monologues he has his character spew out all the time, even in the last film. its laughable at how serious he takes the movie. did he forget this is based off of comic books and that there are supposed to be fun elements in the film? Tim Burton struck the perfect balance of comic book and reality. its somewhere right in the middle. Nolan puts a guy in a bat suit and places him right in middle of an unaltered real life city. it makes him look silly and out of place. I'm not gonna dwell much on bales batman. this guy cant save any movie hes in. people seem to love this guy, or think hes some brilliant actor, but hes obviously just a wooden actor and once again phoned in his "performance" in this film. to quote Christopher walken from Batman Returns, "hes just a poor schmo, who got lucky". his batman voice is ludicrous. ludicrous! i still don't understand why they decided to make batman sound like an engine turning over. every time he talks he makes me laugh. the only decently done things in this film is how Harvey dent is portrayed (pre-twoface) and the pretty nifty bat pod, that has ONE cool scene in which it bursts from the bat mobile. but again, the action scenes never pick up because of Nolan's hard on for realism, so nothing in the new Batman films ever makes you go "OOH Awesome" for too long. this movie just dragged and i remember looking at the clock as to when it would end. they make it feel like the new Batman's are "smart" but honestly, in a comic book movie who the heck wants to listen to all this law and order talk and long drawn out "deep" monologues? its so....meh. i'd rather watch jack Nicholson laugh like a maniac shooting his henchman and making me laugh. who can forget gems like "bob, gun". today you have "why so serious?". yeah thats what i want to know, why so serious Nolan?? why cant you make batman fun? nothing against having darkness, Burton's films were dark too but not so much to the point where they weren't fun or exciting. again, disappointed.
10.0~BEST JOKER MkailaBrown Sign in Permalink I loved this movie I can literally watch it over and over again, Heath Leger was the best Joker that has every been played I love the whole cast.
10.0~Ledger owns The Bat AdrianMessenger Sign in Permalink In the world of Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight," Batman is to the Joker what Dirty Harry was to Scorpio. Like Eastwood's Harry Callahan, Bale's Batman isn't above smashing heads, cars, and civil rights, in his brute-force quest to bring justice to a lawless city; like Andy Robinson's psychopath, Ledger's gleefully nihilist Joker seems to enjoy having the stuffings beaten out of him almost as much as he delights in highjacking schoolbuses and committing murder, up close and personal. I've never been a huge fan of comic book superheroes. The Green Lantern was pretty cool, however I generally prefer guns to super powers, and have always thought there was something a little ridiculous about a man in tights and a cape who flaps around the city, fighting crime. Which is why I was not a fan of the previous Batman movies. However, with "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight," director Christopher Nolan has attempted to free the character from the albatross of campy convention, reinventing Batman as a kind of urban ninja. The previous films were all about style over substance, whereas Nolan has re-imagined everything from the batsuit to the batmobile in a way that makes them seem more practical, functional, and--most important--more believable. There's a gritty reality about this Batman. He gets hurt and has to stitch himself up, Rambo-like. He gets bitten by dogs, fer Chrissakes! Moreover, his gadgets don't spring magically from thin air, but are the result of meticulous engineering on the part of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who is Batman's answer to Bond's "Q". In fact, the Nolan/Bale Batman has more in common with James Bond than he does with his own prior incarnations in film and print. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the dazzling "Operation Skyhook" scene. With "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight," Nolan and his team have worked the minor miracle of making an utterly fantastic character seem plausible, which is no small accomplishment. In so doing, he has also brought a great deal more respectability to the genre. Truth be told, though, "The Dark Knight" isn't really a "genre" picture at all. Nolan goes about the film as if he's never seen a comic book before, the result of which is a breathtaking departure from every other superhero movie ever made. This isn't a superhero movie so much as it's a hyperkinetic crime thriller mixed with a psychological horror film: "Heat" meets "Silence of the Lambs," with a delicious dose of sly theatricality. Everything about this film is exceptional, from the cinematography and visual effects to the fine acting and the snappy, intelligent script. But as anybody knows who has already seen it, Heath Ledger owns this movie the way Al Pacino owned "Scarface." Ledger's Joker is a self-described "agent of chaos," out to prove that people aren't worth saving in his own giddily vicious way. During one of several mesmerizing exchanges with Batman, the Joker explains that he's not a monster, he's just "ahead of the curve." Ledger's performance is an elliptical masterpiece of existential rage and sardonic wit, alternately ferocious and funny. The brief but brilliant scene of the Joker, dressed in an ill-fitting nurse's outfit, fiddling with a malfunctioning detonator, was clearly an audience favorite if the applause and laughter were any indication. Can't say too much more about the film without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. Suffice it to say, even if you're not a fan of superhero movies, "The Dark Knight" is what great movie-making is all about. So, why so serious? Get out and see it! Let's put a *smile* on that face...
10.0~I AM NOT A DC FAN. zamlazercorn Sign in Permalink I hate, and then i mean it, i hate dc, dceu in perticular but this move... made me a batman fan and i just sit there watching batman v superman and seeing my batman getting dragged in the dirt... its sad... but this movie mmmmmmmmmmmmm easily up there in my top 5 movies
10.0~Can The Dark Knight Really Be That Good buiredintime Sign in Permalink Absolutely, it's not only that good, but it changes the way of movies in a way no one sees coming. Heath Ledger is brilliant, and it's sad that he won't keep going on in his career. Aaron Eckhart is also brilliant and has been forgiven by me. The rest of the cast plays there parts including Gary Oldman who has actually done some of his best work in history. Christian Bale well he's Christian Bale enough said. The movie itself is hand down one of the best of the year, maybe the decade. It pulls you down, gives you no rhyme or reason, and only at the very end do you see a little light. Anyways enough of me, go see the movie, and expect to be changed.
5.0~Heath Ledger-brilliant actor!!! - Movie just OK for me dog... sisuwoman-1 Sign in Permalink First of all, I blame the publicity for the over-hyping of this movie to the point where I expected nothing short of an incredible experience. I heard it compared to "the Untouchables" and "the Godfather"... NO WAY!!! What I actually got was a REALLY long movie with a few good moments, and a truly overly complicated and hard to follow plot. I would honestly say that, other than the scenes with Heath Ledger, this movie was not that great. But I have to say, poor late Heath, what an amazing acting job. What a loss, I am so sad that this was his last movie. Who knew what else he might have accomplished? He made every scene he was in riveting, disturbing, funny and terrifying all at once. Without him, this movie would have been even more disappointing. I guess in a nutshell, that in this summer of crappy movies, this one was less crappy than the rest.
5.0~as usual, Batman bores paul-2686 Sign in Permalink Heath, Heath, Heath, yada yada yada. Yes, he did a lovely Joker. So what? The film was almost as tedious as the rest of them. The obvious problems: * Too long! * Shallow stabs at moral seriousness. * Absurdly over-processed Batman voice. * The usual barely-there female characters. * Heath's Joker was just another lunatic villain, and we've seen plenty of similar quality over the years. *gasp*  heresy! Yes, in my opinion, Heath was merely okay. Making a villainous virtue out of the Joker having no purpose but to "make the world burn" is not "deep." It's not that hard to create a charismatic psycho character. Yes, he had some game. Yes, of course, I enjoyed lines like "I wouldn't know what to do with it if I caught one." This movie wasn't completely awful. I'm giving it five stars, after all (which guarantees no one will read my comment, but oh well). But neither Heath nor the film as a whole was "amazing." I'm not a superhero movie hater, and I've actually read plenty of Batman comics in my life (unlike at least half the people getting excited about this film, I think). But I have been bored and disappointed by the Batman franchise films every time, so this is no surprise. I can't even wrap my head around this one being fun, light entertainment (or any other kind of entertainment), let alone a "classic" as so many are calling it. A classic? As GOB would say, "Come on!" If you are calling this movie a classic, you can't possibly have seen many movies!
4.0~a lot of screaming does not make a good story emdeewee Sign in Permalink A few arguments to show how mediocre this movie really is: two ships, having the choice of killing each other, or being killed. If every ship will be blown up at midnight anyway, what kind of choice is that? It is certain death, so pushing the button seems the only choice you have. The only way to survive is to push. It is no real dilemma. The weakest Batman in history. Being saved several times by humble earthlings. Carrying a suit that is not up for dog bites but yes for bullets? Further: the least interesting. Where is the psychology? Morgan Freeman's character: the whole city is burning, hospitals are exploding, people on ferries about to kill each other, and he's making a point of privacy? How can a joker have no sense of humor? Scary at times, he is as flat as a penny. A bit of humor, the dark one that is, would have made him really dangerous. Now he is but a nut. The whole point of a joker is that he is bad as hell, but charming too. He makes you fall in love with evil. Ledger did excellent with how little he was given. Harvey Dent: turns into a revengeful monster in seconds? Psychologically so empty: first all he wants is good, then all he wants is revenge. 'They took her away from me'. Such a stereotype. Chris Nolan seems to be: humorless, wanting to distract the viewer from a hollow story by means of flashes and effects.
1.0~The Dark Mess i_never_writ Sign in Permalink Is this what now passes for entertainment? Can this really be compared for depth and breadth with other generally highly-rated movies such as the Godfather, Casablanca or even Star Wars? Many of the IMDb top movies deal with the good old battle between good and evil and the world-weariness of the hero or anti-hero, but this film lands far short of the mark in both character and plot development, not to mention script, acting, screenplay or any of the other attributes of a movie that might be worthy of commendation. The purity of the comic book origins of this piece are thoroughly distorted and turned into an incoherent muddle - almost any James Bond movie has a great deal more tension, humour, conviction and morality than this mess of a movie. On the other hand, if there's a serious message in The Dark Knight, I missed it, as I suspect will thousands of others. As a Batman flick, it simply doesn't deliver anything like the expectations; at yet another level as a post-9/11, human-condition, search-for-identity movie it also fails - however you want to see it, it fails on a grandiose scale. For some of who do not live in the in the US, The Dark Knight has the potential to appear as little more than an appalling piece of hyped-up propaganda for a moribund social policy that permits and legitimises evil, mayhem and general wrongdoing and unpleasantness on a colossal scale in the pursuit of defeating the threats against society. I've had more fun at the cinema studying the architecture.
1.0~Can You Say Overrated???!!! IcyRoses Sign in Permalink One of the WORST films I've forced myself to sit through. Nothing happens, except explosions and violence. Skip it. And Heath Ledger's Oscar win was solely for the fact he had died. Basically, I think America had become the only country in the world where a movie like this could be popular. A movie about a SUPERHERO (!) who wants to clean a fictional metro city up? Morgan Freeman, Micheal Caine, anymore Oscar winners looking for money? And the screen time of this was atrocious. I seriously thought the movie was NEVER going to end.
10.0~A Movie For My Generation RalliCalli Sign in Permalink As an amateur movie critic I consider myself to be someone knowledgeable and well educated on the great movies of the last thirty years. I feel however, in all aspects that each generation has a movie or movies in which they associate themselves with. For example; the Godfather, Star Wars or Indiana Jones generations. With the release of the Dark Knight I feel that my generation has been defined. It takes not only amazing directing and a great plot to make a defining movie like this but also a role that can be forever associated with the film. In this case, this is easy with the performance of Heath Ledger. As the Joker, Ledger lights up the screen with his dark and psychotic performance and it is impossible to take your eyes off him. With Christian Bale and a superstar, well chosen cast around him this movie is an absolute knockout. I feel that the evolution of the Batman movies has been a long and painful one. At one point after I saw George Clooney playing Batman, I thought they may be gone forever. Now with the emergence of Batman Begins and the excellence of The Dark Knight I feel like a child again in my seat in the theater. This movie supplies a medley of twists and turns, incredible action, changing emotions and most importantly goosebumps. If you have seen the film then I'm sure you know what I am talking about and if you have not seen it I very, very much encourage you too. Please feel free to comment back, thank you.
7.0~Good, but incredibly overrated. razorblade1 Sign in Permalink I cannot believe this film is in the Top 5 of all time. Sure, it's packed full of action and the stunts are magnificent. But, in terms of the actual storyline and the script, it's a film like any other action film. The bad things: the film is too long (the ending should be half as long!), predictable plot (the film develops and finishes like any other action film), too many sub-plots (many scenes and sub-plots in the film were completely unnecessary). The good thing: The Joker! Heath Ledger is the only good side of the film, his way of delivering the script, his shocking appearance and his sense of "evil" really make him the best actor in the cast. Well, I think I have gone through the main aspects of the film. But keep in mind that it is still a good film, and is worth the watch! (Although I wouldn't really bother buying the DVD)! 7/10
10.0~Not just a comic movie, but the measuring stick for every action movie to follow brodogg6 Sign in Permalink This was one of the best films I have ever seen, not just on a comic and action level, but emotionally as well. This film although it is a comic and is a big-dollar blockbuster had a very raw quality to it. Yes it is packed from end to end with high speed action, explosions, and sequences, but every single actor delivered above and beyond what I expected. I can now see why Heath Ledger had trouble sleeping while doing this film. If he did indeed kept this character going on set all the time, it's not shocking to hear that he was sleep deprived and took too many sleeping pills. This character is psychotic, not in a gruesome way like we see in stupid snuff flicks like Saw, but the kind that you see in classic horror like Psycho. He made a comic character so deep, demented, and yet funny....you almost wished he wouldn't get caught. Easily takes home the trophy with this, and one of my favorite characters of all time now. Bale once again shows how good he is by taking a seemingly unbreakable Comic icon like Batman, and turning him into an emotionally drained, and torn human being. He by far is the closest thing to the character that you will ever find. (Side note, the preview before the movie was Bale starring as John Connor in the new installment of Terminator AWESOME) Eckhart, who at first I thought might not gel as well in this type of movie did a great job as Harvey Dent/Two Face. Although you know where his story leads, he does a great job of letting you see just who he was before the transition, and how much pain he is in after it. Oldman, did a wonderful job as Gordon. Com. Gordon has never really been seen as a 3D character, but with all the terror that comes crashing down in the story, the threats on his family friends and himself....he becomes a courageous, torn, and emotional character, not even close to being seen in any Batman installment before. Even Maggie did a good job, far better than Katie Holmes...the two actresses are almost black and white. Katie always seemed jagged, and forced into that role, and Maggie seemed to slip right into it, a good fit and a solid addition. She was somehow able to not only give her character depth, but was able to give the Harvey/Rachel/Bruce Triangle a very real emotional tie. Overall, this is probably the best, most balanced, most entertaining, and most dramatically and action charged movie, let alone Comic movie that I have ever seen.
1.0~I know it's awful and I don't even READ comic books! longstreet63 Sign in Permalink Wait until you see the atrocity that is 'The Dark Knight." And you will see it no matter what I say, anyway, won't you? I've tried to keep this spoiler-free, despite the fact that whatever unpredictability the moth-eaten plot has is based on the surprise being completely inexplicable in context. So forgive me if it's a bit vague in places. The latest Batman film, lauded by fan and critic alike, was apparently replaced at my theater with another similarly-titled film in which Iron Man fought the killer from Saw, who is intent on reproducing the last ten minutes of Spiderman II over and over again. Everyone in the film is either an idiot or an omniscient genius, but either way, they are the most unobservant bunch of people ever put on film. The whole movie would have sputtered to an instant conclusion if the city cell phone network had gone down. And even The Simpsons has lampooned 'The Only Bridge Out of Town'. And the first moment Batman is on screen, he is bending the barrel of a gun unto a U-shape. I think somebody was looking on the wrong page of their comics reference guide when they wrote all of the super strength + flying scenes in for Batman. This is an Idiot Picture. There was no set piece in this film that would not have been avoided by a modicum of common sense. Honestly, kudos to Heath Ledger--whoever he was playing that was impersonating The Joker as someone with no apparent sense of humor--but any normal person would have shot the man on sight just to stop him babbling for the next twenty minutes. Every freaking scene was a monologue! Of the same thing! Everyone did that, actually. The characters seldom had conversations, just extended monologues which aspired to be weighty and philosophical. And not a word they said mattered, because in the end, it comes down to punching someone, anyway. The Joker has only one trick, and it is the same one three or four times. Bale's characterization of Batman and Bruce Wayne is so lifeless, he doesn't even seem to have been in the film. Technically, it suffered from being heavily edited, apparently to obtain a PG-13 rating. Killings appear off-screen or in obvious jump cuts. Events are alluded to which not only do not occur, but appear to occur differently. Was this the airline version? How long would this thing have been as shot? It already exceeded two and a half hours. Happily, there was plenty of opportunity for bathroom breaks. Every time someone opened their mouth you had ten minutes free. Still, sloppy editing cannot excuse the way characters simply appear and disappear as needed by the script, regardless of the impossibility of getting there unnoticed. IITS* is essentially a plot device. If this seems like a litany of nitpicks without mention of all the good points, well, as far as I can tell, I mentioned ALL the good points.This film viciously wasted my time as if I was a character in it, trapped in a theater with fifty hitherto-unnoticed oil drums and the option to explode the audience of Wall-E. It would have been a mercy. *IITS (It's in the script, that's why! Concept created by Ken Begg.)
1.0~Where is the story? mchelenek Sign in Permalink After I was done watching this movie, I was sitting there waiting for it to begin. There was no story. There was nothing for viewers to hope to happen or not to happen. Unbearably trite performances all around. Can Morgan Freeman play anything other than Morgan Freeman? I was waiting for the scene when he tells Batman that he is really God and that Batman has to be God for a day, i.e. Batman Almighty. We're given no reason to care about anything that happens to any of the characters. This was a classic example of weak screen and story writing covered up by special effects, explosions, and other eye candy. The only thing redeeming about it was some decent ambiance and directing, but in that regard, it did not live up to Batman Begins. Nolan is past the point in his career where he has something to prove. The love is gone and it's showing in a big way. The Batmobile was fun to watch, but that hardly makes a movie. Please look past the special effects and give this movie the rating it deserves. Make Nolan and other film-makers do more than throw gobs of money at ILM to make a movie.
10.0~A Triumph of a crime film (not just a simple comic book movie) My_Hero_Why_Go Sign in Permalink I was just afforded the opportunity to watch the newest batman installment The Dark Knight but not only did i get to lay my eyes upon a Nolan gift to the world, I saw it at 12.00pm and school was back in session. So without the constant ramblings of minors or the reverberating sounds of popcorn crunching I was allowed to fully appreciate what had been put to the screen. To say i was elated with the finished result is an enormous understatement but it is also something that does not come on like a flood. Some scenes once begun can seem like a simply and brainless action flick as "spiderman" is asked to chose someone's fate but the conclusion of each scene leaves you stunned as if you have just come to the twist in fight club and no one has spoiled the ending. It does not take much thought to see that this is a good film, but soon after the movie whilst you are sipping on your Mocha or catching the train home as I did, that you realise this is a great film. Morals are questioned and lines are crossed and these are all beautifully created by the Nolan brothers. They may not have the odd brilliance of the Coens or the VFX beauty of the Wachowski's but this brother duo are the new force to be reckoned with in theatre. The title says crime film and I stand by that notion because what the Nolan's put to screen is not a comic-book PG blockbuster. Within minutes you feel like you are watching another crime thriller even though the protagonist is dressed in a black Kevlar suit and the antagonist dolled up like a two-dollar hooker. The action/story is fast-paced and the editing very edgy throughout fight scenes keeping that sense that we are all just blind as bats as he moves amongst us. And now onto the performances, Without doubt one of Ledger best characters and I know that the former statement is already echoing like a poor cliché but it can be justified. It was not so much as what he said in the movie that evoked my 'endearment' but what he left to his body. His jerky movements and twitches as he almost seems uncomfortable in the trappings of his human body and then when he does open his mouth it amplifies everything that his body tells you. It is so easy to forget that this is in fact Heath Ledger, the man who sang to Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You, he simply is not himself and you can feel just how much he put into his performance because you truly believe that this man is mad. It goes unsaid that Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain both dominate in their particular roles especially in the case of Cain as he is given some wonderful dialog, which he delivers with perfect tone absolutely stealing the scene from anyone he is accompanying. Bale again shows the world what a real batman should be; torn, misguided, hopeful and terrifying but the one role that truly stood out in the film was that of Gary Oldman. Long gone is the sympathetic innocence we saw of his character in Batman Begins, as he gives rise to a powerful Gordon and a character that really belongs in Nolan's envisioning of Gotham. As i watched each scene with Oldman I thought that i was watching the likes of Keitel or Spacey, he took every opportunity to prove himself as a great actor and in each scene he intimidates the audience with his power. The main factor behind the re-birth of the Batman franchise is believability, Gone are the glo-paint and mo-hawks as the Nolan's give a haunting image of a world, our world, riddled with corruption in it's darkest hours before the dawn. Without hesitation i give this movie 10 stars as it is beautifully shot, encouragingly directed, impressively written and memorably performed. This sets a new standard for the comic-book movie, I wonder who can step up to the plate?
10.0~The Greatest Superhero Movie EVER MADE... PERIOD evolutionentertainmentmd Sign in Permalink When you think of superhero movies nowadays, most people would mention a Marvel Studio's flick given the sheer amount of characters they've been bringing to the Big Screen, Spiderman (3 times), Blade (3 times), the Hulk (twice), X-Men (3 times), no to mention the soon to come in Thor, Ant Man, and the Avengers. DC hasn't been as fortunate... Catwoman was a complete flop, Superman wasn't completely fulfilling, and even Batman Begins, while it was a great movie overall it never got the respect it deserved. Enter "The Dark Knight". From the very first millisecond your eyes glance the WB logo, you just simply can't take them off the screen. Beginning with what would arguably be the greatest bank robbery ever pulled off, to everything in the middle filled with great conversations and dialogue and non-stop action, to arguably the greatest and most anticipation building, cliffhanger endings you've ever seen. Heath Ledger is obviously the highlight, you can clearly see where the dedication to the last years of his life went, and it's a shame that we lost someone who was potentially one of the greatest to ever perform... but everyone knows this already. What you don't hear about are the more than exceptional performances given by Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Aaron Eckhart. Bale is great, don't get me wrong. The only things negative I have to say about this film is Maggie Gyllenhaal's mediocre yet tolerable performance (she makes you miss Katie Holmes A lot though), and Bale's horrible growling Batman voice... which he didn't do in Batman Begins? The latter point was obviously avoidable, and Katie Holmes was probably too caught up in the craziness of Tom Cruise, because there is no other way I'd have seen her turn this film down. All in all, this film is quite simply a masterpiece, it's so damn good you commonly forget your even WATCHING A SUPERHERO FILM. You in no way have to like action or hero movies in ANY way to LOVE this film. THIS IS WHAT FILM IS ALL ABOUT!

9.0~Surely not worthy of number 1 on the top 250? lewislloyd Sign in Permalink Right, seriously, number one on the IMDb Top 250 films of ALL TIME!? Bizarre! I can't possibly see how this would work. Can anyone really disagree with the tragic death of Ledger being a blessing in disguise for this movie? I don't mean to sound insensitive or to show any disrespect to who was a great actor, but I don't think this film would have had any where near as much praise as it's getting if not for Ledger's death. Sorry, but you all know it's true! A great film in it's own right, but not worthy of such high praise. It's been rated higher on this site than true greats like The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, The Good the Bad and the Ugly...you've got to be kidding me!!
1.0~Sick Product of a Sick System Danusha_Goska Sign in Permalink "Batman: The Dark Knight" is a tacky, trashy, mindless, ultra violent piece of garbage. It will bore anyone with a mature mind. "The Dark Knight" consists of one sadistic, pointlessly violent scene after another. There is no point to these scenes except to extract money from the pockets of teenage boys who have had no experience of real life. "The Dark Knight" is a drug. It pushes violence and sadism. That's it. That's what you get for your ten bucks. "The Dark Knight" is a sick product of a sick system. What's the difference between a blockbuster death-fest like this, and an act of actual terrorism? How many deaths do films like this contribute to? How much suffering? Pointless, ugly, violent, sadistic movies peddle violence as the drug of choice to mindless consumer hoards who lack discrimination, life experience, wisdom or balance. Teenage boys who spend all their time playing video games and having no experience of three-dimensional reality see a movie like this and conclude that the world is like this: cool criminals torture passive victims and meet no resistance. Hey, Thanks, Hollywood, for flushing your refuse into young male minds. Ka-ching. How much more violent and sadistic will such films have to be in the future to make that cash register sing? Let's up the ante. The Plot? Heath Ledger puts on a ridiculous series of ticks, costumes and make-up and tries really hard to get taken seriously as a master criminal / master actor. There is no real performance there because there is no real life there. In one scene, Ledger, a slight young man, murders a very large, muscular, professional criminal, and a black man  white supremacists will like that part  with a pencil. No. In real life that would not happen. Nor, in real life, would a man who shoots his every accomplice be able to do pull off any of the stunts ledger does in this film. The movie is utterly implausible. This won't matter to its fans, who talk only to other fans who worship films like this as they do. In their solipsistic, computer-generated echo chamber, "The Dark Knight" is the greatest film ever made. These fans have little contact with anyone not exactly like themselves, and can't see any flaws in their judgment. Though saturated in violence, these fans can't even see why a skinny guy like Ledger murdering a muscular, hardened criminal with a pencil is a silly, nasty, scene that exists only to up the sadism ante, not to have any relationship with reality. Though saturated in violence, these fans would panic at the merest contact with the real world, with the real violence occurring in places like Iraq, or federal prisons. Christian Bale is an interesting actor and was fun to watch in the previous batman. He's hardly on screen here. There is nothing interesting about the sets or costumes, and as for the special effects, how many chase scenes and big explosions have been on screen recently? Nothing new. Nothing interesting. The intelligent viewer will move along, or simply select a better film.
1.0~Letting the terrorists win, very, very ugly film-making that belittled my soul... intelearts Sign in Permalink I don't care about the acting or the effects or whatever. Not matter how ... brilliant... uh-huh... Dark Knight is just so completely devoid of any compassion from anyone; it's like watching computer euthenasia. There isn't an ounce of anything equating to a human emotion here. I wasn't afraid. I wasn't entertained. I was just depressed. If this is the best film of 2008 then films have become a way to feed the worse of the human spirit. Ooh, but it exciting, and ooh isn't the Joker a real baddie. When you leave a film just plain bemused at how so many people can buy into this, I for one was definitely not entertained. If you love this then wow yippee.... To me it's just ugliness, and really horrible vision of a world where the terrorists always win. And if you find that great entertainment, then what will top this, what more do you want next time? Sorry, just found it all thoroughly horrible. Really.
10.0~Fantastic jenny3489 Sign in Permalink This is the first of all the Batman films i have actually taken time to sit down and watch, and i was truly gripped from start to finish. It has all the blockbuster ingredients, a great storyline, amazing special effects, suspense, humour and an excellent A-List Cast. The on-screen performance from Heath Ledger was flawless, it really made the film and i agree that Heath deserves to win an Oscar for his portrayal as the Joker. I was warned that the film was a little too long at 2 and a half hours, but i never noticed. The storyline was impeccable with unpredictable action that really makes this film a classic. I highly recommend this film, it is a must-see!
10.0~Easily the best film ever made. cometothepop Sign in Permalink Stellar proformence from every actor/actress Heath ledger was truly a fantastic actor and no one will ever top his joker if you are into super hero movies or really any movie I believe you will love this one I highly recommend.
1.0~omg what a overrated movie !!! manco-25800 Sign in Permalink The biggest mistake this trilogy made was to meld the comic book craziness with real life logic in the hope of making a gritty, realistic Batman. News Flash: The comic Batman is totally and utterly unrealistic. You either create a decent comic film, or you take only elements that can generally work in the real world. This trilogy tried to create some kind of hybrid and, because of that, it falls flat on its face. But even the parts that should be believable regardless are done badly - like the police force. In order to make the joker a super- villain, Nolan made everyone else a super-moron. LAZY WRITING
7.0~Bruce Wayne is back! nathan_franklin2006 Sign in Permalink Batman ranks along the likes of Superman and Spider-Man as one of the most popular superheroes ever. In his brand new film, Batman has given us a satisfying sequel that's filled to the brim with action, drama and suspense. The Dark Knight places Batman (Christian Bale) in a struggle against the dreaded Joker (Heath Ledger) and his dastardly minions as the Joker attempts to dose Gotham City with large amounts of fear. In fact, The Joker is not so much interested in money as he is in bringing the city to it's knees! Bruce Wayne and Batman are played incredibly well by British actor Christian Bale who did a fine job in the previous movie. He makes the two identities of Wayne and Batman very different and gives a distinctive flavour to each one. Michael Cain does a great job as Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce's butler, who is against Bruce's desire for justice. What can I say? There are great special effects and the good thing is, there is hardly any CG - most of the fights and dangerous sequences are performed by humans making these fights extremely realistic. The film is - in most cases - extremely dark and this fits snugly into the tone of Batman. I don't mean 'I can't see!' dark, but dark as in night-time or dark streets with flickering lights etc. There are some bad things though; Batman's pretend 'dark voice' is comedic and there are times when it is impossible to take him seriously. Near the film's ending, Batman gives a speech that you can't understand at all because of his stupid voice. Looks like there's more than one Joker in town... Secondly, the plot can be quite confusing at first as it develops, but this isn't a major thing; you'll get it as it progresses even further. In conclusion, Batman has come to us in good form. Apart from some slightly boring moments and some other niggles, the film is generally amusing and incredibly entertaining.
6.0~A Good Adventure But Falls Back on Greatness eric262003 Sign in Permalink The main highlights of this dismal, dark isolated atmospheric superhero adventure movie is the Joker's (Heath Ledger) appearances the climactic special effects like the explosions and the believable dark clouds that surround this dreary, but riveting blockbuster. According to demographics, the majority of the audience who went to see "The Dark Knight" are 85% males between 18-35 who's minds are fixated on video games. And that is a non-surprising statistic. With the exception of Ledger's stunning performance, this movie fails to carry out its promise in gathering our interest in watching the good usurp the forces of evil, almost to the point where we take more sympathy for the evil Joker than the dark hero himself, Batman(Christian Bale). Bruce Wayne comes on to me as philandering playboy and his portrayal is thinner than a Ritz cracker. His envy and rage over the new female D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is more juvenile in personality without any sign of emotion at all. Even when they embrace in that fatal kiss, it's more manipulative than inspiring. Batman's robotic voice and stoic expressions convinces the audience into thinking, is that a man or a cyborg? This pedestrian performance may give the audience the impression that this movie was never meant for adults to watch. The anger and rage manifested in the Joker's soul has some spark of appeal and sorrow, but the schtick eventually become monotonous after a while that it becomes tiring after a while. The final scenes in the movie has very little excitement that afterwords people started to slowly trickle out of the cinema disappointed because of the set-up. It was just pure banal. Though it's not the worst movie in the world, it's still very over-rated in the end. The real standout was the Clown Prince of Evil himself the Joker. But even he couldn't save this movie himself. He wasn't getting any real help from his co-stars. But if you are those who just want to watch the movies just to see Heath Ledger one last time? Well the more power to you, but you really shouldn't do that on account of someone's unfortunate premature death.
7.0~good but overrated r3i6nm8n2002 Sign in Permalink Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated. A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle. I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy. There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long. BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype.
3.0~What Was That? DreddMancunian Sign in Permalink Like most people, I am familiar with Batman. I read Frank Miller's gritty Dark Knight Returns comic in the 1980s, but also watched with glee the comic spoof of the 1960s TV series. I enjoyed the Tim Burton Gothic fairytale, and even the rather dour Batman Begins. But a few minutes into this movie, I thought to myself "What is this? It isn't Batman!" This was like a grumpy James Bond. And that feeling lingered throughout the film. This is just my opinion - but I didn't see Batman anywhere here. From Christian Bale's gargling caped spy to the Heath Ledger's raspy bank robber with make-up, I found myself longing for an actual Batman story. Batman would NOT do the things the does in this film - he does not let his lady love die to protect the career of an attorney. If the filmmakers wanted to see how to solve this problem, they should have watched Spider-Man. Yes, his motivations are complex, but in this film he positively revels in doing the wrong thing. He is a soulless instrument of the law - not a vigilante - not even someone interested in justice. And I for one am sick of people talking to him, turning away, then looking back to see he has disappeared! If he was that fast how come he couldn't dispose of both bombs at once? Many people have ruminated on the deep philosophical questions asked by this movie. Yet they don't make sense. The film is turgid, doesn't make it's points clearly, and contradicts itself. The message at one point is that people can make the right decisions. Yet Batman himself makes the wrong decision - as shown by what happens to Harvey Dent. And the final scene seems to contradict this point - people get the hero they need, not that they deserve. It seems the writers were going for as many profoundly deep points they could make, without bothering to string them together into a coherent drama. This is one of the few movies (and certainly the only superhero movie) that I ever felt like walking out of - especially during the Harvey Dent subplot that feels like an extra 30 minutes tacked on to the story for no good reason - and haven't we even seen this before in Batman Forever? In short, this over-hyped, bloated movie didn't - for me at least - live up to its expectations. It wasn't Batman, and I'm not sure I know what it is.
6.0~Mildly Disappointing Sequel; overlong dialog, less involving, pc95 Sign in Permalink My expectation for Batman: The Dark Knight, the 2nd of the newer, sleeker installments was probably a little high mostly due to the word of mouth of co-workers/friends calling it better than/ as good as Batman Begins. Unfortunately I didn't think so. There is an awful lot of jockeying and expository dialog - too much - testing my patience. The media reported "Oscar-Worthy" performance by Ledger, while good, is not fantastic. He is only sporadically on the screen. It follows, the movie I think suffers from the film-makers trying to develop several story lines at once. The Joker should've been focused on more - (spoiler) instead we have the Joker, love triangle weirdness, and Harvey Dent villain development. Also, what is with Christian Bale's raspy (I'm masking my voice) line delivery when in the suit - detracting and awful. A fan of the original 89 movie, I'd also like to add both of the lead females in these newer Batman movies really don't bring the class and presence of Basinger from the original - they are the girl next door - Gyllanthal is a good actress but is not a fit in this movie imo (maybe even less so than Holmes in Batman Begins),... anyway.....,Interlaced were a great locale skyline/scene in Hong Kong, and about 2/3 of the way through a superior chase scene delivering (spoiler!) the most exhilarating moment technically in the movie - the tank transformation. There was some great final dialog by the Joker delivered to Batman too - For me these were badly needed elements, but few between. Also we have a less interesting/less imaginative crises - (spoiler) bomb hostages vs. weird kooky interesting hallucinogen idea in Begins. I was hoping for more "wow" moments, but instead got more hand-to-hand combat and rapid-fire expository dialog - ho-hum - Some editing and recasting could've done this movie some good. Mixed review, with several entertaining scenes trying to break out of the mold....
1.0~cak a rama alexm-3 Sign in Permalink Humm! I saw this film before Batman begins and possibly it has better special effects (I have only seen the first one it bits), but, and it's a big but; This film is very much a perfect example of what is wrong with contemporary cinema - it's garbage. Truly appreciate the quality of Tim Burton's Batman by first watching this cart of steaming plops! You might be the kind of person that doesn't give a fig about what you watch. Or you just want to see pure spectacle. This film has spectacle and then more spectacle and then just as you are trying to follow what happened, and possibly work out that the film is not that great, something else will happen. End result is a kind of mood, average at that, rather than any cohesive enjoyment. In fact it is probably a bit worse than that even tawdry.

8.0~Not the #1 movie of all time-- But very good! travis_widman Sign in Permalink I was really looking forward to seeing this film when I first heard about it. I can honestly say that it lived up to to its hype. The action is non-stop and very entertaining throughout the film and the script was very well written. It is certainly not as predictable as you would expect and may disappoint fans seeking an all-happy ending. The acting was as good as it gets. We all knew Christian Bale as Batman and he was equally as good in this sequel. Aaron Eckhart was a very good edition to an already strong cast, Maggie Gyllenhaal was very strong as Rachel (Forgot that Katie Holmes was in the original), and the veteran actors (Freeman and Caine) were again at their best. Last but not least, Heath Ledger was absolutely incredible (God rest his soul). I am a huge Jack Nicholson fan but the difference here is that Jack was Jack disguised as the joker and Ledger IS the joker. You will completely forget that he is Heath Ledger. It is so incredibly disappointing that his life had to end so prematurely because his job in this role left me wanting more. He definitely deserves an Oscar nod despite his unfortunate and untimely death. Again, this is not the #1 film of all time (better than Shawshank Redemption, Godfather, etc??.... Please) or even in the top 5. However, this was another slam dunk by Nolan and a very entertaining, action-packed and somewhat suspenseful film. 8.5 out of 10
10.0~Mesmerizing!! svkishere Sign in Permalink Never in my life have I been so much fascinated and thrilled as I was while watching The Dark Knight. It's a peach of a movie and is fraught with every element a movie needs to create history. Not everyday you come across a movie like this. Spectacular, to say the least. The Dark Knight starts its journey from where Batman Begins ended and slowly we get into the gripping duel of the batman and the joker as the beautifully crafted story scarily moves into its epic climax. Not only is the plot an engrossing epic, it has a sense of an agonizing tragedy which hits you and gets into you. Kudos to Nolan, who is maturing with every film, for his impeccable direction and awesome portrayal of Batman. The way he has portrayed the psyche of the joker, Harvey Dent and Batman and the way he has convoluted the story-line by pitting against each other the complicated ideologies of good and evil is sensational. Not to forget the electrifying performances of almost everybody who has been in this movie. Bale is flawless as usual and he handles the dual role of Wayne and Batman with perfection. Aaron Eckhart shines as Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhaal does a far better job as Rachel than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. Michael Caine is as usual 'proper' as Alfred, but the icing on the cake surely is Heath Ledger. Mr Ledger pulls off a stunner and oh man! is he not good! Quite rightly an Oscar winning performance,deserving all the accolades that has been showered upon him and sadly his last. May he rest in peace. Folks, to sum up, all I can say is that The Dark Knight is, by all means, one of the greatest movies that has ever been made, if not the greatest. Please don't miss this and be prepared to be mesmerized!
4.0~I didn't get it. bobbywang000 Sign in Permalink The only thing that I know about Batman is that he's a man that dresses in a black bat suit. As such, I had no clue about what happened during the movie. The good first: 1. I liked all of the action sequences (which is basically 80% of the movie) 2. I loved how the joker and his clowns really freak you out. Now, the bad: 1. I really didn't get how everything fit together. I don't see how a bank robbery, a Hong Kong businessman, a multimillionaire, a psycho clown, a detective, Harvey Dent/two-face, 2 boats, a lot of explosives, and 800 people can fit into one single story. 2. The batman's motives seem really murky. Why does he want to beat up criminals at night? For the really big batman fan, this'll be great. For me though, this was only a mediocre film, because I JUST DIDN'T GET IT!
1.0~The Dark Knight: A decision support dukehagen Sign in Permalink I already wrote a review on "The Dark Knight", being full of anger and antipathy for that movie. But now I realized, that the best thing to do is: Help others to make a decision whether that praised film will awesomely entertain or simply shock them. I'll forbear from spoilers. "The Dark Knight" wasn't the movie I expected. I thought it would be like "Batman begins" where people had motives for deeds and still surprising moments. Where Batman was a troubled character finding his way back to psychological stability, dealing with obstacles and fighting hard never to corrupt his morals. It wasn't. Considered soberly "The Dark Knight" was a complete surprise. It said: "The journey's not over and it will not end, where you expect it to end." Moreover, and that's also announced in the movie, the main villain has no motives. He's simply evil, loves to hurt and corrupt people and is, differently to what he proclaims, not a chaotic person, but an organizing and planning genius, almost (or I believe definitely) able to foresee the future. And here's the lack of the film: The Joker is unbeatable. Whatever Batman and the police try, the cannot defeat him. He's like a mythological god of chaos (owed to the writers), corrupting people with (I have to admit) known, but corrupting dilemma situations. And that's quite hard to bear. If you're a sensitive person, you'll sit there and suffer. If you're sensitive and intellectual, you'll simply understand that movie as a nightmare. And you should take that literally, because if you are, it's an unpleasant, annoying or even fierce situation, with  what you call  "logic" taken away. So if you're wondering whether to watch and you're a person like me, who believes that a movie either has to be realistic or if fiction has to contribute to giving you a good feeling or being a better person or something like that, DO NOT watch that movie. You will go out and have to deal with a serious quarrel about these (I believe fake) "teachings" you saw in that movie. For all the others, please take my advice. I have to admit that I am maybe a bit too sweet-tempered or something, but please don't take that movie too serious. In movies (the too positive ones) I often caught myself believing what happened there without reflecting. Please DO NOT do that here. It's a negative movie, destroying the super hero legend, having been established in "Batman Begins", surrendering to the believe that anyone can be corrupted and will be corrupted unless they die first. Thanks for reading.
8.0~Let's be honest - They should just call this movie "The Joker" shiftyeyeddog Sign in Permalink Let's get this out of the way right off the top: Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing in this film. ** Heath Ledger's Joker makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like Cesar Romero's Joker. ** Less cartoony and far more menacing, this Joker actually feels dangerous. Every moment he's on screen your eyes are simply glued there, just soaking in this iconic performance. His look, his mannerisms, his voice... they all come together to make the perfect Joker, and probably the best villain ever seen on screen in a superhero movie... or any movie, for that matter. It's really quite a shame Ledger passed away, as I would love to have seen him portray that character again and again. Does the rest of the movie match this level of excellence? Well, not entirely... It's got plenty of action, just enough humor, and a good script for the most part, but there are a couple minor things that bothered me slightly: If they have to recast Rachel Dawes, fine, but Maggie Gyllenhal is a big step down; Bale's gruff "Batman" voice still sounds a little over-the-top and almost humorous at times; and the movie takes a few unnecessary turns, especially towards the end. Much off this is due to the involvement of "Two-Face." This film didn't need a second villain. His time on screen does nothing but make the audience wish they'd hurry up and get back to the REAL villain. I've never cared for the character, and I suppose it's good they didn't wait to try to use him as the sole foe in a future film, but he simply didn't do anything for me. Aside from those aspects, however, it's difficult to find much to criticize in this movie. I struggled greatly with the rating for this one, as without The Joker, the rest would only have made for another above-average film like Batman Begins. But Ledger's Joker is undeniably the star of this show, and based on that performance alone, I spot it the higher rating. Forget The Dark Knight - they should just call this The Joker. Ledger simply OWNS this film.
4.0~The Dark Knight...Shrug jgroh Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight..Ledger and Chicago 10, Plot and Dialogue 4 The Dark Knight is the latest saga in the Chris Nolan/Christian Bale dynasty of Batman films. We return back to gotham city where the mob has taken ahold of the money in gotham city, but only operates during the day due to their fear of the Batman (Christian Bale). Enter the Joker (Heath Ledger) a card carrying pscho-killer who teams up with and is ready to lead the mafia back from the dead by wreaking havoc on the city and luring in the Batman in for the kill (or so we think). Meanwhile an election is on for the new D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) who is dating Bruce Waynes ex-girlfriend Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Wayne meanwhile follows Maggie around trying to up-stage Dent and Maggie with his affiliations with ritzy fundraisers, 3 girlfriends on his arm and at one point taking the Russian Ballet yachting just to cancel a performance that Dent and Maggie would be attending. All of this while a beautifully shot city of Chicago provides the backdrop for Gotham City. What proceeds from here are a number of twists and turns in the plot between the aforementioned characters as their ambitions are revealed on the screen. Bale plays Wayne cocky and overly arrogant. He plays Batman with a voice that is overly gruff, distracting and almost comical. Gyllenhaal is fine as Maggie, but under developed and lacks range which is more because of the character, rather than Gyllenhaal herself. Eckart plays Dent pretty straight but like many of the characters in this film underdeveloped (aside from one). This is the joker's ace. Ledger's character is the only character that is fully developed with a proper through line. His needs and wants are well defined without having to spoon feed the audience. Ledger communicates this brilliantly without taking it over the top. Spoiler Alert Overall likability and believability is the big problem here. Not a problem if this is Schumacher's Batman, but it ain't. This is Nolan's Batman in a more realistic setting. The characters are deep enough but the the twists in the plots come before they are around long enough for the audience to identify or care about them. Even Batman has to restate what he wanted Harvey Dent to be to gotham city about 3 or 4 times, just to remind the audience. This leads to another major problem with the film, Maggie's death and the transition from Harvey Dent to 2-Face. Not convincing enough of a transition. I doubt that the Joker, who killed Maggle could and would convince Dent to get revenge and start killing people all in one scene. It is a very week plot point and unconvincing. Also, what is up with the 2-Face make-up. it strikingly resembled the skeleton of the T-1000 from Terminator. For a Batman film that wants to be realistic...sorry...totally unrealistic! The infections in the exposed bones would not hold up. Also, he flips the coin too many times which prolongs the action in a non-suspenseful way. Other points include cheesy reaction dialogue from random cast member and a tye in-to national security that tries a little too hard to make a point. All is not lost on this adventure. The actions scenes are good, Batman/Joker chemistry is very good. This is a grossly overrated film that takes one step back from it's predecessor. The question remains, is Ledger's performance good enough to garner an Oscar nomination: yes. Should The Dark Knight garner an Oscar nomination, uh...no. Some critics have related this film to Heat and The Departed. Not even close.
10.0~The Dark Knight: a 'Comic' Greek Tragedy if-i-could-stay Sign in Permalink The hype over The Dark Knight reached preposterous planes before the midnight release, and I won't lie: I scoffed at the Oscar buzz. The Academy would never dismount their high horse and reward a "Batman" or a "comic book" film. Now I believe. I believe in Harvey Dent, and I believe Nolan created a tour de force worthy of Best Picture. If the film had been directed by Scorsese, it would be in a sure in (or maybe not, you know, took him only twenty years to get the damn thing). Nolan created a modern Greek Tragedy. Tragedy is the downfall of a great man caused by either the Gods or by hamarita (a tragic misstep). Harvey Dent was a great man, the "White Knight" to Batman's "Dark"  and The Joker, a self-described agent of chaos, swoops into Gotham like an angry messenger from the Gods. Did you feel the fear and pity? I did. And I felt it for every character  most of all, I felt disturbed. Watching the Batman beat The Joker in the holding cell is probably the most haunting scene in the film. I almost could not watch it. I've seen the film three times. Its elegance only grows on me, right down to Aaron Eckhart's cleft chin. Not only is Aaron just as good as Heath  if not better  the casting director selected a man whose face visually splits in half, even before the transformation. I cannot speak highly enough of Gary Oldman, as the supreme Jim Gordon. Oldman brings all the sentiment without sentimentalism, all the fragility without weakness, and all the humanity without melodrama to our beloved commissioner. As for Batman becoming a secondary figure to the villains, I say reread your source material. Batman is an elusive figure that not even members of the Bat Family understand. Here Bale plays Bats as the detective on the trail, and Wayne struggling with his choice to become The Batman. It's a quiet performance, and full of the grace. The convict on the boat steals the film. His actions in the time of crisis live with you long after the credits roll. He is the essence of the film: brief rays of dawn over coming the darkness. For anyone that calls this film too dark, too depressing, too sadistic, and too nihilistic, I say look again. If it wasn't Batman, I'd said it believed in Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Just a 21st Century version. (The only problem I had with the film: why Jim Jr instead of Babs at the end? Why!)
1.0~The 'Dull' Knight e-1529 Sign in Permalink It's hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together. Well let's start by saying that the Dark Knight is very boring and messy. The plot is incoherent, with too many undeveloped subplots. The movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere. It tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured, out of place, and doesn't build up from anything. Lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere. The characters have nothing, nothing interesting about them. They're like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor, taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are. And creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero, is what this movie is all about. All the rest comes as a consequence of this. Anything that happens has little or no effect. Batman is just as hollow as every one else. You could swap him with some other character and nothing would change. Action is just average. Random things happening out of nowhere, and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that. Some great effects here and there don't add much to the movie. I like violent movies but the violence in the DK is pretty much senseless as well as censored. Definitely not for young kids. The movie is not dark, is hollow. If you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome 'The Crow'. You want to see a good batman movie then watch the Tim Burton's version. Flat with no substance, humor or soul, the Dark Knight doesn't leave you with any emotions whatsoever, no hope and not even hopelessness. Only a lame sense of depression.
10.0~This is the summer of The Dark Knight p-obrien1 Sign in Permalink Before "The Dark Knight" was released, I mulled over the uniqueness of Titanic's success. Perhaps not worldwide, but in the United States, Titanic's success was certainly unprecedented. Back to "The Dark Knight". Growing up, there had only been one movie that had enveloped almost every possible area of media before its release; "Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace". Rightfully so, because Star Wars was and still is the highest grossing trilogy in U.S. history. Until recently, that had been the most "hyped" film I have been alive to see open in the theaters. That was of course until "The Dark Knight". I remember my friends buying tickets 2 weeks in advance for the IMAX screening of "I Am Legend" in December, just so we could get the 6 minute sneak of "The Dark Knight". When the sneak of "The Dark Knight" was over, it was met with uproarious applause. Right then I knew this film was going to be special. And then came the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. But instead of deterring those to see the movie, the buzz surrounding his take on "The Joker" began to spread like the plague. And as the time approached for the film's release, words and phrases like "Masterpiece", "Oscar-Worthy", and "Best of its genre" began showing up in various media outlets. The controversy of Ledger's death, matched with this buzz of his performance, matched with the media dubbing this film "Not to be missed" made this the most anticipated film release in my lifetime. Much more so than any of the 3 Star Wars prequels. In closing, for those of you who haven't seen the film... In fact for those of you who haven't seen any Batman films... This film certainly lived up to its hype. Chris Nolan pushed the envelope for what is considered a "comic book movie", because unlike 99.9% of comic book films, when watching "The Dark Knight", everything in the movie is most certainly possible in the real world (perhaps even the bat-pod). So the movie plays off as more of a Crime-Action/Drama than it does a stereotypical Comic book flick. At the rate this film is going, it will at the least become the second highest-grossing film in U.S. history, and at the most, it will soar over Titanic.
5.0~Easily the most overrated movie of all time auzy83 Sign in Permalink Sorry guys, but this doesn't belong in the top 250's by any account. Its fight scenes, car chases, its effects, and its storyline were all mostly average. Momentum wasn't built up over the film at all, and worse, they dragged out scenes longer then they should have. In fact, this movie was in the top 250 list BEFORE it made it to cinema. Why? Because there are a few people who are overly enthusiastic about batman who used Heath's death as a marketing tool, over-hyped the movie and voted it upwards despite never having seen it. Just because a movie is based on a comic shouldn't mean it should be voted any differently (would anyone have liked this movie if Batman's costume was swapped). Yes, heath was good because he played something out of his general character, similar to how Jim Carrey did in Spotless mind. But... 9 and 10's should be reserved for movies which are completely innovative. I felt like I saw this movie 20x already, and nothing kept me hanging on to find out what happened next. People who voted this 10/10 possibly need to experience movies such as the shining, Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, Fight Club or even Wall-E. These are movies which provide the watcher with a different experience then what they are accustomed too, and they are left wondering what will happen next.
2.0~Over-hyped....I must be missing something. segustafson-2 Sign in Permalink Finally got to see this - I was disappointed. I haven't been this bored in a movie in quite awhile (not since Titanic at least). Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker was fine, but come on, I hate to say this, but are people saying his performance was a "tour de force" because the performance was so outstanding (it wasn't) or because he died prematurely (it was). The movie was dark, plodding, and overly long. There were some tense moments (ie: the ferry boats), and some of the twists and turns were interesting enough, but not enough to sustain this dank, overloaded barge. Time is always the true test of worth, and like Titanic, this movie will not hold up.
7.0~Just your everyday action movie with a tinch of "Art" to get you thinking... ssmongo56 Sign in Permalink To be honest...I fell as though I'm he only real critic reviewing this movie. People are making it sound like its the holy grail of all superhero movies. If your critical about movies and are looking for some technical and literary masterpiece than i hate to say it, but this isn't the right movie. This movie has completely outrageous action scenes, great affects, and a standard plot, which holds it back, and il explain why. The Dark Night does very little to make this movie different from your average "blow-em-up" superhero movie. The Joker is portrayed as a psychotic criminal who "appears" to be extremely unstable. The joker is an excellent character in this movie because they show a side of the joker that was never shown in the previous movie with Jack Nicholson. It's almost like the joker was separated from his jokester side and he finally embraced that psychotic unpredictable villain we always knew was there. This movie is different for 2 reasons which makes it stand out just a bit. First, Heath Ledger is remarkable in his roll as the joker, and this movie really makes the joker a psychotic genius that will always make you think twice. Second, The Dark Knight really has one main theme, and thats "what really makes a hero?" The dark knight touches up on that question pretty well, and it leaves room for you to state your own opinion. now, other than that... the acting was "good" the action was crazy, but nothing a 6 year old wouldn't think of, and two face wasn't thought out at all. And can someone tell me how 2 face survived that car accident? i mean please, that was just stupid. bottom line is, this is your average action movie. You cant help feeling that the joker is the only thing that captures you the whole movie. I was hoping this movie would do for action movies what 28 days later did for zombie movies, but sadly it doesn't. The dark knight doesn't make it as "masterpiece" or a "work of art" its simply a superhero movie with some interesting characters and a theme that gets you thinking, nothing more.
4.0~It's not Batman subthing Sign in Permalink This is an intelligent well written movie with some great performances but it is not a Batman movie. Apart from getting a fingerprint from a bullet there is no detective work. There is no use of batarang (throwing stars etc.) Batman doesn't fire his cable thingy and swing from any buildings. In fact he doesn't use any items from his utility belt. Another major flaw with this movie is the absurd use of every mobile phone in Gotham as a sonar, which Batman uses to track the Joker. This sci-fi technology is out of place in this movie, mobile phones don't have receivers in them capable of coming close to this level of wizardry. A true batman would of used his detective skills to find the Joker. The Joker only makes one joke in the whole move, albeit very funny (disappearing pencil). It's OK to reinvent characters but there should be some consistency and I think jokes are for the Joker.
7.0~Good but certainly not epic! RoibinOToole-1 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight, seeing all the great comments on IMDb and seeing it knocking 'The Godfather' and the 'The Shawshank Redemption' of the number 1 position I went to this movie with HUGE expectations. I have to say that I was highly amused with the movie and it was put together excellently! But comparing this to films like the ones I mentioned before I feel this doesn't even belong in the top 50. I felt Batman was kind of a boring character in this movie he doesn't say much and you don't really feel any connection to his character in my opinion. Now the Joker was pretty funny and well played but his dialog could have been a lot better at times his comments where not as funny as they could have been at certain points in the movie. My verdict is that this is one of the better if not best action movies I've seen in a long time but it doesn't compare to some of the legends that are in the IMDb top 250! People vote fair this movie is not a 10 star rating don't let the hype cloud your judgment and be honest!
8.0~Why so serious, right? jpschapira Sign in Permalink "The Dark Knight" is a movie that honors its title. Dark, twisted and complex, Christopher Nolan's latest wonder concerning Batman is a movie that sets a before and after in its genre and joins its perfect companion; its predecessor "Batman Begins". It had been a long time since I had seen so much adrenaline on a screen, but then again Nolan's Batman is what it is because it isn't just about the adrenaline. It's still daylight in Gotham when a masterful opening sequence (supported by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer-again-magical score) gives way for a robbery to take place; organized by a man who calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger), someone we would instantly take as a villain. If normally villains don't call themselves villains in superhero movies, this one says a lot of things about himself. He loves to talk and share his life philosophy with everyone he meets; he likes to joke, of course; he likes to watch people suffer with or without him watching; he dislikes rules and he likes Batman. This last statement maybe more understood once you've watched the film, but there's one of Bruce Wayne (yes, Christian Bale IS Batman) many interesting conversations with Alfred (Michael Caine) in which they discuss the nature of The Joker, and the old man points out that maybe Bruce doesn't understand this villain in particular. There will be a moment of confrontation later in which the villain will tell the superhero: "You complete me". That phrase reminded me of the great movie "Unbreakable" is. But, actually, what is a hero and what is a villain? In Nolan's brilliant screenplay (written with his brother Jonathan, a usual collaborator), full of psychological insight, this is one of the issues that floats over our head as we get lost in the ever exciting action sequences, fights and things blowing up in Nathan Crowley's spectacular production design. "It's not what underlies you, but what you do that defines you", a Rachel Dawes now played truthfully by Maggie Gyllenhaal told Bruce in "Batman Begins". Her words resonate, as Batman continues to fight evil with her, Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, the D.A. Harvey Dent (a superb Aaron Eckhart). Let's not forget that Batman is more human than any of the other superheroes of the comic books. In this film, he's never able to call himself a hero and he thinks of quitting; without knowing if he's the guardian the city needs or deserves. But in all this realness, to continue watching him fall, to see him using his gadgets and his vehicles as a pro, to see that intelligence may surpass a gun to win a little fight or to generate fire without the need of any explosive; is one of "The Dark Knight's" treats to the viewer. Another major treat for the viewer is the presence of a villain (or criminal, if you prefer, as The Joker refers to himself when he says the town "deserves a better kind of criminal"-again the issue of deserving someone or not; a villain or a hero-) that equals Batman in human qualities. I don't mean that The Joker has principles we may admire (although many people will find inspiring things in his weirdness), I'm simply referring to the fact that he doesn't fly through the air or owns magic powers and he just uses what he has in hand to serve some kind of purpose. Heath Ledger steals the film (and will get an Oscar nomination, because dreaming has no cost) and makes a wonderful Joker, mainly, because he embraces this human aspect of the character Christian Bale understood so well in "Batman Begins". Without overacting, Ledger creates an individual that we can call a freak, because it's the first thing that crosses our mind when we meet him. He has all this makeup in his face and two scars; he has a lot of stories to explain the origin of these scars. Ledger tells every story convincingly, and leaves no room for the viewer to fully understand him. His character has no name, nor he possesses the background story we see many times with heroes and villains; however we get to perceive an amount of grimness in his look and we want to know exactly where it comes from. It's Heath Ledger's great acting what generates all this. The rest of the ensemble, as in "Batman Begins", is top-notch. Michael Caine is given more screen time and makes the best of it; so does the great Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. There are surely many other perspectives in which the film can be viewed and discussed, and that reflects the very good piece Nolan has created; a movie that's profound in the best sense of the wordA word we don't use so much for comic book movies. AnywayBatman may not know if he's the protector Gotham needs or deserves, but "The Dark Knight" is undoubtedly the superhero movie the film-goer deserves and has been waiting for since its predecessor; a film that even someone who knows nothing about comics, like me, celebrates with a big smileWhy so serious?
1.0~Horrible, fascist and poorly acted aussiefilmlover Sign in Permalink Even for a blockbuster cotton candy movie, this is a piece of crap. Got a script that makes so sense, characters that you don't care about and mindless violence and unbelievable set pieces. How do you know the joker is a guy that just likes to see things burn? why first Alfred tells us that and if you didn't get it the first time, the joker then tells us he just likes to see things burn and sure enough if that was too subtle for you, he then sets things on fire! Then there is the fact that keep on calling him a terrorist when he goes on about how he only care about chaos. First of all a terrorist is a person who acts because they do have a strong belief not because they have no beliefs. Terrorist do the things they do with a goal in mind, they are in fact the total opposite of the Joker character. Then you have a film that's basic message is hey sometimes it's OK to lie and pretend someone is a hero when they aren't. Wow what a wonderful things to support, I'm sure George W. bush loved this film. Then there is the acting. how hard is it to play completely crazy, not that damn hard, just because Health Ledger is dead, doesn't mean his acting is suddenly good. He was not a great actor and he sure isn't in this film. Too long, so boring.
8.0~Fantastic Heath Ledger performance... MEDIOCRE FILM! wdskinner77 Sign in Permalink The only 2 reasons I give this film a 7 is: 1) Heath Ledger's fantastic performance, truly deserving all the Oscar buzz he's getting. And 2) Aaron Echhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. Despite those two excellent performances the movie is surprisingly... average. Now how can I say that after it's become the number 2 movie of all time and is one of the highest rated movies on IMDb??? Easily. It was too long and convoluted (and boring). Every time Heath Ledger was off screen I found myself eyeballin' my watch... something I didn't do with Batman Begins (a better film), until - to my surprise - Harvey Dent became Two-Face (I thought they were gonna save him as villain for the next film). When I first saw the trailer to this film I thought two things: Heath Ledger looks cool and the action scenes look dull (Which is why I waited so long to see it in theaters). Now, maybe I'm wrong, but for me, what is essentially an action movie should have exciting action sequences. I couldn't count one. I didn't come to see a Batman movie for a moody drama with a couple of good villain performances... I came for an exciting film. This was not an exciting film.... In Batman Begins Christian Bale gave us the most interesting Bruce Wayne/Batman ever... in this he registers zero.... I could go on forever but this movie is so AVERAGE that it's not worth the time (I'll save longer reviews for truly great films or truly awful films).
6.0~Nothing special stavrostsirlis Sign in Permalink This movie is so bloody overrated,it's ridiculous!Never have I experienced such mass hysteria in movie criticism before! OK, Ledger's performance was very good but not enough for an Oscar and certainly not enough to hold the movie together!It was a typical maniacal performance; nothing more or less!But nothing extraordinary that you haven't seen a lot of times before in similar characters! The movie itself was a disjointed mess,chaotic,schizophrenic editing... By the time it got to the last half hour,with the Sonar system that Batman used I was nauseating with its editing speed and no time for thinking! Poor movie;Batman Begins was much better...
8.0~Good, but no where near GREAT djssoccer1 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight in my opinion was a little disappointing. This was not caused by so much of the quality of the movie but by all the hype that critics and other viewers created. It is obvious Heath Ledger is the star of the movie whether he is considered the lead or supporting actor, but he does play an outstanding role. The only problem with Ledger and the movie is that it is over shadowed by Ledger's death. Only since Ledger's death did this movie become so anticipated and it is the only reason why it is getting so much credibility. Many viewers also have over looked Christian Bale who also played a well role as Batman/Bruce Wayne. The movie also has many flaws, Aaron Eckhart's little flip of the coin to decide someone's fate is taken from No Country For Old Men. Then, some how, the Joker can find 1,000 tanks of oil and put it under a hospital or two boats without anybody noticing it even though the police were searching the entire city for traps and explosives. The excuse most people would use is that its comic book movie, but the rest of the movie wasn't. So your telling me the director can make two scenes of the movie a comic book movie so that it can unrealistic. Also, what happens to the Joker? Sure you can say he was arrested, but then you have to think he was already arrested once in this movie and escaped so how do you know that he can't do it again. Then in my mind the worst part was the length of the film. The film did not have to be longer then 2 hours, and if you were to add extra scenes it shouldn't be action scenes, it should be about the Joker's past because in Batman Begins the movie touches on Bruce Wayne's past in such detail that it creates a story which this movie should have done with the Joker. Overall this movie was good and Ledger can be considered for an Oscar Nomination, but i hope the next installment to the series will not be so hyped up so that viewers will not be disappointed.
10.0~Best Batman flick ever ajwin05 Sign in Permalink I was blown away when I first saw the Dark knight. It is better then Batman Begins and is one of my most favorite movies. I am glad Heath Ledger was nominated but The Dark knight should have been nominated for best picture. Heath Ledger was very capable at playing the joker. I like the scene where he killed the gangster with a pencil. Aaron Eckhart was great at playing Two-Face and did better then Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever. He was evil but I felt bad for him. I liked the hospital confrontation between the joker where he used his coin and spared joker's life. There's only one bad part of Dark Knight. I liked the final battle between Batman and the joker but after he was captured for good they did not show him in Arkham Asylum. I think Maggie Gyllenhall did better than Katie Holmes and I liked her scene with the Joker. Christian Bale gave an Oscar worthy performance and he had improved since Batman Begins. I also liked when Lucius Fox referenced Catwoman. I can't wait to see The Dark Knight Rises. I am kind of glad that Bane is one of the villains. He's not that well known but he is famous for breaking the bat. If Heath Ledger had not died he would have been in Dark Knight Rises. He would have teamed with Bane. Everyone should see The Dark Knight because it is an excellent film.
10.0~The best film of the decade! It's a classic already! TMarkus_1993 Sign in Permalink I'm a really big Batman fan, and Batman Begins had blown me away. I had been so anxious about this movie, I thought I was going crazy! And then the big day came. July 17. I rushed into the cinema with my parents, and when I got out, I was left completely SPEECHLESS!!!! This is no ordinary movie! It's a cinematic PHENOMENON! The Nolan Brothers have done it again! So this time, Batman has officially declared war on crime in Gotham City, along with Lieutenant Jim Gordon, and the new District Attorney Harvey Dent. And when they are so close to wiping out crime in the city, a new EVIL arises. A criminal mastermind, an incredibly intelligent, but absolutely insane man. A personification of anarchy, evil, madness, chaos, cruelty. The most iconic, deranged comic book villain of all time. THE JOKER. With his rise, chaos returns to haunt Gotham for one more time, and Batman will have to face his own demons more than ever. I think it's my obligation to start with the most astonishing performance I've ever seen (except for Marlon Brando in The Godfather). The late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Heath gave so much to that character, he was so scary, so perfect, he is surely going to win an Oscar for best actor. Mark my words. I've never seen The Joker like that before. His best incarnation. R.I.P. Heath Ledger. The rest of the major cast gives very good performances. Cristian Bale is really good as always as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He is more troubled than before, and has to fight his own demons to maintain balance in his life. Michael Caine is the best Alfred Pennyworth there is, as the father figure of Bruce Wayne. Gary Oldman's character, Jim Gordon, becomes much more important, as he belongs to the major trio that fights crime in the city. Katie Holmes is replaced by Maggie Gullenhaal for the role of Rachel Dawes, who is in fact the source of antagonism between Harvey Dent, and Bruce Wayne. She's so much better than Katie Holmes, I'll give you that, but seriously, she is NOT pretty. Aaron Eckhart does a remarkable job too as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, and Morgan Freeman is still doing really well as Lucius Fox. The direction by Christopher Nolan is nothing but an incredible achievement. He gives you that dark atmosphere that fits perfectly for Batman. The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is just masterful, taking you to an amazing trip throughout the whole movie. Of course, we shouldn't forget the screenplay by the Nolan Brothers, which is absolutely flawless, and unpredictable. What else can I say? The movie is terrific! It's gonna win many Oscars, that's for sure! SPOILER AHEAD---- The last scene where Jim Gordon talks about Batman is just EPIC!!!! All four times that i've seen the movie, this scene always gave me the chills!!!! ----END OF SPOILER Don't take any second thoughts. Just go, see it, and you'll see that these 154 minutes of your life will have been wasted wisely.
10.0~Greatest film of this generation lilitaly87 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight was, to say the least, an amazing comic book adaptation... But, that is to say the least. It was the greatest comic book adaptation to date, and simultaneously one of the greatest films of this generation. It is safe to say that big-budget blockbusters rarely deserve the level of commercial hype put in place to drive their monumental box office sales. This film is an exception to that rule. I stress the use of the term "FILM", because this was no ordinary movie. This is a modern day masterpiece, a three act opera that unfolds before you in high definition and surround sound. Director Christopher Nolan explores a blurred dichotomy of good and evil with an expertise rarely exhibited, while Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, and Heath Ledger combine for a timeless portrayal of twisted fate and fortune. While screening The Dark Knight, I was deeply taken by the raw depth of Heath Ledger's Joker. I couldn't help but feel privileged to be able witness this performance of a lifetime. Profoundly moving, and entirely entertaining, The Dark Knight has rightfully established itself as a film for the ages, a rare accomplishment indeed.
10.0~let's put a smile on that face Goodfellasz Sign in Permalink wow, some time ago I saw the dark knight and all I can say is :wow. the film started as a crime film and ended as a real dramatic story. the joker is the only "bad guy" I like in the batman series and Heath ledger preformed an amazing enemy. The story of Two-Face was dramatic and sad, 10 times better than Jones (Batman forever) BAtman himself was probably the best of all. my favourite scene : every scene with the joker. only one disappointment : the film was to short. Yesterday I red that the sequel would contain the Riddler (good choice) and the Pinguin (afwul choice) All I can say is : hopefully the writers erase the Pinguin and replace him by another enemy.
10.0~Hollywood Gets It Right DKosty123 Sign in Permalink This film is long at over 2 1/2 hours but that is because it does so much right that it takes that long to do the job. Everyone in the cast is terrific. The action is almost non-stop for this film too. Michael Caine is even better in this film than he was in Batman Begins. Morgan Freeman who has been busy this year (also in Wanted this summer) is fantastic. The film has times where the action is so intense that you almost get lost but it picks you up and doesn't let you get lost. Kudos to Christian Bale as he is even better here than in Batman Begins. Heath Ledger as the Joker is the big story. This is not a Joker like before, as this one is totally out there (and don't ask me where there is). His criminal activity is defined as unusually bizarre. He says it himself when he says in the movie that he just goes where he wants without any reason for what he is doing. The Joker actually starts the film robbing a bank. By the end of the movie, he has made that bank robbery seem and actually be pointless. The robbery is just a place to start the movie. The film starts dark & ends darker with very little light in the middle. It kills off people often and even one of the main roles is killed. It gives viewers a delightful UN-predictability not just too the Joker but to where the film is going. That is pretty much what makes this film go. I doubt than any film will top it this year. It even leaves Wanted in the dust grasping to catch up.
1.0~all you need to know is...... hughman55 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie on a Monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater. Good plan. It worked. The movie didn't. Many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so I'll skip that part. There were some very good, though isolated, moments in the story: a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesn't work, the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived, "abridged" civil rights are neither civil nor right, etc. I like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state. To me, however, the most prominent feature of this film was neither Heath Ledger, (whom I greatly respect as an actor), Christian Bale, nor the script, directing, story line, performances, or suspense, but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on. Everything in this movie explodes!!! And the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing, stabbing, pounding, bludgeoning, shooting, and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through. And though I have enormous respect for him, Ledger's Joker was basically Ted Bundy with face paint. I think the inspiration for this film came more from Oliver Stone's "Natuarl Born Killers" than from anything that was ever written in a comic book. All you need to know is this... In the last ten minutes of the film, with the body count hovering somewhere around 100, a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood, (those of you who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about). The scene goes on for what I thought was an excruciatingly long time, but even as it was just beginning I was thinking to myself, "no, no, no, this is wrong. This should not be done this way in a movie". Then somewhere in the theater, behind me, a child began sobbing uncontrollably. Yes, real terror, real horror, real fear, a real child, right there in the theater. The scene finally came to an end. The sobbing didn't. As the lights came up for us to leave I saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater, still sobbing, and hanging on to his parents' clothing as they walked out. I don't blame the parents. This movie's PG13 rating is unconscionable. This is a "Batman" movie! With a PG13 rating! "Batman" originated from a children's comic book series. One would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children. It's not. Given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits it's not even suitable for adults. Several of the postings here at IMDb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect scores that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film ever,according to IMDb. Not me. I really didn't like this movie. And in the last ten minutes of it I came to hate it. It does not do service to the Batman franchise, or movies in general. There is not a shred of "comic book" appeal in it anywhere, and it will take it's place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made. That this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad, and sick inside. And if I could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest I'd say this, "thanks for the memories".
10.0~more than a simple "comic book" movie. theoutlawtorn1080 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has created a monster in "The Dark Knight". With this film, he has set the bar so high for comic book movies, that i doubt anyone else will be able to touch it for a very long time. Him and his brother, Johnathon Nolan, have crafted something special that not only goes beyond the label that this particular type of movie is given, but breaks the walls into a totally different genre all together. Of course the story on everyone's lips is the tragedy of heath ledger. Now while i agree that ledgers final performance was quite possibly the best of the year, there is SO much more to this film. It plays like a well crafted crime drama on par with some of the best of all time. This film runs with a extremely swift 152 min run time, and amazingly, has no fat to speak of. Every story line running thru this film is so tightly wound around each other, that the logical conclusion of every situation is allowed to play out under its own momentum. And the films conclusion is so well done and so satisfying, that i did not feel the stomach pains that come with the need to see what will happen in the next movie. but i will be waiting patiently for the inevitable next chapter in this amazing crime saga.
5.0~"The Dark Joker" or "21st Century Ennui" LouE15 Sign in Permalink The last time I had to ask so many questions during a film was during incomprehensible existential timewaster "Tron" (so now you also know roughly how old I am!). Significant exceptions aside, this is the "Tron" of the modern-day blockbuster world. I emerged saying "yeah, well". I loved "Batman Begins"; Christian Bale is my favourite Batman; and with this many great actors, it should have been a steal. Michael Caine in particular brings, with his briefest appearance on screen, a wonderful sense of comfort and pathos. But despite all this – despite a general tone suitable to a post-traumatic, mid-recession era – I was left entirely agreeing with a reviewer who described feeling unaccountably "disconnected" from the culture that spawned this film. The breathless adulation that some have heaped on the film has astonished me. I love dark things: I love film noir; and films of all sorts whose characters who struggle with their souls' messy urgings. But "The Dark Knight" is all dark looks and no urgings. Lots of reviewers have praised the 'dark Gotham' design: huh? It's modern-day New York in low light and with extra night thrown in! How is that brilliant? And the crime wave? You want a truly dark tone, watch "Serpico" or "Blue Collar". To make a really good action film about corruption, everyone – literally everyone – needs to be, or to seem, corrupt. How much more interesting would this film have been if Rachel, Alfred and Lucius Fox were under suspicion, or better still, actually corrupt and working against Batman? Or if Batman were found in his Penthouse by Rachel, curled up naked and whispering mad nothings like a Gotham Howard Hughes? Bale was half asleep, or may as well have been – what a waste of that intense face, his physicality! Ledger was very, very impressive, and this was his film – he would eventually have made the lists of the really great actors if he could have kept from doing rubbish films like "Casanova". The charismatic Maggie Gyllenhaal is a pleasant change but even she can't perform the magic trick of making a meaningful character from an underwritten part. I've seen the Batman back catalogue, but throughout this I kept asking: "soshe knows that Bruce is Batman?" "soshe loves him but she's marrying someone else?" "so.she's known him all his life? Who IS she?" I had no idea that this was the same girl Batman had brushed with in "Begins", so for me, there was no history, no connection, no tension. Everything got absorbed in the central, overstretched idea of Batman's inner darkness versus the Joker's chaos theory. Like the vision of purgatory that is Batman's temporary lair while Wayne Manor is being rebuilt, mostly I think this film is about nothing more or less than the state of being bored. Batman is bored of his dual lifestyles. The Joker is bored of playing all by himself, the only intelligent psychopath in Gotham. Harvey is bored of winning his not very interesting games of chance. Glass-and-steel Gotham is 1980s dull; crime, which is money, is boring – so boring that the Joker sets his money on fire. That party Bruce throws for Harvey – come on! – the most boring party on earth; Rachel's "love" triangle is the most boring love triangle ever. Maybe a different style altogether would have helped bring this spin on the story alive, such as comic animation in tune with the TV series, or hyper-stylised like "Sin City", which seems apt. It's absurd to imagine that this film – mere dark-toned spun sugar confection that it is – merits a place in any generation's top 100 list. Here's a revolutionary idea: how about NO more Batman, in this guise at least? Leave the superheroics in the capable hands of Iron Man and Hellboy and move on.
10.0~Awesome BabyCheddarGoldfish Sign in Permalink This is a fantastic comic book/superhero movie  easily my favorite. The actors are very good, especially some of the minor roles. The action, gadgets  every staple of Batman Begins  is there in full force and better looking than ever. The movie is gorgeous. The real highlight of this movie is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Some might be under the impression that all the talk and hype about his performance leading up to the theatrical release was because of his unfortunate early death. That impression, however, is definitely not accurate. Ledger's Joker is everything that was hyped and promised and then some. It is simply spectacular. Thanks in a large part to Ledger, Dark Knight is surprisingly emotional. There are parts that are (unsurprisingly) dark. But the mannerisms of the Joker and what he thinks and what he says are extremely funny. He has the ability to instantly change the tone of a scene  something that Nolan used to great effect. My only real (but small) complaint is that there are a few problems with the otherwise strong story. Dark Knight's plot does not seem as controlled as Batman Begins  the pacing of some sections is a little off. Also, Joker was an agent of chaos, destroying other's plans because he hates control, yet his actions were superbly planned  "it's all part of the plan." This criticism may be superficial, but there's no need to get into the deeper philosophy of the movie here other than to say it is engaging and fun. In short, if you love good action with a good story with great acting, this is definitely a must see. Ledger's performance is fantastic  in my opinion, it deserves piles of awards. 10/10
1.0~Absolutely not dark. Hardly Batman-like. musuca Sign in Permalink I wasn't so much excited about "Batman Begins". Simply pseudo-intellectual "philosophy of fear" was rather painful than interesting to me. Techno-futuristic Batman surrounded by oh-my-god cinema stars that have nothing to do with traditional Batman characters was nothing special to me. But this time I got excited. 3rd trailer was absolutely great, interesting interpretation of Joker (though vocally not so good as Mark Hamill but very original), a little bit of darkness, "The Dark Knight" reminding me of "The Dark Knight Returns" (that then I found out has absolutely nothing to do with the movie). It was great. But then... then come the movie... Movie that is absolutely boring, artistic-like weird and is so full of light that calling it "dark" is an abomination. If you want to hear the voice of Batman who apparently sings in a death metal band, go for this movie. If you want to see Gotham probably built and designed by IKEA (especially interiors), go! If you want to see "bat cave" so full of light that I had to dive under my chair to bring my eyes some darkness, it's the movie for you. But if you want to see anything really dark, atmospheric, Gothic, simply batman-like better remind yourself of things like "Batman The Animated Series" (1992) or Burton's movies (1989 & 1992) as you will find a lot of what Batman really is there, the real Dark Knight where word Dark means something and Knight is not meaningless as well. "The Dark Knight" is absolutely soulless like IKEA furniture and even Heath Ledger do not save the movie as his Joker is enjoyable for first 40 minutes, then becomes simply boring and all the same. What's funny, myself and audience around laughed much more when Batman spoke with his "dark" voice (death metal band vocalist, here...we...go!) than Joker laughed through the whole movie. It doesn't surprise me much as Ledger had the biggest problem with learning the mad laughter and although he did pretty well, lack of it during the movie, lack of single smile on Joker's face made it all look very pathetic. And then, here...we...go... with the plot. Batman decided to give up twice in the movie. Of course because he was afraid of what people think and self-critique. He apparently forgot that he started his obsession thanks to his parents death (oh well...). Alfred is dull and absolutely boring (I start to believe that it's just good to have "Michael Caine" name on movie posters). Lucius Fox is ohmygod-another-star-to-have-bigger-commercial-impact. Gordon was and remains not even close to what Gordon suppose to be, in my opinion. Etc. Etc. Finishing this counting-out rhyme with the Batman himself. Personally I love the way Ch.Bale acts. I admire his role in Prestige very much. But here... I don't see Batman, all I see is Christian Bale pretending he is Batman. Sad :( My conclusion is simple, Nolan's vision is far from what I consider as "the dark knight" and lack of darkness, lack of dark Gotham (not to mention that Gotham lacking of criminals who are too afraid to do their job instead of overwhelming Batman with number of crimes is simply a blasphemy), lack of darkness in Batman's soul and then lack of taste and common sense in the movie are something that made me yawn and look on my watch for nearly whole movie. Apparently audience thought the same as nearly every Batman's line produced fine amounts of laughter and maybe 10 people stayed to see first lines of credits (just like they would hear "here...we...go..." and decided to evacuate as fast as possible, literally). I know that the future will be completely different but I have high hope that Nolan will never, ever do another "Batman" again. Please... for the dark knight's sake.
5.0~The film that the word 'overrated' was invented for. BA_Harrison Sign in Permalink 8.9 out of 10—really? The Dark Knight is undeniably visually impressive, full of flashy special effects, stunning production design and spectacular action set-pieces, but the fans who have rated this film so highly clearly have as little grip on reality as its antagonist The Joker (Heath Ledger). 152 minutes of relentlessly dark, dreary, depressing drama—the enjoyment factor turned down to the lowest possible setting—this overly complex and frequently logic-free sequel to Batman Begins sees director Christopher Nolan once again presenting the antics of a man dressed as a bat in a completely humourless fashion. And if Nolan is going to take matters so seriously, then so am I... Could a man with half his face burned off really get out of bed the next day to conduct a vendetta? Why does Batman talk to Fox in his 'gruff' voice when the man already knows his real identity? How do you get hundreds of barrels of explosives onto two ferries without being noticed? Likewise, how did The Joker wire up a hospital to blow-up without being spotted? Who built Batman's underground silo? Does anyone really know what the hell was going on during that scene with that cell phone sonar equipment and the building full of baddies? Where exactly do you hire a butler who can arrange for a skyhook in Hong Kong? These are just a few of the many questions that arise from Nolan's so-called masterpiece. Rabid Batman/Nolan fans might be all too happy to overlook these somewhat awkward posers, but I can't—not when such a blatantly flawed film currently sits at No.8 in the IMDb top 250. 5.5 out of 10, but not good enough to be rounded up to a 6.
1.0~An overrated movie butchfilms Sign in Permalink I think this movie deserves 7 stars, but I give it 1 star because I don't think this movie should be so high in the top 250 IMDb list. I liked the performance of Heath Ledger as The joker. That is why I think many people gave to "The Dark Knight" 10 stars, and of course besides the great marketing that this movie had. I didn't like the voice that Christian Bale used when he was dressed like batman, he sounded so rare. I think Heath Ledger is going to be nominated for the Oscar awards for his performance as the joker in the supporting actor category. In short, this is a good movie, but an overrated movie.
6.0~Wake up, people. alexlennon55 Sign in Permalink Let me preface this by saying that the dark knight is a good movie. Unfortunately, that's all it is. Not excellent, not a masterpiece by ANY means, and anyone who tries to tell me this movie's a CLASSIC, save your breath. This flick's a summer blockbuster and nothing more. let me start out with the good parts: Heath Ledger and Michael Caine. Both actors brought good things to the table and prevented the movie from being just dismally bad. When I first saw Ledger was to be cast as the Joker, I was disappointed; I guess I'd been hoping for someone different. What a sleeper he turned out to be. Unfortunately, Ledger essentially carried the film. He was the one strong performance among the leads. Some aspects of Ledger's Joker were downright creepy, creative, and most importantly, convincing. Props to you Heath, you were quite a talented actor. Michael Caine as Alfred was as good as he was in Begins, but he's a pretty minor character which is a shame. I'm pretty neutral about Morgan Freeman, he did a good enough job, but could've been better, which leads me to my next point: the script. What an awful piece of trash this was. The script was the reason why Lucius could've been better; it certainly wasn't Freeman's fault. The lines were flat, the storyline was contrived, and there were plot holes en masse. I think the Joker's lines were OK, as they fit with Ledger's portrayal of him. It was a shame, then, that the writing for Batman, Bruce, Dent, Gordon, and Lucius was completely flat. I think what irked me most about the movie was Two-Face's role. It didn't work in the film at all. It almost seemed as though two face had been some kind of afterthought. Dent was all well and good, but two face was in the movie for all of 25 minutes, and killing him off at the end was mind-bogglingly stupid. Two-Face had such potential, especially for the 3rd movie, and the character was a complete failure. More plot holes than you can shake a stick at. Everything went like clockwork for the Joker, from the bank robbery to the interrogation to the jailbreak to the mayor to the hospital. It's all WAY too easy. The story isn't coherent at all and was also too complex. I could have done without about half the minor characters. Nevertheless, none of that stuff really bothers me nearly as much as this: people are calling it a 'masterpiece' and a 'classic' and 'timeless'. That last one really gets me. What are you, stupid? this movie embodies none of those words. Wake up, people. Check back with me in 25 years and if it's still #5 I'll give it some thought. For Christ's sake, it topped the chart for like 2 months! that to me is just obscene. Tell me that it's better than Casablanca, Seven Samurai, Goodfellas, a Clockwork Orange, Rear Window, Seven, and Apocalypse Now and try keeping a straight face. In a perfect world, TDK wouldn't even be on the top 250, but I'll be happy when it gets below #150. Read: 'when', not 'if'.
10.0~Eagerly Awaited By All Grissom66 Sign in Permalink With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the committed new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Batman (Christian Bale) sets out to destroy organized crime in Gotham City for good. The triumvirate initially proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a rising criminal mastermind known as The Joker (Heath Ledger), who thrusts Gotham into anarchy and forces The Dark Knight ever closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante.The thought of Heath Ledger not being able to see his final completed role saddened me but i myself quite enjoyed it and believe he will win the Oscar. The Dark Knight:10/10
3.0~A Different Perspective aliceprez Sign in Permalink Many people think this is one of the best films of the 21st century. I'm here to assure you that it most certainly isn't. Is Heath Ledger excellent in his role as the Joker? He certainly is, but who cares? This film is so muddled in its own self-importance and at the end of the day, the only thing it truly accomplishes is patronizing its audience for two and a half hours. JUSTICE! LAW! ETHICS! BATMAN!!! Yadda-yadda. Translation: bunkum and hoopla. This film would certainly only have the reputation that it does in our current society of grown children who think that superhero comics are on par with classic literature. Enough is enough. This isn't a great film.
10.0~Greatest Superhero adventure ever...(minor spoilers) sniperswagat Sign in Permalink Let me begin by clearing a few misconceptions about 'The Dark Knight': It is not a superhero movie and it is not just a Batman movie. You could transfer the setting, and the theme of the characters to a real-life situation, and they would behave just the same way. All right then, down to the details. First of all, this is definitely, easily, and comprehensively, the best superhero movie ever. Period. Second, Ledger is the Joker. He is the brightest star in an especially bright galaxy. Nicholson, Romero, Hamill can all fill out their retirement forms. They will never be looked upon as Joker anymore. The manic intensity, the crude yet subtle humour, the unpredictability he possesses, takes Ledger to a level higher than any villain in comic book adaptations. TDK picks up from where Batman Begins left: Batman has established himself in the criminal circles, and is now inspiring a few of Gotham's citizens to take up the fight for justice themselves. But rather than doing what he thinks they would have done, i.e., taking the legal route, raising their voice, standing up to the mob; a few take up the vigilante's mantle, trying to be Batman themselves. Enter Harvey Dent, the D.A. of Gotham, and the man who is what Batman has been waiting for so long to take over the cleaning operation of the city. Dent is the face to take Gotham out of their misery: their White Knight in shining armour. And this Knight takes the damsel with him as well: Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's long-time love and childhood friend. The emotional turmoil this puts Bruce Wayne through is immense, considering that Dent is the man he was waiting for to come in, so that he could hang up his shoes and retire to normal life with Dawes. But this soon becomes the least of his worries, as the Joker, a criminal who is trying to establish himself in Gotham's underworld, takes centre stage. As he himself says, he is "an agent of Chaos." The lack of a background story only adds to the aura and mystery of the Joker. He blows up hospitals, kills people for the fun of it, and plays with Batman's psyche: "You complete me", he snarls. We also play witness to the inner turmoil of Batman. Wayne even ponders whether he is really a hero, or just a fed-up guy who wants to teach the goons a lesson by using force. During critical moments in the film, he thinks of quitting his night job as the situation seems impossible. During these times, his anchors: his butler Alfred, and Lucius Fox, his technical mentor, are the men who keep him on the course, who make him endure for the greater good. Moving to the acting department, Christian Bale as Batman puts in a great performance. He is able to transfer the turmoil of Bruce Wayne and Batman effectively onto the screen. He seems to have settled into the mould of both characters like second skin. An Oscar nomination doesn't look too far away. Aaron Eckhart does justice to both his roles: Harvey Dent, and Two-Face, though he doesn't get enough time to develop the two-face character. Maggie Gyllenhaal does a better job than Katie Holmes at playing the headstrong Rachel Dawes. Though the character is not as well sketched out as the others, but it does not act as a roadblock in the story. Batman's allies: Jim Gordon, Alfred and Lucius Fox, are extremely well played by the veteran thespians Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. But this movie belongs to Ledger alone in the acting department. He gives the Joker a twist that will live on forever, despite Ledger's unfortunate death. He might well become the first posthumous winner of the Best Actor Oscar. Yup, Best Actor, for this movie is his swan song; a final bow before he walked into the sunset. The vision of Christopher Nolan about human psyche is terrifying and extremely thought provoking at the same time. He forces you to think in between the movie as to what you would do if faced with the situation as the characters in the film. Nolan has taken his vision of a superhero movie from Batman Begins and worked on it to give us a gem on the screen on a much bigger scale. He has able help from his brother and co-writer Jonathan Nolan; the music team Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard; and Wally Pfister, the cinematographer. Chilling to the core, it leaves you wanting more. It is one of those rare movies where you think that 2 and half hours are less. The experience is emotionally overwhelming, visually grandiose, and overall, something not to be missed.
10.0~No words will do this justice Nyx_Selene Sign in Permalink This is... dark, horrifying, frightening... It is nothing short of a masterpiece. The story and script are magnificent. While leaving the movies, a friend said: "I thought the first movie (note: Meaning Batman Begins) was dark, but it was nothing like this. There was no happy ending anywhere." Well, is there ever? The darkest, most horrible thing about this movie, is that it's truthful: Good stands frustrated in the face of an evil that cannot be understood. Terrible things happen and we have few other choices but to endure them. We want someone to step up and end it, but few will add "and that someone is me", because we know too well the cost. So we place our hope in the few who are willing to take the risks and make the sacrifices. "The Dark Knights" cast is wonderful all around, but one must be mentioned in particular, and it is the late Heath Ledger - may he rest in peace. His performance as a villain has no equal. In "The Shining" Jack Nicholson gave me nightmares and in "The Silence of the Lambs" Anthony Hopkins made my skin crawl, but Ledger's Joker surpasses them both. He is simply on a level of his own. Since I can't find the words to describe what I felt while watching this movie, I'll just give it the 10 out of 10 it deserves.
10.0~'Why so serious?' - because this movie isn't like other comic adaptations cortinex Sign in Permalink I watched 'Batman Begins' and gave it ten stars out of ten. I watched 'The Dark Knight' and what am I supposed to do now? I can't add any stars to the rating system... This movie is breath-taking, brilliant, absorbing... just add all the other positive adjectives that come to your mind! A good two and a half hours of excellent film-making in which every second is placed as perfectly as it can be! The cast: awesome! Bale, Ledger, Caine, Freeman, Eckhart, Oldman, Gyllenhaal... The plot: superb! Not just an ordinary action-movie with endless sequences of explosions, brawls and shootings but thoughtful moments of incredibly fast events taking turns with subtle, extremely sinister situations, so perfectly combined that you are in serious danger of forgetting to breathe... The atmosphere is as dark as the title forebodes and you can virtually feel the terror the Joker spreads in Gotham City - by the way: the Joker is probably the best villain in a movie I have ever seen in my life and I take my hat before Mr. Ledger and thank him for having us left such a bombastic piece of acting as his legacy! Back to the movie: breathe out in the moments of (nonetheless)captivating silence, think about what happened - because the movie wants you to and that's what adds to his special status - and be prepared for the next wonderful sequence to come; the film is full of it and it has earned my personal 'Movie of the Year'-Award! I seriously doubt anything better can happen to the audience this year... and maybe next... and maybe... ;) 10+x/10
8.0~Darkness Is The Definition Of Epic elliotminorjosh Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight tops Batman Begins enormously. The line-up feels so different but only a small part of the cast is new. If you thought the first was good, then this is the ultimate superhero film. The fact is, it doesn't even have the feel of a superhero flick. Yes, you have the hero going around in a costume complete with a mask and cape and, yes, you have the villain disguised by something and wearing an iconic costume but if you actually look closer, you'll see the hero is a vigilante and you'll see that his suit is very lethal and isn't a red and blue spandex outfit. And look closer at the villain and you'll see he is absolutely crazy and insane but is also very, very clever. The star of the film, however, isn't Bats. It's Heath Ledger as The Joker. His death a few months after the release of the film was tragic, so he left the world with one of the greatest characters of 21st century cinema. He is the glue of the film. The storyline is very good, without being too serious. A bit of humour is injected but at the right dose. See this film, and you will be amazed.
5.0~Tries to hard to be the "Syriana" of superhero films...unfortunately williamdefalco Sign in Permalink I went into this film with a fresh mind, having not heard much about it or any spoilerish stuff. Other than the unfortunate passing away of Heath, everything else was neutral with me. Wow did this movie try too too hard. It was like it was auditioning itself to become part of the rotation on the Bravo or AMC channel. There were just way too many unnecessary story lines involved here, all trying to make things more complex than they really were, all with that constant gloomy depressed feeling too, both staples of "serious" films. Don't get me wrong, it started off with a nice bang with the Joker, but soon after that Harvey Dent and his whole campaign issues became involved, then that whole storyline of the guy trying to frame Bruce Wayne came up, and then that whole byline about the commissioner's secret operation, and then the whole kidnapping of the Oriental mobster came up, and then the three-way romance between Bruce, Harvey, and Rachel came up, and so on and so forth. And that's not even including all the other segments involving Joker meeting up all the mobsters and following up on his big plan. You see what I mean, it was just trying to hard in too many areas all at once. Iron Man did it quite nicely by not taking itself too seriously. Yes there were fantastical parts in that film, but it never wavered too long on one issue or tried to have too many issues plague the script all at once. And that brings up another point about the dark knight. Was I only one a little offended at how the script just wanted us to so easily accept the Joker and his small crew doing so much with so little. I mean I just kept thinking that there's too many variables that have to be ignored in order for this to happen, but the movie sure makes it seem like everything should be instantly taken as fact. Problem with all the powerful mob bosses and their hundreds of men? Don't worry, Joker took care of that with his one little meeting with them. - Problem with trying to kill Harvey Dent, who's being escorted by nearly the entire Gotham City Police force? Don't worry, Joker and a few henchmen inside a truck can take care of that, all while somehow managing to block off entire sections of the city streets too. - Problem with trying to get out of jail? Don't worry, Joker already planned on having some guy with a live bomb inside of him, and timed everything to the second. - Problem with trying to get all of Gotham onto two ferry boats charged with explosives? Don't worry, Joker must've figured out some way to block off ALL highways and freeways leading in and out of Gotham, not to mention figuring out a way to stop all of the airlines, trains, and the entire US government and it's military power too. All with a just a few henchmen too. Anyways this movie get a 5/10 from out of me.
8.0~One of the best films ever created. Hats down for the whole crew. menfear Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight. Spectacular , stunning and amazing. Absolutely staggering, a film that is not going to be forgotten. One that actually shows a story as it was meant to be shown, and one of the most darkest, cruelest, and violent action-packed films ever created. With great dialogues in between the equally great scenes, taking the film to another level of greatness. The special effects were all done in a simple, non shabby way, the soundtracks were simply harmonizing with the picture, and the Gotham we knew is now gone, this is a darker and more corrupt place than in any of the previous films. Moving on to the acting. Starting off with the Dark Knight. Bale's performance was outstanding, no-one else has ever been as superb a Batman as he is. Him being split between righteousness and insanity, between what is right and what is wrong. An entirely different Batman, and Bruce Wayne, surpassing any of his other predecessors. Whilst those were more flat, two sided characters, the Bruce Wayne we face in The Dark Knight, is a totally different story. Two key people in the film were also Det. Lt. James Gordon, who was played by Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. They both gave a good, very believable performance. Same would go to the two characters in the supporting roles, Alfred and Luscious fox, being cast by Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman. Whilst these all gave a good quality from themselves, I was not at all impressed by Maggie Gyllenhaal who played Rachel Daws. Whether these characters were played well or not, people just could not concentrate on them too much, and that is only because of the fact that Heath Ledger, as the Joker, simply dominated every scene he was in, he was the highlight of the whole film. This is no ordinary Joker we were used to, Ledger portrayed the Joker as someone with hate running through his veins, someone that killed for pleasure and someone who had felt a great loss in his past. A darker, sicker, and more evil Joker than any of the other ones in the previous films. Insane, corrupt and terrifying, with a laugh of a psychotic maniac. A perfect villain for the Dark Knight, one that truly completed, and challenged him through the whole story. Hats down for Heath Ledger. Now, not to give all the compliments for the fantastic job to the actors. I also have to compliment the Nolan brothers for an obviously marvellous screenplay and great directing. Not to forget for a large stack of brilliant dialogues. They make films immortal, in a way that they are never forgotten. It makes the difference between a quality film and a masterpiece. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, amazing performances by the actors, with special mention on Ledger as the Joker. Bone-chilling scenes combined with action and drama, in Gotham that looks flawless, a huge city covered with darkness and insanity. The Dark Knight is a must see film.
9.0~Good but ... Kroshe Sign in Permalink First of all The Dark Knight is a good film and is worth a watch. Yet (imho) lacking a heart or a soul. Nolan does it again, he seemed certain to deliver a worthy action movie and for about half a film almost succeeds, but then succumbs to overload temptation and delivers a messy, overblown epic that resembles two Batman films hastily edited into one. Plus it is way too violent and graphic with knives and gun's for 12A. Plus the story completely focuses on Joker. Well this is maybe a good thing because Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) delivers a great performance, much better than Bale's wooden acting. I am not going to talk about Bale's vocal performance when he wears the Batman suit; awful.. My favourite line was "I can make this pencil disappear..." *slams pencil into other man's face* "...and...it's gone.". This is good humour but that's about it for me. If you want to see a good dark action movie go see V for Vendetta. It was a much better film in my humble opinion.
1.0~why this turn? the_floydian_wall Sign in Permalink I love Batman. In fact I loved Batman begins as much as I did the 1989 Micheal Keaton one. But This one I believe has sold out. It was obvious they're trying to tap into the 'saw' audience by making the joker some kind of ultra realistic disgusting serial killer. Nicholson's performance was so superior it's not even funny. The heath ledger joker had no class whatsoever and was a completely unbelievable bullshit philosopher through out. WHy did he have a knife? Where was the long-ass gun joker's always supposed to have? Very 'saw'-like "games" that he played on the masses were a disappointment. The problem is also that the movie tries desperately to tie in ultra-gritty realism and philosophical justifications. It's a comic book for god's sake. Don;t try so hard to make it realistic. It was created with a lot of skill but just took the wrong turn from what I was hoping for. All the situations where just contrived reincarnations of other scenes we've seen in other recent blockbusters. The hostage scenes: 16 blocks-inside man-other stupid cop movies. THe played out "you have to chose the girl or some other chump" just like in the spider man movie! Bat man begins was steady and a very creative new take on the comic. They should of focused the originality instead of making an overly-dramatic pile of feces. And two-face? one of my favorite villains. Seemed like they just pulled that one out of their ass and made him into a totally unpredictable dick that got added on towards the end of the movie and then killed off without ever doing anything remotely cool. the cell phone sonar thing was inane. so much potential, wasted
10.0~Certainly worth it. ENDING-MAN Sign in Permalink There is no part of "The Dark Knight" that can go unappreciated. From Heath Ledger's legendary performance as The Joker, to the masterful directing by Christopher Nolan, this film lacks nothing. The plot of "The Dark Knight" is so intricately written, whenever the movie appeared to end, it instead built up from previous events and into more intense struggles between each individual character. Additionally, one admirable quality of the plot is the universal appeal without gratuitous violence or sexual innuendo, which is often excessive in recent movies. The trailers for "The Dark Knight" cannot accurately reflect the quality of this film. If only all movies could be this good... but then again, if all movies were as good as this one, "The Dark Knight" wouldn't be so legendary. 10 stars out of 10.
7.0~Not that good. gex-the-gecko Sign in Permalink 9+ goes to the Joker, 6 to the rest. A perfect example when just one character can make movie worth your time. Whant to see perfectly convenient 100% badass antihero? That's him. Bravo. Everything else on the other side is mediocre. There are some good moments, some bad moments, CG scenes are OK, shaky camera in fighting scenes makes them completely unenjoyable. Characters other than Joker are... well, just characters, like in million other bland movies, too boring and typical to care about. Yes, Batman is now also nothing-to-see-here type of character, makes me sad( The last 20 minutes of the movie are god-awful. Typical blah blah blah am I hero blah blah blah a man deserves blah blah blah what should I do I'm a grown up man with childish issues on my mind... Shut up, you're embarrassing! Conclusion. Rent this movie, skip some moments and don't watch the final scenes.
10.0~The Dark Knight is an instant classic andre-walcott Sign in Permalink "Where do we..begin?" I knew the movie would have been good...but wow!! It's better than what I could've ever imagined. Enough superlatives can't be used to describe how wonderful a cinematic experience this was. Christopher Nolan is taking over. While I wouldn't expect him to release movies to this level every time, once he continues with anything even close(as his portfolio is still small), then he'll become a legendary director. From the beginning, you're locked on to everything the movie has to offer. The mood is just dark and exactly how Batman should be portrayed....as in Batman Begins. I don't even know if I can watch the 1989 Batman now. Seems so...bland in comparison. Sorry Tim Burton, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson but my goodness...The Dark Knight is a masterpiece. Despite all the hype, which usually spoils some movies as you expect too much, this is worth all the hype and more. I think Christian Bale is a superb actor and is cast very well due to his cool, calm and collective demeanor BUT Heath Ledger stole the show hands down. He had the mannerisms exact and he was a psychotic twist to what we've seen as the joker in the past. How did he do the voice? Just superb!! The acting was wonderful thanks to excellent casting, the music heard throughout just set the tone. The action scenes were well done, and the stunts were cool, especially the ones seen with his 'new' vehicle. The dialogue was excellent. Very well written. Everything is tied in nicely from beginning to end. It gets 10 out of 10 in my books. I have a Batman Begins poster in my room. Looks like it will be replaced. The Dark Knight is an instant classic!! "Let's put a smile on that face!"
10.0~Batman's Back & Better Than Ever! hannah8700-1 Sign in Permalink They're back again! I think everyone had high expectations for this film, but this sequel went above and beyond. "The Dark Knight" was without a doubt the best movie of the year! In a word- riveting! It was equally as good as the first if not better. All of the action and suspense keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film, from the first scene to the last. It's one you have to see more than once, especially with such an all star cast. As always, Christian Bale plays yet another phenomenal role this second time around as Batman and Heath Ledger's last chilling, yet brilliant performance as "The Joker" both made the film. He most definitely deserves the Oscar! However, I did not care too much for Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes. There was just no chemistry there whatsoever. And you kind of feel bad for Batman too at the end because first the woman he loves chooses someone else after she already basically said that she loved him and then the entire city of Gotham turns on him, forcing him to become "The Dark Knight." The film also brought to light so many of the truths about the never ending battle of good vs. evil that so many fight within themselves. All in all, it demanded your full attention and rightly so. No doubt there will be another "Batman" somewhere in the near future, making it a trilogy that will soar through the box office once again. Entertainment at its best!
10.0~Well Deserved Hype knoyourrole04 Sign in Permalink I am at a loss for words. The Dark Knight was hyped so much that I was tired of hearing about it.... But every bit of hype was well deserved... extremely well deserved... Heath Ledger, its a shame the man passed on.. His performance was incredible, not just as the joker but as a supervillian in a movie. He pulled off what the great Jack Nicholson wished he could and don't get me wrong, Jack's performance was great but Ledger made me forget while watchin the movie that good ole jack ever played the joker before.. Please see this movie, its flawless, and I mean FLAWLESS. Christopher Nolan did an excellent job.. Its not just a good batman movie its a great standalone movie
10.0~brilliant movie definitely worth watching tristanlaming98 Sign in Permalink Well made movie the best Batmam ever to be made and probably ever will be Nolan did an excellent theme to the dark knight one never seen before in any of the Batman franchise's ever made heath ledgers acting was at its readjust when you thought he was at his best he goes a step further definitely worth being in the top 250 and so high number 4 on the list I would definitely recommend watching it even if you are not a Batman fan this will change your view on it finally this brings out a new side to the joker he has always been viewed as a funny character in cartoon but when you watch this your whole idea of him will change for good
10.0~Simply Incredible and One of My All-Time Favorites... brando647 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has created the greatest superhero film ever in the latest installment of his Batman franchise. While I didn't get involved in all the viral marketing for this film, I did follow the news on it very closely in the year preceding it's release. I had some ridiculously high hopes for the movie before it came to theaters and I was so happy when it not only lived up to the hype, but blew it away. Not only is film the greatest superhero film to date, it is easily one of my favorite movies ever. The movie continues the Batman saga with the mob losing it's stranglehold on Gotham City due to the actions of Batman, Lieutenant Jim Gordon, and the new district attorney, Harvey Dent. In an act of desperation, the mob turns to a relative newcomer who offers to handle their little Batman problem...the Joker. Seeing as how Nolan wanted to keep his Batman franchise grounded in reality, I was confused as to how he planned to do so with a character such as the Joker. And, I won't lie, I was a bit leery upon hearing of his casting Heath Ledger in the iconic role. Well, I've learned my lesson and I will not doubt the skills of Christopher Nolan again. Ledger was AMAZING in his portrayal of the villain...he wasn't the least bit campy and he came off as a sadistic, chaotic, genuine threat to Batman. He stole EVERY scene he was in and was almost charismatic in his lunacy. It's a shame Ledger was so good in his performance because he nearly outshines the other great performances in the film. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman each reprise their roles from the first film and continue providing solid performances. Oldman (Gordon) was given a larger role in this film and it was cool watching his character grow into the powerful figure we're familiar with. There have been a lot of complaints regarding Maggie Gyllenhaal's replacement of Katie Holmes in the role of Rachel Dawes but I thought she did a fine, if not a little better than Holmes. Finally, the film introduces Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, who I feel should get more recognition for his performance. While Ledger was definitely the highlight of the cast, Eckhart had the challenge of portraying Dent through a crucial character arc and pulled it off with ease. Everything about this film was a dramatic improvement over an already amazing film. The action was bigger, the tone was darker, the characters/cast were incredible...I really couldn't find a single thing to dislike about this film. The running time was a full 2.5 hours but you really don't notice. From the opening scene, the film grabs you and doesn't let up until the end. I know not everyone agrees with my opinion, but so everyone I've watched it with does. Nolan has created a Batman film that the audience doesn't need to be comic book fans to appreciate.
10.0~Spectacular... tracie-a-carter Sign in Permalink I came into the cinema having only seen Batman Begins, which I thought was excellent. I went with a friend who had seen it before and she had said great things. Just the first few minutes blew me away. The sheer scale and atmosphere was incredible and Christian Bale's performance was excellent. Then the Joker came in. You would hardly know it was Heath Ledger playing it as of his quiet performance in Brokeback Mountain. He played the Joker phenomenally, from his funny 'pencil trick' to his creepy and hysterical laughs which completely made this film. Overrall, the entire movie was dark, exciting and breathtaking, a definite must-see. 10/10 **R.I.P Heath Ledger**
5.0~Ledger is good at being bad; Bale bailed buckeye22 Sign in Permalink In my 43 years on this planet, I have never seen a more manic depressive movie than The Dark Knight. This movie alternates between insufferable, back-aching boredom to frenetic, hold-on-to-your-seat action. And most of the action sequences are amazing. It's probably worth the price of admission just to see the action sequences and Ledger's performance. It does not surprise me that this movie had FIVE WRITERS. I knew this half way through the movie before I even looked it up. How did I know this sitting in the movie? Four things will tip you off to multiple writers in a movie. (1) Haphazard, rambling direction. (2) Storyline on top of storyline on top of storyline. (3) The movie ends FIVE TIMES (one for each writer). (4) More than two hour running time (this movie is almost three hours -- remember the mess that was Spiderman 3??). From the very beginning, this movie seems to have no direction whatsoever. You could literally take the script to this movie and divide each scene up on separate sheets of paper, throw them up in the air, gather them up and shoot this movie again and nothing would change. That's how disorganized and haphazard the story proceeds. There are at least five side-stories, all of which are hard to follow and difficult to understand how they fit in to the overall story (blowing up two ferries?). BY FAR the most annoying part of The Dark Knight is Christian Bale's unbelievably over-the-top, angst-ridden portrayal of Batman. As Bruce Wayne, he delivers a great performance. When he straps on the gear, he becomes this growling, hilariously overwrought caricature of the Batman we know and love. He had people in my theater LAUGHING when he talked. It's a ridiculous performance and it's the director's fault. And, who is the annoying basset hound playing Rachel? Horrible actress. Not even remotely hot. I never thought I'd miss Katie Holmes. I'd rather see Iron Man fifty times before seeing this again. But don't let that keep you from seeing the movie. Ledger alone is worth the price of admission.
7.0~Good but over-hyped robcomber Sign in Permalink First off, this isn't as good as Batman Begins. The story isn't as tight and the characters aren't as strong within the story. We are lead around rather haphazardly. Sure you could argue that this reflects the Jokers chaos, but the film doesn't particularly characterise him as all that chaotic. For every plan, the Joker has a backup plan, and as he spells out his and Batman's polar relationship, its quite clear that Nolan has chosen to depict the Joker, not as a crazy lunatic, but as a psychopath that has chosen chaos over order. The chaos of the plot simply leads away from the characters, and fills us with unnecessary schlock; the guy revealing Batman's identity (why? and if it was this easy to figure it out, why doesn't everyone know?), Gordon's death (again why? and isn't it plainly obvious that no-one is particularly grieving, and that he hasn't even made Commissioner yet?), the mobile phone sonar (pointless, included to keep Morgan Freeman in the movie, show off that they can think of gadgets, and include some special effects, get rid of it and have Batman figure out who is a hostage the old fashioned way), and so on. Nolan should have chosen to extend other scenes, focusing on enriching the main characters, such as Joker's taunting of the detective in the MCU before his escape. For all this, the film is enjoyable, and you don't feel the length. The action scenes are as exciting as you would expect and don't fail to deliver. Ledger's performance as the Joker is good, in my opinion only lacking in the characterisation provided by the plot. His movements are natural while remaining corrupt and psychotic. He could have been more menacing, or even aloof, the only real depiction of which comes in after he blows up the hospital in his dance away. This isn't Nolan's masterpiece but maybe next time!
8.0~Legendary computingemail Sign in Permalink Sometimes the films which long often open up to lots of movie mistakes which are talked about for years to come. The big difference here is, yes, there are some movie mistakes as with everything. But, the film has so much happening all of the time these mistakes can barely get noticed when watching the movie. The only time that they are recognisable is when they are clearly pointed out and you deliberately search for them yourself. The script was one which was well written and good enough to keep the attention to what they are saying throughout the whole of the film, from start until the end. I do believe though there could have been so much more development with some of the characters in this film though. Mainly Harvey Dent. Even though he popped up multiple time I definitely believe that he could have done so much with the character but didn't.
10.0~The Dark Knight rikkemor Sign in Permalink I had high hopes and anticipations foremost to Heath Ledgers performance which was highly spoken of everywhere. I saw the movie once, but I was so busy analyzing every move he did and every sequence of the movie that I didn't get the chance to relax and enjoy the masterpiece of the year. Now, I did see the movie once more and I was truly captured by its magnificence. Heath Ledger was an incredible actor, and it is tragic that all though after this fabulous performance, this is almost the last we will see of his great talent. Can't wait to see him in Terry Gilliams "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"! "The Dark Knight" is fantastic and I loved it. Excuse any English grammar mistakes!
10.0~a top ten surprise chrissy-stephenson Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight was a movie that was undoubtedly going to be awesome, original and a a success with the critics, but did anyone think this movie was a serious contender to break into many peoples top ten movie list of all time?... My first opinion of Heath Ledger as the Joker was that he did not quite live up to Nicholson's portrayal. Every time Nicholson was on screen he could make the audience laugh, whereas Ledger was awesome but The Joker was originally played by the best actor of all time...it was always going to be tough to better Nicholson. However, as the movie went on, i couldn't help but feel this was one of the best acting displays we may have ever seen on screen. Ledger was truly mesmerising. Worthy of an Oscar?... Damn right. Of course there are still dimwits trying to find faults and criticise this movie... maybe just to be different, but this movie is without a doubt one of the most rounded and profound movies of recent times. humour (wanna see a magic trick?), action, twists, clever writing, Nolan showing true class (probably the most consistent director around these days) as well as Christian bale bringing absolute depth to Bruce Wayne. the point i am trying to make is that all good movies have their smart asses trying to pick faults and criticise (for example - the 12 certificate should have been a 15 certificate - kelvin Mackenzie )... because it really made youngsters wanna dress up as a clown and blow ferries up didn't it? why so serious?
10.0~A breathtaking, and exhilarating experience themix03 Sign in Permalink When Christopher Nolan and company delivered the superb origin story of Batman Begins, the shift in tone and ambition from previous superhero comic book adaptations was both riveting, and most welcome, if not curiously overdue. Using that as a springboard, The Dark Knight reaches places that are utterly stunning and overwhelming in the depth and scope they reach. This movie goes far beyond what any previous comic book movie has come close to, creating a haunted and comprehensive study of crime, morality, and tragedy. The story poses numerous moral and philosophical dilemmas for its characters, forcing them to make choices that can have devastating consequences, while also showing the duality that exists between sides of what is moral and immoral, civil order and chaos, truth vs. justice, loyalty to those around you and your own established boundaries, and the gray areas in between. While the vast landscape and powerful narrative that Christopher Nolan and his team have woven is a huge factor, a significant part of the reason the conflicts achieve such a forceful impact is because of the immense power of the performances from a talent heavy cast. Returning as the Caped Crusader/Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale continues to infuse the character with a remarkably conflicted and ultimately tragic quality. Bruce Wayne has troubles that have deep roots within him, constantly disturbed and driven by his past to uphold his strict moral code to deliver justice to Gotham, while trying to maintain a human grip on sanity within him, and for those he is close to. Bale brilliantly conveys this inner turmoil, in a character that is very low-key, reaching depths that his predecessors hardly even hinted at. As the loyal butler to Bruce, Michael Caine delivers another wonderfully composed Alfred, who more or less acts as Bruce's moral conscience, and provides the balance for him as well as the film itself. Morgan Freeman also delivers his reliable class to Luscious Fox, serving as Batman's technical supplier, and even manages to deliver some pertinent commentary on the issue of excessive individual power over a population that strikes a contemporary chord. In a much more central role this time around, Gary Oldman deliver's a quietly stellar performance as the righteous and unyielding Lt. Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal proves to be a welcome upgrade from Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, adding a confident edge and swagger to the character that was not as evident in the previous narrative. Other newcomer Aaron Eckhart delivers what turns out to be a startlingly moving, and forceful performance, very effectively showing the trajectory of the very determined and confident district attorney Harvey Dent, to his tragic fall from grace. Those familiar with the subject matter will be privy to what he sadly becomes. The most central newcomer is the Joker as portrayed by Heath Ledger, in what is a monumentally sadistic, maniacal, and frighteningly unsettling performance. While Jack Nicholson and past performers provided wickedly entertaining interpretations, what the filmmakers and Ledger have crafted here is something remarkable in its viciousness, and sheer nihilistic relentlessness. This Joker has very little that is amusing about him, no matter how amusing he finds everything else. He fully embodies his self proclamation of: "I am an agent of chaos", taking a sort of fascination and amusement at the notion of stripping power away from those that feel they possess it, and breaking down any notion of order that exists in Gotham. The Joker is like a constant moral plague on the law enforcement and Batman, constantly setting up scenarios which force them to make decisions that may violate their ethical codes and have dire consequences. As brilliant as Ledger is and as domineering a character the Joker may be, the fact that everyone within the story hold their own and don't get overshadowed is a testament to how strong the ensemble effort is.. Any overshadowing seems to be coming from sources outside of the film that want one performer/unfortunate story to overshadow everything else. The technical aspects are simply stunning. Christopher Nolan and his technical crew have created a vast and stark Gotham, drenched in a dark and moody atmosphere much like Batman Begins, where the weight of the city is felt in every scene in what is a masterful work of visual composition. The action sequences are electrifying, continuing from the first film in a gritty, near-realistic style that is minimal on CGI and heavy on stunt work with crisp editing, that along with the whole film progress at a relentless pace. The 2 ½ hours fly by, with a constantly imposing tension and sense of peril filling every frame. There isn't really much more one can truly ask from this electrifying, uncompromising and rich experience. The movie goes places that haven't been close to being reached in the genre, and transcends it altogether in a way that is immensely satisfying, and fulfills and I say even exceeds the promise that the first film established and has been built up for until now. This is in my view the richest and greatest comic book/superhero movie ever made.
10.0~Greatest kamikaze008 Sign in Permalink Greatest Super Hero movie of all time. One of the Top crime dramas of all time. Greatest Heath Ledger performance. Heath WILL win the Oscar just like the Golden Globe. Nolan has MADE Batman. If you didn't get a chance to see this in Imax when it was out now is the time with the re-release. This movie is amazing in Imax. The opening scene is entirely in Imax and any time you see a city shot as well. Also the great chase scenes are done in the Imax. This must be up there with most reviewed films of all time but Hey..... It's that good. Seriously if you haven't seen this by now SHAME ON YOU!
10.0~The Best Movie Of 2008 aviakob Sign in Permalink usually I don't give a movie score of 10 so quickly after I see it. But I wanna let you all know that if there was more than 10 in the vote,like 100-I would vote on that. Let me say first that THIS IS the movie of the year.2008. I know that everyone said it's a great movie. But I didn't know I'd love this movie THAT much. "The Dark Knight" is,honestly,the best movie I saw this year. Of course I could feel that it was 2 hours and 30 minutes,but I didn't care. After the 2 hours I wanted more. And I got it. The movie was better than what I expected! And I know that most of the people said that they felt like the movie focused more on the bad guys than Batman, but I again-didn't feel that way. And how it's possibly for me to end this summary without mention the GREAT Joker-Heath Ledger. I've never seen him act so good,so convincing! and Aaron Eckhart too. I saw here lately lots of comments that didn't love the movie. Well,I am so glad I didn't read them before I went to the theatre.All those comments would make me sceptical about it.I can tell you to ignore those comments,cause because of them,you'll miss a wonderful movie. I hope you all will get up from that chair you're sitting on right now-and just run to watch this movie. When there is a work of art like this- it deserves to be valued. I don't really know if this movie deserves to be in 1# place on IMDb top 250 list but I don't think that any movie deserves that. All movies are good in all kind of ways. I hope that you all watch and ENJOY!
1.0~Awful movie with awesome marketing and propaganda alfredkh-chan Sign in Permalink This is a boring film with shallow acting (except those of Ledger and perhaps Caine)and poor story-telling. Throughout the viewing, I wasn't even moved for one moment by those "crisis" created by the Joker and faced by the citizens of Gotham city. The supposedly emotional reactions (which led to the subsequent hostilities and killings) of Havey Dent over the death of Rachel is so unconvincing and superficial that I felt sorry for Eckhart for having to so act as required by the script. I was fooled by IMDb's Top 250 list (currently ranking 8 out of 250 and scoring 9 out of 10 !!). I realize now what the list stand for. Frankly, if the list is not a result of a brilliant commercial engineering, I am quite embarrassed by the view of my fellow users at IMDb.
10.0~This is how comic book movies SHOULD BE MADEEE!!! Prepare to be wowed!!! :D OneRingToRuleThemAll13 Sign in Permalink I saw this completely for the first time since I saw it at the theater 4 years ago (I don't know HOW I COULD'VE LIVED THIS LONG WITHOUT SEEING THIS MASTERPIECEEE!!!!), and I hadn't realized how COMPLETELY AWESOME this film is! I absolutely loved it!! The story follows Batman where we left him at the end of ''Batman Begins'' (released in 2005), trying to still cope with the death of his parents and having to face his most infamous enemy: The Joker. The story here is CENTRAL to the movie and is EVERYWHERE. But it is also very emotional, epic and, sometimes, it even has some deeper, philosophical meaning to it. Even though BB was pretty dark and totally different from past Bat movies, this one goes even DARKERR!!! It makes the villains a lot more realistic that Ra's in BB, which was basically a ninja. Here, The Joker is just an ordinary crazy guy, who (like Alfred quotes at some point in the movie) ''just wants to watch the world burn.'' The acting here is what sells the movie, in my opinion. I mean, Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, and of course Heath Ledger as Joker, all deserve special mentions, as they all deliver AWESOME ROLES! I mean, seriously, The Joker is so scary and disturbing in this, but at the same time we know why he does this, as Nolan delves deeply in both the psychology of Joker and Batman. Ledger delivers the performance of his career in this (R.I.P, Heath! You WILL BE MISSEDD!! :'(), he's absolutely BRILLIANT, as is the rest of the cast (including Bale as Batman, whose only gripe I have with his acting is the stupid voice he makes when he puts on the suit. It's so cartoonish and distracting >_<!), but Ledger definitely steals the show. Special effects and editing are really good here, with the former is even more satisfactorily showcased if you watch the film on Bluray, which makes everything look absolutely GORGEOUS!! Every airborne shot in this is epic. Also, the music is also something which enhances the experience in a truly remarkable way. The main theme here is so awesome and overall the music in this (composed by known composer Hans Zimmer) just makes the movie all the more exciting and emotional when it needs to be. Overall, this movie is a must-see for any Bat-fan, superhero movie or comic book fan out there. The acting, story, music, etc... everything is just so perfectly balanced to create an even better and ''epicker'' (I know I've said the word ''epic'' in pretty much every paragraph in this review, but cut me some slack, I love this movie!! xDDD) film than it's already superb predecessor.
1.0~Everyone...especially you fan boys....calm the f**k down michroba Sign in Permalink I had to give this movie a 1. While I enjoyed the movie, my vote is to balance out the insane ranking of this movie at number six in the top 250. WTF? This film is not the sixth best film of all time. Maybe near the bottom of that list. Christan Bale was a little over the top, and while I think Heath Ledger was great in his role, this movie was a little long. I started looking at my watch after about an hour and 45 minutes. Go ahead, hate on me, but this is my opinion. I think the reason there is so much hype on this film is that Mr. Ledger, may he rest in peace, died before the film came out. Aside from his performance, along with some flashes of brilliance out of Aaron Eckhart, it was a good film. And, from the people calling this the greatest comic book movie ever, I still say go look at Spiderman 2. That is the best comic book/superhero movie of all-time, with Superman 2 a close second.
10.0~amazing !!! mullymainia95 Sign in Permalink Best Film Of The Year I went to see The Dark Knight on its first day of it coming out and for the first time ever i went back to see it again.And I would like to see it again. It was an amazing film from the beginning to the end. Usually in two and a half hours i would get bored of the film but for once i didn't i was entertained all the way through. Filled with action and suspense. The bit i loved the best was Heath Ledger's acting as the Joker. The way he played it was inspiring. Most of the time i would find something bad about the film , and i've tried hard to but i cant its perfect 5/5 Five out of Five Heath Ledger R.I.P
7.0~Good film mihaly_bora Sign in Permalink I've never read any Batman comics, I only saw the films and few episodes from the excellent animated series when I was about 10. Batman '89 is still one of my favorite movies (mainly because of emotional reasons), along with Batman Begins which was a very good movie too. I was really hyped about The Dark Knight and like Batman Begins, it is a very, very good movie, though not the best. Let's start with the cons first. CONS Two and a half hours were a bit long for me, they could have done it in 2 hours and it still would have had this same resonance with the audiences IMO. Two unnecessary story lines: Mr. Reese and Hongkong, especially Hongkong. It was a nice little sequence, but not too important. Batman's voice: Too much, I almost laughed. Scarecrow: the character deserved so much more than what he finally got, I hope he'll be back for the third ride. He was a real threat to Batman in the first movie. Rachel: now I believe it was the character itself all along, not Katie Holmes. She simply didn't work, I'm kinda glad she's out. Music: most of the time it was excellent, but it annoyed the hell out of me in some places. PROS Greatly crafted story, full of twists and turns, though I felt a definite anti-climax during the ending sequences. A wanted a bigger showdown between the Batman and the Joker, I guess the writers wanted to save that for another movie. Christian Bale's Batman: apart from his growling voice, very, very good like in Batman Begins, though I think he should have got more screen time. Aaron Eckhart's Harvey/Two-Face: the real steal of the show, he was bloody brilliant. I hope he'll also be back for the third movie as the main baddie, his Two-Face was very threatening. Heath Ledger's Joker: I won't go into details, but I guess the greatest compliment I could give him is that I hated the Joker, I couldn't stand this psychopath. Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon: He was Gary Oldman. Enough said.:) Brilliant and the character was very well written. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were superb as well, so the cast was top-notch. SUMMARY So, the film was very good, but not great (only in my opinion!!! Fans, don't shoot me!). The Dark Knight is NOT a comic book movie, perhaps that's the reason I'm not as thrilled about it as other people (which DOESN'T mean the film isn't excellent), for me the concept of Batman doesn't really work in the real world as it worked in Burton's fantastic Gotham. But comparisons with Batman '89 are kinda fruitless, the styles are so different, it's impossible for me to decide which is better. Like the Ledger vs. Nicholson debate. Nicholson's Joker worked perfectly in Burton's version as did Ledger's in Nolan's, the two universes could coexist together perfectly. 7 and a half out of 10. I want a third movie right away with Scarecrown and Two-Face (I hope the latter didn't die).:)
10.0~Loved it Ned_977 Sign in Permalink Best Batman movie yet. I think it surpasses every other film, even Batman Begins. My favourite aspect of the Batman franchise is the villains, and they did a brilliant job with both the Joker and Two-Face. Sure Batman Begins had villains, but they were quite minor, and only got like ten minutes of screen time (we had no idea about Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul until like halfway through the film). Heath Ledger (RIP) and Aaron Eckhart topped Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Tommy Lee Jones and everyone else who portrayed said villains. I don't care if their origins aren't true to the comic books, they worked. That's all that matters. If there will be a third movie, I cannot wait. I don't care if villains like the Riddler, the Penguin and Catwoman have already had screen time, they need to have the Nolan treatment. Plus the Riddler hasn't been done justice yet. The 60's TV series doesn't count, and Jim Carrey wasn't much better. I can't see them including Robin or Batgirl anytime soon, but I think Hayden Panettiere or Ellen Page would be good as Batgirl. Just saying maybe. Christopher Nolan, I salute you. I hope you can continue to make more Batman films. Burton and Schumacher only did two films each, but Batman Returns was too dark, and Batman and Robin sucked. This was a very good film, and it had the right tone. So it is possible he may sign on for a third film.
1.0~Are you people paid for rating this non-event a tener? VoiceOfEurope Sign in Permalink This is the biggest ridicule after George W. not being able to spell the word 'nuclear' right. It is simply beyond my understanding how hundreds of thousands of people could have rated this film even worthy of attention. Batman, The Dark Knight is a piece of cake. With capital letters. OK, a huge fat turkey of a movie is not a new kid on the block. But no piece of trash has ever been so over-rated as this one is. I know that Heath Ledger's death came unexpected, and the guy was a solid actor, but you cannot praise something to the skies out of commiseration and loyalty. 'Cause however hard I am trying I am not able to find any other substantial reason why you would give Christopher Nolan's new embarrassment of an action flick six, seven, eight or nine points, let alone ten. This movie is lacking a consequent plot, a cohesion of the myriad of action scenes it has been broken down into and a common sense to know when enough is enough. Besides, I really don't know which film those who said the acting was brilliant had watched, but what I see is that Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhal and Gary Oldman all lack conviction and had the end of the day - and probably the collection of money - in mind when they stood in position in front of the blue screen. Oh, and quite often I really got confused; from time to time I needed to be reminded I was not watching the new James Bond movie or Terminator CXXXVIII (the gadget scene, the plane escape scene are truly pathetic, as is the concept of (re)introducing the character of Two-Face, the guy who did not read the instructions manual of the microwave oven). Since we are talking about a comic book adaptation I don't bother to mention how unrealistic action sequences are (try wiring a town hospital with all that security and CCTV cameras they got installed, or try buying - unnoticed - the oil reserves of a medium sized country to blow half of the city into the sky), but let me ask why nobody out of the immense crew that put this film together could pay attention to small details. Like when police forces storm the Hong Kong building to catch the bat-suit guy: 'Arigato, arigato!'- they wave each other up the stairs. Does this mean China needs to hire law enforcement personnel from Japan? OK, I am stopping there. I know I might already have made some enemies among comic book and action film lovers. This forgettable encounter with Batman however, reminds me again I am not one of them.
10.0~The Best film of 2008! estebangonzalez10 Sign in Permalink Director Christopher Nolan had a very difficult task ahead of him once he decided to make a sequel to his hit Batman Begins in which he had created a new Gotham City much different from the previous franchise. With a great performance from Christian Bale we got to see a new and more realistic Batman and a much more interesting Bruce Wayne. The question everyone was asking was whether or not Nolan could match what he did with the first film in this sequel. Nolan had already created a new Gotham City, but could there possibly be anything new he could add in the Dark Knight that we hadn't seen in the first one? Or would this be one of the many franchise films that are ruined by sequels that should never had been made? These questions are answered right away for us viewers from the opening scene when a bank robbery is taking place and we are introduced to the new character, the Joker. We had seen how great Bale was as Batman and we also had seen the performances from Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman who all gave a new dimension to their characters (and continue to be great). But what sets The Dark Knight apart from Batman Begins and gives it a new and fresh look is the introduction of the villain, the Joker, played by the late Heath Ledger. Ledger gives an inspiring and Oscar worthy performance in his role as the immoral, evil, and violent Joker. One cannot explain or understand crime and violence and that is what Ledger represents as the Joker, an individual who does things for reasons that we cannot comprehend. It is hard to rationalize what is going on in his mind and why he commits all the atrocious crimes in the same way we could never understand the true criminals in our days. Another new character in this film is the highly moral and loyal Harvey Dent played by Aaron Eckhart. He symbolizes everything the Joker does not. He is all about good and fighting crime, he is the voice of reason over emotion. This is where Nolan goes right and gives the franchise a fresh look, focusing on the new characters and giving them greater dimensions than the previous ones we were already introduced too in Batman Begins. This movie franchise is much more than special effects and action, it is about creating interesting and complex characters and underlying a message of the struggle between good and evil in our society. I have to admit that along with Iron Man these two are the best superhero movies ever made. The sequel is not only as good as Batman Begins but in my opinion superior thanks in most part to Heath Ledger who added an entire new dimension to a well known character as the Joker. This film is not about Batman, its about the Joker and the struggle between finding the evil in everyone or finding the good. Heath Ledger is this movie as much as Robert Downey Jr. was the movie in Iron Man. My favorite film of the year which in my opinion is much more than entertaining, it is complete.
10.0~Simply the best of all time... bazthegreatone Sign in Permalink Im a huge fan of the Batman franchise and was delighted when Christopher Nolan and David Goyer brought it back to life with the fantastic 'Batman Begins' in 2005 after Joel Schumacher's mediocre 'Batman and Robin' in 1997. It was a fantastic movie with a great cast, a great storyline, great fight sequences... Everything about the movie was excellent. I would never have predicted the sequel would have topped it (most sequels never match up to the original movie) but The Dark Knight beats it hands down and in my opinion is easily one of the best movies ever made, and is the best comic book adaption of all time by considerable distance! We get the same great cast plus more, an even more action packed and gripping storyline and we get sensational performances from Christian Bale as Batman and the late, great Heath Ledger as The Joker. Nolan himself said he didn't see The Dark Knight as a superhero movie but called it a crime saga similar to Michael Mann's Heat, and he is spot on. It's the story of the battle for control of Gotham City, pitting Batman and his allies Lt. Gordon and DA Harvey Dent against the mafia and the insane terrorist The Joker. The storyline is gripping with lots of plot twists and you get caught up in the plight of every character instead of focusing on one simplistic story. It has incredible special effects and is not crammed with CGI which gives the film fantastic realism and makes 'Batman and Robin' looks 100 times worse after watching The Dark Knight. I recommend that if you haven't seen it yet, do so as soon as possible because it is the total package and appeals to all people, not just Batman fans. I hope Nolan and Goyer return for the third installment because the two previous films would not have been possible without their fantastic story telling skills. And Heath Ledger may be dead but his spirit lives on, and its a shame that he didn't get to see his finest work in full and get the recognition he richly deserves. A simply incredible movie.
7.0~Very very overrated for me, but maybe will do it for you Azl2ael Sign in Permalink People are all entitled to their own opinions. But for me this movie was very very overrated and so far I seem to be the few minority. I watched it and kept expecting to see the 9.7/10 rating movie that people have raved about and it just never came. The movie did not feel that special to me. It was like all the other comic book movies out there, maybe more polished but it still felt like nothing more then big budget Hollywood manufactured flash. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie very much and found it highly entertaining. It is hands down my favorite comic book movie but a masterpiece of cinema?????? Sorry not for me at least. Maybe my expectations were too high.
10.0~If only more movies can live up to the hype like this ksagendo-1 Sign in Permalink I finally had the chance to see TDK yesterday and it was well worth the wait and the price of admission. If only there were more movies like this that live up to the hype. This and "Batman Begins" far exceed the other Batman movies that have been made. It's very unfortunate to think what could've been for Heath Ledger after this performance, he was just brilliant. Christian Bale has cemented his legacy as Batman, Gary Oldman is great as Commissioner Gordon, and I thought I'd never say this but Eric Roberts and Anthony Michael Hall did well in their roles. Is the door open for Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Two Face to continue? I hope Christopher Nolan has at least one more installment for us.
10.0~Certainly Dark - Worth The Wait Mush_Man29 Sign in Permalink I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses. It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy. All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing. If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid. There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience. I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well. All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given. If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart. Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!
1.0~God, this movie is boring. avrook-1 Sign in Permalink After first 30 minutes I was about to get out of the theater but I gave it a chance, I left after 60 minutes.. Great cast, most boring plot, I know that probably it has great CG overload effects at the end and all the good guys win. I don't understand the actual rating for the movie, I expect it to fall drastically in the next few days. I suspect manipulation in here and it is a sad thing to see when the business takes over and the honest rating for the movie does not matter anymore. Great, I want 60 minutes of my life back and the money for my ticket. Don't spend money on that dirt. avrook
9.0~The best film of this year so far and the best batman film! salfordcollegegary Sign in Permalink Majority of people who criticise this movie say that either it is too long or isn't good enough. Well here is my review, see this film simple as that as for a long time it has characters that I actually believe, now I know that people may say that should not be the case in batman. Well batman has always been the most realistic hero as he is a character, who anyone in the audience who become if they had the inclination and the training. Heath Ledger as the Joker was superb, he had 4 classic scenes, which will live long in my memory for example the first time he appears in the gang meeting seems to be so taut and unpredictable that in my showing people laughed at the "magic trick" My favourite sequence is the jail scene joker owns those sequences for example the conversation between him and the police officer is so spell-binding and interesting that my focus was on this scene for the rest of the film. Now this is not a one man show by no means. Gary Oldman shows why he is one of the best character actors out there today. He is subtle and seems like a man unsure of the force he is facing and feels that the batman is the only one who understands the joker, Christian bale is really good as batman and bruce wayne especiually the part in hong kong plus on a side note has anyone noticed that they not have a batcave that they can sell to kids? Is it too long no, because in that argument is pirates of the Caribbean too long? is godfather too long? no because they are the perfect length to tell their stories. Dark Knight told its story people may disagree but as I will always say its my opinion. Is it a perfect movie no but its a perfect crime drama and the best comic movie.
10.0~The Darkest Knight johnnyfive Sign in Permalink Batman Begins was a highly enjoyable film and the first to be truly close to its origins. Tim Burton's films were good but the Bat seemed somewhat inanimate, cold and lonely (despite Alfred and billions of dollars). Killing off a major Bat-villain is always sacrilege in my eyes and the only thing that Schumacker did right with his two duds was to incarcerate the villains in Arkham instead of killing them off. you should at least leave a plausible chance of their return. Back to the 21st century and Begins did what all have failed before. Gotham is completely believable as a real city and not the hyper-exaggerated version of the 90s versions. The characters are a lot more convincing and more like their literate counterparts and perfectly ended with ongoing storyline of all the characters and the tasty teaser of The Joker. With the exception of the different Rachel this "sequel" goes for continuity in spades. Gordon recently promoted (All knowing that he ends up as commissioner and excellently played by Oldman)still keeping his head above water with the corruption around him. Harvey Dent rising to his expected post as DA after the previous one was murdered and his eventual fall from grace after being disfigured (differently from the written version). The only gripe with continuation in this flick is the sudden disappearance of the whole rail system from the original. The Dark Knight is brilliantly acted, expertly written (more of that in a mo)and properly styled. The good thing about the script is that everything that happens, all that is said is there for a reason, never (despite the long running time)does it feel like padding. Take the obvious, Dent saying "you either die a hero or live long enough to become the bad guy" which resurfaces towards the end, or the two scar stories from the Joker that ends with Batman throwing a punchline regarding the aforementioned scars. As for Dents final scene, like I said you should never kill off a major villain ( Big no-no in my opinion) but as Maroni said "one professional to another if your gonna scare someone try a different height, from here the fall won't kill me" (please forgive possible misquotes) Two-face didn't fall that far and technically Dent is dead, I want to believe Two-face ain't. (and much Kudos for Eckhart, simply brilliant). Despite really just being the glue that holds the film together, Ledger's undeniably brilliant (and spot on) performance of the Joker cannot be unmentioned in any review, terrifying with a very dark sense of humour (Watch as the Bank robbery at the start plays out like a joke.... albeit with a very funny but subtle punchline... Not to mention his "magic trick" which was worth the admission (or six) alone. As good as Bale was, it seemed like he needed an inhaler at certain points in the movie (understandably he would be knackered doing what he did anyway) but at a certain scene towards the end, he just seemed to have got over it in just a change of camera view. As for Oscar nominations, this is considered an ensemble movie where there is a big cast and all are good performances meaning that the stars are overlooked for other roles in other films. I do firmly believe in all honesty that Ledger deserves a posthumous nomination but as predictable as the Academy is, he will probably be awarded some sort of achievement award or something. I also believe that Gary Oldman deserves equal recognition improving on his role from Begins. The only thing (other than Begins) that comes close is the fan-made "Batman; Dead End" (see youtube). AS FOR THOSE THAT REFUSE TO WATCH IT BECAUSE IT IS A "BATMAN" MOVIE OR A "SUPERHERO" MOVIE.... SHAME ON YOU, LOOK PAST THAT STIGMA AND ENJOY WHAT IS Easily THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR AND ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER (SEE IMDb TOP 250 FOR EVIDENCE).
10.0~The Dark Knight is the best film of 2008 and creates one of the greatest Villains in Cinema History Dmagic5000 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is dark. The Dark Knight is violent. The Dark Knight is scary. Yet The Dark Knight is simply in one word Sensational. Batman raises the stakes in his war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets. The partnership proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of Gotham as The Joker. The mood in The Dark Knight is absolutely perfect. Batman is supposed to be Dark. Christopher Nolan has finally done the perfect Batman and gotten the mood right. The 1965 Batman was good campy fun but far off of what Batman should be. Tim Burton's 1989 Batman almost had it but was still a bit campy. Finally Nolan creates the perfect one. Not only is it a good comic book movie, Nolan creates a great crime epic that rates up there with the crime masterpieces. The action sequences in The Dark Knight are stunning and exhilarating. The scene where Batman is going after The Joker and saving Harvey Dent is simply amazing. Nolan uses little CGi and focuses on simple stunts and it works! The action sequences keep you on the edge of your seat and excites you and takes your breath! The Performances were great from everyone in the cast. Christian Bale gives a solid performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman. I Actually don't mind Batman's voice. Bale is the best Bruce Wayne the Franchise has had and i thin the Best Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a good performance as Rachel. She isn't amazing but she is an improvement over Katie Holmes. Aaron Eckhart gives a great performance as Harvey Dent/Two face. Gary Oldman gives a awesome performance as Commissioner Gordon. I find Oldman is often dismissed and forgotten. He gives i think the second best performance of the film. Of course the main talk surrounding the film is Heath Ledger. Let me tell you. The only positive thing about Ledger's death is that his last film will forever mark his greatest performance as an actor. Ledger creates the greatest screen villain ever. If the main Villain from A Clockworth Orange can win an Oscar for Acting. Ledger will definitely win for his portrayal of The Joker. A lot of people think that if Ledger was still alive then people wouldn't be making such a big deal over it. In my humble opinion. If Ledger was still alive today. He would still be getting praise from everyone and would still be surrounded by Oscar Buzz. The Joker, and Ledger's Portrayal of him will forever go down in history as one of the greatest performances ever. In the end, The Dark Knight is simply amazing. It's Dark, Violent but still amazes the audience. It should and hopefully get a nomination for Best Picture and will go down as the best comic book movie ever made. The Dark Knight rates at an outstanding 10/10 and is the Best Movie of 2008.
6.0~A Disappointing Continuation warren-1976 Sign in Permalink Where did it all go wrong? Unfortunately all the hype turned out to be exactly that. Just hype. This is a mediocre and highly repetitive film, perhaps marginally better than average action movie. It certainly is a major improvement over the recent mess that was The Hulk, but that's not saying much. Then again, even The Hulk managed a little better in the character department for its first third, before devolving into mindless dross. They seem to have forgotten the things that made the first of the new Christian Bale Batman movies a success (In more than just box office). Dark Knight is a bloated misshapen mess of a film, with little coherent structure. From it's rather lacklustre opening to it's weak finale, we are just treated to a variety of scenes that just seem to have been lumped together. At 152 minutes, someone needed to seriously take the editing scissors to the negative. Then again, if the fat had been trimmed from this film, there wouldn't be much left. The first film worked, because we had different locations, an interesting back story, and some genuine character moments, that all came together to make the 'action' parts enjoyable. Because they had a reason for being, and we became invested in what happened to the characters. Dark Knight is simply a collection of action scenes, and 'Joker' scenes for the sake of it. Heath Ledger is serviceable as the Joker, but it's by no means an Oscar worthy performance. Jack Nicholson at least had a certain level of theatricality to make the character work, in Burton's Batman. Though in Heath Ledger's defence, he had very little to work with, character-wise. I think he did the best he could with it, despite lots of pointless 'Joker-giggling' and 'oh, look, I'm insane' expressions. There are virtually no meaningful character moments in the film, no real structure to the story, and so there is no emotional involvement in the action. The fight scenes seemed to lack any genuine sense of threat or risk, because it never felt like Batman was ever in danger. In the previous film, he was fighting people of equal training and skill, so you felt he was having to struggle to defeat his enemy. In Dark Knight, he's simply going through the motions. And any genuine threat in the violence is shied away from. Don't believe the other reviews. There's plenty of 'action' in this film, but not a lot of 'violence' as such. Which isn't always a good thing. It may keep it child-friendly (in a way) for the most part, but leaves us with no real sense of consequence or risk. In terms of setting, this time around they decided to film mostly on real city locations. The idea being, that this will make the atmosphere more realistic. Unfortunately this works against it. The ever so slight fantasy feel of Gotham in the first film, helps us as the viewer, to dwell in their reality and accept the fantastical parts. By bringing this new film more into the world of everyday reality, the more outlandish elements become less believable than they might have otherwise been, thereby resulting in a detachment from events, rather than drawing us in. Morgan Freeman is poorly used, with little to get his teeth into. While perhaps he did not have a large part in the previous film either, he was at least imbued with some sense of personality and a genuine feeling of necessity to the plot. Michael Caine fairs a little better, and is one of the few characters to maintain a reasonable level of personality and purpose, that is on a par with his character in Batman Begins. As for the Harvey Dent character, Aaron Eckhart is simply adequate, but apart from his general role as the District Attorney, his evolution into the 'Two Face' villain feels utterly superfluous and tacked-on for the sake of cramming in another temporary antagonist. Though admittedly, he has stunningly well executed CGI enhanced make-up. (unfortunately the un-shrivelled eye ruins the effect, since it simply would not have likely survived the wounds, and even if it had, would dry up and wither, without its surrounding tissue, eyelids and moisture.) He is supposed to be some sort of example about how evil can change and affect even the best of people, but it all feels clumsily executed and poorly resolved. So what's good? Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes, brings her character some much needed depth. She's a more mature actress, both in style and looks, than Katie Holmes was (As the same character in the previous film). She also has a rather sad and tired appearance, which keeps her from looking like the typical overly-pretty female love-interest. She felt like a character that you could imagine he had grown up with and loved for herself, rather than simply an attractive face. To be honest, that's about the best that can be said, in comparison to the previous film. And in it's own right, it is a movie that can best be described as an enjoyable distraction, with virtually nothing to remember once you walk out. Sadly, this is very much another forgettable summer blockbuster. What makes it so disappointing is not that it is actually that bad, but simply that it should have been so much better, and certainly does not live up to the hype.
2.0~Uuh...Do You Want Me To Be Honest? WakenPayne Sign in Permalink Batman raises the stakes in his war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets. The partnership proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of Gotham as The Joker. We Can All Argue About The Quality Of This Movie Until The Cows Come Home But This Is What I Saw. I Saw An Extreme Amount Of Violence In A KIDS MOVIE (Its Like Making Dora The Explorer Into Punisher War Zone) And As Far As Flaws Go This Was Jam Packed. There Is This Nerdy Guy On TV Who Claims He Knows Who Batman Really Is Yet It Goes Nowhere...It Doesn't Take An Idiot To Figure Out That It Would Take A Millionaire To Afford That Crap. The Cell Phone Gag Was Idiotic. They Actually Could See Everything Including People Who Weren't On Cell Phones & When They're Trying To Find The Joker They Need To Wait Until He Speaks. Another Flaw That Is Pretty Obvious Is That A Gunshot Does Nothing To The Bat Suit Yet...A Dog Can Harm The Wearer. When The Bombs Are About To Be Activated The Sailor Only Just Finds Out The Thousands Of Gallons Of Flammable Liquid In The Engine Room At That Point. I Could Go On And On About This But What Really Pisses Me Off Is Its Place In The Top 250...So What Everyone Is Saying Is That Its Better Than "Psycho", Better Than "The Seven Samurai", Better Than "Alien", Better Than "Seventh Seal", Better Than "Amadeus", Better Than "The Matrix", Better Than "The Terminator". The List Goes On So Much That I Could Be Here Reviewing This Film For Days. As Far As Acting Goes Heath Ledger Is The ONLY Performance That Is Descent. Christian Bale As Batman Is Hard To Understand To Me What I Heard Is "Ruta Ruba Runa Roo!" This Might Sound Weird When You Say This Review To Yourself But Say It In The Batman Voice & You'll Find Similarities In Both Forms Of Dialogue. Hell This Isn't Even The Best Movie Of 2008. "Iron Man", "The Incredible Hulk", "Let The Right One In" & "Hellboy 2" Are The Best Because They Had...You Know...Thought Put Into It. I Realise This Review Might Get Slagged To Death Because I Insulted Everyone's Favourite Movie (Apparrantly) But In Every Decade There Is An Overrated Director. In The 70's It Was Copolla, In The 80's Its Spieldberg, In The 90's Tarantino & In The '00's Its Nolan. Overall I Think I Have Made An Okay Argument But I Also Expect Fans To Beat The Living Crap Out Of This Review Because "Its Nolan" & "Heath Ledger Died In Shooting" I Can Honestly Say That Not Every Movie That Has Had An Actor Died While Shooting Is A Good Movie...Take "Plan 9 From Outer Space" Bela Lugossi Died While Making That & Thats The Same With This (I AM NOT COMPARING MOVIES!!! I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!!!) Heath Ledger Died But Now They Treat This Movie & His Performance Like The Second Coming. What Happened To Him Was Tragic But It Doesn't Mean That His Performance Is Legendary. The Only Time When A Good Movie Has Come Off The Death Of An Actor Is "The Crow". Rating: 1/10
10.0~Best Movie I Have Seen In Years pdiaz-5 Sign in Permalink I was fairly apprehensive about The Darks Knight going in. Most sequels do not hold up to their predecessors. Batman Begins was a well-done, fresh start to a series that had become campy at best. Let's face it, the last few Batman movies before Batman Begins were plain horrible. Typically, when you have the media jump on a movie for what could be a sentimental or popular angle such as Heath Ledger's death, the movie ends up as a disappointment. This one does not. The plot and underlying themes of this movie are extremely deep. This is one of those rare movies that you can sit for hours analyzing with friends as if you had just read a classic novel full of symbolism and meaning for the time it was written. This movie speaks to the human condition in ways that you would never expect from a movie based on a comic book. It does not take long to completely forget that you are watching a comic book movie, and just find yourself immersed in the moral and emotional conflicts of the characters. I do not want to give much away - so will not go much further except to say, this movie is by far the best, deepest, and most entertaining film of the year - and possibly in many years. One last note - for those who think that the press on Ledger's performance is over the top, guess again. He gives one of the great all time movie villain performances. This performance makes the "No Country" villain look like a Teddy Bear. You go in wondering how you will feel watching a deceased actor on the screen, but immediately forget about the actor and see only the character. This is not any kind of a disrespectful notion - this was the performance of a lifetime.
10.0~VG Film Noocies Sign in Permalink I thought this movie was extremely well done. Heath Ledger was astounding as the Joker. One of the Best Batman films so far. It was smart to include Two-Face to the plot. The fact that the White Knight of Gothem turned against good after his love died was genius on behalf of the Joker. I also thought that Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman were very good in the movie too. I also really liked the Joker's stories of how he got his scars and found them very chilling and the way the Joker licked his lips in a very intense way was amazingly done by Heath Ledger (R.I.P). I thought the conclusion statement made by Gordon (Gary Oldman) was the perfect way to end the film. In a nutshell I thought this movie was well done, intense and extremely enjoyable. Great movie over all. Enjoyed thoroughly! On the edge of my seat the entire time.
10.0~The dark knight, not Batman: The Dark Knight denizlengde Sign in Permalink First of all we all must admit that this is the best movie in 2008 so far. The Joker is great, the cast is great, the shooting is great. But this is not a batman movie. A batman movie is a movie that the main character is the batman, not the villain. A batman movie is a movie that takes place in the Gothic Gotham City, not in Chicago. And a Batman movie is a movie that says the name 'batman' in its title. In this movie batman is not the main character, its just 'one of' the characters. But this does not mean that its a bad or average movie. It's actually one of the best movies in its kind. I don't say its an action movie because it gives messages which are really logical. But like every movie it has some mistakes. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good actress but she is not very suitable for the Rachel part. She sort of looked numb at some parts and she really couldn't play batman's girlfriend. Also the movie was very long. 254 minutes is a lot and you might get bored at some parts. I would like to finish with just four words: ten out of ten.
10.0~Fire in the Knight adrongardner Sign in Permalink Gotham city has seen better days. The Joker's terror campaign has both the public, and even its criminals living in fear. One day, Alfred relates a story of his early days in Burma, to a ponderous Bruce Wane. He tells Mr. Wayne how he and his men began to hunt a jewel thief who was on a killing rampage in the jungle. A man who actually threw the jewels he stole away, because this was just a man "who wanted to watch the world burn." Bruce asks Alfred how did they catch him? "We burnt the jungle down." The opening images of Batman announces this theme of fire, with the Bat signal simmering among blue flames. Gotham has indeed seen better days. And the opening of the film announces, better days are not coming soon. As the joker announces, "people will die tonight, I'm a man of my worrrrd." Oh yes, the jungle is going to burn down, by one hand or the next. In the Dark Knight Christopher Nolan clearly strove to do justice to the Batman character and the world he inhabits to degrees and depths of character rarely seen before in a "comic book" movie. He has delivered a true epic. Though he still hasn't a clue how to film fight scenes and also dances a fine line of too much story and too many characters. There was obviously more than enough material here for two movies. However, I am very happy things worked out as they did. The movie is a triumph of vision both in the new realization of the joker, and in the practical manifestation of the Two-Face character. Aaron Eckhart is sufficiently pretty and viscous as Harvey Dent. Heath Ledger is hilariously creepy, yet I feel both probably deserved a little more screen time. Again, Nolan was juggling a high wire act with all these characters and themes, but yes again, I feel he was almost without fault in doing so. Both of these characters will be remembered. With the Joker, Jack Nicholson's turn in 1989s Batman was menacing and funny. A bravura performance for sure. But I think there was a touch of nostalgia, and tongue in cheek humor in how he played the role to keep him from being frightening. Heath Ledger, on the other hand has succeeded in bringing a more truthful version of the Joker's homicidal rage from the comic to the screen. Ledger's Joker is funny, but not "haha" funny. There are no hand buzzers or whoopie cushions here. He's really something to behold on screen and I feel both Batman movies' portrayals can live side by side in their interpretations for some time to come. Famously modeled in some way after Michael Mann's "Heat," with Gotham city as the protagonist, the Dark Knight is a chase film of double crosses and revenge killings. It widens the narrative scope of the Batman Begins story-line and confronts the realities of one man's mission and principals to make right, what was once very wrong. This is a film, a true epic film, that engages Batman in a grand struggle against evil, some of which is his own making. Much like in Nolan's "The Prestige," the idea of "getting your hands dirty" reminds us of the type of world that created Batman in the first place; a dark world of shadows and shades of gray. The Dark Knight is a poem of nobility and justice; a story about the futility and illusions of control. This is a story of the struggle between two sides of the same coin. One man who wants to burn the jungle down and another who will burn the jungle down to stop him. In the concluding soliloquy Batman says, "people deserve something better than the truth." I couldn't agree more. America too has seen better days and this Batman is wondrous pure fiction at the right time. It's a venture down the obscured paths of humanity about a Knight among the darkness. You bet this is better than the truth. This stuff is why we go to the movies in the first place.
9.0~Now that I have seen this film several times... DrWillHatch Sign in Permalink I can finally put the film in its proper context. When I first saw the movie, I went into it absorbing all the hype about how mind blowingly amazing it was and how it was an instant classic if not THE best film ever made. So I viewed the film in an intellectual frame of mind...and I loved it, but with some reservations. Firstly, I admired Bales performance much more then Heath Ledgers, who practically everyone said and continues to say stole the show. I thought he was an exceptional villain, but since he was a completely remorseless maniac, with even Ledger himself calling him a "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy", I didn't know what to make of it. For a film that was going for "realism"(as real as you can get with entirely foreign geographical locations like Gotham City and scientifically implausible devices and applications), having a brilliant, insane super criminal who somehow has limitless access to henchman and supplies, and can rig hospitals and ferry boats with explosives even when there is manhunt out for him right in the middle of a major metropolitan city seemed a little far-fetched. Didn't it? To buy in to the story, you have to accept that the various crime bosses and crooked business men have almost total control over Gotham. Of course corruption exists, look around you, but I just find it hard to believe that all the corrupt civil servants and mob members would have the ability to manipulate the entire city for the Jokers benefit. Anyway, what I really admired about the film was Batman himself. I see Batman as the ubermensch, I think he is human potential at its very peak, and I think Christian Bale did an outstanding job at it. He has emotions and deep feelings of love and compassion for people he cares about and the citizens of Gotham themselves. He is deeply touched that his Batman persona is actually making an impact in peoples lives, lamenting on crude vigilantes, yes, but relieved that he may one day retire from being Batman because of the new DA, Harvey Dent, who has been christened "The White Knight" of Gotham. He may get to relax and maybe spend time with his longtime crush, Rachael Dawes, but then the Joker enters the picture. Watching Batman become increasingly desperate to apprehend the Joker, whether through outright physical abuse, or abuse of technology(some sort of device to monitor peoples cell phones throughout the entire city simultaneously), it is actually a little disturbing to watch Batman become unhinged. What I also liked about Batman was something Henri Ducard told him in "Batman Begins": "If you commit yourself to an ideal, you can become more than a man...a legend." Batman has completely omitted himself to his code of ethics and morals, and built himself up to be the greatest human alive, look at how he easily evades the attack dogs late in the film. I think that any benefit we can get from superhero stories is how the hero can teach readers or viewers to reflect on these morals and apply them in real life, who doesn't want to be Batman? The Dark Knight makes me appreciate Batman Begins much more then I had previously, the former accentuates the good qualities of the latter and gives it focus, a sense that it is one part in a longer struggle. The supporting cast are all excellent. Aaron Eckhart played Harvey Dent, the third lead in the movie. While I thought the hospital room scene wasn't totally believable, I was honestly moved by Dent slowly moving into insanity because of the Jokers actions. Not when he laments about how his girlfriend was taken from him, but during subtler moments, like when he was talking to Jim Gordon in the hospital, you can see he is gone off the deep end. Or before that when he is going to kill an insane henchman of the Jokers, flipping a coin to decide his fate, I thought that was the most disturbing moment in the movie. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and every other actor actor involved are handle themselves greatly, there isn't a weak actor in the cast. Finally, after watching the film several times more, I finally see the greatness in the Joker. I have never seen Mr Ledger in another film before, so I couldn't appreciate how deeply he sunk himself into the role. The physical transformation is astounding, and he does play an insane mastermind to the absolute T, even if he doesn't seem right in a "realistic" world frame. He is charismatic and will certainly be remembered, and I see him as a Mephistopheles type character. Batman has always been a mythical story at heart, so why not embrace it? Congrats on your amazing performance Heath, you played pure evil and insanity in a great way, and I hope you somehow know how many fans you have down on Earth. I also give my heartfelt praise to the director, screenwriters(director Chris Nolan and his brother), cinematographer and everyone else involved. The movie has great dialog, a great and consistent plot, is a wonder for the eyes and is just fantastic all around as it explores different themes like pure evil, morality, order, human nature and more. It is not the best film I have ever seen, but it is a very respectable effort. PS I would also like to compliament the action scenes and sick humor used by the Joker. The Dark Knight also works perfectly well as a straight action picture for those without minds(just kidding). It is just as exciting as the best action movie ever, Die Hard and the Jokers dialog, while twisted by his evilness, is also very funny
6.0~Very disappointed mike-devitt Sign in Permalink The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding.
10.0~"The Joker" mesparza-1 Sign in Permalink You know all that hype about the Dark Knight? It's all WRONG. I saw the movie tonight, and I assure you- It's SO MUCH BETTER than you've heard.. Anyone who thinks Heath Ledger will be remembered for Brokeback is dead wrong, he is now, and will henceforth be, The Joker. His Joker makes Jack (don't get me wrong, <3 Jack to death) look like a catholic schoolboy in comparison. Every scene he is in is stolen, even from other fantastic actors like Christian Bale and Gary Oldman. This year's race for the "Best Supporting Actor" is over. I don't think it's possible for someone to beat Heath, and if they do, that just shows what a good actor they will be. 10/10 Best Movie this year so far, Best Batman Movie ever, Best Comic/Hero Movie ever.
10.0~Oh My God! DivineMrsM Sign in Permalink I've just been to see a preview screening of 'The Dark Knight'. Now, I'm no film reviewer/critic/whatever, but this film blew me away. Blah, blah, blah on all the performances, they were brilliant! Heath Ledger is a truly psychotic Joker! As one of his final performances, he will be remembered as a villain who thrived on kaos and mayhem. Maggie Gyllenhall, Christain Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Erkhart all gave such Oomph to their roles. Technically, the movie was fantastic. With all the explosions you expect and the body count wasn't too high. May be a little too much for children under 13 to grasp. Go see it. Go on! Buy your tickets now!
5.0~Overrated? Yes. A Good Film? No out_of_town Sign in Permalink I Simply have to give this movie some marks for its incredible special effects, i loved them, Now if they where in a good movie! Now there would be something worth watching I Can name at least 5 movies i have seen in the past two weeks so far that are better than this, in fact i think i will; Transformers Step Brothers Blue Harvest (although not entirely a movie but you get the idea) Benders Big Game Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Almost all of these movies are no where near in my top 10 favourite movies, but yet i would rather watch anyone 100 times than watch this piece of rubbish again. I Had such high expectations for this film and everyone was talking about it, but wow did it suck, If it wasn't for the late Heath Ledgers amazing acting i would probably have cried nearing the end of this movie. Thankyou for your time xox
10.0~Where do I begin? lucasaq-1 Sign in Permalink Where do I begin? The film was hyped ever since reviews started filtering out about Heath Ledger's final performance. The film, as well as his performance, has been lauded. I was slightly skeptical, but still highly anticipating film and my expectations were very high. Well they were met and exceeded. I have to agree with those reviews comparing it to The Empire Strikes Back. It is that equivalent to the superhero genre. The overtones are darker than Batman Begins, which was a great stepping-stone for this incredible and epic storytelling of two masterful nemeses for Batman, The Joker and Two-Face. However, the film did not get lost in the dark and still holds a great sense of humor to alleviate much of the pain of the film. To begin with, Batman is having troubles carrying over from the first film. The narrows was lost and he is still trying to collect the criminals who escaped including Scarecrow / Jonathan Crane in small cameo appearance, which really was only weak point of the film. For a villain given so much story time in the first film, it felt disappointing to see him carelessly tossed aside here as he was at the end of Begins. I digress on that, matter though as it is overall a minor disappointment. As he is finishing business with Scarecrow it also shown, that Batman has inspired others to follow him in his "vigilante" activities. He is not pleased at this. It is not what he intended when he donned the mask. However, the vigilantes inspired by him are not the real beef. The Joker and first the mob is the first beef. Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon are cracking down on the mob hard forcing them to launder their money to one man. Pounding them into a corner, this proves most deadly for a city already having major problems. Into this deadly net waltz the ultimate in chaos theory. The Joker, a mad hatter and the anti-thesis of Batman, who not only follows not rules, but also has no qualms about doing what Batman will not, kill and kill without remorse. He is a mad man and sadistic and still one the enigma he is from the comics, something that Jack Nicholson had ruined for him back in 1989. Unlike him, Heath Ledger is aloud to play the role savagely and therefore, cannot be compared to Nicholson's lighter Joker. He is unto a class all his own in the Batman universe. Anarchy and madness that is what Ledger plays Joker as and deftly too, as advertised a complete screwball whose actions have no rhythm and no bounds. He is the showman of the film, but overblown. Still one cannot help but laugh with him as the film goes up to the point when he kills. While Joker plays the villain of the film, the film offers three main lead heroes whom through the course of the film are tested to their limits by the Joker bound by none. There is the incorruptible Batman, the stalwart James Gordon, and the newcomer District Attorney Harvey Dent. All played just as well as Ledger's Joker making the film are a fantastic film to watch as the four men butt heads. Individually they do it with the Joker as well as together. It is the heart and soul of the film. The three heroes most especially Harvey Dent represent the goodness of Gotham. That is something that is tried to the edge by the Joker. It is through the performances of Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart that the film flourishes dramatically. Extraneously on the side, there is the love triangle between Bruce Wayne, Rachel Dawes, and Harvey Dent, but only alongside the main one of the heart of the city and the triangle of Batman, Gordon, and Dent. Above all Gotham is what must survive and that is what Joker makes at stake as much as Ra's al Ghul did in Begins. Therefore, the love story takes a back seat, but it is not overlooked in the 2 hours and 40 minutes that the film runs. It covers a lot of ground with lots of twists and turns and it does not miss a beat and way to tie up a loose end, save for Cillian Murphy's ever suffering Scarecrow. The technical makeup of the film is equally as stunning as the film story and makes it astounding strong in all respects. Add to that the perfect melding of countless comics and portrayals in the performances here and the film falls into place as the pinnacle the Batman film series has to offer to date.
10.0~Hyperbole aside, this is still a brilliant crime thriller and the best "comic book movie" I've ever seen. The entire cast is phenomenal and Heath Ledger is a revelation. MovieAddict2016 Sign in Permalink "Batman Begins" was a critical success and audiences loved it, but -- probably due to the declining quality of the films before it -- not many people turned out to see it during its theatrical run. It was also one of the first of many "franchise reboots" -- yet wasn't clearly advertised as such, and it took time for people to realize that, as a film, it stood on its own from the Burton/Schumacher pictures. It was a modest success (with less than $400 million worldwide) but its real legacy was solidified on DVD, where it became a best-seller and one of the defining titles of the Hi-Definition DVD war. Positive word of mouth slowly but surely turned it into a blockbuster -- the exact opposite of, say, "Spider-Man 3," which opened huge but performed poorly on home video. Warner Bros. had a keen eye on the progress of the film, and obviously they had a lot of faith in director Christopher Nolan and the areas he could take the sequel. Whereas "Batman Begins" was a so-called "origins story" and therefore had to sacrifice a few action sequences in favor of character progression, "The Dark Knight" showcases a more organic blend -- there's plenty of action here but there's also just as much character development, which -- at least for me -- made it somewhat more satisfying. I really liked "Batman Begins," but "The Dark Knight" makes it look like child's play. Everybody was excited about The Joker, of course. And Heath Ledger is phenomenal. I remember when he was first announced for the role in 2007 and the Internet community was, to say the least, quite baffled. I was one of the few who seemed to have an understanding of what Nolan was aiming for, but some fans despised the casting decision. It wasn't until the first theatrical trailer that a palpable shift in mood could be detected -- suddenly all the doubters realized just how dark Ledger was taking it. And shortly thereafter, of course, Ledger died tragically of an accidental prescription drug overdose -- I still remember reading the news that day in January and thinking, "What?!" I don't think anyone ever expected it. And although in retrospect it was a rather selfish thought, one of my first questions was: "How will this affect 'The Dark Knight'?" Thankfully, Ledger had completed filming on the movie and his last performance is a real tour-de-force. Many people have a nostalgic affinity for Jack Nicholson's Joker, but honestly, I've always found it to be Jack playing Jack more than anything. Yes, it's a fun performance, but not nearly as terrifying or convincing as Ledger's, whose Joker isn't just funny or just dark - he's a twisted psychopath. You find yourself laughing at the most horrific aspects of his behavior, but often times -- such as after the brilliant hospital scene -- you can hear people's laughter in the theater gradually fade as they realize *what* they're laughing at, and how disturbing it is. And that's really the key to the character, and something even Nicholson didn't land on: the horror behind the laughter. Everything about his performance - the verbal and facial tics, the little details - causes you to believe this psychopath is real. Nolan's remark about Ledger being "like the shark in JAWS" is dead-on -- he isn't a consistent character in this film, but he'll suddenly appear out of nowhere (in sync with James Newton Howard's and Hans Zimmer's schizoid "Why So Serious?" theme) and tear through the movie's core. This is one of *the* performances of the decade, and the only bad thing about Ledger's role in the film is that it's so good it almost causes you to overlook how good everyone else is. Aaron Eckhart is wonderful as Harvey Dent, and is arguably the most "human" of all the characters in the movie. I found Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne to be surprisingly downplayed in this film, but Eckhart is the one whose character has the most dramatic arc in this movie. It's a testament to Eckhart's skills that he makes Harvey both realistic and tragic -- you believe this guy is real, even though his emotional and physical transformation takes place over the course of less than an hour. Another aspect I loved is Nolan's direction -- he has found his footing here. I thought his style in Batman Begins was a bit cautious at times, like he was trying to find his comfort zone for a big franchise film, but he's far more self-assured here -- the back-and-forth editing between scenes really heightens the tension. It makes "The Dark Knight" less of an action film and more of a crime/mystery thriller -- there are some remarkable twists in this picture and the build-up is, at times, unbearable. I could go on about this film for ages, but I've already run out of room. Suffice to say, it's every bit as good as I had hoped. Is it the "best film of all-time" (as its current ranking on IMDb would imply)? No, of course not. But in all honesty, and hyperbole aside, it *is* one of the best films I've seen this entire decade and certainly one of the most remarkable -- especially for its genre. Nolan has taken "light entertainment" and given it brains, heart, and depth -- even more so than the first time around. On top of that, he's given us villains and anti-heroes we care about -- backed by superb performances by all involved. It's a wonderful motion picture experience, and the feeling it gave me after it had all ended can only be described as "emotionally draining." Like the best works of Scorsese or Fincher or other gritty/visceral directors, this movie left me feeling overwhelmed when it had ended -- but in a good way. If you see one movie this summer, make sure it's "The Dark Knight."
10.0~Film surpasses the hype straightblaster Sign in Permalink We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie. Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype. For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments. Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great. This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.
5.0~The movie is over rated. People are voting emotionally. tedfthis Sign in Permalink I was very disappointed with this movie. I made the error of watching it, based on the high score it is recording in the reviews on the IMDb. I could quite easily have given it away after 15-20 minutes, but I persevered with it. I only persevered for one reason, I wanted to see what was probably Heath Ledgers last complete performance. I rated his performance very highly and he deserves to be considered for any of the upcoming awards shows, truly on merit. I thought that Christian Bale was miscast and unconvincing, as Batman and there really wasn't very much of a story line to the movie. I cannot understand how this is rated a 9 out of 10 at present. That must mean, that all reviewers are between 18-30 and you are all giving it nine or ten. Ten being the perfect score for the perfect movie, I think some of you have let your emotions get away with you. I scored it 5 out of 10.
10.0~Want your Greek Tragedy Crime Thriller with a side of Comic Book? gfw_gigan Sign in Permalink This is a great movie. Joker was spot on, very scary and funny, I love the editing in the suspense scenes. But to be honest, the main character is Harvey Dent. This is his best version since in Batman TAS. A full story, the greatest character development he could have been given, as we see the potential in him when he tosses the double headed coin and so on, with great foreshadowing (You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain) and there is a great payoff. The acting was amazing too. Very menacing. I mean, you can't possibly complain he got shafted. In Batman Forever he got shafted. Just a Joker ripoff without any sympathy, and we didn't want him on screen. Here, though, he has genuine pathos. We see the greatest of men, the most honorable and honest man who had a real chance to make things better, fall. He really didn't deserve it, and we all feel for him. He loses everything, and he has done nothing wrong. He isn't even insane in the end. He's just torn and defeated. And when he aims the gun at the kid, we really think that he can kill him. And when he is defeated (I won't say dead, he might be in the sequel... why kill the goose that lays the golden eggs?), we realize that he is a victim. A victim of the Joker on the outside, and a victim of himself on the inside. That is why I think he is the greatest character in this film. Also, he looked great. Was the scarring CG, prosthetics, or both? Surely, though, with all that open skin, he would contract some kind of disease and get infected? Doesn't matter. If Heath hadn't died, both him and Eckhart would be praised as equals. But now that I'm done with that, let's get on with the Joker. Before I saw the film, I heard that he was great, but I wasn't convinced. The trailers did seem second rate to me, I admit. He wasn't scary enough there. So when I heard how great he is in the role, I took it with a grain of salt... until I saw the film. I was literally TERRIFIED of him. Even when he was funny. I really thought he would kill everybody who mattered. And he did, I guess. He played a psychopath who wasn't really insane. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I realize that he wasn't a psychopath. He was a sociopath. He only cared about his own well being... Wait a minute. He didn't. We need a new word for this guy. Maybe he had a sort of super-sanity. On first glance, you think him completely insane. But he's actually a genius, using Gotham as a petri dish to do his social experiments. Why? Because, deep down, he wanted to prove that everybody was like him. I remember reading a comic about the Joker where psychiatrists in Arkham find an essay about how the Joker isn't really insane. If he was insane, he wouldn't have been able to pull any of his crimes off. It concludes by saying that with this as proof, the Joker should not be charged as insane and locked away, but be put to death. The psychiatrists then learn that it was written by Harley Quinn before she went insane. That means that this file would not be taken seriously by a judge and Joker would still be classified insane. That comic never convinced me. He always seemed batty to me. But this film... he isn't crazy. He is probably more sane than anybody else, actually. Just cold and uncaring.There are times that he does seem insane, like when he goes nuts laughing while jumping on Batman. But he is really a calculating genius with incredible foresight. And I think it's a shame that we can't have Heath back. He showed complete acting skill when doing his rants and monologues with a straight mind, if not a straight face. The scene where the hospital doesn't blow up, and he keeps hitting the button until it does, is unscripted. I've also been hearing that there's a (false) rumor that he was on drugs while doing the scenes. If his eccentric acting can start rumors like that, an Oscar nomination would not be out of pity. It would be justice. His character can probably be written off with a death penalty in the sequel and it would make sense, but I would take that over a replacement (unless an obsessed fan named Harley decides to continue his work.) As for Batman himself... I never believed that you can hide your identity from your friends with a mask until now. Bale played two people. They can't possibly be the same person! Also, we finally realize in this film that Batman is not a hero. He does very immoral things in this, like eavesdrop on everyone in Gotham. And you just can't make an excuse for that. He is clearly in the wrong, even if it's the only way to do his job. And with the almost complete lack of CG in this, everything Batman does seems possible by human standards. And, of course, he gets attacked by dogs. Of course he would. It was delightful when he gets attacked by dogs again and his suit keeps them from killing him. Gary Oldman's Gordon was incredible in this movie. He had such a big role, and it was pulled off perfectly. He had better be in the sequel. I give the Dark Knight... A+, or 10/10
1.0~Not Very Good! oclatham Sign in Permalink Sorry, But this movie was trash! Had a few good moments, but that's about it! A waste of over two hours of my life I won't get back. Time to put Batman to rest! Heath was a good actor, But sorry. His performance is NOT worth a Oscar NOD. Let Heath RIP!! There are far better movies and actors out there that deserve the Oscar NOD. I am just glad I rented the movie and did not waste time and money paying to see it in a theater. I was never so happy to see the credits roll up before!
10.0~Posthumous Oscar, coming right up! halohamish Sign in Permalink Batman returns to the big screen once again in The Dark Knight, sequel to already brilliant Batman Begins. But as good as Batman Begins is, this truly is epic in comparison. Christopher Nolan returns again as the director and co-writer and creates the movie of his career. As we all know, the hype was everywhere. Many were skeptic of whether it would live up to it. And it didn't. It surpassed it! Even after waiting a whole week for the brilliance of The Dark Knight to fully set in and assure myself I, myself, wasn't just caught up in the hype, the only thing I can still say is, "Wow". There really is no place to start. The acting, the writing, the plot structure, effects, action scenes - each of these showing the best of what cinema has to show for each section. But, in a messy, misguided attempt, I will start with what I saw as the most impressive arc of The Dark Knight, the acting. Now, I think we all know who steals the show. It is, undeniably, that of Heath's performance as the Joker. This truly is a milestone in film history and is definitely the performance of Heath's life (no pun intended). It's up there with such unforgettable legendary roles as Marlon Brando as Don Vitto in both dedication and delivery and a posthumous Oscar is well on its way. Every minute he is on screen, your eyes devour it, savoring every second he appears, and craving it again once he is gone. But as good as Heath is (and he really is that good), you cannot oversee the other excellent performances by many of the cast, especially that of DA Harvey Dent by Aaron Eckhart, who tragically becomes Two-Face later on. And who ever thought Gary Oldman could be versatile enough to play such a good character so damn well. Well, let's move onto the next aspect of The Dark Knight that I saw as almost impeccable. The script. Once again, the Joker's script is one that any writer can only ever dream of writing, full of clever wit and some of the best quotes cinematography will ever be graced to. Every word is like a piece of beautifully woven poetry, but not only that of Heath's but by everyone. But aside from all the genius that is packed into this almost 3-hour masterpiece, it is not perfect, just like any other film. And to push aside these blemishes and try and forget them would be ignorant. The first problem seems to be a case of too much to do in too little time. I felt the plot structure, as good, no excellent, it is, it is a little messy and I just felt Nolan tried to bite off a bit more than he could chew. No, more like a nibble. Also, we can't deny that, even with a change from Holmes to Gyllenhaal, Rachel's character is just plain badly written. Though Gyllenhaal's performance was a fresh breath of air and her acting overshadowed that of Holmes, it still had that same dry, bland feeling I felt with Holmes. Finally, I did think the ending, the last 15 minutes or so, were a bit drawn out, filled with what are good final quotes, but utter spoon feeding. But believe me, it took me a week of nit-picking to find any faults, and all of them are very small. Even with all that said, this movie is a triumph and must be seen by everyone.

1.0~Highly overrated acube3 Sign in Permalink This movie has toppled all the records and currently ranked number 1 on IMDb rankings. This really makes me doubt about how IMDb ranking works and are we the people so gullible to the advertisement campaigns that we have rated this film this high.... I must say this that the film as such is not bad. It is the best film so far this year. However it does not qualify to even come near to other masterpieces. If it is not for Heath Ledger's excellent performance, I would have rated this film even lower. To tell the truth I liked the prequel of this film better. The film is lengthy and melodramatic. e.g. the scene where inmates and civilians want to decide if they want to blow off other ship. Message was good but the way it was delivered is little bit childish. Also, transformation of Harvey Dent seems sudden and illogical. Nolan should have developed this character better. If Harvey does what he does after the death of his beloved, he should be avenging Joker. The most important part where joker convinces him to be an anarchist just like him is written poorly. All in all, it is a good movie (excuse me but far from masterpiece).
10.0~Mixed feelings...sort of jhobdell Sign in Permalink This is only the second film I've reviewed that I've given 10 stars to, and to be honest that is mostly based on Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. In some ways I feel the film has suffered as a result of Ledger's death and all the hype around this portrayal and you cannot help but ask, how much of the adulation and the Oscar rumours are due to his untimely death back in January. That said, I've been looking forward to seeing this film since I Ledger's death and the comments on his performance, particularly from Michael Caine - some of the praise from such an established actor about someone still so fresh, relatively, is staggering. I was absolutely delighted by Ledger's performance - that at least wasn't ruined by all the hype. His psychotic hilarity is delicious. The disappearing pencil trick is quite horrific, the more so because of the intense, aggressive indifference he manages to conjure up. But for me (and I urge everyone to look out for it), that defining moment of the performance is the video that Alfred and Bruce watch together: the strangled roar "LOOK AT ME!!!" is so unnerving it defies belief. In summation, I think this is a fantastic film. It lives up to the ambiance of its predecessor, and I believe Ledger's cult status is well deserved. Go see it and enjoy it, I promise you won't be disappointed!
10.0~A much needed and longed for kick in the balls to the movie industry dnagorny Sign in Permalink To start off, I will say that I never was a big fan of the original Batman Begins, but as an open minded individual, after a couple of my closer friends told me to give it another chance, I did. I caught it on TV sometime last year, and I have to say that I was all in all impressed with it. Why the sudden change? Because in the previous Batman movies, a lot of us had come to accept that our main hero was not as calm and yet psychologically damaged as Bale's rendition. Actually, all the previous Batmans were calm, but in comparison to Bale, not as slick. After seeing Bale's Batman, I realized that the new take on him and the rest of the characters and settings of Gotham now made perfect sense through the directorial visions of Nolan and crew. It alllowed us to truly see the dark times in Gotham and see the human condition through the Gotham universe. Now, the first movie aside, I had no expectations when I came in to see Dark Knight. I knew it was receiving a major amount of hype and that Ledger's Joker was rumored for a nomination, so I was excited to see Ledger's first appearance. Anxious even. And wow, did he amaze and captivate. Everything about him thanks to the costumes, props, lighting and music combined makes for a truly shrill and frightening Joker. That new look will stick in my mind for a long time. Now, how about the rest of the movie? Did it amaze all the way through? Yes, it did. It surpassed amazing. It was suspenseful, surprising, dark, and a spectacular rendition of a comic book universe. But, did it have flaws? Yes, it did. But a movie of this caliber deserves to have the flaws thrown aside. Even the Godfather has flaws. Opinions on movies are subjective, and thus even such a classic cannot have universal love. That's why The Dark Knight needs to be seen in the context of what it is. A take on a comic book character and a comic book universe. What does this mean? That it's not real. There is no standard here for what's acceptable in Gotham. There are different physics at play, which is what made its precursor, Batman Begins acceptable in the first place. I've read plenty of 1/10 reviews on here and have really thought about the current number 1 movie in all of IMDb status it has now. Does it deserve it? No. And that's only because I think this movie needs to stand the test of time. If in 20-30 years, people still remember it like we remember the Godfather now, then it truly is a classic. But, do I think it will stand the test of time? Simply, yes. The nature of Ledger's preparation for the role, his masterful acting, and his untimely death will propel this movie to beyond amazing reception. No doubt people will go around claiming how overrated this movie is. But, critics like that must be ignored and my heart says this movie was beyond fantastic and will be in 20 years and beyond. Regardless of that, it's a classic in my eyes. The small plot holes and flaws really do make this movie perfect. Yes, this movie was so good that the flaws make it great. It's inevitable that it couldn't be subjectively perfect. Even my favourite bands (I say this as a musician), aren't perfect. They have objective flaws that make them perfect in my individual eyes. An easy 10/10 because I've never been entertained and thrilled in such a way and kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. This isn't an average superhero movie. It's a movie that deserves a spot in any DVD collection for rewatching.
1.0~Overkill. rtcnz Sign in Permalink Months after seeing this film, all I can remember about it was Heath Ledger as the Joker. Everything else melts away: I can't remember anything about growly Batman or lame Two Face. I remember that there were way too many characters played by elderly veteran actors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal looks like someone's elbow. And it felt like the film was ending so many times, only to launch into a whole new chapter. I know this is how comic books are written but the sprawling structure doesn't work as well in a film. The storyline was messy. Only one star: the Joker.
1.0~plot is illogical, aesthetic uninspired, casting poor, acting sloppy, editing rushed, and larger themes unconvincing fbb123 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight's extreme popularity must be due to saturation advertising, hype, the popularity of the Batman franchise, and a star-studded cast. Looked at objectively, it fails on a number of levels. SPOILER WARNING: This comment talks extensively about the plot of the movie. A) The script is full of illogical events. 1) Batman jumps out of a window on the 50th floor to rescue Rachel, catches her, and smashes with her onto a car in the street below, and they both walk away unscathed, despite the fact that no parachutes were deployed and no wings broke their fall. 2) The Joker somehow fills large places throughout the city with large oil canisters full of explosives, with no one seeing, including Gotham's largest hospital and two ferry boats, after advertising that these places would be targeted. 3) Midway through the movie, the white knight of justice, District Attorney Harvey Dent, does a 180 degree turn when his girlfriend is killed and becomes a psychotic killer, for no reason whatsoever. 4) Early in the movie, the Joker goes on a rampage and then makes demands and the entire city clamors not for his defeat but for all his demands to be met. 5) Dogs can bite through the bulletproof bat suit. 6) Two Rottweilers can take down and immobilize Batman. 7) The Joker can singlehandedly overpower Batman without any weapons. 8) The police act as buffoons throughout the movie: they put the Joker in a cell with other prisoners; interrogate him without handcuffs; let him out of the interrogation room when he takes the interrogator hostage; and give him a cell phone to use, which he then uses to trigger an explosion in the building that kills everyone but, miraculously, him. 9) The Joker drives alongside a police caravan and systematically picks off one police car after another with a bazooka, and the police continue driving along at the same plodding pace. 10) Batman shoots at the Joker and fights him and flips his 18-wheeler truck, but when he is about to hit the Joker with his motorcycle, he crashes it instead and puts himself at the mercy of the Joker in a fit of GI Joe morality. 11) Morgan Freeman objects to Batman's cell phone mapping technique, saying "Too much power for one man", and resigns as his assistant, despite Batman's lifelong pursuit of lawless vigilantism. B) Aesthetically the movie is unimaginative and uninspiring. 1) Batman as a fighter is stiff. His suit is like a slab of sheet metal welded together. His movement is the opposite of the smooth, flowing martial artist one sees in classic samurai or judo movies. Batman arrives without stealth, by smashing through windows into hails of gunfire, and departs in a similarly unstealthy manner. This is the opposite of how a ninja would behave: with intelligence, grace, simplicity, and secrecy. Similarly, the Batmobile smashes through reinforced concrete walls and sits still to absorb a hail of gunfire. The Batman envisioned here -- smashing everything in his path, and indestructible -- is more like the Incredible Hulk than a bat. 2) Set design is drab. The scene in the kitchen, of the conference of mafiosi, is plain, uninspired, and unimaginative. The parking garage scene is aesthetically dull. The bat cave is quite plain -- just a long, empty room with a low, internally lit ceiling, without any gear whatsoever. C) The casting is poor and the acting uninspired and sloppy. 1) Morgan Freeman is a dreadful choice. His acting and presence is like the feel-good music that often accompanies his scenes. Just play the music and skip him. 2) Aaron Eckhart relies too much on his good looks and smile and not enough on acting. He sounds like a motivational speaker -- that is, a liar -- trying to convince, but unconvincing. His body language in the scene on top of the building is very fake: amateur-aggressive. 3) The actor playing Commissioner Gordon is about as good as a director standing in for an actor who couldn't make it to rehearsal. He has no energy or presence on screen. I appreciate understatement in acting, but he seems to be half asleep and mumbles his way through his lines. 4) Maggie Gyllenhaal is unconvincing as the object of desire of both heroes. 5) The black mafia boss is terrible. The other mafia bosses are not much better: overacting without direction or intelligence. 6) The man who turns from a meek bank supervisor to a tough vigilante in the first scene is too self-conscious, and his transition is unbelievable. He is too recognizable as an "actor". 7) The acting by extras is very bad and poorly directed. When the Joker says "half", the chorus of laughter is like that in a high school musical. The same unanimity of action is found at the press conference. The thugs in the parking garage seem like models, not thugs. D) The editing is too fast; transitions are largely dispensed with altogether. 1) There is no pause before the cut to the trial; dialogue from the two scenes runs together. 2) The scene at the benefit party is unconvincing: Bruce Wayne drops the models immediately, people applaud immediately, it's over. Scenes are too fast and perfunctory. E) In its larger themes, the movie proves to be just as illogical and perplexing as in its minutest details. The end of the movie carries this message: "Sometimes the truth isn't good enough ... Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded." This is used to justify the creation of a myth of Harvey Dent as "Savior Of Gotham", and to explain the need for making Batman the fall guy for all of Dent's crimes. However, the movie makes no attempt to explain why Dent, the psychopath, should be eulogized and not Batman, the hero. The writer floats a thesis about the human need for myths on a raft of unpersuasive evidence.
7.0~Carl the Critic: The Dark Knight gustafsoncarl Sign in Permalink Every where I go people always say how great the Dark Knight was, how its was such a great movie, how the film should deserve an Oscar for Best Picture! I say NO IT DOES NOT! gasp "What!? you don't like the dark knight?" you may be asking me. "No," I would reply, "as a movie I did not think that it was a good movie at all, and I know no one will say this but I feel that this film was a horrible story, and the photography of the film was not that impressive." "But," you may reply "Heath Ledger was the best Joker ever!" "True," I would reply, "Heath Ledger was indeed the best Joker ever, and he did deserve that Oscar for Best Actor, but he was one actor that made the movie enjoyable for me, the rest of the film was not all that impressive. Two Face should have been saved for the sequel instead of this film because it just made the film longer instead of dragging on for ever making my butt hurt in the theater." However I must confess that the score for the film was still good, even though it was the same thing as the FIRST film, and that it is not really the worse Batman ever made. That title was given to "Batman and Robin," but what I'm saying is that people should not be so conformist when it comes to films such as this, people need to watch the film for more than Heath Ledger, because every time I ask people what made it good 100% of the people say Heath Ledger. He was the best Joker, but this was not the best Batman, in fact I'm thinking the film should be retitled "The Joker," because his role was much more significant than Batman (who still talked as if he had been smoking tobacco out of a bazooka for the past 10 years.)
4.0~Disappointing, overrated and too long... a_aleksan Sign in Permalink First of all, I am very disappointed that this movie currently stands as no.1 of all time on IMDb listing. People, just remember the first time you watched the Matrix, Godfather, Braveheart, any Stanley Kubrick movie, and the list goes on. I think IMDb should take this matter seriously and reconsider its rating system, because I have been using this website for god knows how long as a reliable way to select movies to watch and compare my taste. Let me tell you that I actually went to see this movie a second time to really make up my mind. Now, why such a low rating, why soo serious?? Well, first of all, I am a big fan of Batman and a big fan of Christian Bale, but, unfortunately, I have to say this was his worst acting role. I think the direction or production forgot about the Batman for this movie, there is no darkness in his character, no depth, no inner struggle, I mean Christian Bale himself looks bored. The comments of Alfred on the other hand, as his "adviser" are just useless, a poor performance from another great actor. I don't want to continue criticizing the actors, but it doesn't get any better as I think of the other actors. Heath Ledger may have pulled off a very good performance though, he was very good, but I mean we saw him maybe 30 minutes in the movie, and some parts were too predictable. OK, so, what makes this movie so disappointing? It is no longer a comic movie and we have to many "real" elements. A vigilante wearing a mask and using his wealth to have amazing gadgets, fighting against a psycho, who's motives we don't even really find out, what made him the way he is: a self proclaimed "agent of chaos". We also have a harvey dent, who has the highest morals and who is incorruptible, or maybe not. The story is too long, the innovative schemes that Batman comes up with to stop the Joker are over the top and simply too unrealistic. In order to achieve making the Joker look super intelligent and a mastermind, all the direction does is make sure the rest of the characters are very stupid. I mean, leaving him uncuffed??? Come on? OK, so, do the action scenes and special effects save the day? NOPE! Remember the chase scene in Ronin? Remember the robbery scene in Heat? Not comparable. I'm sorry, but everything in this movie is sub par! This is a mediocre high budget flick, with nothing genuine to offer. A cheap ripoff and attempt to reintroduce the story of Batman without any twists. How is it that the movie lasts almost 3 hours if not more, and there is no story development what so ever. Oh wait sorry, by the end of the movie, Batman becomes the bad guy, yeah okay... I can go on and on but I am just starting to lose my calm. Hollywood, wake up, World wake up, if you think this was a good movie, then, I suggest you watch idiocracy, and maybe you will recognize it as a true vision of the future. So disappointed.... 4/10 (or maybe I am still being generous)
7.0~Cluttered script and directing, but acting is great. XAPxSCORPx Sign in Permalink With all the high praise this movie was getting from both movie reviewers and movie goers, I was expecting a film that was better than the previous film, "Batman Begins". Instead, we have a cluttered mess of a script and directing (At least in the first hour). Too many story lines and too little focus on the more important parts of the story. For example, a subplot of Bruce Wayne going to Hong Kong is a total waste and not needed if written right. There is also a wasted opportunity in the scenes with the Scarecrow. The movie does pick up and get better after the half-way mark. Much was made about Heath Ledger's acting in this movie, that he should be nominated for an Oscar, but that too was overblown. Although Ledger did a great job as the Joker, it's not an Oscar worthy performance. I think it's the emotion of his unfortunate death that is making reviewers over-hype his performance. Do not overlook Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent (especially in the second half of the film). It would had been nice to have Katie Holmes back as Rachel Dawes for continuity, but Maggie Gyllenhaal gives the character a more realistic and emotional performance. Finally getting to Batman. The writers seem to make Batman unlikable by all of the other characters in the film. Maybe it's because there less focus on the Batman/Bruce Wayne character in this film. Not even the two people he's closest to (Lucius Fox and Alfred) seem to like him. The relationships between those characters in the first film is what gave the movie its soul. Is it worth seeing? This is the type of movie to see on the big screen. Will you be bored? There are some slow moments to this film. It is a darker film than the first which can be good and bad. All in all, the movie didn't live up to my expectations, but this is just an opinion from a 41 year old movie-goer
2.0~Once you are shallow, then Batman seems deep... Norshius Sign in Permalink For all those who think, that it is The Masterpiece - it's not, not even close, here's why: 1) The only strong role was Joker. Acting of others was above average. But Ledger, in my opinion, deserves a huge credit for making his character so impressive and realistic. 2) Second half of the movie got boring, because of the action scenes that were made only for the sake of action. At some point I started to ask myself a question "Why". I didn't find an answer in the movie. 3) Story is quite acceptable, but those that claim Dark Knight to be an art are floating somewhere near the epicenter of Americas self-indulgent "culture", where grown people are still more interested in comics than real art. It's a shame to see this movie near the top of IMDb 250. Even though I would like to write 3 or 4 for it, I decided to give those extra minus points in the name of some disoriented cinema spectator, who thought it to be perfect. Just beside Shindler's list and Pulp Fiction? Are you serious? To sum it up - I would advise all those that praise Dark Knight, have a few hours lecture about history of cinema. They might be surprised, what genial directors are capable of. I would suggest starting with Kubric, Tarkovsky, Copolla, Lynch... And after the lecture adjust their evaluation scale accordingly.
10.0~A Sign of Hope alexkolokotronis Sign in Permalink Wow. How else could I describe this movie? I was wondering how this could possibly better than Batman Begins, but the truth is it was a different type of a movie. Yet it still held those morals of righteousness, faith, ethics, responsibility and so on, it was just presented in a different way. The acting was amazing overall. Maybe not every individual performance was first rate but as a whole the cast was among the best ever. Christian Bale, who is undoubtedly the best Batman ever and probably the best superhero ever, like in Batman Begins, provides a deep and thought provoking performance. One with authenticity, validity, purity and most of all originality. His performance is subtle yet compelling, it is not by what we as a culture would like to think of as heroic but in my thinking that is exactly what it is. Unlike every other superhero he does not have superpowers. He is an intellectual who needs to rely on his and his friends' intelligence in order to do what he does. He is not an actual "superhero" he is a man. A man with the audacity to do what is always right even when no one else would do so. Bale throughout is able to display the turbulent lifestyle he lives in and how at times he "The Batman" himself has to question his own morality. The best performance of the movie though was not Bale's its Heath Ledger's. Like Bale he brings originality to a comic book character. It seems though that in every comic book movie the villains are never quite as unusual or scary as they should be. Ledger in this movie is able to pull off what repeatedly other actors have failed to do as comic book villains, give you that bone chilling feeling. Entirely throughout he brings intensity beyond intensity. His performance is so capturing and disturbing that he makes you laugh out of sheer horror, something that you rarely feel while watching a movie. The most frightening part about the way he portrays his character is not his freakishness, it's that his performance is not the least bit cartoonish, it is in fact very real. His performance is just beyond words. Aaron Eckhart was quite a surprise to me. We basically saw the rise and fall of his character Harvey Dent. The way he transformed from an incorruptible district attorney to a vengeful bloodthirsty maniac was simply perfect. Gary Oldman I was not surprised by though. I have always thought of him as a talented actor and unlike Batman Begins he is able to give a more serious portrayal of James Gordon and did as well as I expected and more. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a godsend compared to Katie Holmes. She seemed more fitting in the role of a lawyer and was able to pull off many scenes Holmes probably could not. Michael Caine is perfect for the role of Alfred. Alfred is more than a butler of Batman he is a friend, a father figure and righteous man. Who better than for Michael Caine with his great voice to portray such a character? Another actor with an even better voice is Morgan Freeman. He may not have had a large amount of screen time but he was certainly never a forgotten figure at any point in this movie. The writing was very good. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are among the best writers currently and once again show off their talent. What is so interesting in the way that the script was written was that it did not aim to make anyone the star of the show. This script brought the best or should I say the most intriguing traits out of every character and actor. Everyone in this film had their moment to shine which was very satisfying to see. Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman all deservingly so are allowed to not just be in this movie but a part of it. Not once have I thought "oh I wish I could have seen more of this character and less of that one". The writing was the glue to this movie and should be given more credit. I am now much more comfortable with saying that Christopher Nolan is currently the best director. He in the past has done great movies such as Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins and The Prestige. This movie was a perfectly crafted and is probably one of the best made movies ever. He is able to do something that most directors, including the great ones, cannot do. He can keep you well engaged into a movie and still provide some sort of a deep meaning at the same time. At no point in this movie did I ever wonder what time it was or how much longer is left. That something I could say I have never done. What other director in the past has brought out depth from a superhero? The answer is no other has. He maintains an authentic feeling that you would get from watching The Godfather and still excite you like your watching Die Hard. His direction in this movie is more than special it is a monumental achievement in film. Now what do I mean by a sign of hope? It not only has its hopeful and inspiring message saying that we have the power. It says that society doesn't have to determine who we are. That is not even it though. Over the years now summer blockbusters have become mostly shallow and superficial. This maybe one of the biggest blockbusters ever but it has something that the others did not have: true, deep meaning. Hopefully this movie can be an example to the rest of Hollywood. Maybe just maybe Hollywood can do something that it has not done for years; incorporating thought provoking, deep philosophical themes consistently back into their summer blockbuster commercial movies.
10.0~very rare excellence blackangelproductions Sign in Permalink Only once every few years does a movie of this caliber get released, the last movie of recent days that impressed me as much as this film did was "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy so this film is now sitting, in my opinion, with the biggest films of all time. The acting in this film is mostly superb, i say mostly cause the performance of Maggie Gyllenhaal leaves a little bit to be desired and the voice that Christian Bale puts on when he becomes the dark knight is a little over the top plus some very average performances from many minor characters but Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are all excellent and so is Christian Bale for the most part when you look past the over done voice. For obvious reasons, I left one name out of the list and its the name everyone has been talking about since this movie was released, the sadly departed Heath Ledger. Heaths performance as the joker is beyond excellent, it puts him up with the greatest actors of all time including Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. He undoubtedly becomes the Joker and throughout the film you never really see Heath Ledger you are looking at Batman's most famous villain not a man playing him. I did have doubts when i first heard they were casting Heath as the Joker but obviously my doubts have been put to bed. Now, what makes this film great is not just the acting, its the storyline, the directing by Christopher Nolan and the all round production values are just superb and surpasses the excellent "Batman Begins" by a few miles. The only thing i will say against the storyline is that Harvey Dent's phase as "Two-Face" is way too short lived, they killed him off after about 45 minutes of the character being in the film which disappointed me a little cause Two-Face is an excellent villain. All in all a brilliant film that deserves all the hype and praise it gets and more with only a few very niggling problems that don't effect the overall score of this film one bit.
5.0~The Dark Shoes Bezenby Sign in Permalink Although a far, far cry from the cheeseball shoe days of Tommy Lee Shoes, Jim 'sneakers' Carry and Big Boots Arnie camping it up as the bad guys and their shoes, I still had a problem engaging with this film. Not sure why. Maybe there were too many characters and not enough Batman shoe action (I mean, you've got Morgan Oldman, Gary Gyllenhall, Maggie Oldman, Heath Dale, Michael Ledger and Christian Caine to keep track of and that's only the actors who's name I can remember with absolute clarity just now). Also, the film is about seven hours long and very little of it involves footwear. Also: Eric Roberts – forgot about him and his white spatz. This time the heavily convoluted non-shoe story involves the triumvirate of policeman Gary Oldman, lawyer Harvey Dent, and The Batman trying to take down the mafia by hitting shoes warehouse through Gotham while trying to protect the legit shoe industry. They confiscate this huge shipment of shoes but there a jackboot amongst the plimsoles in the form of the Cobbler, who's nuts and keeps asking people how they think he got his shoes. It's up to Batman etc to sort this guy out but to be honest there's an old saying that goes "The craziest shoes wins the day" and by all accounts the Cobbler, even though he says he's an agent of Chaos, is the most Organised and pre-planning criminal since the killer in Se7en(shoes). Batman here is all caught up in some sort of shoe triangle with local lawyer/nike designer Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhall's deck shoes, which leads to all sorts of redundancy when they could have been concentrating on stitching and designer laces. The Cobbler however is playing all sorts of crazy games, replacing shoes with loaves of bread, tying people laces together and looking like Robert Smith of the Cure far too much for his own good. Maybe I'm too much of a shoe fan and not enough of a loads of characters fan, but I found this a bit of a slog. I am also confused by Bales (or Dale?) dropping his voice several thousand octaves every time he was Batman. I did like the bit where the Cobbler set fire to his share of the mafia shoes and then sailed down the East River in a giant Doc Martin while drinking champagne from a stiletto heel.
10.0~R.I.P Heath Ledger sanchopanzabr Sign in Permalink The best joker actor in the history of Batman's movies, nobody came close to him.
9.0~Does What it Set Out To Do mstomaso Sign in Permalink Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed. What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for. Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential. Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work. The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin. The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody. For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes.
1.0~Boring kodiac_city Sign in Permalink I gotta go against the grain here, but after all the hype I've read here I expected no less than cinematic greatness. What I got instead is that I got bored right out the theater. It's the only movie I actually walk out on this year, and I've seen some pretty bad ones. Scenario: linear, predictable, dark long and boring. Main actor(Christian Bale): Give me a break, I've seen trees with more emotional depth. Supporting actors: Yeah, OK, Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was inspired, to say the least. I was impressed, a very difficult character to impersonate and he pulled it off. The rest of the crew was adequate, no more. Special effect: Great, but we're used to seeing great by now, and there's too much of it. Editing: Inconsistent with bad rhythm. Music: Standard Hollywood canned fare. I found the whole indigestible, rooting for the Joker to kill them all about 3/4 of the way in so it would end and I could walk out; ended walking out anyway without even caring how it ends.
5.0~Characters and random situations alone do not make a great story mycannonball Sign in Permalink I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. I am shocked it has such positive reviews and raving fans. I give it a 5/10. My biggest complaint is about the overall storyline, which I felt was lacking. There seemed to be a bunch of characters ranging from very interesting (Heath) to not as interesting (Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman felt like non-characters this time around). And then there was a bunch of scenarios, some very tense and cool (the joker pitting the two boats against each other), and some very tired (didn't the hostages wear the masks in INSIDE MAN?). But there wasn't a great throughline to pull me through. In my opinion, a series of miscellaneous scenarios, a villain vs. a hero, and a smattering of people with assorted agendas does not make a solid storyline where from scene to scene I wonder what's going to happen. I got bored at times. It felt like a fantastic premise, but no story. I also don't feel much for Bruce Wayne/Batman character this time around. I haven't seen Batman Begins in awhile, but I'm pretty sure they show us his human side and that his laziness/womanizing/partying is just his Bruce Wayne cover-up. In this movie, he was cold. The kissing scene was ridiculous. He kisses Rachel then strides away with one hand in his pocket like he doesn't give a care at allwhich pretty much makes me not care about his character at all either.
2.0~A mess Tessa-7 Sign in Permalink I'm sorry but did I miss something? When did the rest of the world lose their brains? How did this film come to be the all-time number one? Has someone gone back in a time machine and deleted every film ever made before? I don't think I have felt so let down and annoyed by movie hype. Dark Knight is a complete mess and the director, editor, soundtrack composer and fight choreographer should be tied together and dangled from the nearest skyscraper until they repent. What a hideous assault on the senses. And, as a 12A, it's also got the most inappropriate rating. I went to see a 9pm screening of the film alongside a bunch of beer-bellied, thirty-something dads who are clinging to their youth by wearing crop trousers, bright-white trainers and fat laces. These guys laughed at the lame jokes and grunted in appreciation of the confusingly, overextended fight and car chase scenes, and then they came home, logged on to IMDb and gave the film "a 10, dude, cos like it rocks, this is like the best film EVER in the world, the universe, infinity". Meanwhile their offspring - ranging from tiny babies in carry-cots to pre-teens - bawled their hearts out in the seats next to them because they were completely overwhelmed and should have been at home in bed. The cybermen scared the hell out of me until I was 10 - so how does a child (regardless of whether they're accompanied by an adult) deal with this level of violence and noise? How is Sweeney Todd an 18 when this film is just a 12A? The former was gory but camp and theatrical. Dark Knight is just plain nasty - there's very little wit and no light and shade. My two out of 10 score is simply to thank Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman for turning up. To all the people that gave this film a 10, I say go & put your kids to bed, settle down in your sofa and watch the Shawshank Redemption, X-Men, Alien and Aliens, Heat, David Lean's Great Expectations etc, etc and then recast your vote.
10.0~This Movie Can Only Be Described With One Word. Zombie-Kermit Sign in Permalink And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like "awesome" and "fantastic" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil. The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace. I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool. I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible.
4.0~Critic and crowd pleaser raucously uninspiring brian_r_wright Sign in Permalink Back to the movie, clearly the actors are first rate and the dialog is entertaining. I particularly enjoy the incarnation of The Joker by Heath Ledger, which may bring Heath a posthumous Oscar nod; the writers give him some clever lines... like the "you complete me" phrase in the above quote (from Jerry MaGuire). But you know what I'm not buying? I'm not buying that this Batman flick, because of it's dark humor, is better than other comic-book-inspired movies; aside from the rare Joker line, nothing in this movie is humorous, dark or otherwise. In fact it's uncommonly depressing. I suppose Knight is similar to the later Spider Man films, in which we're to solemnly consider the deep emotional conflicts presented to a post-pubescent boy who has been given superhuman powers. My friends, these are movies (and movie advocates) that take themselves way too seriously. ...

6.0~Don't Believe the Hype loreguy Sign in Permalink I don't get the high ratings and glowing reviews this has received. Yes, Heath Ledger's performance is better-than-average. But this is a badly-flawed movie, largely because of its tedious conglomeration of plot points, all of which collide in mostly unsatisfactory ways. I was prepared to be blown away. Instead, I was squirming in my seat before the half-way point. And I have two questions: First, is Gary Oldman too big a star for someone to tell him to speak up and stop mumbling the ends of all of his lines? And second, how did Maggie Gyllenhaall get this job? She's a fine actress, but is woefully miscast here. OK, I lied, three: whose idea was it for Christian Bale to do the voice he uses when he's Batman? And how did the other actors keep from laughing whenever he spoke? I think that if Heath Ledger had not tragically and stupidly lost his life, this movie would have flopped like a live fish on the pavement. All that money and talent, and a script that should have been cut by about 30 minutes, after it had been rewritten for coherency. Thank goodness for Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.
1.0~2 movies packed in 1 !? watchouttokyo Sign in Permalink I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, it's still good entertainment compared to other 21th centuries block busters that fail in every possible way. But it has NOTHING to do in the Top 250. Sorry IMDb, kids who know nothing about cinema took over your ranking system. The main grudges I'd have about this movie would be: 1. It is way too long!!!! It'd been a while since I last experienced the feeling of expecting the credits to begin each time a scene would end. I was like "OK, then, the end?" and the movie would keep going into some nuke the fridge like action scene that has nothing to do with the main plot, as if the directors told themselves "People paying money to go to the theater want to have bang for their bucks so let's give them 56 explosions, 87 wrecked cars and 77 dead guys" (fictive count, but you get the idea) Toward the end I was completely out of the movie, focusing on not peeing in my pants. 2. What's with 2 face !? I didn't know about 2 face making an appearance in this episode. I thought it was all about the Jocker VS The World. Boy I was surprised to see this coming straight out of nowhere right in the middle of the movie. But hey, at that time I thought "nice way to introduce 2 face, could it be the next batman they make will have him as the main villain?" So I was kinda expecting a "The End" screen when, say, the Jocker sets him free from the hospital so that the movie is still coherent with the others. Like, "OK this time batman half won, the jocker is introduced as its arch ennemy and there's another freak out there to spice it up, the end, to be continued..." But the movies keeps going and going and going and going............ ALTHOUGH IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY!! It's as if they packed 2 movies in 1, seriously they should have called it "Batman Vs The Jocker featuring 1 extra villain" Of course, there's also the "2 face is dead" thing when we all know he's coming back a few episodes later. I can't understand why they made it that way. It would have been so much easier to have for example the 2 of them drop into water and only have batman to reach the shore leaving a question mark over 2 face's fate. Completely cliché, sure, but at least they're not killing someone to have him reappear in a sequel (oh hold on, maybe batman and gordon and all the cops can't tell the difference between a corpse and a living fellow?) I could go on forever on all the flaws like: _ cell phone crap (yeaaaah right OK it's batman but still.... and like 1 guy alone could trace millions in real time...) _ stupid prisoner's dilemma in the boats (since when criminals have morals?) _ "I burn money 'cause I don't care but I rob banks" stance of the Joker _ the batcave is now located in an almost empty room in the docks _ alfred burns his master's letters (come on, why so serious alfred?) _ batman is strong with men but weak with dogs (where is the batkick at?) _ batman's awful voice (puberty at 35 between Begins and TDK?) _ the joker has no plan but everything goes as planned every time _ the batpunch carpets big fellas but the jocker can handle it no problem _ crime syndicates give away their money to keep to some Chinese guy nobody knows, trusting him to keep it safe (since when criminals trust each other over money concerns?) _ gotham changed a lot between 2 episodes... and on and on ... I repeat this is NOT a bad movie itself, it's just WAY overrated. It's just another action movie that you go see to put your brain on low power mode for a couple of hours. I would have put a 5 or 6 on it but we need to counterbalance the tens that cinema uneducated dumb kids put.
3.0~A boring and bland adventure with logical mistakes joshua-theiner Sign in Permalink I've never been into Superheroes or comics but since this movie got praised to the heavens I watched it. And it blew. The story is simply the joker trying to spread chaos over Gotham City (obviously Chicago) because he is mad (there is also the Mafia and stuff but I found myself not caring at all in a matter of minutes so i will leave it out of this review). Batman tries to stop him being supported by Harvey Dent and Comissioner Gordon (in the beginning Lieutenant Gordon). I will now list the pros and cons: Pro: - Batman looks cool in his costume - The Gotham City Impositors are in the movie - The Joker is well acted Cons: - Batmans annoying voice Illogical things like the scene with the two ferries and the bomb. One side would surely have blown up the other because they didn't know if Batman could save them. Or the scene were Joker falls from a building and Batman saves him. Why? He could have just walked away instead of saving this mentally insane guy who just tried to spread chaos all over the city. - The Police in this movie. They are just stupid and incapable of doing their job right. They had several chances to shoot the Joker. For example the oh so beloved chase scene where the joker fires rockets at them. He is in plain view about 10 meters away and the S.W.A.T. guys don't even consider opening the door and shooting him. Or the scene where the old Comissioner is killed. If someone is a possible target for an assassination the police should check every corner of all his casual whereabouts Dent is convinced to be evil and mad in a matter of seconds Batman gets not enough screen time. They could have just named it Joker and Harvey Dent and some others but barely Batman: the Movie - The moral at the end is just naive. Everybody would choose to blow up someone else in order to survive. It isn't ethical at all to choose that you rather like to be blown up it's just pathetic. Because if both sides choose to not blow the other side up they both die. - The characters are bland and barely likable. Batman gets to little screen time to build up a real personality. The Joker is just the Joker but in this film without any real goal but to destroy anything. And the others are just bland. As you can clearly see I personally don't like this movie and I think it totally not deserves to be Nr.7 in the list of the greatest movies of all time.
6.0~The Dark Truth... kooleshwar Sign in Permalink Media Hype and Crowd Behaviour!!!! While lots of research has been done on this clearly its not enough, while there are lots of other points in this movie that merit study, it quite clearly this seemingly unrelated and external factors that determine the outcome of watching this movie. Well here are some dark truths, which after saying I expect the same vicious backlash that I would get after telling any other person something he doesn't want to hear. Truth No 1 - This is hardly a Batman film, as a person who grew up seeing the original TV series and cartoons and reading the original comics, and even the original movies, I can tell you that batman was always about humour even though i may not have been a fan of the almost comic TV series, even the comics had a sense of humour about them, besides as in any comic movie the comic is always about the man in the costume. What we have a here is multi-million modern urban social crime drama, with Batman only being used as the director to indulge in a socio-urban setting which a normal budget would not have allowed him, THE ACTION SCENES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. AND NO MATTER WHAT WHO SAYS WHAT THE F@#K HAPPENED TO THE NEO-Gothic LOOK OF GOTHAM DOWN TO THE OLD FASHIONED CARS AND PINSTRIPED SUITED CRIMINALS THAT WE HAVE ENJOYED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF BATMAN IN ALL MEDIUMS AND ACROSS ALL TIMES. Truth no 2 - This is not a movie to be watched by children even in they are accompanied by their parents, I've SPOKEN TO THE CHILDREN WHO I PLAY WITH IN THE PARK (i claim my mental age is 12 and i love children), AND EACH AND EVERYONE HATED IT, there was a time where comics were meant for children and teens,and if nothing else was at least fun for all age groups, but now its the medium for artistically inclined serious adults who want to see REAL PEOPLE WITH SUPERHUMAN POWERS. Oh please give me the superfantastical superhero of yore anyday. Truth no 3 - He may be dead but that does not mean that this is the best performance by any actor ever AND HELL EVEN IN IT IS A SINGLE STUPENDOUS PERFORMANCE Doesn't MAKE A MOVIE THE BEST MOVIE EVER at least have the common sense to the final result as the sum of all its factors. Just because the critics and the publicity managers tell you that it was the final greatest performance by a person who was disturbed enough to commit suicide doesn't mean we exhibit herd mentality and all go with the flow. It was a great performance NOT THE GREATEST EVER. truth no 4 - This movie had 2 climaxes, there were people in the theater who were ready to leave after a certain scene in the movie because they didn't know there was another character that was yet to be introduced, this movie was very very long, and that scene i waited for the movie to get over. In fact IT WAS THE LONG WAIT AFTER WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF THE MOVIE THAT RUINED MOST OF THE MOVIE FOR ME. truth no 5...................... well what the hell i can go on rambling but im going to be judged anyway so im going to end here. Some truths that everyone will like. The performances from everyone were great. The background score was very good but it always sounded like the movie was climaxing instead of just moving forward. WHATEVER THE FACTS MAY BE THE END RESULT FOR ME WAS A GOOD MOVIE THAT WAS MADE LESS GOOD BY THE unnecessary hype and the coinciding herd mentality. Maybe this movie was less suited to my tastes, but at least i deserve to told what im getting into, im hoping this is like ang lees hulk that was loved by critics and their followers initially but later people realised that may be they didn't like this movie that much after all, BUT THEN AGAIN NOBODY DIED WHILE MAKING THAT MOVIE.... -s WHY SO SERIOUS?? not like the batman i expected, very long, over-hyped. +/-s not a movie for all audiences.... +s superb performances all around, good soundtrack, some memorable scenes. total 6/10 (THE PERFORMANCE (you know whose im talking about), was indeed very good but the overall product fell well below my expectations if i wanted to watch a crime drama (which i don't like much anyway since i get majorly put of by crime) i would re-watch godfather or any other such movie.GIVE THE BATMAN OF YORE ANYDAY (exlude batman and robin). ps i expect to be judged and ridiculed, so bring it on, i have my own opinions which im proud to say are based on my own tastes and not by those of drama-tragedy loving critics and crowds driven to a frenzy by media hype.
10.0~No Ordinary Comic Book Movie Jtbone3141 Sign in Permalink This doesn't deserve the title of movie. It deserves a more fitting title, like masterpiece. We watch Batman continue his crime-fighting with some new villains, but faces a new brand of criminal Gotham hasn't seen. He doesn't want money or power. He just wants to watch the city destroy itself. And he's completely insane. His name is the Joker. Meanwhile, Harvey Dent is appointed DA, and Rachel's love. Bruce still has feelings for her, and Batman, Lt. Gordon and Dent form a shaky alliance to combat crime. The Joker slowly attempts to dismantle their sanity, pushing them practically to the point of insanity. This film is a great example of watching the hero struggle to remain the hero in the face of great loss and hatred from others. Dent makes a quote early in the film that is basically the outline of this movie's plot: "You either die the hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain." I guess I can't really elaborate on that without giving away a detail that would spoil the entire movie. But this movie shows how dangerous a person truly can become once pushed to insanity, and how far someone can be willing to go to pursue their idea of justice. Above all, watch it, as it is a masterpiece among movies and by far the best comic book movie I have ever seen.
8.0~Better than Begins helmutty Sign in Permalink Actually, first of all, I can't compare Batman Begins with the Dark Knight. They have different plot. Begins shows the introduction of Batman, the origin of Batman. The Dark Knight has a more darker plus interesting plot. It is commendable. Plus bigger action pieces, the movie goes in deep with humans' feelings. It is quite good and I understand it receives a lot of positive reviews. Christopher Nolan did a good job in everything in the movie, making the story deep and dark but engrossing. The story: The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and wants to kill Batman at first. With his trick plans, nobody even Batman can find him or predict his next move. Batman must stop the Joker from further destruction of Gotham. From there, humans' emotions slowly rise. There are some big action pieces, plot that you want to know and electronic music. I am somewhat disappointed with Two-face aka Harvey Dent, considered the white knight. I wished that Two-face will be given a bigger role. Other from that, it is hard to see any faults with the movie. Acting is good, Heath ledger makes a good joker. Overall: It is good to watch this in cinema. The runtime although long seems to pass quickly. You won't be disappointed. The first scene features bank robbing to hype the audience. It, not only shows you that it has the big action, shows the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movie.
10.0~Why So Serious? insanekid Sign in Permalink With such big hype on this movie, I am afraid that this movie will disappoint me but luckily it didn't. For me, the movie is a very well rounded movie in which it has everything it in...From Romance, to action scene, Inner conflicts, philosophies in life. I think it is nicely packaged into one movie. The Dark Knight isn't just a movie of Good vs. Evil, it goes more deeper than that. The storyline is very good. The development of the character especially that of Harvey Dent / Two-face is very good. At the end of the movie, I can say that I believe in Harvey Dent. Performances are very good as expected. Ledger didn't disappoint the people of his stellar performance. For me, I didn't really saw Heath Ledger in the movie. What I saw is a lunatic criminal named Joker causing terror to the Gotham City. Joker caught my attention because of his very terrifying performance, you never know what will happen next when he is around. Christian Bale does wonderful job for the Batman, and the portrayal of his inner conflict is nicely done. I am quite impressed on Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent. Harvey Dent character really gave me a very good and lasting impression. I like how they develop the Harvey Dent character. Other A List cast did very well on their part as well. *Dunno if this is considered a spoiler... But one small criticism that I had on this film is the part near the ending. Somehow I felt that somehow things were a bit rushed and forced to make it that way...I felt that they could have put it in the next Batman film. But I think the ending was quite good and well done. So overall, the movie is not affected and is still very good. It want it 9.5/10 but since no 9.5, then round-off to 10/10. The Dark Knight didn't disappoint me despite of TOO MANY HYPES. It lived up to the expectation which is really rare in a movie after the bar is raised too high because of hype.
9.0~Ledger delivers a stunning performance in best ever Batman Stampsfightclub Sign in Permalink In the sequel to Batman Begins (2005), Batman and Gotham are under threat from a man known as the Joker, who is causing mayhem amongst the mob, and starts to focus his attention towards The Dark Knight, and Gotham City. In the most anticipated film of the year so far, Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan team up once again for a triumphant return to the Batman franchise and deliver a darker, more sophisticated and exciting film than their previous collaboration. The plot of Batman Begins was exciting to discover the origins of how Batman came about, and this follow up sees how Batman's personal life is affected, with multiple stories revolving around the Joker, Harvey Dent and Rachel, which gives the film excellent depth and interest and this is what makes it better than the previous, that and Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain). As The Dark Knight was released Heath Ledger stole the headlines for his performance as the menacing villain, and seeing the trailer I couldn't wait to see if he lived up to the hype and the truth was he excelled the hype and has made the best Batman villain ever. So dark and dangerous, the cunning and the general madness of the character was brought to such a marvellous light by Ledger, and has, in my opinion, outshone Jack Nicholson's (Batman) portrayal of the Joker. And though the plot and everything about this film is excellent, Ledger is the best part about it all. Though I was slightly confused with all the mob dealings at the beginning, the plot is consistent with a wonderful depth to it, covering a lot of character's personal situations brilliantly. The visual effects are stunning. The action sequences are kept to a minimum, which was brilliant in my opinion as it is so easy to over do action and escape from the realism, but it was all done inch perfect with accurate realism. The direction is excellent by Nolan again, really capturing the mood of the genre and is without question the best Batman film made to date
10.0~Brilliant, Haunting, Sad ddeppfan21 Sign in Permalink I just saw The Dark Knight and it was even better than I expected and I expected it to be great. Most of this comment is about Heath Ledger so let me start by giving Christian Bale and the rest of the awesome cast, director,make-up,special effects team, writers, producers, and so on a huge thank you for doing such an amazing job in, and on this movie. Now for Ledger. People can say what they want about Heath getting too much praise just because he is no longer with us cause it just isn't true. Alive or gone, this was the performance of a lifetime. The make-up, the laugh, the mannerisms, every little thing he did was perfect. I have always had an image in my mind of how the joker was and this was finally it. I love Jack Nicholson because he is one of the best actors alive, but I am sorry Jack because Heath Ledger just out shined you and that is not easy to do. I was praying the entire movie that the joker would not be killed because it would have just been too symbolic and I would have lost it. I did cry at the end though. The ending when two face, the commissioner and batman are talking about life and death and how unfair and too soon it can be it really struck home and paralleled Heath Ledger's untimely passing. It is completely unfair that Heath's family and the world are going to miss out on such an amazing person with some of the rarest and rawest talent I have ever seen. I am a single mother and I can't even begin to imagine losing my daughter, so my heart goes out to Heath's family and his daughter. I am truly sorry that such an amazing man died so young.

8.0~More than just a superhero film. dead47548 Sign in Permalink Gotham is in turmoil. In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne created Batman as a symbol for justice and to put fear into the hearts of criminals. By the end of the film he had succeeded, but in The Dark Knight we see that his vision has turned Gotham into an even more chaotic world filled with more crime than ever and littered with pseudo-vigilantes dressing up as Batman and unsuccessfully attempting to fight crime. The story begins briefly after its predecessor ended, opening with a bank robbery constructed by the Joker and his thugs. We are immediately introduced to how this madman works, killing off his thugs as the robbery gets closer to completion. But he's not robbing the back for the money; he's sending a message to the mob that he can take as much as their money as he wants and they can't do anything to stop him. At first Batman tries to ignore the Joker and continue his attack on the mob, but he'll soon realize that nothing is more terrifying than this completely unhinged maniac, motivated only by the desire to spread destruction. The key theme running throughout The Dark Knight is the idea of justice in a corrupt society. Wayne (Christian Bale) created Batman as a symbol of that justice, but he didn't plan on being Batman forever and he's looking for someone to replace his position as this symbol. Enter Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the new District Attorney and Gotham's White Knight. The city sees him as a beacon of hope, and unlike Batman, this symbol is an elected official with a face everyone can look up to. He doesn't use theatrics to put fear into criminals, but he demonstrates that not everyone is corrupt and he's going to do whatever it takes to bring down those who are. Bruce sees him as the right man to bring decency to Gotham and allow him to quit being Batman and be with Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), his love who is currently dating Dent. So Batman and Dent team up, along with the morally upright Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) to put an end to corruption in Gotham and for a while it looks like they're going to succeed. The Joker (Heath Ledger), however, refuses to let decency win out. He stands as an agent of absolute chaos and he wants to show the world that deep down, when you strip away all hope for justice, everyone is capable of destruction. To prove his point he spends the film testing these three men who show that they aren't going to back down easily. And so the battle for Gotham's should begins. The Joker constantly throws pain and aggression into the faces of this city and forces everyone to show that they are capable of unimaginable cruelty, just like he is. Batman and Gordon stand strong against this menacing psychopath no matter what the Joker throws at them, but he eventually finds the trigger in Harvey Dent that brings him down from his status as the White Knight into a frightening but incredibly sympathetic monster. In creating Two-Face, Christopher Nolan does what I think is one of the smartest moves in the history of this genre. He doesn't just throw a villain at us and expect us to be afraid of them or to sympathize with them and he doesn't have fifteen minutes introducing the character and then show us a freak accident that turns them into the villain for the rest of the film. We meet this character as Harvey Dent, a symbol for decency and get invested in him as such. I personally almost forgot what his horrible fate was destined to be throughout a large portion of the film, through the shear fact that he was displayed as such a large icon for morality. Seeing him as this makes his complete decay into madness even more devastating to the point where it brought me to tears. Aaron Eckhart's performance is absolutely phenomenal. Yes, all of the talk is about Heath Ledger, yes he was a force to be reckoned with, and yes he gave easily the best performance in the film to say the least. But Eckhart is almost as magnificent. He is terrifying after his transformation into Two-Face, but we can still see the man we came to know him as throughout the film. There is one scene in particular, before he becomes Two-Face, where we can start to see the primal aggression that is going to take control of him boiling up inside and it terrified me and broke my heart all at once. Of course with any talk about The Dark Knight, there must be a detailed discussion about Heath Ledger's performance. To say that he immersed himself into the role would be an insult to the genius that is portrayed here. His unfortunate passing isn't even a factor when saying that this performance is so far beyond flawless that it almost surpasses any expectation I could have had. His work in the interrogation scene is so real and terrifying that it would have been impossible to watch if he didn't suck the viewer in so perfectly. I mean, the Joker is nothing but pure chaos and Ledger flawlessly creates that. This masochistic, destructive force goes from being charismatically hilarious one second to immensely terrifying the next. It gets to the point where you have no idea what he's going to do next, but you know that it's going to be brilliant. That interrogation scene alone is enough to convince me that it's one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. Words can't even come close to doing justice to this man's genius.
1.0~Do you have 0 rating as well?? davinci_loves_movies Sign in Permalink I don't want to waste more time on writing the review for this stupid movie, as I have already wasted my precious time watching it! This movies is over-hyped. c'on, IMDb gives it 9.2?? I mean are you serious?? lol........really this is the biggest joke ever, that an awful movie like this gets 9.2??!!! Direction is mediocre. The 'hissing' voice of batman is annoying. It was supposed to sound intimidating and macho, but it sounds as if he is having laryngitis, instead. Joker?? Was he really the joker (who never laughs??). A joker is a character, who is supposed to be full of surprises and tricks, and most important the one who 'laughs' in paradoxical situations. Unfortunately, this joker was not even close to the actual joker character. It seems, as if joker controls the whole city, but how and when, God knows? I can't go without mentioning that 'hyper sonar' machine, that can see every single person in the city. This time the director really jumped out of his briefs!! You evacuate all the hospitals in the city, except for the person for whom you are doing the evacuation!! lol........who was the writer?? I guess he didn't reach school higher than 2nd grade. I have so much to say about this stupid movie, but again, as I have already promised that even reviewing this stupid movie is wastage of time, so in the end, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, which paradoxically gets the best rating.
10.0~A few flaws make The Dark Knight imperfect, yet worth all of the money and time! faust-48 Sign in Permalink When I heard of TDK (The Dark Knight) for the first time, I wasn't amused. I myself am not a comic-book fan at all, and usually, I do not enjoy or even gather patience to see the films made out of them. But after I heard the hype and rave reviews, performances, and extremely high rating, I bought my ticket a few days early. When I arrived at the theater, it was sold out completely. I had to look around for a good 10 minutes to find a seat. When the screening finally took place, I was stunned and entertained heavily for every second. The story line is semi-original, the dialog is very catchy (yet campy and comic book like nonetheless), the performances by Ledger, Caine, Freeman and Oldman were amazing. One of the main problems I had with this film was Bale's "Batman Voice", which was just all too cheesy and almost embarrassing. Yet from beginning to end, I was surprised at how entertained I was, and actually, I loved just about every minute of it. It was a tad slow, but the whole film itself is worth the wait. This is one of the first great pieces of cinematic art from the new millennium. I recommend this movie 100%, even if you are skeptical like me about comic book themes. This movie is sure to win multiple awards, and I feel comfortable saying that every person involved that will win deserves it 110% I was enthralled from beginning to end, this is certainly close to living up to the hype of "Masterpiece"!
2.0~Worse than batman begins ... but if you liked it you may like this one atanas_n1-1 Sign in Permalink nop. they should stop making batman movies before making more like this. was disappointed by too many things in this movie - first of all the joker. while well acted this is just not the real one - Jack Nicholson's role was so much better... this one is just a twisted overdone "terrorist". yeah, you can guess it - the second thing i strongly disliked ... too much use of that t-word in recent years... and should i mention the link-the-cellphones-and-see-everything technology? too powerful and too much for a man, but for this one case we will use it and after it destroy it .... yeah ... cheesy. yeah, and the batman is running around and screaming like a dumb brute ... not exactly what he should be... many stars, nice acting, bad script and action - bad movie
6.0~Too many fans seem to be blown away SimonJack Sign in Permalink Many commenters said they were "blown away," so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!? There's no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects. That's the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre. So, this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes (but I would not rank it up with Iron Man). So, special effects and makeup may earn it awards. Maybe I'm beginning to burn out on all the action and special effects of movies, though. Or perhaps I need more from a movie. With 45 minutes to go, I was ready for it to end. It was way too long. Some reviewers thought the acting was superb. What acting -- do they mean the one- or two-minute interludes between the fast and furious segments of action and destruction? I'm not down on any of the actors for their roles or parts -- but where were there any parts of substance in acting? True, Heath Ledger does a very good Joker. But, then, who hasn't (Nicholson, et al) who have ever played those roles in Batman, Superman, etc? As for plot -- well, anyone who knows the genre and a story that combines Batman with the Joker, knows to expect the unexpected with the Joker. So, the plot goes from one unexpected to another -- as though the variety and mixture and change in "unexpecteds" is trying to outdo the action mayhem. When I saw that this stands as #1 in the top 250 right now, I clicked on the list. But how this movie for acting and plot (and yes, even action in many cases) could rank up there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings, the Star Wars films, and many great classics with real suspense (I have to mention Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest), is beyond me. I'm not that far off with the overall trends in the IMDb reviews, but can't agree with so many who rate this film at the top. It's good and entertaining -- but too long. It's not great, by any means. I love the youth of today (I have a few grandchildren), and I don't mean to disparage them by this observation -- but I think this high acclaim by many for this film may reflect a very large, very young audience, most members of whom don't have a great deal of quality and varied films in their viewing history. To all of those young people, I urge a look at the top 250 list or other major review ratings -- and then that you rent, borrow or otherwise watch some of the other great films. I promise you won't be disappointed or bored --and you may get an understanding (maybe appreciation for) of some past customs, life styles, dress, behaviors, etc. To be sure, you will have great entertainment.
1.0~The Dark HYPEpotamus ! solaiman00 Sign in Permalink The red coats are coming! The red coats are coming! Once again the English is trying to invade the land of the free. IMDb. I apologize for not believing those who warned me of this movie. People actually walked out. I very much wanted to however I was with a friend. He apparently wanted out as well. Being respectful of each other did not say anything till we discussed the movie, which took about 2 seconds. Movie is hollow. There is no beginning, and most important, there is no END. Batman's voice was annoying. Heath was okay, especially with his disappearing trick. Oh yes, one person clapped at the end. I wanted to jump down and beat the hell out of him. Then realized, he was slapping his head for it went numb. For those who don't believe the negative ratings, I want you to go watch it.
6.0~Overlong, dull, and pretentious. So bad it almost ruins Batman Begins buddyboy28 Sign in Permalink Jeez,where to start.Well first off I have to say that Batman Begins is not only my favourite Batman film but one of my favourite comic-book movies period.It was so good I was really looking forward to seeing this.Batman Begins looked and felt like a comic-book world, but it also had a dark tone to it and great acting which set it apart from the others.Now where did this go wrong. Well right from the beginning in all honesty.Just purely because as soon as the movie opens,you can tell that the director Chris Nolan has used a real city to stand as Gotham.In this case Chicago.Straight away you could see that it wasn't the same world as the previous film.The opening bank heist involving The Joker was good but it just looked like a scene from any crime thriller.This is supposed to be a Batman movie.For some bizarre reason the director thought he would make the tone very serious.Ridiculously serious.Now I never liked the camp tone of Tim Burton's movies,I much preferred the approach that Begins took but that film never forgot it was a comic-book.This does.It plays it so serious it just becomes ridiculous.Fair enough make the world plausible but at the end of the day it's still a story about a guy who dresses up as a Bat,in cooperation with the police and takes on strange criminals.This ain't Shakespeare for Christ sake. In a way the film is just as amusing as Joel Schumacher's efforts because it is so overtly serious that you can't help find it funny.So many ridiculous things happen,and because it tries it's best to be a crime thriller,these things stand out.And somehow Batman ends up becoming a supporting player in his own film.Something the director said Burton had got wrong and he would never do.Yeah right. It somehow manages to be overlong in length but too short in many scenes.It just keeps cutting back and forth between characters and sub-plots and mini sub-plots it becomes annoying.It just seems like a bunch of ideas thrown together without any logic.And Harvey Dent's sudden character change is laughable and Joker's anti-climatic end very frustrating. Here's the parts in the film that really annoyed the hell out of me. The Joker pulls up at the side of a police vehicle and starts shooting but the cops make no effort to shoot back and just carry on cruising along at the same speed.What the hell. Batman saves Rachel from falling off a building after The Joker crashes a party and the scene just ends.Seriously.This is a sadistic,psychotic killer we are talking about,are we really just supposed to believe that he would walk out and leave. Batman refuses to kill people but has no problem riding along on the Batpod blowing cars up to move out of his way.How would he know he's not going to kill someone doing that. And the main part that bugged me is in a sequence where Batman using some gadgetry flips over a truck with The Joker in and he emerges from the wreck conscious and unscathed.And yet immediately after,Batman somehow gets knocked out by coming off his Batpod which slowly he grinds to a halt.I was like WTF.I thought he was just pretending it was so stupid. The film doesn't have many redeeming merits at all and almost undid the achievement that Begins made.But not quite because that is still a great Batman film,unlike this wannabe crime drama with Batman and The Joker. A generous 6/10.
1.0~Terribly violent and poor movie!!!! Abusimble1 Sign in Permalink I was expecting to see at least a semi-good movie but this film is not even up to par. This film gets a 1 rating from me because it tries to depict Batman and fails miserably at it. Even for an action movie if Batman hadn't been in it, it's not good. The plot is horrid and morbid, the amount of gore unhealthy and the fight sequences are badly done. Notable problems: A. What is this rock theme music that's constant in the movie? It comes whenever a suspense scene starts and sounds like an annoying electric guitar. What is this doing in a Batman film? Also, the plot seems to be totally disconnected in between scenes. The entire movie is like one big mishmash of 10 different stories that occur in succession. It is also unrealistic many times. In the beginning The Joker simply takes his schoolbus into the convoy to escape. And the way he avoids police in broad daylight and blows up the hospital is unbelievable. B. The Joker in this film is someone with a predilection for violence and violence alone. Traditionally, The Joker has been a nefarious, insane character. He does things that are out of kilter with normalcy. He then laughs at what he does and takes unexpected delight in it. This Joker is not like so. He's simply a disturbed psychopath who likes to blow up things and harm others. There's no depth to the character. C. Harvey Dent has been traditionally Black the last 2 decades. That and the way he's made into Two-Face in this movie is totally wrong. Two-Face traditionally goes on to become a crime boss but in this movie, he simply dies soon after coming into being. He also isn't a good Two-Face, overusing his coin flip to make decisions. For example, in the limousine scene he flips the coin again and kills the driver in order to eliminate a crime boss. The real Two-Face wouldn't have cheated like this once the coin makes a decision for him. D. Batman himself doesn't appear much in the movie. We are shown glimpses of him and the fight scenes are very darkly lit so it's hard to see who and how he's fighting. His over-reliance on technology is also not good because Batman usually uses wits as well as brawn. The voice of Batman is guttural sounding and Bruce Wayne himself doesn't seem to have any emotions. Micheal Keaton's portrayal of Batman in Batman (made in 1989) is by far the best in all movies. The Dark Knight is not just not a good Batman film. It's a poor film in any genre. I recommend watching Batman (1989) if one wants to see an excellent Batman film. Here's a small sample from this great movie that's better than the entire The Dark Knight: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC249jPbBDY
7.0~Something still missing davies-michael54 Sign in Permalink Dark Knight is better than Batman Begins. There is a sequence near the end of Batman Begis where the Scarecrows plan takes shape that is still a better script piece than most of Dark Knight. I know lots of people love this movie and I can see why its so popular. But like all the expectation around the first Batman movie 20 years after the spin off movies with Adam West and about 20 years before the Chris Nolan ones, the movie featuring Jack Nicholson also left a sense of disappointment. Everythings in place but its not moody and dark enough. The Dark Knight doesn't have the sense of torment in Bruce Wayne. He responds to the threat to Gotham in an action movie and there ins't the sense of torment or darkness in Christian Bale. The comments by other characters are the closest the film gets to moral dilemma. The best of the films production is in the performances. Gary Oldman as the ruffled and confused Gordon whose determination overcomes this. He's made to look ordinary and plain. This makes his character the more sympathetic. Harvey Dent is an outstanding character. His torment, pain and emotions are from an earlier era that we don't see much anymore as CGI and running around appear to substitute for story and acting. Heath Ledger's Joker is as everyone says a revelation. Its very different from Nicholson's performance and no weaker in comparison.
5.0~First impression from someone who did not like it zrezvi Sign in Permalink What?! Someone did not love this action-packed blockbuster? Blasphemy! I eventually watched the movie everybody is talking about last Friday. I gave a lot of thought whether I should write a review ...Well why not? I have been actively watching movies for over 35 years so I do feel I have an opinion to share. Why should I join the rest of the enthusiastic crowd, waving a red book and hailing director Chris Nolan as a genius? Now, don't get me wrong, I did not hate the movie...OK, let's start on the good bits: * The first 20 minutes were brilliant: the pace, the editing, the music, photography and dialogues...All the ingredients to prepare the audience for a good show. * Bale's portrayal of Batman is exemplary: dark, fast and furious. * Some of the action sequences were excellent including the Batcycle * And....That's it! Sure, Ledger's performance as a Joker was very good, not groundbreaking though. And yes, he certainly brought another dimension to the character. But he did not have the same impact or wicked humour (we are talking about a joker after all) as Nicholson's. For a film of this scale, there were too many 'dead time', i.e. scenes with loads of cheesy dialogues and no action. For a long movie like this one, one needs to keep the audience on the edge of their seat. Take last summer's Transformer, the film was too long for me but still kept a good pace of action sequences. The biggest problem with The Dark Knight was simple: too many characters and story lines. Sometime after the first 20 minutes, Nolan lost it: the movie was no longer about the capped crusader the film was named after but a whole series of people trying to distinguish good vs evil. The 90's Batman movies failed for the very reasons: loss of focus when there were too many characters involved. I reckon the film should have been called 'Harvey's lost it'. Do I regret watching it? No...So this film comes very neutral: some good scenes but not worthy of the praise it has received. For the record, Sam Raimy's first Spider-man remains for me the 'perfect' super-hero movie of recent time: simple, well-structured, with a comic book feel and a nice mix of dialogues and action sequences.
9.0~'If you're good at something, never do it for free' fidelio7 Sign in Permalink 'The Dark Knight' is a dazzling epic filled with excellent performances and incredible action sequences. It is a triumph on pretty much every front and, while perhaps it does not quite reach the dizzy heights of director Christopher Nolan's more recent 'Inception', it still packs a mighty punch. Christian Bale reprises his role of billionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne whose alter-ego, the superhero Batman, is the 'dark knight' of the film's title. Bale really captures the torment of Wayne; he is still clearly haunted by the cold and heartless murder of his parents all those years ago. And it is a real treat to see Eric Roberts as a slimy crime boss named Salvatore Maroni. But the real scene stealer here is the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Ledger plays him as an unpredictable and dangerous psychopath and never overdoes it or chews the scenery for a second. The other actors - as good as they are - do not stand a chance when Ledger is on screen; he steals every scene that he is in. The film features a spectacular car chase in which an eighteen-wheel rig is flipped right over lengthwise, and Nolan has assembled a dream cast which includes Maggie Gyllenhaal as Bruce's love interest Rachel Dawes, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. This reboot of the 'Batman' franchise which began with 'Batman Begins', also directed by Nolan, is a resounding success. There is darkness but there is also light, as the result of the ferry standoff in the film's third act demonstrates. 'The Dark Knight' is a brilliant and well-constructed film which just keeps on getting it right.
1.0~What was it even about?? music_chick_7592 Sign in Permalink I've never seen Batman Begins....but my friends told me I'd get The Dark Knight anyway....they were way wrong. This movie has either no plot at all... or a plot so complex that the average person won't get it at all. What's up with the mob thing, it was never explained it any way shape or form, and the movie was thrown into chaos so quickly that I sat through the whole 2 and a half hours of it trying to figure out what the heck was going on. My friends told me that the first one was so much better, but I don't know if I even want to see it after this pathetic attempt at a movie. If your looking for something to see, skip The Dark Knight...and see Mamma Mia. Now that's a movie everyone would absolutely love.
8.0~Dark and frightening with a towering and memorable antagonist - you couldn't ask for much more! The_Void Sign in Permalink In 2005, director Christopher Nolan gave the ailing Batman franchise a successful reboot with the very well made 'Batman Begins', and of course it was very well received. A sequel was, naturally, always going to be on the cards and it's been delivered in the form of The Dark Knight; a film that follows on directly from the first film and manages to continue the story in a way that is interesting and at times frightening, and does it better than the first film did. Once again we focus on Gotham City. Things have started to change for the better as more and more criminals are being taken off the street. This is thanks in part to the mysterious masked marauder known as Batman; but police officer Jim Gordon and district attorney Harvey Dent are also partly to thank. However, things are plunged into chaos when The Joker enters the fray and begins to shake things up; specifically going after Batman. Batman soon realises he must stop The Joker and his wave of terror at all costs; but the battle may push him to his very limits. Batman Begins was all about showing the creation of Bruce Wayne and Batman and my biggest problem with it was that the film really lacked a definite villain. Having got the character creation out of way, this leaves director Christopher Nolan free to explore other characters and areas of the plot, and it pays off very well indeed. There are a lot of different characters and elements to the story and things move very quickly; but the skillful way that the film is presented ensures that the important elements are focused on enough. The success of the film is thanks mostly to the fantastic Joker character and the director's willingness to take the film further than you would expect a comic book movie to go. The Joker is a thoroughly dark villain; a maniacal anarchistic psychopath who goes round forcing blades into people's mouths and blowing things up, and this gives the film a very dark edge. The tone of the movie is also very skilfully handled; Nolan portrays the efforts of the crime fighters in making the city a better place to live, so when things are actually plunged into chaos - we feel bad for the people living in the city - which is pretty impressive when you consider that Gotham City is a fictional place. A lot of the hype surrounding this movie was due to the unfortunate premature death of Heath Ledger. I have to admit that I've not seen a great deal of his earlier performances but this last performance really highlights what a great loss his death was for cinema. Heath Ledger creates a villain that, while distinctively comic book; is also very real and frightening for that reason. He completely owns every scene he's in and this is a performance that will go down in history as one of the greatest antagonists on film. The rest of the cast is very good too. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all step into their roles from the first film effectively and provide good performances, while Christian Bale continues to provide the 'perfect; Batman; although for me he's even better simply as Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as the love interest is even better in the role. She's not a natural beauty, but she was easy enough on my eyes and always convinces as a female lawyer. Aaron Eckhart is the biggest standout outside of Ledgar, however, with his turn as Harvey Dent. I wasn't impressed with him (or anything else) in The Black Dahlia; but here he hits the upstanding politician nail directly on the head and manages to make us care about his character. Despite being based on a comic book, everything in the film is taken very seriously and the characters are one of the most important things about it. As you would expect, there's plenty of action and fighting too; and the two come into balance very well to ensure that The Dark Knight works as a complete whole. Naturally, all the hype surrounding the film does go just a little too far - but there's no denying that this is a definite triumph on the whole and deserves its place as one of the best comic book films ever made.
1.0~Convoluted farce Chromex Sign in Permalink I loved Batman Begins. It advanced from Burton's shallow fun and brought him reality. Naturally I expected yet more from Goyer and Nolan. Boy was I wrong. This "movie" is a nerdy fanboy jerk fest. The hype it has received is so unjustifiable that it can only be the product of Warner marketing and fanboy Internet manipulation; no film can go to #1 on IMDb in 48 HOURS without prior orchestration. While a final reckoning between Batman and Gotham's lowest is inspired the story becomes a mess of plot lunacy. The Joker's great but I was dumbstruck to watch the camera suck off Ledger's performance to wallpaper over plot chasms, generally shallow characters and a complete lack of the Dark Knight himself. Where is Batman in this movie!? He is nothing, a playboy billionaire on a yacht who wrecks Lamborghini's in a vain attempt to prove he's a hero. He didn't prove it to me one shred. Batman Begins reveals Wayne as a tortured soul making the world a better place for the memory of his mother and father. His moral code here was impossible to track. He mocks other vigilantes with high school quips about hockey while they get murdered (along with many) for what they believe. Isn't what they believe what he believes? Claims he mustn't kill (comic lore) as its immoral but happily jams shut a police interrogation door so he can beat six bells out of the Joker. It seemed to me that Gordon and Dent with the placid Ms. Dawes were in the moral front line while Batman lurks in shadows. All Mr. Wayne contributes are ridiculous gizmo's for epileptic action scenes. Batbike's tripping trucks like Skywalker tripping an ATAT, cell phones become security cameras, Gatling guns that rebuild bullets so we can scrutinise fingerprints for no good reason, another bat-suit, Lamborghini's & yacht lounging, need I go on? The worse effect of this is do you even need Batman? Consider a film with Gordon and Dent fighting alone against the Joker's criminal nihilism. They battle and win only for Dent to be consumed by his war against evil. Sounds good? I was watching that fine movie until they wrote Batman into it! And when the Batman spoke at all it was digitised alligator gruff tone that made me laugh. The story ricochets everywhere. Hong Kong, a Gotham come Miami and through multiple plots until you're just enjoying the cinematography during another action yawn. After two hours I could not care who did what or why, least of all Batman. This film resembled an over hyped episode of "24", complete with real-time "waronterror" inspirations, to such a degree I wondered if Jack Bauer would make a better Batman. At least he would have been at the forefront of events a little more. For a superhero the Dark Knight was an amoral superflop. The culmination of this movie's propensity for absurdity it the arrival of Two Face. His injury from some of the Joker's mountain of bombs is ridiculous. No human being could come close to surviving this let alone check out of a hospital to roam the streets for revenge. But it was done for the comic owner's need to make the silly real for fans and ultimately that's what this film is about. Dark Knight's biggest error is its script editing. It seems most of the writing is done by the Nolan brothers with just minor input from Goyer. Has the studio let the Nolan boys run amuck? Every idea they have come up with (or stole from "24") is crammed into this film until it explodes. Some don't rate Goyer but he has more experience writing and may have controlled (a few must be his) the absurd elements and kept pacing sensible. This film is also far detached from Nolan's previous work (Prestige, Momento) and is either a poorly conceived sortie into action adventure on his part or the studio's yanked the rug from under him. It does appear Warner's sponging off Ledger's unfortunate demise with him receiving TRIPLE screen time from Batman. Bale also seems bored when he performs. He has always liked deep complex characters to play so I suspect he was also unimpressed with the script. Batman Begins was outstanding but IMHO The Dark Knight lets its predecessor down in spectacular fashion. I won't say don't see it. Do and make up your own mind. If you are one of the happy, brain washed masses that love The Dark Knight because Warner/DC says you should then enjoy. However, I am not one of them. Sorry Bat fans.
10.0~"as great as an great epic" oojjcorp Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolen has redefined the art of story telling.I am quite happy to say this is best movie in my life time,and i have already seen it thrice.Movie has shown that superhero stories are not those which can be taken lightly. Story tells us being a super hero is not a glamorous job, it need dedication ,preparation, you will do everything right, and for the welfare of the people,still you end up on loosing side. Same thing happens in the movie , Batman end up in miserable condition. and Villens are glorified,even in reality same thing happening. Movie can be seen as true form art which is as great as an great epic which really teaches lessons of life.Even though movie has great stunts it don't push children or people to try them at home because it also shows how much preparation those stunt need.My friends go watch it!
2.0~Pathetic, Unbelievable, now in my Trash Can jazznightcat Sign in Permalink I finally finished watching this movie on DVD, and it was a big disappointment. It was very poorly made and very poorly written. The believability factor is almost zero. If the film was going for fantasy, fine, but it is seeking realism. There are many aspects of the movie which are completely unbelievable. While the Joker can not catch the armoured truck with bazookas and taking down a helicopter, somehow he could catch and tie up two of the main characters. How? We don't know. We weren't shown that. But he did it! In the scene where the helicopter is taken down, the armoured truck turned randomly from the underground passage to a street. So how did the Joker's men know which street to be on? Speaking of his men, where do they come from? Since he proves himself willing to kill and discard his own guys on a whim, why does anyone continue to work for him? What kind of mob boss shows up for the money with almost no guys? But the joker, who burns their money, he has lots of guys. This is the school of film-making where you can just write whatever you want. It's very apparent. That makes for a rather pathetic viewing experience. Near the end where Dent explains his motivation: I could not believe a film of such supposedly high calibre reached like that. It's like a kindergarten melodrama. And notice the two choices, either him or Batman. Why not Mr. X? Or Ms R? Or the Joker? No. No. We're writing this script the way we want to: stupidly. And by the way, you kill the Joker. Dead. Again, we see more and more in the pathetic school of film-making that has become somewhat dominant, the bad guys aren't killed, they just fall off a cliff, or stumble, or something. Why give the audience the satisfaction of watching this piece of crap buy a bullet.
9.0~"The Dark Knight" is pretty flawless!! , and the greatest film ever made!!!!! aseniorm Sign in Permalink First of all, yet I can not leave my amazement of what I witnessed tonight, the film is fulfilling the very high expectations that had been put into it. History has been so carefully worked and which did not suffer from absences by any side. The new Batman is a hero misunderstood that after working hard to Gotham City is located which remains one of the most feared dangers of the city. The police does not give you rest your help but recognize that what at first could be a model for workers of law has become a paradigm for bands that try to take advantage of their presence. The film has everything you should have a film Batman: Special effects, action, violence, drama and a lot of adrenaline. But however Batman is not the character who most striking but Joker, played by the late Heath Ledger who makes an excellent performance of a psychopath fun, sadistic, sarcastic, arguably masochist both highly intelligent and clever, this character together with the performance was perfect and amazing. In the case of Harvey Dent will not be left behind, not in vain as outlined in the film that his motto in the police unit is anti-crime Two Faces. His attitude of endless struggle against corruption is highlighted by a coldness that frightens. As soon shown to blunt the violent attitude of some, as becomes a man who let their uncontrolled acts are directed by the questionable fate that mark a coin. The film is full of surprises, betrayals, and revealed secrets that will prove crucial for the fantastic saga and, without hesitation, make a probable third another cornerstone in the new vision the dark knight. This is definitely a masterpiece.
1.0~Dark Knight ...an appropriate title, but goes too far awsettle-1 Sign in Permalink Granted, I'm not a huge "splosion" fan, but walking out of the theater after just seeing this film, I am appalled. I feel like a Roman who has just witnessed a tiger maul a man. Why wasn't this rated R? Why do we as a society think movies like this are amazing, let alone acceptable? I am an English teacher; the symbolism and social commentary were not lost on me, but at what point are dramatically violent scenes in a movie ultimately contributing to more violence in our communities? What price do we pay as a society to entertain our growing need to witness this level of destruction . . . using school buses to rob banks and murder? Blowing up hospitals? Pointing guns to children's heads? This has gone past harmless entertainment, particularly when it's witnessed by younger children (there were a number of 6-9 year-old boys in my showing that ended at midnight). Needless to say, I will not be seeing a third installment of the franchise, and will be encouraging people (at least the last five on the planet who haven't seen it) to avoid this film.
7.0~Good movie but grossly overrated lazydude3214 Sign in Permalink For a summer superhero movie, this is a great film to watch; however, in terms of greatest movies of all time, it is in no way number 3. It baffles me how some moviegoers could be so dumb. This is a good movie, but people grossly overrated it. The performances were great especially ledger who in my mind should get an Oscar nomination. - I enjoyed the movies darker grittier feel and I believe Nolan did a good job projecting that feel. - Etc... However, I believe there are no moments in the film that are really that revolutionary in terms of film making. The plot was not difficult to figure out: introduce the Joker, Batman fights the Joker, captures the Joker but OH NO!!! He tricked us, Batman fights the Joker against tremendous odds and of course wins. The basic plot was well presented though by Nolan who I believe has a very very bright future in Film making. This movie is very good but does not deserve the place it was awarded, although I think it can fit into a good spot on the top 250 list. But the lack of genre defining moments limit it to be merely a very good yet generic summer movie. Although I do believe that the Nolan era Batman movies take a giant dump on the previous Batman series which sucked.
5.0~Disappointing... ubersoldat_47 Sign in Permalink I have registered here at IMDb just now, because I continuously fail to see how this movie is no.1 on the top 250 list...I've seen this movie 3 times in order to get a good impression of it and not to miss any parts. So, I have seen quite a few movies myself, and I think this movie was just a bit above average...Thanks to Heath Ledger and partly to Aaron Eckhart... True, I've never seen better performances of the two, but the rest of the movie was just disappointing... Just a few things I'd like to note: Heath ledger was amazing. Though not the best performance in the last decade. Not even close. Just remember Edward Norton in American History X or in Fight Club, or maybe Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York and There will be blood, or Javier Bardem in No country for old men, or Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal, or Russell Crowe in Gladiator and A beautiful mind, or Samuel Jackson in Resurrecting the Champ, Whitaker in Ghost Dog...I swear I could go on and on and on. And that's just the LAST DECADE. Aaron Eckhart was a surprise. Bale was a disappointment. Whoever wants to see the REAL Bale should watch RESCUE DAWN. The best Batman AND superhero movie so far. I was disappointed to see how the Joker never actually told any jokes, nor did he laugh hysterically most of the time, though I do like the portrayal. Nolan was good. Good, not Very good or excellent or perfect. The movie is too much an imitation of HEAT. All in all, the movie was entertaining, though not even close to a masterpiece. This movie in the top 250? B L A S P H E M Y Cheers everyone, hope you enjoy the movie more than I did.
1.0~Disappointment creekside-3 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is a great director. He several great movies under his belt such as: Memento, The Prestige, and Batman Begins. I loved these. And so when that's why I went to see The Dark Knight, I expected something great; I heard people praising it as 'a masterpiece', or 'best movie in 10 years'. So I saw it. Major disappointment. I walked out of the theatre befuddled; "So that's what the hype was all about?" Although Ledger completely owns the role of the Joker and he gives a fantastic performance that must be seen, the movie surrounding it is at times mediocre. The pacing, character arcs, direction and impact of the movie are all flawed. The ending was pretty terrible too. Its not a bad movie and I'd give it a 7/10 but I must vote a 1 because of all the fanboys that are blinded by the hype.
5.0~Well done but way too over the top intp Sign in Permalink Just re-watched "Dark Knight" (2008), from the purchased Blu-Ray trilogy. I had rented this once years ago but had not seen it since then. My opinion about this movie has not changed. Sure, it was well done, but I still am mystified by the incredible adulation this movie gets. The single thing that I hated the most was the incredibly ridiculous, over-the-top effectiveness of the Joker. Come on. Even if he was connected like, say, someone in the Trust from 100 Bullets (a comic book reference), he couldn't have pulled off the grandiose schemes that he executes flawlessly again and again. Then, add on top of that, he's supposed be a psychopathic mad dog, and it becomes utter nonsense. "World's greatest detective" is transformed into guy desperately trying to stop someone who's so much better than he is that it's not even funny. Some of the basic themes of the movie were interesting and well done, like the idea of the Joker that everyone is just one bad day from being like him (the same basic theme in "Killing Joke"). But really, if the Joker could pull the stunts he did in this movie, he could have had the entire country on its knees in days. Sheesh. Sorry, I just couldn't suspend my disbelief that far. Not only would one need to have incredibly meticulous planning, one would also need inconceivable resources, of the sort that a derelict like the Joker would never even come close to having. This bothered me so much that I just couldn't enjoy the movie. I agree, though, that Ledger's performance was quite amazing. He stole the show. I thought Batman Begins was very much the better movie. I haven't yet seen "Dark Knight Rises" so I'm hoping it's more in the vein of the first movie than the second.
1.0~this movie is propaganda - all you people are just lambs for the slaughter zeepoli Sign in Permalink why does everyone like this movie? it's not particularly that good. and everything in it is just so so wrong. it's OK for the government and the people in charge to lie to the masses? the masses (that's you) are too stupid to rule themselves? it's OK to use people's private cell phone info? (oh just this one time... morgan freeman says... thanks) this is a fascist film. it is fascist propaganda wake up people you should be outraged the movie is tell the audience you are idiots and look how easily we control you and make you think this is some great movie and look how much money we can make off your desperate desires... thank god obama became president - this movie seemed to be financed by the bush administrative prepping people for more BS. who is this batman? oh so troubled batman? he's a rich white boy with guilt - he doesn't want to play along so he goes out and inflicts the masses with his own morals - which turns out to be exactly the same as his fellow rich white boys that rule. poor little rich white boy... this is a scary scary propaganda movie. ten years from now we'll look back at this in horror.
10.0~Apparently, The Best Movie Of All Time Should Have Every Type Of Genre. So... Razor-Lazor Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is in fact the greatest film of all time. Tons of action, many laughs, lots of chills and thrills, and many more. The acting is truly superb, mainly by Bale and the late Heath Ledger. The story really sets it aside from your average comic book movie because it's dark, chilling, and most of all...real. I went into the movie with high expectations and came out shocked. Some say it was too long and I agree that it was a tad longer than it should have been, but when you look back at scenes they should have cut out, you just can't do it. Every scene was filled with this cinematic magic that pulls you right into the screen. Would I recommend The Dark Knight? Yes. Would I recommend it to a child? Maybe, if the parents saw it first and made sure it was OK. This movie should win many awards this year, because not only is The Dark Knight the greatest movie of the year, it's the greatest of all time.
1.0~Not better than Tim Burton's Batman jyrgen755 Sign in Permalink I went to see this movie with no expectations at all, because I'm not a fan of Batman and big budget Hollywood movies usually disappoint me. Although I think this movie is totally overrated, I liked the Joker character played by Heath Ledger and the story was OK too. The film itself was week in my opinion, it depended too much on the action and it didn't deserve to be titled "The Dark Knight" at all. Tim Burton's Batman was much more dark in my opinion and there was more of an artistic element to it while TDK was just an action movie. Despite of all, I completely understand why people like it. This movie has enough action and special effects to entertain most people and a pretty good story for an action movie, but I certainly think that it doesn't deserve to be third in IMDb Top250.
7.0~TDK, a solid superhero movie, nothing more apfelkornmetijs Sign in Permalink After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldn't wait to see this movie. Man was i disappointed. Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar. Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent. But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws. Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didn't like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion. There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it. All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, that's crazy. It's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it. Happy to share my feel about this movie, Realkane

10.0~Oscar for Heath Ledger os_raza Sign in Permalink One of the Best Performances I have ever seen. He has acted with such originality leaving behind all other performances in the movie. Specially the sequence where he blows the hospital. I must admit before watching that movie I was very hesitant to go to theater, however, during and after I saw it there was only one thing in my mind, It was worth while. Christian Bale and Morgen Freeman are so mature actors, one doesn't need any words to describe there acting level. Overall the film is nice and action and stunt sequences are great. Hats down for the Cast and Crew of the Film.
10.0~A Masterpiece ckolet37 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight not only pushes the boundaries to be a better super hero film, it not only pushes the boundaries to be a better drama- it pushes the boundaries of masterpiece. It is a near-perfect depiction of how one man can really make a difference, good or bad. This makes the film more compelling than the average action film. I will not go into detail about Heath Ledger's performance, but in short, it changed the industry. If you haven't seen this film yet, exit this page, don't rent the movie, BUY it, and just watch it until you realize that you are seeing a film of class, and quality, and know that every second that goes by is worth it.
9.0~Review from deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com joecunningham14 Sign in Permalink Whether it be due to Heath Ledger's tragic death, suggestions of a posthumous Oscar, box-office records tumbling by the day, assault allegations made against Christian Bale, the protracted viral marketing campaign or maybe because it is the sequel to the hugely successful 'Batman Begins' - there can be no doubt that 'The Dark Knight' is the most talked about and most eagerly anticipated film of the year. The level of hype has been intense and although ultimately 'The Dark Knight' can't quite live up to the (arguably unattainable) levels of expectation that have been created...it doesn't fall too far short. We return to a Gotham City much changed from the one we left in 'Batman Begins', the mob are beginning to fall thanks to the efforts of our masked vigilante hero, it is very much a city at a crossroads. Bruce Wayne is hoping that his cleansing of Gotham's criminal underbelly will soon be over so that he can hang up his cape and hand over crime-fighting duties to the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). But in their desperation the mob turn to the mysterious Joker (Heath Ledger), a fearless anarchist who thrives on the existence of Batman and provides him with his toughest test. The Joker operates outside Batman's comfort zone, Gotham's noir daytime turns stereotypes on their heads as Ledger's villain terrorises in a light that Batman will never stray into. Director Christopher Nolan has created a complex beast; an action movie with ideas. So in amongst the motorbike chases, truck flipping, buildings exploding, bank robberies and murders there is a genuine sense of intelligent film-making and a complexity that is notably lacking from it's contemporaries. The word 'hero' is not a straightforward term and Nolan plays on it's ambiguity as he questions as to whether Batman is inadvertently creating more problems than he is solving. Is Batman the hero that Gotham needs, wants or deserves? As well as citing Michael Mann's 'Heat' as inspiration, much has also been drawn from the various Batman graphic novels. Ironically this is a film which has been hailed by critics as less a comic book movie than a 'crime thriller', when actually it is one of the most heavily influenced by it's source material. The lead characters are also carefully constructed - in what could effectively be described as a battle of the masked freaks. In 'Batman Begins' crime created Batman, in 'The Dark Knight' Batman has created crime. The characters of The Joker and Batman are carefully balanced and their symmetry is superbly crafted. Inevitably Heath Ledger does steal the show, his performance is irresistible and every bit as iconic as his Brokeback role. It's not so much that he overshadows Bale, far from it, but his screen presence is electrifying as he creates possibly the most charismatic criminal ever to grace our screens. Perhaps the most fitting tribute one can place upon his performance is that he not only matches Jack Nicholson's execution of the same role, but renders it almost forgettable. But this is very much an ensemble piece (which is precisely why we should be talking about Ledger for Best Supporting Actor, not Best Actor) and Bale displays once again why he is to Batman what Connery is to Bond. He suitably encompasses the three sides of the character, Bruce Wayne's playboy pretence, the real Bruce Wayne and The Dark Knight himself. Aaron Eckhart most notably is superbly cast and hasn't had the credit he deserves for the role, while Gary Oldman returns in usual fine form. The weakest cast member from the predecessor, Katie Holmes, is gone and has been replaced in the role of Rachel Dawes by Maggie Gyllenhaal. I had high expectations for the actress whom I am usually a great fan of but sadly she disappoints in unsuccessfully trying to recreate Holmes' character whilst also attempting to make the role her own. Despite a running time of over two and a half hours the plot never lags and despite brief spells of incoherence Nolan's story arc pushes all the right buttons. However, it's not all plain sailing. There is a severe lack of emotional depth in the characters which is highlighted most clearly after a key twist towards the end of the second act, in this respect Nolan's ideas got the better of him. The social experiment sequence also seems misplaced and unnecessary which unfortunately weakens the impact of Batman's final showdown with The Joker. And on a slightly different note, whoever was responsible for Batman's voice needs to go to their room and think about what they did, because that grating voice was simply excruciating. I shall not however sign off on a sour note. It is a fantastic film. It is a fitting epitaph for Ledger. It does deserve the box office and critical success. It is the greatest comic book movie made to date. Verdict: Everyone should and probably will see it. Not perfect by any means but wonderful nonetheless. The prospect of another sequel would be mouth-watering, Johnny Depp as The Riddler anyone?
10.0~Simple the best superhero movie!!!! **** out of **** tbest_maya Sign in Permalink I really hope a good movie, but never a peace of art, a really excellent movie with excellent interpretations, good photography, very good story, a combination of action with crime, drama, thriller and film-noir. Christopher Nolan is really an excellent director, and he prove it once more after making very good movies as Batman Begins and The Prestige. What can i said about Ledger? i really can said that is amazing playing The Joker, totally different to the Burton joker, this more terrific an anarchist and a physic. I think this movie will receive many nominations for Oscar, is really a classic. And another excellent point of this movie, Gary Oldman playing Gordon, i really enjoyed the interpretation, he maintains you with many entertainment in the movie, he did a good job with Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane, bringing the picture dramatic sense and many humanity. Bale was good, he was born for the interpretation; Eckhart was regular after he was the Two-Face, he lose all the equilibrium. I really recommend you to see this, very exciting, excellent soundtrack by Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, very good editing and excellent sound. Very Good action scenes, Intense Thriller sequences and very realistic story are the requisites to see this Spectacular Drama.
6.0~Bit of a mess, and far too long aadamtx Sign in Permalink Some caveats to begin with: I haven't seen any of the Batman movies since the one with Schwarzenegger, and I never heard of Frank Miller until the SIN CITY movie came out. I'm also old enough to fondly recall the silliness of the TV series, Christian Bale as a young boy actor, and Heath Ledger when he was just another middlin' teen actor. Anyway. I went to a matinée showing this afternoon, mainly since everyone else seemed to be going to see this film, and figured I'd at least be entertained. Well. First off, the film is far too long. A few people left well before the halfway mark, and at one point I was afraid it was never going to end (not realizing it was clocking it at over 2.5 hours). The whole money laundering plot could have been cut down, and the sequence in Hong Kong eliminated altogether (and maybe a lot of the ferryboat sequence). A two hour film would have come off much better for those of us who aren't Batman aficionados. The Two-Face sequence could also have been cut--why introduce another villain when the film is almost over? Speaking of villains, so what happens to the Joker? The last I recall, he's dangling from a skyscraper, and I was waiting for some sort of resolution for his character. Granted that the plot is pretty simplistic--Joker sets up situation, Batman to the rescue (sounds like the Die Hard movies, come to think of it)--but the writers seem to think that throwing everything imaginable into one script makes for good writing. We've seen it all before, from the flawed hero (SHANE and HIGH NOON come to mind, along with THE SEARCHERS) to the exploding buildings to the car chases. Speaking of which (again), was I the only one thinking 'FRENCH CONNECTION' during the chase sequence with Dent in the back of the SWAT wagon? The acting was OK--it's not Shakespeare, after all, or even Paddy Chayevsky--but I think Ledger's performance is being over-hyped. Then again, I preferred Nicholson--now THAT was a memorable performance. Good to see Eric Roberts still able to get into a big-draw movie, but Caine and Freeman seemed wasted in what were essentially extended cameos. It'll be interesting to see, after a couple of years have passed, whether THE DARK KNIGHT has staying power. Remember the hype over TITANIC? Lots of oohs and aahs over that film, but most critics will agree that A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is a better film overall. Who know what the rest of 2008 will bring us?
3.0~I'll tell you why so serious GoldmundX Sign in Permalink I'm pretty serious about this one because I love movies. And since this movie is being rated as the best movie of all time, I was expecting something that could measure itself with the great movies of all time. I expected a movie that grips you, crawls under your skin and leaves you breathless. It does none of that. It is pretentious and inconsistent. It pretends to dig deep and dark and explore themes like morality, fate, good versus evil, heart versus mind, madness versus reason, and at the same time it wants to be this big spectacular action movie. But it fails miserably. It's all just a big clumsy pretentious inconsistent mess. Yes, Ledger is good, but for his performance to really contribute to the movie, there should have been context. If the rest just doesn't feel right, it looses its potential. If you throw a diamond on a mountain of poop, it doesn't change much of the way it looks or smells. Love interest Maggie Gyllenhaal (great performance in Stranger than Fiction) produces no chemistry at all, so I wasn't really blown away when she was blown up. Editing feels weird. But most of all it was the inconsistencies that got to me. And then not just the 'practical' ones (like the inconsistent protective quality of the batman suit; or why leave an extremely dangerous criminal unrestrained with a tubby policeman in his cell ('hostage volunteer? you, tubby?'); a schoolbus is used twice to make a grand escape? - do they come with teleporter machines these days?; why would you want to ride your batmobile face down?; Batman lowers his voice to be unrecognizable, but how hard is it to follow a batmobile with a helicopter to its hiding place?), but more importantly it's crucial plot/ morality inconsistencies. Yes, the White Knight went through some traumatic experiences, but to turn to the dark side so wholeheartedly and sadistically? And then to just let the Joker (at least indirectly responsible for his trauma) walk when he only needs to pull the trigger? Oh yeah, forgot, he's Mr. Coin Toss now. But even if he is guided by blind fate now, he still determines himself who he goes after and whether it's OK to threaten to blow out the brains of little kids. And then the Big Bad criminal who throws the detonator out off the window. Ah! The Joke is on you Joker! People are not what you make them out to be. Even the baddest bad ass has a good heart. Never mind that just before when the Joker threatened to blow up a hospital unless an innocent lawyer was killed, there was a crowd with guns ready to shoot the guy within no time. Also, what with the vote on the 'good people boat'? They vote to blow up the 'bad people' (democracy at its finest) but then Nobody has the balls to do it? So they don't blow up the other boat because they think it's unjust, but because they're spineless hypocrites. I applaud movies that try and deal with complex issues like conflicting emotions or morals, but to just make a big soup of it all under the pretense of 'but that's how life works, it's conflicting ideas, feelings and actions' is just a weak excuse for the inability or laziness to produce a good consistent story. Believe me, I detest black and white thinking and applaud the exploration of the Grey area. But that's not what this movie does. Piling a bunch of random inconsistent ideas on top of each other is not equal to exploring the Grey area. The climax is the ending though (it usually is). Our dark knight has to sacrifice himself, has to live like a hunted animal in the shadow, because the People would not be able to cope with the idea of Denth doing bad things, despite his recent traumas. So it's better to LIE to the public, because they are too stupid to make up their own mind and their faith in goodness of man would be lost forever (despite the fact that they just tried to establish with the boat-thing that there's goodness even in big bad criminals). So Batman (whose enemies take advantage of the fact that he doesn't kill) takes the blame for a bunch of random killings that could have been linked to anyone - a Joker perhaps? (even if they wanted to absolve Denth from his crimes -I mean, evidence/motive would have been needed to link it to Batman too?) and goes off running ('run Forrest!') into the night to save us another day. Because you just can't trust people to make up their own mind, it's better to lie to them. It's for their own good. Great morale. Straight from the White House? But ey, why so serious?
10.0~Introduce a little Anarchy!!! Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews Sign in Permalink The best superhero movie ever. The whole movie i never lost interest and there were moments of almost unbearable suspense. I have never been more excited to see a movie. The Joker was excellent. The first time i went on to the Dark knight page i saw that The Joker was going to be played by Heath Ledger. I thought Heath Ledger? really. I thought he would suck. Then i saw the trailer then my 'Heath is gonna suck' thoughts were blown up in my face he looked awesome. When i left the movie i thought he was beyond awesome he was incredible. He had delivered the best performance from anyone that i have seen. It was like Hannibal Lector only better. If he doesn't win the awards then the awards are rigged. When i see characters being portrayed all i see is a actor. When i saw Ledger's Joker i saw a sadistic maniac. Sadly Heath Ledger died. This is a perfect performance to have on your final(completed)film. I highly recommend this. Nolan really knows how to make a movie. Every single thing in this movie was superb(except for Bale's Batman voice). Drop everything and go see it now. It was worth the wait. It is one of my favorites. 10/10
1.0~Worst Superhero Movie Ever Made PaulyD123 Sign in Permalink This is easily the worst superhero movie I have ever seen. Christian Bale, with his lisping American accent is the worst Batman to have ever worn the costume and the digitizing of his voice only serves to make him appear more ridiculous. This movie will bludgeon your senses in its desperation to entertain - it is very, very loud and there is enough broken metal and glass to start a recycling plant. The plot is so fast and frenetic that it rarely makes any sense, and just when it begins to, it is immediately off in another direction. Plot threads start and stop every three minutes it seems. Aaron Eckhart is a fine actor, but whose idea was it that he should walk around in the last thirty minutes with half of his face burned off. Perhaps somebody should explain to the writers that burn patients who walk around exposed like that are highly prone to infection and don't live long. Yet this guy parades around like it's just another day in the park with half his face missing and no bandages. It was as grotesque and gratuitous as it was silly. I guess it's what you do when your movie doesn't have much to say. The movie has an impressive lineup of movie stars - standouts are Eckhart, Oldman, Caine and Roberts. They are all very good but none is good enough to save this misfire. And then there's Morgan Freeman. Is there any movie made these days that doesn't have Morgan Freeman in it? He is so overexposed that he has become a bit of a joke. He is also in one of the most ridiculous scenes in the film where he stands befuddled in front of a bunch of TV monitors. This is another one of many scenes filmed with high energy and no sense at all. As if all of this wasn't bad enough, this thing lumbers on for two and a half very long hours. Aren't we all a little tired of the superhero who is 'conflicted'? When I hear people talking about academy awards for this film, it is a reminder to me of how the industry equates bigger with better. If you want bigger, this might be your film. If you want better, look elsewhere.
3.0~A Sad Movie jurandyrsf Sign in Permalink As much as Adam West and Burt Ward took the Caped Crusader to the goofy extreme of his incarnations' scale, this movie took him to the opposite, un-Batman-like, dark extreme of it. You leave the movie with a very bad feeling, that's all. If I wanted to see what the movie shows, I wouldn't have looked for a Bat-movie. It's just one very sad movie. Impressions aside, here is a more objective analysis: 1. Why can't screen writers just change the plot when an actress doesn't feel like reliving her role? If Katie Holmes didn't want a rerun, why just not leave her character out of the movie? Using another actress to replace her is just a very bad idea! It doesn't work. It didn't work. 2. One more comic hero movie where a recurrent villain in the comics dies at his very first appearance in the movie. Hello Harvey! Adieu, Harvey! It looks like those guys can't resist the temptation of repeating that bad formula, as well as the equally bad formula of putting at least to recurring villains together in the same movie... 3. Just one more Joker-movie... 4. Bat-fighting: Batman Begins hit the spot in terms of choreography, fighting style and speed, but failed in what came to camera angle: you just couldn't see anything, so close the camera was and so fast was the action. Dark Knight tried to correct those flaws, but in turn the fight speed and fluidity was totally lost. It looked as if Christian Bale didn't rehearse as much as he should. 5. The old problem with the cowl... Batman gained a new, flexible cowl, thus somehow solving the "stiff neck" issue that plagued the character since his first appearance in the movies. However, in doing so, Batman lost its famous football linebacker neck. I'll give you a hint for the next movies that will resolve this dilemma once and for all; something you've never heard before: C.G.
10.0~The way Batman was meant to be themohels Sign in Permalink This is without a doubt the best Batman movie ever! The best comic book movie ever! (Iron Man was close second) I would go as far as to say this is my new favorite movie of all time! That coming from a gore hound horror movie fanatic. I grew up with Batman. He has always been my favorite hero and the Joker has always been my favorite villain so much that I have the famous scene from Batman the killing joke tattooed on my chest. Comic book fans you know the one I'm talking about. The previous Batman movies were a kick in the crotch slap in the face. Anyone who says Jack Nicholson made a good Joker needs to be beaten severely. Jack made a horrible Joker, he didn't look like the Joker and more importantly didn't act like him either. Take Heath Ledger he read the proper comics to pull of the role. Sure his skin wasn't bleached and his hair was permanent green but the idea, the portrayal of the character was true to form. To be honest I never thought much of Heath Ledger before this films it pains me because he did such a fantastic job. I never thought it was possible to pull off that role with out entering the realm of camp. Christian Bale was phenomenal as Batman he was the perfect choice for revamping the franchise, the other guys Keaton, Clooney Kilmer good actors but not for this role. Batman needs to be brooding and dark, but at the same time he needs to as Bruce Wayne convince the outside world that everything's hunky dory in richville. Bruce Wayne is the act Batman is the real person. If you read the comics Batman always refers to himself as Batman not Bruce Wayne. This movie proves that with very subtle scenes that you have to watch closely to get. I was impressed with begins but blown away by the Dark Knight. Anyone reading this go see it forget that Tim Burton even exist (the no talent Hack!) and see this movie.
10.0~It's no definitive masterpiece but it's damn close. polarcola Sign in Permalink No words can quite aptly describe the dark, sinuous genius of Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight". A sequel to the 2005 "Batman Begins", the film defies the industry cliché of being a shameless exploitation of a franchise. Much has already been said about Heath Ledger's electric performance as the demented Joker and little else can really be said. It's a performance that displays every psychological tic with sadistic glee and Ledger, virtually unrecognisable behind both the makeup and the mannerisms, imbues his character with terrifying insanity. Of course, Ledger is just one of the many gems in a fine cast. Christian Bale is predictably good in the titular role but he's overshadowed by some other key players. Maggie Gyllenhaal is good as are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman but it's Aaron Eckhart who gives a truly amazing performance as Harvey Dent, Gotham's idealistic DA and the city's moral centre. Eckhart's innocuous golden boy looks belie his dramatic finesse and he conveys the duality of Harvey's character and ideals with great deft. The high calibre of the cast is reason enough to go see the movie but it's the screenplay, written by the Nolan Brothers, that allows "The Dark Knight" to become more than just an adequate sequel. For all the cartoonish connotations of its comic book origins, the movie is a rich and fascinating study into the machinations of justice and humanity. In a genre of such formulaic conventions where "doomed romance" and "final showdown" are automatically entrenched in the storyline to inspire the same old message and emotions, it's hard to find some new ground. "The Dark Knight" succeeds, however, in toying with these very conventions and while the message that it sends is as subtle as an anvil crashing on your head, it's surprisingly powerful. Say what you will about the hype and about the free publicity that Ledger's death has earned this film but to credit it's commercial or critical success so cynically would do both the actor and this film an injustice. At the end of the day, "The Dark Knight" is brilliant entertainment with some phenomenal performances. It's no definitive masterpiece but it's damn close.
10.0~Dark, brilliant, and the best movie of the year. Roger_Sterling Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight was setting records even before its release. The hype was on since late 2007, and was only fueled by the sudden and tragic death of Heath Ledger in January. Did The Dark Knight live up to the massive expectations? Yes. Definitely. The story progresses very well, and the 2 and half hour running time flies by. Pay attention though, or you may get lost. The action is plentiful, and there is just the right amount. Not too much, not too little. There aren't too many explosions just for show, and the special effects look great. Performances Christian Bale is spot on as the tormented defender of Gotham. He gives a very believable performance in one scene of raw emotion that I won't spoil here. Michael Caine once again plays Alfred in a role that makes him a mentor/friend even more so than in Begins, or any of the older movies for that matter. Morgan Freeman also reprises his role as Lucius Fox, who once again supplies Bruce with the gadgets and cutting-edge technology he needs to combat crime. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaces Katie Holmes from Batman Begins, plays Rachel Dawes, a pivotal character in the movie, and in the lives of Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent. Even if you think Gyllenhaal may not be much of a looker, she certainly has far more charisma than Holmes in the role. Newcomer Aaron Eckhart debuts in the series as Harvey Dent, the new District Attorney, and a shining ray of hope on the corrupt Gotham City. Batman thinks he may be the man who may make Gotham no longer need Batman. However, fans of the comics know who he is destined to become. And last, but most certainly not least, Heath Ledger. From the trailers alone, I could tell he was going to give a commanding performance, but I was not expecting this. Ledger completely disappears into the role, and is virtually unrecognizable. He easily gives the best performance of the movie as the psychopathic, sadistic Joker. It is unfortunate and sad he will not be able to reprise his role in the third film, if there will be one. The Dark Knight is easily the best film of the year so far, and by far the darkest. I won't say much, but don't be surprised if you don't get a happy ending. In my opinion, the best film of the year, and the best Batman and superhero movie ever.
1.0~Disappointed kp1965 Sign in Permalink I've felt moved to comment on this movie if only to provide some much needed balance to the string of 10 out of 10s being awarded. My real rating would be about 7/10 but I can't stand seeing this up at number 4 on the top 250 list , it wouldn't make my top 100! The plot was confusing and ludicrous throughout. The 'moral dilemma' of the two ferries at the end really spoilt the movie for me. Why weren't the passengers diving off the boats and swimming for it ? would both boats (especially one full of ex-cons) really have taken the morally high decision to choose death to save the others ? Some great scenes, special effects, cinematography, lighting, dark mood etc. Brilliant performance by Heath Ledger but overall the plot let this film down.
6.0~Convoluted plot and at times actually stupid seth_the_wampyre Sign in Permalink So, this movie was cool. Heath was amazing and Aaron Eckhart stole the show. But something was definitely wrong here. A 2 and a half hour movie is fine with me, but only when necessary. It seemed like it could have been 30 minutes shorter and some non essential points could have been easily removed, or it could have been 30 minutes longer and more developed. Either way, it felt super sloppy. oh, and the Batman voice was just too stupid for words. That voice was fine for "Begins" when his dialog was short and sweet. But for the monologues it was just silly. It sounded like when Homer Simpson tries to whisper, but everyone hears him anyway.
7.0~It is certainly not a 9.7 rated movie. Maybe a 7 or an 8 skyusc Sign in Permalink Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times
7.0~Excellent superhero movie funkyfry Sign in Permalink Batman (Christian Bale) hits the streets again with his most famous foe, the Joker (Heath Ledger) as his foe. Where the first film in Nolan's new series expressed basically the problems with Batman's double life, this new film focuses (to whatever it extent the film can be said to have focus) on the effect that he has on the criminals themselves and the culture of "Gotham City." The most successful and surprising aspect of the film is the way that it truly makes the audience believe by the end that anything could happen (i.e. one of Gordon's kids could really die), as opposed to most superhero movies where the outcome eventually becomes obvious if not tedious. Ledger's performance is also a huge factor in the film's quality. He's really scary, not over the top at all in a bad way. My problems with the film remain some of the same problems from "Batman Begins." I think Bale is sort of a dull Batman, primarily because he's not really convincing as Bruce Wayne. Specifically his version of Bruce Wayne is so cool and composed that it would seem obvious to everyone that he's Batman, whereas Michael Keaton for example seemed like such a doofus at times in the Bruce Wayne persona that you could believe that people would assume he was too much of a dilettante even if they did suspect him a bit. Believability is strained, even within the context of a superhero film, when Wayne slips away from his party and then moments later replaced by Batman, and yet nobody suspects. One thing I also liked about the Burton films was that Nicholson's Joker was both funny and terrifying, whereas I noticed all the jokes that Nolan tried to pull with Ledger's Joker came off flat. The dark atmosphere of the film is so unrelenting that the audience does not really feel inclined to laugh, and that produces an effect that dulls the overall edge of the action scenes. I tend to prefer superhero films that take themselves less seriously, yet this one was so well done in its own style that I would actually rate it higher than "Iron Man" for example despite the fact that the latter was actually more my type of movie. You just can't ask me to take crimefighters in capes and armored suits seriously for 2 plus hours, but this movie actually came amazingly close. Halfway through the movie I was thinking that it really wasn't any better than "Batman Begins" which I thought was somewhat mediocre, but then Ledger's performance really hits the high gear. I loved the dialog scene between Joker and Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart) in the hospital and the bit with him walking out. Also Batman and Joker in the interrogation room was a very strong scene. The really scary possibility that Ledger's performance raises is the possibility, perhaps only glimpsed, that the Joker might actually be more sane than Batman or even more sane than the average "civilized" person. "I'm just ahead of the curve" he says, and we almost want to believe him. These "supervillains" spring from essentially the fertile ground of Lon Chaney's performances in films such as "The Penalty" in 1919, where he was a legless criminal mastermind who wanted revenge on the entire city of San Francisco -- yet Ledger takes it to still another level by doing an irrational, anarchic take on the idea. He actually recites various versions of his invented "backstory" to his victims as if to mock their desire to contextualize his behavior through some rational explanation i.e. "my father beat me", "my mother didn't love me." The concept of revenge or even psychological compensation is just another joke to him. If indeed he is "insane", his ego will not allow him such a luxury and his very purpose seems to be to deny us the consolation of a rational or formulaic explanation for his brutality. I wasn't disappointed with the film at all -- this is basically as good as this type of thing gets. It wasn't a truly great film like Nolan's "The Prestige", but I didn't really expect it to be. I did notice some of Nolan's trademarks like the repetition of certain sounds and images in different contexts. I'm very excited by the possibilities for Nolan's next couple movies because this one is such a big hit that he basically has a blank check.
8.0~While not the greatest movie ever made, it's still an enthralling experience. littlejimmy835 Sign in Permalink A lot of people here on IMDb are going to be rating this film 10 out of 10 claiming that it is the best film ever in the history of cinema. While the film is not _that_ good, it is still a great experience that manages to keep the audience immersed in it's unpredictable story line and tight action sequences. The Dark Knight, the first Batman film not to have "Batman" in the title, takes place after the events of the last film "Batman Begins". Crime in the city has fallen drastically ever since Batman (Christian Bale) started roaming the streets and made the police pull their act together, but this progress starts to become undone when an insane anarchist dubbing himself "The Joker" (Heath Ledger) comes into the scene. What follows is a tight story control vs. chaos as Batman and the Jokers ideals clash in increasingly violent ways. The plot veers and turns as The Joker and his crew continuously create increasingly dangerous diabolical complicated schemes for Batman and the police to thwart, and all the while the film constantly strives for realism by trying to make the events that take place as plausible as possible, and is delivered with utterly seriousness dark attitude more along the lines of a good crime drama than a stereotypical superhero movie. Since Batman and the other characters from the previous film are largely the same as they were last time around, I'll get to the man we all came to see: The Joker. While Heath Ledger's Joker doesn't top Jack Nicholson's from Batman 89 (because let's face it, who ever could?), Ledger does provide an immensely interesting take on the character. It is probably not fair to compare the two actors seeing as they both do completely different approaches to the character; where Nicholson's Joker was an egotistical, narcissistic psychopath, Ledger's Joker is a schizophrenic, sadistic anarchist. And believe me, The Joker in this film really does play off the anarchist factor. Here we have a man who wants nothing else but to see the world collapse, and the only reason he wants it is just for the very reason of seeing the world collapse. He is jumpy, twitchy, intimidating, and gives off the vibe that he could flip out at any moment for the smallest reason, or even no reason. He spends the whole film scaring, bullying and murdering people, just because it somehow makes sense in his twisted mind, and he feels no fear, remorse or guilt whenever Batman or anyone else tries to "punish" him. He's just dangerous, truly the Batman's arch nemesis; Batman hates everything about him, and the Joker loves making Batman hate him. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the other big newcomer to the story, and while anybody who knows anything about his character from the previous installments in the Batman franchise already knows his end, he is probably the most well rounded and three dimensional character in the film. You can really get to feel his motivations, and seeing his rise and fall from power is really interesting. And for the more superficial out there, I will say the action scenes in the film are wonderfully choreographed, and the use of stunt men and practical effects over computer generated ones the majority of the time really does make for some exciting fight scenes. The film is not without flaws though, the two biggest that come to mind are the films fast pace and ending. Granted, the film is nearly three hours long, but it still feel like the creators tired to tell too much story in too little time. If someone walked in 5 minutes late for this film, they would have already missed about 50 plot points. Granted that is an exaggeration, but it's still true that the movie constantly jumps between set piece and set piece, skimming along to the next action scene, where it would have been nice to spend a few minutes here or there get to know characters better and establish mood. This isn't to say the movie doesn't spend time doing this at all, no, but it still would have been beneficial to pad out the movie a little more. This fact becomes apparent with the ending. Without giving away anything, I will say the ending of the film, while still satisfying, does sneak up out of nowhere and abruptly bring the film to an end, leaving you saying, "Uhh... Don't you have a little bit more you want to show us?". That and Batman's voice does get a little try hard. So while many will get wrapped up in the hype that surrounds the film and prematurely denote this films the "Best Movie Ever Made In The Universe" award where it probably does not deserve it, the movie does manage to deliver to an audience member looking for a fun experience and tight storytelling. It's not a masterpiece, but it is a great movie.
10.0~The Joker : An Oscarworthy Performance, nothing less and a truly great Batman franchise unfolding. amolghadi Sign in Permalink Boy, this only gets better and better! First of all, let's NOT compare 'The Dark Knight' to the excellent 'Batman Begins'. 'Begins' was just the Beginning, a prequel and never was something different than 'Knight' in a way so as to draw comparisons. It is a continuous process. This, the second of the 'Batman' franchise comes from the acclaimed director Christopher Nolan unleashing now with it the actual foresight and vision the director must have had in 2005 as to how a batman should be when his 'Begins' hit the theaters. The director took and used his time resourcefully in 'Begins' to build a crescendo right from the base, to explore what The Batman in fact was. In this movie, as a supporting actor Gyllenhaal provided the emotional factor to the plot effectively. Morgan Freeman, a seasoned veteran, exactly knows what he has to deliver in a Batman movie in a very short time. As in 'Begins', here too, he has delivered a crispy witty performance. The other Oscar winner, Caine, was heart-warming as the butler Alfred to provide moral support/guidance to Bat/Bruce, of course, with his own one-liners. Eckhart was brilliant in his acting as an honest, crime fighting District Attorney but the transformation from a DA to a Two Face was amazingly performed. Compared to him, the Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face was a joke. Oscar winner Jones too was capable of doing a much better job than he actually did but they never allowed him to. Tragedy is what Two-Face should depict and Eckhart did that successfully. Gary Oldman has done really well to play a character hanging delicately between his allies and enemies. The cinematography was outstanding. The camera angles made me feel like I was flying with the Batman. The background scores by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, The Lion King, Batman Begins, The Da Vinci Code) and Newton Howard (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) were simply haunting right from the beginning till the end never losing the pace... just like the storyline. The editing was crisp. The action was terrific. The dialogs were simply superb. Bale's was a well-balanced performance. What we are looking for is a well trained, well educated, scientific-minded, have-seen-it-all-type, Ninja in a Batman movie with emotions under control. So all is well with Bale, The Perfect Batman, the perfect Playboy. And now, to the real 'Jewel' of the movie: Heath Ledger. With all due respect to Jack Nicholson, the three time Oscar Winner, he has finally been outclassed by Ledger in playing the role of this particular deadly, psychopathic, psychotic, ego maniacal, sinister, unconscionable, egregious character of one of the biggest adversaries of Batman known to Batman fans: The Chaos-spreading Joker which Nicholson never was, if the aforementioned qualities are compared. This is the Mind-Chilling-Man-Killing-Lip-Smacking-Smiling Joker we, as Batman fans, have known, read about and imagined. Nicholson has lost the race here to Heath Ledger. The previous franchise really was a comic book franchise ...literally. If they really wanted to make a serious real life metaphor of a comic book, they would have, but they didn't. Otherwise Nicholson could have also been chilling too. But this franchise is injecting Batman and his adversaries into Real Life and vice versa. Just like what The Joker in this movie says: "This town deserves a better class of criminal... and I'm going to give it to them." And truly Ledger has given it to us. Ledger has simply put astonishing life and sadistic energy in The Joker. The Joker here in this movie is like a nightmare come true. I always used to say: nothing gets more chilling or colder than Barry Foster in 'Frenzy (1972)', Anthony Hopkins in 'Silence of the Lambs 1991)', Kevin Spacey in 'SE7EN (1995)', Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List (1993)'. But here we can add one more chilling role to the league of the best 'cold-hearted' roles executed ever. Ledger has NOW truly put The Joker in the pantheon of the greatest movie villains ever. Watching this performance alone we can easily judge that Ledger, who died so young could easily have become Oscar material if he had lived. He can still win it as the Best Actor for this role posthumously though because his performance here is demanding one. This also is one of the Best Sequels Ever along with: Godfather II (1974), Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park 3(1999), Lord Of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), Lord Of the Rings: The Return Of The King (2003), Matrix Reloaded (2003), Mission Impossible 3 (NOT 2), The Jason Bourne Series, The Da Vinci Code (2006) - DVC is a sequel to Ron Howard's forthcoming Angels and Demons (2009). Not only is this the Best Batman movie, this is The Best Superhero movie and one of the best masterpieces ever made. Truly deserves many Oscars with at least the Best Actor's. If crime based 'The Departed' can be the Best Picture (because Raging Bull, Taxi Driver were better) than this definitely can also be. The previous franchise was literally comic, made for children. This franchise is dark and deep, made for teenagers / adults. And that is what a realistic Bat-Series meant to be. Based in the REAL world. By that, it does not mean Batman is for real. But he is in a world where rules of Physics hold true and are not distorted. Two more Batman movies from this franchise and this one will wipe out the ill-effects of the previous franchise ... completely. Just like The Joker says to Batman: "You've changed things forever. There's no going back." This franchise has changed things forever. There's no going back. And yes, Long Live Ledger (in our hearts). By the way, I was amazed at The Joker's Pencil Disappearing (sick) Trick. Don't Ever Try That At Home. This movie gets a perfect 10 on 10.
10.0~The Ultimate Superhero Film!!!!! mrpulpfiction-400-735188 Sign in Permalink In one word - Unbelievable!!! But I will not stop at just one word. This film is as close to flawless as I have ever seen, and on top of that it sets a new standard, just as it's predecessor did, for the superhero film. Let's start with the technical aspects: Visual effects - The visual effects are simply mind - blowing!! The action moves seamlessly through the city. With even the most impossible things brought back to sheer realism. It shifts with ease between the normal and I - Max camera shots. The truck jacknife scene that includes the the batpod is especially thrilling. Directinng and Scriptwriting - Christopher Nolan directs with the hand of a cinematic master, effortlessly blending action, romance, humor and drama. The writing from Christopher and his brother John is fantastic!! Giving depth to all the characters and bringing in character growth that goes beyond the conventions of a superhero film. Now that this has been handled, let's go to the acting, all of the actors deliver stellar performances, bringing the struggles of the characters to full realisation, but the star of the show has to be Heath ledger in a wonderfully chilling and menacingly insane performance!!! Losing him was such a loss to the film industry. So for a thrilling and exhausting masterpiece do not look any further than the Dark Knight.
5.0~Is The Dark Knight that good... really? 'Fraid not. richard-hodges Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion. Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking. On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble. And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu. To remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it should've borrowed).
10.0~A Truly Great Movie and For all the Right Reasons s-price476 Sign in Permalink Why is this movie so good and why is everyone talking about it from the mere spectacle of it or Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker? You'll have to go back to 2005 where director, Christopher Nolan whittled and stripped the myth of Batman to the bone to produce a leaner, meaner and fitter franchise. Where Spider-Man 3 promised to be a walk on the dark side, we were subjected to a poor second sequel. In Batman, Christopher Nolan has assembled truly gifted and heavyweight actors across the board and told them to do what they know best. Batman Begins reinvented the franchise and produced a dark, entertaining and well acted movie. In the Dark Knight the ante has been ramped up further. The story is very basic but clever. The script and direction of the movie is brilliant. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman (standout-this guy is just as convincing as a good guy!)and Aaron Eckhart are all superb in that they take centre stage as opposed to the trickery and effects. I think that's about it...Oh and Heath Ledger. In the Joker, Heath Ledger has created one of the most genuinely terrifying villains ever to be put on the screen-this isn't over acting as we saw with Jack Nicholson (although very entertaining). Whenever Heath Ledger is on screen you get a real sense of unease he is an absolute monster of a character, with no morals, sense of decency or saving grace. This is a massive credit to Heath Ledger and one can't feel sad that the movie industry has been robbed of a truly gifted actor. Both this movie and Begins are actors movies-unheard of in the Blockbuster genre. Whether Heath Ledger gets a posthumous Oscar come 2009 is another debate but it cannot be denied he is immortalised in The Joker to produce one of the finest movies you will ever see. To sum up a stunning movie, well acted, directed and produced. When's the 3rd one out?
10.0~The Dark Knight: A comic book film that doesn't feel like a comic book film miguela194 Sign in Permalink Batman Begins rebooted the Batman series as a tale that's sadder and more violent than Tim Burton's or Joel Schumacher's films; such a radical change in style from the previous films (which emphasized a lot of Gothic settings and campy humor) could have been only done with a smart and talented director with lots of tricks under his sleeves; luckily, that director was found in British-born Christopher Nolan. It goes much deeper into Batman's past and origins, something that Burton only tried to do in Batman, and Schumacher didn't try at all. The Dark Knight, the sequel to Batman Begins, preserves Nolan's vision of Batman, however it adds numerous features that only improve the film. For one, it has brilliant actors. In Batman Begins, the biggest flaw was the actress who played Batman's love interest. This horrible actress was Katie Holmes. In The Dark Knight, that tiny mistake is rectified by replacing her with the more talented Maggie Gyllenhaal. There is also a fine addition of new cast members, including Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent and Heath Ledger (in his last role before he died, may he rest in peace) as the Joker. Finally, the great veteran actors from Batman Begins stay for the sequel; these actors are Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Batman's armorer, Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's butler and closest confidant, Alfred, Gary Oldman as Police Lieutenant James Gordon, and Christian Bale as Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne. When the film starts, the Joker, along with a group of henchmen, head out to a bank owned by the mob. They go to rob it, and in a weird turn of events, the Joker manipulates his minions into killing each other until only he is left, the sole survivor of the shootout. Meanwhile, Batman, with the assistance of Lieutenant Gordon as well as D.A. Harvey Dent, are planning to completely take out the mob. Though at first suspicious and jealous of Dent, especially since he's the man dating Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal), Bruce Wayne begins to form a friendship with the man after recognizing his honesty, even though he's still in love with Rachel himself. Wayne is tired of living his double life as Batman, and views Dent as Gotham's true hero and the heir apparent to take over Batman's position in the war on crime. On the other hand, the meddling of Batman, Gordon, and Dent is taking a big toll on the mob. They form a temporary truce on how to fix the problem before it turns uncontrollable. The Joker offers his services in return for half of the mob's money; though they initially refuse, they ultimately accept the Joker's deal. Just when victory's near for Batman and the law, the Joker arrives and makes a direct threat to Gotham: if Batman does not reveal himself to the public, people will die every day. As the body count escalates and more people turn on him, Batman pushes on, but the Joker's murderous spree slowly destroys his hope of a world without crime. Acting, good. Story, brilliant. But what is the key component of a good superhero film? Action sequences. And despite executing the first two aspects perfectly, the chase and fighting scenes are the highlight of the entire film. To name a few examples, take the truck flipping over, or the opening heist sequence, or (in my opinion the best fight scene in the film) the scene where Batman fights Russian mobsters, dogs, impostors of himself, and the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy in a cameo appearance). This is one of the greatest films of the decade, not to mention one of the best superhero films of all time. If you want to know why I like it so much, read this review. Again. Rated PG- 13. Four out of four stars.
1.0~A film for those than cannot see beyond the explosions ramirezv1968 Sign in Permalink I never write reviews for movies, good or bad, but seeing this movie in the top 250 list makes me mad. Its just a movie for teenagers who don't question why things happen when they just don't make sense. I went to see this movie with great expectations because my brother told me it was great. But after the first five minutes I knew what kind of movie I as was about to "suffer". One cliché after the other with no characters development, nothing "Gothic" anywhere, and nothing "dark" or mysterious about this "talking batman" either. Also, I don't see anything great about the joker interpretation. For me Leger was just "ok". No need to glorify an actor because of his death. The other actors were just as terrible as the script allowed them to be. I really don't remember one minute of believable conversation between any of the characters. For a movie to be great, it needs, at least, to make sense. Its not that you cannot have explosions or great action. But this film reminds me more of a Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs can be anywhere when he wants to and pull anything out his sleeve. I don't want to mention anything specific to avoid spoilers, but just expect a ton of "non-sense" action from a bunch of "Bugs Bunny" characters. Its sad how 100,000 people cannot see beyond the special effects and tell themselves, "that doesn't make sense, he was in that other ten places 5 minutes ago!!!".
10.0~This movie will make you not want to watch anything but The Dark Knight. mandavia620 Sign in Permalink The movie is incredible in every way, from the story to the animation of Harvey Dent's other half. It was the most anticipated movie of the summer and it delivered. Though the movie may seem long, there is not a single moment which you feel is unnecessary. I noticed a few links in the storyline with that of 'The Man Who Laughs' and this was put onto the big screen with a great screenplay. In many ways i expected this movie's success; 1) Batman is great, 2) This movie has Chritian Bale (the greatest actor of this generation) and Morgan Freeman (the greatest actor of the last generation)and 3) Batman is great. The hype of Ledger's Joker is justified. I was initially sceptical about his casting but he showed a completely different side to his acting ability in this movie. I am personally fond of his walk; it is perfectly strange. It's a shame he cannot be back for another movie. The Dark Knight is the perfect sequel and I am hoping for another. It would be very difficult to top this movie but i do hope that Chris Nolan gives it a go. He is arguably the most brilliant director of all time and nobody could top this movie apart from him. The same goes for Christian Bale. Also, if there was one movie to watch in IMAX it would be this one.
2.0~No emotion, no rhythm, tremendously overrated borntosmell Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is a simple, discreet, hard-working man. His work on Memento was made with great talent and The Prestige is a pleasant movie. Unfortunately this is not the case with his batman movies. "Begins" has many defects (mainly Katie Holmes) but it is not bad. This is just an average movie with no chance to date in film history. The Dark Knight seems to have been made by a pretentious man (a pretentious crew, at most). The major lacks of the movie is a dense scenario with no rhythm and no emotional implication and a flabby direction. After the two third of the movie, I was actually blunted and the only thing that I wanted to see was "The End" on the screen. Because I didn't care of the fate of the batman or the commissioner Gordon or Harvey Dent and because the story slacks from the beginning to the end. I don't think that Nolan was the good choice for such a movie, and excepting the early 90's McTiernan, I can't see what director would now be good enough to make this ambitious movie. Hiring a talented script-writer wouldn't have been bad for the sake of the movie, and a director who knows the making of good action scenes (but not like the bad Michael Bay). Nevertheless, The Dark Knight has some qualities : the actors are good, particularly Heath Ledger, and it's better than nothing.
10.0~Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!!!!!! Legand786 Sign in Permalink We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie. Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype. For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments. Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.
3.0~A disaster on SO many levels mamajock Sign in Permalink I actually agree with almost every comment in the "Hated It" category. This was an enormously over-hyped and overblown flick - but apparently the explosion-and-violent-chase fans are rating as one of the greatest movies ever, despite a collection of plot holes that resembles the face of a tennis racket. I can understand their enthusiasm, but what was going through the minds of the professional reviewers??? I've seen them pick apart unto death much better flicks than this. Their bitch meters should have gone straight to the infrared, but instead they turned into pompon-wavers. Were they paid off? I have one extra comment on the plot. When the Joker is in police custody, one of the first things they would have done was wipe off all the clown makeup. Without it, this guy becomes a nothing - Samson without his hair. Then they just bury him in some out-of-state max security pen (and label him a child molester, by way of revenge), and all Gotham's troubles go back to same-old same-old. SSDD. Unlike most, I saw this movie first on DVD. It damn near drove me crazy: if I could get my hands around the neck of the Sound Director, he'd be dead meat. The explosions and demolition-derby car chases like to blow out the speakers on my TV - and then half the dialog is done at a virtual whisper! I practically wore out the volume buttons on my remote: up and down, up and down, ad infinitum. You want to sit back and just enjoy a movie, not have to continually stop it and go back because muting down the explosions caused you to miss the first five sentences of dialog. I dropped my vote three places just for this alone. It was THAT infuriating. As for the Oscars, Ledger's award HAD to be a sympathy vote. If he hadn't committed suicide (nobody can take that many different drugs accidentally), would he have even been nominated? His acting was pretty much just Jack Nicholson's Joker on angel dust. (Art imitating life???) Of course, the Academy keeps throwing statuettes at Nicholson, when in every role he's played he just played Jack Nicholson. He's got THAT character down pat.
10.0~Great Movie!!...and to the poster, "Mozared", from below nsmitha Sign in Permalink Loved this movie..I'm a big fan of Heath Ledger from his '10 things I hate about you' days, and will always and forever remain a fan of his acting! The plot was great, every actor/actress' were phenomenal..especially Maggie G. as Rachel. So, yeah, maybe "the batman" didn't have to make his voice so deep, but he definitely had to change it to separate himself from Bruce Wayne..I thought it was fitting. So..to the poster "Mozared", below me, to answer your questions, why did Dent turn bad and why didn't he kill the joker when he had the chance?...Dent believed in fairness his entire life, that's what he lived by...when things started to become unfair in his eyes, such as his love being killed and his current predicament, to him, the only fairness that was left is flipping his coin. When he flipped it with the joker, he landed on heads..the joker lives, same with Maroni in the car scene, and Ramirez. Even if it causes chaos, like when you stated...him "turning bad". The joker, as well, convinces him that "chaos" is fair, as well as convincing him he,the joker, was locked up at the time, so Dent needs to go after the people who actually put him and Rachel in the warehouse. It was fairness in a sick way, if you will. Basically, Dent is just like Batman..he has rules he lives by. We all know what Batman's was, and Dent's rule was "fairness". Now why does the joker have so many loyal men?, well it's simple these men aren't working with a full stack of cards! And actually in the original series, his 'men' came from an asylum, called Akhram...crazies, bi-polar, schizophrenics, you name it. He was able to "lure" them to do bad things for him, it wouldn't be that hard when they're "not well" to begin with!...as you saw with the guy Dent interrogated in the alley..Batman explained the joker, "feeds off these men". And lastly, why is the Joker able to get around with explosives and no one noticing him?....well he has too many people working for him, that he bribes with money, as we saw, and you definitely don't think he set those traps up himself, do you? plus, they're "cheap".
10.0~Almost too good for a superhero-movie. keiseren-2 Sign in Permalink If "Batman Begins" was dark, then "The Dark Night" is pitch black. Large parts of the storyline is driven by deep personal tragedies for the main character's, with resulting evolution for most of them. This is apparent in Bale who is of the few left from last time. He has clearly grown more into the role of particularly Bruce Wayne. As far as the hype surrounding Heath Ledger goes, Ledger is great. Copying some of Nicholson's mimics from "Batman" and finding a great balance between the sheer madness and the calculated evil that makes The Joker. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, however, is much, much better. He brings life and complexity to the politician and crusader Dent, and whilst Ledger makes good on a great role, Eckhart makes perfect of a lesser character. He steals many of the scenes he is in, whether pitted against Bale, Gyllenhaal or Ledger. Nolan has done himself a huge favour by letting the evolving of characters move the film forward, rather than the other way around. Nothing ever feels forced, unnecessary or boring, despite a run of 152 minutes. The are fragments and clues spread around in a large portion of the aptly written dialogue that make the audience pay perfect attention when the intensity of action is lowered. What Nolan does best though, is contrasting Dent and The Joker. Dent will draw away from choice and consequence by flipping his coin (a wonderful symbol after it actually has two different sides) and act accordingly, whereas The Joker will force the conscious choice. Both for Batman and the common man there are exruciatingly inhumane choices to make that make you cringe at the very thought of them.
1.0~Before we get out the balloons and champagne ashkon7527 Sign in Permalink Just like the joker, I am also a little curious about the primitive nature of human beings in our society. Not that I'm immune myself, but it always amazes me to see the exponential effect of hype... to watch humans horde into a frenzy of blissful ignorance. Let me make myself clear. Heath Ledger's performance alone is worth the ticket price to see this movie. He is stunning and he destroys JAck Nicholson's performance... and I say this knowing that I had previously thought, no one can do joker as good as Jack Nicholson. But Joker is only a third of this movie, and a shame in hindsight. The rest of this film is a just mish mash of tension, pace, plot and action. 1. Christopher Nolan struggles with action scenes. They are confusing, chaotic, and illogical which culminates into an underwhelming visceral and cerebral experience. Somewhat boring. 2. Batman is a lifeless and dull character. In 'batman begins' this was OK because he was mostly swinging from the corner of the screen, like a predator, but given a more open role, Batman in a cape was distracting. His metamorphosis as batman was absorbing to experience in the first film, but the conflicts he faces in this sequel pale in comparison. Batman is too sensitive and too poetic in his choice of resolutions. Ready to reveal his identity too quickly and ready to become a dark knight based on the pompous premise... Dent must remain the white light. 3. Two face is an oddball. An oddball of creation, of reaction and of evolution. His arch is a forced effort by Nolan. It doesn't make sense for him to kill Gordon's family. Dent himself commented that he knew his job was dangerous. He knew that there were bad people after him. Why the sudden transformation when this happened? The transformation of Two face was based on the premise of his philosophical awakening.. That to believe in chance... is to believe in chaos... but i cant believe this would cause such an explosive change in him... willing to kill a child. It doesn't make sense. Two face as caricature was not near as engaging or entertaining. 4. The pacing of this film is poor. There are moments where it is too fast, and moments where the film is too slow. Effectively, I think the movie should have ended sooner. It dragged out, and I was mostly non-responsive to the conclusion of two face. 5. Ultimately for a movie to be amazing one must come out of a cinema and be amazed. I didn't like the movie in its entirety. And I truly believe that had Heath Ledger not been involved in Dark Knight, the general consensus would have been a lot different, and the flaws a lot more glaringly obvious. This was a 2.5 hour movie in which everything but Joker was underwhelming. It was a good movie, but given the hype, its now everyone's favorite film of all time... as the IMDb ratings might soon suggest.
10.0~I'm stunned. Films have no right being this good. argonfire Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight **WARNING: some spoilers below** I'm stunned. Films have no right being this good. I have no real words to describe what I've just seen. I can't quite process it yet. It is going to need several more screenings to unravel all of the stuff that is in that film. This isn't a superhero film...this is a complex ideas driven crime thriller about two outlaws vying for the soul of a city. One who is dedicated to preserving order but at what cost? The other dedicated to creating chaos at any cost to expose the 'true nature' of humanity and to prove a point; to push Gotham's Dark Knight and its White Knight beyond the limits. And caught in between are the mob, the police, and the people at large. Welcome to a world without rules. Indeed. It's a film about our society. About how fragile it really is. About how close we always are to true chaos and how easy it is to slip in to anarchy or do the wrong thing for the right reason. It's a film about choices. Heath Ledger...what can you say? One of THE best performances I've EVER seen. Unpredictable, insane, vile, intelligent, disturbing, blackly funny, horrific, entrancing...all at the same time. This is probably the most subtle and nuanced 'BIG' performance ever. There is so much detail and depth to it. Just give him that Oscar right now. This film was filled with so many "Holy ....!" moments that either made me giggle with manic glee to rival the Joker himself or made my jaw go slack or just gripped me so hard I couldn't move for fear at what was going to happen next. Too many to list them all...but the Joker's disappearing pencil trick, dropping the mob boss, flipping the truck and then Batman's quick turn from the wall on his bat bike are just a few. Oh, and the sight of the Joker dressed as a nurse is an image now burned forever in to my brain. If I had one minor criticism it would be that Harvey's downfall and descent to madness is a little to fast, but Aaron Eckhert is so good that you still buy it. **START OF SPOILERS** And what a way to end. Batman makes the sacrifice and truly becomes the outcast, the hunted. He is stripped back down to the basic essence of the character: an outlaw, a vigilante, a well intentioned criminal who is to be pursued and brought to justice by society. **END OF SPOILERS** The Dark Knight is a massive achievement. It is a film that transcends its genre roots to become something much bigger and bolder while still remaining faithful enough to be recognisable. It is quite simply one of the best films I've ever seen. Just how far up my list it goes I'm not sure. It will need a good few more viewings to unravel it all the more, but as of now...it's pretty darn high up. Stunning!
1.0~Why so happy? Let's put a frown on that face! blackaugust79 Sign in Permalink I know this review will get a bunch of unhelpful votes but somebody has to tell the truth here! The Dark Knight is wildly overrated and is the most overrated movie of all time. Forget Titanic, Boondock Saints and King Kong(2005). This movie surpasses them when it comes to sheer hype. For the record I love Batman Begins. I thought it was a fresh beginning on a series that was rendered ineffective by that lunatic Joel Schumacher. Christian Bale fared well as both Batman and Bruce Wayne and the rest of the cast did a great job also. But this movie.... Everything that made Batman Begins so great is absent from this pretentious slop. Most of the cast look like they'd rather be somewhere else. Let me break it down this way with what stinks about this movie. The plot: Idiotic beyond belief. Joker(Heath Ledger) plans to kill city officials while playing childish games with Batman. Most of the time he's killing the people he's aligned with making him the most moronic villain in superhero movie history. Batman joins forces with Commissioner Gordon to stop him. The acting: Christian Bale is wooden in both roles(Batman and Bruce Wayne). He spends most of the movie looking like he's stoned out of his mind. And what is up with that voice? In Batman Begins he sounded cool like one of the gangsters from those old 1940s flicks. Here he sounds like Dirty Harry with strep throat. Aaron Eckhart is flat as both Harvey Dent and Two-Face. While his Two-Face was better than Tommy Lee's Two-Face looking good by default is never good. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman sleepwalk through this whole movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite awful as Rachel Dawes. Katie Holme's Rachel Dawes was a strong willed lawyer that fought for what's right. Maggie's Rachel Dawes needs to grow up and find some better priorities. I agree that she is a step up from Katie Holmes but she plays Rachel Dawes like some silly high school girl with a pathetic crush on Bruce Wayne. The fact that we are asked to feel sympathy for her when The Joker captures her is a bit of a stretch. Her getting roasted made my day though lol! Now for the talk of the town: Heath Ledger as Joker. Heath Ledger's performance was okay but to say that he was better than Jack Nicholson's Joker is hilarious to say the least. Jack Nicholson's Joker had style, a plan and was pretty funny as well as unpredictable. Of course he was silly but he was fun. Heath Ledger's Joker is predictable with no back story and had no real plan. Just random acts of chaos. Ra's Al Ghul had a plan, The Joker of Batman 1989 had a plan, The Penguin of Batman Returns had a plan. This weirdo had nothing but bluff. Plus he's has no fun with what he does and spends most of the time ridiculously philosophizing like those corny emo-goth kids that smoke copious amounts of cigarettes while yapping about the misery of their lives. You complete me? That's about as cheesy as the Tumbler turning into a crappy motorcycle. Speaking of Emo-Goth kids that exactly what this Joker is. Only people actually find him cool instead of pathetic. Action sequences: predictable to a fault. Car chase and fights scenes plus they are quite unrealistic. People get punched, kicked, shot, bitten by dogs and knocked around by explosions and walk away without bumps, bruises, cuts or blood. Now, Im not a gore hound but if you get shot or bitten by a dog, I would expect to see some blood. Not in the Dark Knight though. Pacing: The movie builds up a pace to slow it down after wards and with all the action on the screen the movie still finds time to be boring. Plus at 2 hours and 32 minutes this movie feels longer than it needs to be. Various subplots that never connect best describe most of this movie. Conclusion: The Dark Knight is the most overrated, most hypocritical, most pretentious piece of garbage in the history of cinema. The only people that would like this are the fanboys and I cant believe that people are trouncing Tim Burton's Batman movies to foam at the mouth like rabid dog groupies over this overcooked sequel. You pseudo-intellectual snobs don't seem to realize that those movies were great for the time they were made in and they were fun. Tim Burton made the type of Batman movie he wanted to make without trying to please these shills. I must have seen the Tim Burton Batman movies more times than I can count and still have a ball watching them till this day. I saw this dreck three times and still couldn't get into it. Its not even fun. Its a plodding mess that gets more hype than it deserves. Matter of fact, I'll tell how much I didn't like it. For months I had The Dark Knight on my computer for free via z-share and when my computer suffered from a virus that force me to erase the whole thing, this was the only movie through z-share that I never tried to get back. That should tell you everything you need to know about my feelings on this movie. Two Thumbs down.
4.0~Not that good info-11400 Sign in Permalink I do not understand what movie everybody seems to have been watching. "The dark knight" simply is not that good. I am sorry. Heath Ledger is dead. Should we just close our eyes and pretend everything he did in this film was great? I definitely do not think so. He was just re-acting Mr. Depp's pirate! While Depp was absolutely convincing in his role as Cpt. Sparrow, Ledger only copied the whole concept. That was pretty weak acting. I still do not understand why Gary Oldman plays Gordon. What a complete waste! He could be such a fantastic villain, or brilliant at every role, that has light and darkness about it. Gordon is just a straight honorable man. And you let Oldman play this!? The rest of the cast is doing pretty fine. Even though I think some of the great names are straight forward wasted on stereotype roles! So what about the story line? Does it overcome any of the above mentioned items? No way! Batman is forced to consider his actions. Is it in any way justifiable what he does? Off course not! Taking the law into your own hand is no good idea. There is historic evidence: It is very advisable to place the force into the hands of a state, that is bound to law and that is democratic justified. While it is a romantic idea to overcome the weaknesses of the state by individual actions it is in practice the end of a free society. On a comic book level batman is cool. But is there any sense in seriously considering his role? No, that's ridiculous. Our hero does not kill villains, he does not judge them. But he is bending the rules to catch them. So he is bending the rules by spying out all cell phones. Is that in fact worse than beating up presumed criminals? Worse than breaking every single piece of law in order to catch th "evil" ones? It is absolutely silly to have this as a theme in a batman comic-movie. Every reasonable state would HAVE to put our hero into prison. No option on that, period. The movie is pretty good, 5 out of 10 ain't to bad. But that's all!
6.0~Not nearly as good as the first film and only interesting because of Ledger's Joker dcw-12 Sign in Permalink Ledger is irresistibly interesting in his portrayal of the Joker despite the somewhat hackneyed plot, and his performance saves the film from disaster. Without his performance I would have walked out as the rest of the film was trite, melodramatic, garbage. Christian Bale gives wood a bad name as he soullessly meanders through the role. The guttural growling he performs as Batman may make sense to the plot but its almost unbearable to listen to . The previous film with Bale a beaten down outcast and a man struggling for an identity was infinitely more interesting from an acting perspective than this film. Bale feels trapped in the role in this film going through the motions and he seems bored and unchallenged almost not knowing what to do with it. The plot also doesn't have the structure of the previous film. There was a appreciable beginning, middle, and end of the previous film that let things percolate, the action build, the plot be exposed. This film is too evenly paced and like an unstructured watercolor the plot runs together and gets lost somewhere along the line.(or maybe I just lost interest) I remember seeing a scene with the Joker in a nurses costume, and while the character was interesting not knowing or caring at that point why the Joker was blowing the place up. The Two-Face character was fairly weak, the emotions in the wronged Harvey Dent seemed forced and the plot explanation of his 'do-gooder' gone wrong personality seemed ham-fisted. Maggie Gyllenhaal was not a particularly interesting character and there were no fireworks between her and either Bale or Eckhart. Michael Caine almost seemed to be biting his lips to spit out the lines in the film. He seems to be almost embarrassed to be in the film. Acting wise the highlights are Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and of course Heath Ledger who you never doubt 100% inhabit their parts and actually add something positive to the film. Unfortunately they are fighting an uneven script, a hackneyed story, and bad acting from Bale and others the whole way. The result is an uneven, and eventually uninteresting film that relies on constant action and superficial delights to offset the uneven acting and flat out bad plot. Certainly inferior to its predecessor and without Ledger would have been an outright disaster. I feel a bit alone on this analysis and I am surprised as anyone about this as I was expecting greatness when I went into the theater. But thats the way the cookie crumbles.
1.0~Waste of time clsid Sign in Permalink This movie was trying to be many things at once. Between the cheesy Gordon's lines and a gangster movie wannabe, they really lost a lot of the essence they build in the first movie. First of all, Batman is supposed to be a superhero. In my opinion they should have focused in getting a mix of Spiderman (which made superheroes movies popular again) with the kind of Asian mystery and wise character they created in the first movie. Now you just see a guy that can do no wrong, where you are supposed to be awed by his sacrifices. See the problem is that if you want to create a believable gangster movie, "good" guys have legitimate reasons to kill "bad" guys sometimes and they pretty much have to unless they are a priest or something. Remember The Departed? That's what you have to focus on if you want good drama. They could complement that with what the new Hulk movie (the one with Edward Norton) achieved, and then we could have a fantastic movies with one of the greatest comic characters of all time. As far as the acting goes, I don't see what all the fuzz is all about with the Joker. Watch No country for Old Men and tell me who you are really scared of afterwards. And no makeup required on top of that.
8.0~Decent raptorboy4 Sign in Permalink Wow... Firstly this might be the most overrated movie of all-time. The hype was insane. and putting that aside even. People who saw this movie acted and are currently even to this day calling it one of the greatest films of all-time. After watching this movie, I had mixed feelings. Like most people however I enjoyed it. But here are the problems.. OVER ACTING!! My god! I have never seen such bad mellow dramatic acting in my life. I mean it's a batman movie. You can only take it so far. and this film kills it in-terms of milking every seen. It was like they wanted it to be 2 hours and 30 minutes long, and in order to do that, they just extended the dialogue between characters basically to a point, where i didn't even care what was happening. Bale is a terrible Batman. Give me Keaton any day. That voice? Come on why does he have to growl to speak. and now the Joker. It's a tragedy what happened to Ledger. But people are so blinded by his death, that basically you can't except that his portrayal of the Joker............ is good............. Solid..... but nothing more!!.......... It's not the best portrayal of a villain ever, so quit acting like it is!! He's very tame in my opinion. Not scary, not twisted, not really that evil. For a guy who looks like that, they could have had the character be a bit more violent. People say the scene where he slits the guy's mouth. that it's so terrifying. but You don't even see anything, no blood, nothing. The camera even turns away, all you see is the guy fall. WOW. Like really if you watch the film nothing that crazy happens. Conclusion: Take your blinders off and stop falling for what the media deems as good. People who liked this movie are clones. and the fact that it's in the top 10 on IMDb is appalling.
10.0~Amazing Nagleess Sign in Permalink This movie has it where it counts in every way. The action is amazing and is only used when necessary. This film plays out more like a crime drama rather then a comic book movie. Its highly enjoyable through the entire two and a half hour run time. It must be said that Heath Ledger does steal every scene and you are just waiting for him to pop back into the movie when he is not in it. Everything blends really well together from the cast to the music to the shots. It really is a great movie experience. There are a few small details of this movie that bother me. Just because the bring the movie back into comic book land and not a crime drama. Most of them towards the end. I also recommend that it should be scene on an IMAX screen because it makes the movie absolutely breathtaking. It is the best movie this year and should merit some Oscar consideration at the very least a Best Supporting nod to Mr. Ledger he truly is the joker.
7.0~Blown out of proportion brianitsjustin Sign in Permalink I like many others have been dying to see this Batman since I saw how demonic the joker character looked in the early trailers. While I thought the movie had so much potential to be one of the classics, it simply fell short. A lot of people have been clinging on to a lot of the hype simply because of one actor's unfortunate passing. I was prepared for greatness, and one of the best movie-going experiences of my life. Instead I got a film laced with mediocrity. Christian Bale's performance doesn't even come close to his performance in Batman Begins a few years back. Maggie Gyllenhal doesn't do much to expand on Katie Holme's performance either. Not that she can be blamed, but I think the producers would have been better of sticking with someone who could act, and who can really seem as complex as the Rachel character is supposed to be. Aaron Eckhart puts in one of the better performances in the movie but was still less than stellar. Even one of my favorite actors, Gary Oldman, didn't perform as well as I thought. At the end of the day I still don't think it was the cast that ruined this movie. I think each of these actors could have put in a stellar performance had the movie been written better. They highlighted certain characters more than others, and that led to the demise of the movie. It honestly didn't feel like there was anything electrifying going on. Some people in the theater were actually dozing off at certain points. I'm not saying this is the worst piece of garbage ever it is a mediocre sequel. Something must have been lost between Batman Begins and this movie. Mainly I feel that most people involved simply weren't as worried because there was no way this movie wasn't going to be a hit. Batman Begins had to prove to people that Batman movies could be good again, and I applauded its originality and creativity. This Batman movie was above average, but at the end of the day it had to much holding it back to be a classic. p.s. the batman joker showdown was weak anyone should admit that also in a Batman movie usually the entire city of Gotham is facing annihilation, so you didn't get that element of chaos.
2.0~Why is this film so overrated? bigbadblair Sign in Permalink Great all these idiots out there with their positive reviews are encouraging studios to make more super hero films. This film didn't even make sense. How did the joker mastermind so many 911 type explosive terrorist incidents? Boiled down, this is just another brain dead action flick. If you like stunts, hostage scenes and actors who take themselves a bit too seriously (not a poke at Ledger, just everyone else) then by all means see this film. I mean if there are heaps of ten year olds who thought this film was good and you do too, well, do you think there's something wrong with you? Well buddy if you do really like this film there is something wrong with you. Ultra secret cave-dwelling caped crusaders don't exist OK. You need to move on. Swallow your pride and move on.
1.0~Weak kaos_ngine Sign in Permalink Totally weak, are there so many sponges out there that seriously believe this is a good film? Just stop one moment, look at the top 250 best films of all time list and ask yourself honestly is this better than any of these. This wouldn't even come in the top 2500 list. At best an average film, it is better than 1 out of 10, but hopefully sane people can redress the balance between people who might have seen more than 10 movies in their lifetime and those that have not. There are so many flaws in this movie they are innumerable. Batman begins was far superior and definitely Christopher Nolan's worst film to date. Very disappointed.
1.0~what was all the hype for? thedudeishere41 Sign in Permalink I am no great movie reviewer or anything special. I just watch movies and I like what I like. everybody was hyping this movie like it was the greatest movie and adults went and seen this movie at the theater and actually paid to see it numerous times. I was expecting this movie to be great. to me it was boring and I quit watching it about halfway through and came back and watch the ending. this movie is over-hyped by people who wanted this movie to be great and made it great in their own heads because they wanted it to be. the movie did not make sense and thing where done in the movie that could not of possibly be done even in the comic books. I don't know why heath ledger was given the academy award. the joker did not make any sense and jack nicholson played the joker better than heath ledger, without a doubt. mickey rourke was more deserving. the problem is most people wanted this to be a great movie and they went and seen it and must have said to themselves this is suppose to be a great movie and actually made it one because of the hype. the batman movies made in the 1990's were good movies especially the first one with michael keaton playing batman and jack as the joker. from the start of this movie I was lost. it was too long and was filled with a bunch of non sense commmotion.
1.0~Huge disservice to Heath Ledger schuey9999 Sign in Permalink I can't tell you how disappointed I am in The Dark Knight. My friends and I waited for months to see this and it was a film I was expecting to see numerous times. Having viewed it, I wouldn't watch it again unless someone paid me a lot of money. I'm a science-fiction fan so I on board with artistic allowance as long as it's consistent with the framework of the film. There were several violations in this movie that I don't understand how people/fans can get past. I'll site a few examples that I feel cheapened the movie beyond repair: 1)Right out of the gate in the opening scene, since when can Batman bend a steel gun barrel with his hands? 2)Bruce Wayne is now smart enough to network all the phones in Gotham City and stick the results into a database? Last time I checked, my phone didn't have sonar technology. The phone that Morgan Freeman brought to Hong Kong was described to have special capabilities. Yet suddenly Bruce Wayne is able to extend that capability to all 30M citizens phones in the city? The most idiotic part was when Mogran Freeman was analyzing the output and suddenly the Jokers face appeared on the screen immediately in front of him. Did the Joker stop by AT&T before that scene to upgrade his phone? There were about 500 mini-screens in front of Moran Freeman and he just so happened to be looking at the one where the Jokers face appeared. I wanted to leave the theater at this point. 3) If you are admitted to the hospital with burns on half your body and your clothes are saturated from lying on a floor with gasoline, the hospital will remove and dispose of your clothes when you are admitted. Yet when the Joker freed Two-Face, Two Face suddenly had his half-burned clothes back on for the remainder of the movie. 4)Who planted all the explosive charges in the hospital for the joker? There seemed to be hundreds of devices that were suddenly in place (and conveniently no hospital staff noticed). Oh, and how convenient that the Joker had a friend or a bomb in the right place at the right time whenever he was in a bad position. Something like this is okay in couple occasions in the movie, but not in every scene. 5)What was the point in having the Lamborghini in the movie just to be destroyed. Cheap thrill. Ledgers direct performance was great. I just wish they had built a simpler more believable movie around him. I wanted this movie to be great as much as anyone here. I expect a certain level of consistency and believability from the movies I watch. Again believable within the framework of the movie. As much as I wanted TDK to be a great movie, I couldn't even will this movie to the level of awful.
10.0~My God....My God.... hams_hussein Sign in Permalink Wow...How should i start..my God... i did not see this coming! i've always been a fan of batman, since i was a kid..even though i must admit some of it's movies were rather disappointing..i always thought that they never portrayed him properly on film..and in the last decade numerous superhero movies were banging on the box office, movie by movie..year by year...i thought there would be no hope for Batman i never really saw batman begins properly..so i wouldn't know what to say about it.. but then this came along, i was hell excited when i first saw the trailers and the adds..its looked amazing, but trailers are trailers... then came along the tragic death of Heath Ledger. The movie release got postponed. When it finally got released, the hype was insane, the box office numbers were mind blowing, to myself i said it must've been all the hype of Heath Ledger's death and that's bringing this movie to it's success.. but when i saw it...wow...wow...i could have never been more wrong.. putting aside me being batman's fan, i am also quite the critic, i've seen my share of movies and know which ones are good...and which ones suck.. this one was ..amazing, it totally surpassed all the hype!! it truly did.. me and my friends literally had goosebumps 10 mins after the movie was over. 5 things i'd like to say about this movie.. 1. Cliché: Heath Ledger was undeniable Brilliant. i would've never thought he would be up to the role, as i thought Jack nicholson did an amazing job as well....he owned the role. From his body language to the constant licking of his lips was just sheer brilliance. 2.Aaron Ekhart and Christian Bale Both were brilliant along with Morgan Freeman to complete the set. 3.Christopher Nolan along with the writers are the people i'd love to credit most because, the story, dialog, etc were by them, u can't act out anything without a script. one of the best I've seen. 4.One reason why this movie was so great was, its the first superhero movie which has a mature atmosphere to it as well as intelligence. another thing was this , let's admit is the most realistic superhero movie evermade. its good to have a superhero movie with a serious plot, one kids and grownups can both enjoy. The action scenes would drive kids nuts. 5. This wasn't just a superhero movie. It had elements from thriller, suspense movies and so on. Christoper Nolan along with his actors especially Heath , was the main reason for this. Im tired of cheesy superhero movies. i think most of us are. its good to have a change. Dark Kight just, didn't stop getting better. Through parts of the movie, i told my self that, that was it, it'll just stop there it can't get any better, but it just did. it kept getting better and better, and i swear not one part of this movie nor one second bored me. Seriously. Truly a dream a come true. Amazing. one that will be remembered. i know i will.. R.I.P Heath Ledger.
9.0~Darker than Burton's? jimmy2 Sign in Permalink I would have to say that Nolan has done something that no other Batman film director could ever do - make a darker film than Tim Burton. Tim's over-the-top circus-like direction, while albeit dark, isn't anywhere near as dark and gritty as this film is. Let's start with the Joker first off. Ledger has outclassed Nicholson in this role. This isn't the prim and proper Joker that Nicholson displayed - this Joker is a force of nature that plays by absolutely no rules except his own twisted moral code. He cares more about chaos and mayhem more than he would ever care about money or fame. He lives off the fear of the populace. Nicholson's obsession with the Batman had more to do with him creating the Joker, versus a twisted and depraved fascination with Batman being the symbol of hope for a doomed city. Turning the Joker into a bona fide terrorist fits today's post-911 world like a glove in terms of creating a visceral reaction within the audience. Nicholson's Joker was more preoccupied with settling personal vendettas than being a terrorist, which means that his Joker isn't near as fascinating. Likewise, Two-Face in this film is more in line with Nicholson's Joker this time around. His existence in this film is purely about personal vendettas, but if there is one complaint I have about this film, is that he's largely overshadowed by the Joker. Again, someone who has personal vendettas unfortunately isn't near as interesting or compelling as someone who's unpredictable and destroys things just for the hell of it. While I do agree that having Harvey Dent in the film was a good idea to move Batman's story along, I would be loathe to say that Two-Face is the star attraction here. All the stars here seem to know what's at stake with this film, so they give it their all. Even with Heath Ledger out of the equation, the performances are fine. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman really do take advantage of their supporting roles in the film, and use the limited screen time they have to make an impact. Christian Bale does another fine job as the freewheeling playboy as well. Lastly, one cannot say enough about the special effects. The effects in this film rival all other superhero films. An IMAX camera was even used for certain scenes, heightening the impact even more. Even if you like the 1989 Batman film, I highly recommend you see this one. It out-Burtons Burton.
6.0~The Dark Knight (2008) **1/2 JoeKarlosi Sign in Permalink This followup to BATMAN BEGINS has only been out for a short time, and already it's getting hailed as "The Greatest Movie Of All Time" by many viewers of all walks of life, presently enjoying an unfathomable general rating of 9.4 out of a possible 10 points on the "Internet Movie Database". As a result, the voting has it currently ranking as #1 on their "Top 250 Movies" list, even taking reign above true cinematic classics like CITIZEN KANE, BEN-HUR, THE GODFATHER and CASABLANCA. If this trend keeps up, we'll have a #1 for THE DARK KNIGHT, all right -- as the #1 "Most OVERRATED Movie Of All Time"! Hey, folks -- please let's get a grip. One has to wonder how much of this unprecedented glory has to do with the tragic death of 29-year-old Heath Ledger (who plays the Joker in this movie), who passed on unexpectedly with a drug overdose just months before this film was released. THE DARK KNIGHT is not a good film, but it's not as much of a miss as BATMAN BEGINS was. The best thing I will say about THE DARK KNIGHT is that Heath Ledger's contagious interpretation of The Joker IS spellbinding, I will happily concede. Every time this character is on screen we cannot take our eyes off him. His Joker is a ghoulish clown ... intense, deadly, maniacal, and - for the first time that I can remember - downright frightening. He is a criminal to be reckoned with. For devotees of the previous screen versions of The Joker, they may like to know that Ledger also retains some of the comic prowess of this infamous court jester, laughing and getting flamboyant every now and then. I would go as far to say that Ledger is reason alone to see this movie, even though very little else in it can add anything to the fancy table he sets. This is another "dark" Batman experience. It's not the "Zap! Bam! Pow!" type of lighthearted comical approach which was dominant in the Adam West television series. From my own personal experiences in talking to different fans of both the "dark" and the "light" Caped Crusader, there seems to be two divided camps. I can't concern myself too much with that, though, because for me I approve of both interpretations of the Batman mythos. Christian Bale is The Batman once again, and I had the same trouble with him here that I had with him in BATMAN BEGINS. That being, he tends to growl and speak in a sardonic whisper when wearing his Bat mask, and I think the effect is not only silly, but it grates on my nerves. He looks fine as Bruce Wayne, I suppose, but as Batman he also seems to be unimportant in his own film. While we keep looking forward to the next appearance of The Joker, Batman here is not very prominent. A couple more more sweeteners to the stew are the characters of Harvey Dent (aka Two-Face), well-played by Aaron Eckhart, and Gary Oldman in a good performance as Commissioner Gordon. They're strong and intriguing presences within the movie, also peaking the interest more than Batman himself. Where the movie falls apart for me is that it has a confusing way of telling its story and conveying its action scenes, often coming across like a convoluted mess. It also feels far too long and in dire need of losing 30 or more minutes,easily. Add this to the insipid semi-presence of Batman, and even the factor that Heath Ledger -- for all his ingratiating magnetism in the first half of the film -- also seems to get tired in the last half, and you have just an Above Average film experience. That doesn't make THE DARK KNIGHT even "good", let alone "The Greatest Movie Ever Made". **1/2 out of ****
1.0~Why so serious? steveh363 Sign in Permalink I fail to see how people are actually taking this movie seriously. Batman is meant to be an enjoyable superhero/comic book blockbuster, but that is all. The film makers feeble attempt to make things more 'serious' by throwing in the cringing ferry and solar phone tap scene were embarrassingly unnecessary and came off as patronising to the audience. Furthermore, the use of real NY style sky scrapers for Gotham City (in some far from subtle way of making more 9/11 America comparisons) ruined the distorted and macabre atmosphere of Gotham city that Tim Burton had translated so well onto screen. The fictional comic book edge was further lost by showing us the Joker's violent followers from behind to expose their masks. While all this might have made the movie fresher and more realistic- why keep the entirely unbelievable and cackling Joker character? Instead, Heath Ledger's excellent performance feels out of place with the rest of the movie. And while Heath did play the joker very well, it is not exactly difficult to play a cartoon, fictional and face painted psycho. If you want to see a real Oscar winning performance of a psychopath, watch Monster (2006). If he gets the Oscar sympathy vote for this I would have no more respect for the Academy and it's flawed voting process.
5.0~"Why so serious?" I couldn't agree more themkody Sign in Permalink Let me start off by saying that I hated this film. However, I'm giving it a fair rating anyway. As an avid comic-book fan, I've had the pleasure of seeing almost all of the comic book adaptations that have seen the light of the day (so far). And almost all of the films have been at least a worthwhile trip. Ironically, the highest rated comic book adaptation of all time, the film I'm reviewing right now, is pretty damn far down on that list. Everything that Burton did right in "Batman", Nolan did wrong in "TDK". TDK takes itself way too serious. I think Nolan missed the point of "comic"-book. Comic, as in, amusement and entertainment. TDK is neither. It tries so hard to be a smart crime film, but to me it's just a bloody mess. The hero-villain confrontations simply falls flat, like a gum that lost it's flavor. Then there was the action sequences, which was entertaining enough to watch. But you know there's something wrong with the movie when you're only enthralled by the action sequences. The car chase sequence felt totally out of place, reminded me more of a trailer for a Fast and the Furious reboot. Then there was the cell phone gag, which felt totally out of place as well. "Gotham City" in TDK did nothing to me. There was nothing Gothic about it. Just an ordinary Hollywood city. Burton's portrayal of Gotham City in "Batman" was simply priceless. The atmosphere was just so good, the cinematography and editing were spot on. His Gothic approach to this kind of material is probably the best ever, the only film coming close is Sin City. Burton did it all on a $48 million budget. Nolan had a $185 million budget and he failed to accomplish this task. Sadly, he didn't learn anything from his mistakes in Batman Begins, but I guess that didn't stop people from funding him. Early Batman films were so fun to watch, and the actors that portrayed the villains, such as Jim Carrey, Jack Nicholson and Tommy Lee Jones, had such a great time, and it showed. Let's discuss the actor portraying the Joker who people praised to the skies: Heath Ledger. I completely fail to see how his performance could have been better than Nicholson, let alone equally good. Some say they were in the same league. Some say that the late Ledger was better by far. But good 'ol Nicholson will always be the true Joker to me. His portrayal of the Joker is probably one of the most accurately portrayed comic-book villains translated to the big screen, ever (some plot lines regarding the Joker was changed but Burton kept the character pure and original). Every single movement he made reflected something of his character. Heath Ledger's Joker was just a mad dog, as stated so many times during the film. Nothing more. His motives are unknown. In the original film, we are fully aware of the Joker's motives, and through flashbacks, we learn how he became such a gruesome monster. He's so fun to watch, not to mention that he actually laughs. Heath Ledger never even smirks (wait, a Joker that doesn't even laugh?) He doesn't pull any rabbits out of his hat like Nicholson. He just blows things up. He's just a sadistic nihilist and not a complex, unpredictable villain formerly known as Jack Napier. I hated how Nolan changed this character completely, if it was at least half as accurate as the original Joker, it might had been more interesting. Two-Face was an OK villain, but suffers from the same faults that the Joker had: he doesn't have any real motives! At least Tommy Lee Jones was fun to watch. We're never let into his head; at one point he is the good guy, and at the next he's the new villain. Why? The relationship between Rachel and Two-Face was laughable, the fact that he wanted to die for her was ridiculous. The fact that he wanted to blame everyone for Rachel's death, and use "chance" as an excuse for killing people was laughable. I wanted to know what happened in between. The characters in this film are simply not developed enough, which makes them boring and uninteresting. This problem wouldn't be as big if the movie didn't solely rely on (failed) tension and atmosphere. Without adding a pinch of entertainment, which is what a true comic book adaptation should include, the movie falls flat. And it doesn't have to be ha-ha entertainment, Sin City had both atmosphere and action, and succeeded at both; The Dark Knight had failed atmosphere and little action. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman all provide great screen presence, as always. And then there's Christian Bale, an otherwise excellent actor, who lost a lot of credibility to me after taking on the role of "Batman". What an awful choice. What a cringe-worthy performance. Keaton is without a doubt, the best Batman so far, while the rest are circus clowns compared to him. As a final conclusion, I cannot recommend this film. Lacking elements that a real comic book adaptation should have, such as visual effects and accurately portrayed villains that are actually interesting to watch, the only redeeming values are some of the actors who did an OK job, and a few of the action scenes, notably the sequence at the beginning. Christopher Nolan is a great director, who still manages to show his skills in this film, but sadly, the benefits are for naught. The film succeeds a few times at creating, stylish, tension scenes, but those few tense scenes are far from enough from what this film could have (and should) have been. "The Dark Knight" was a huge disappointment to me, and should have been a huge improvement upon Batman Begins. I'm glad I didn't see this film with high expectations. Moose finds this film worthy of a 7.
6.0~Over long, rambling, episodic, pompous. Nice effects though. paddy-2 Sign in Permalink Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters, and ranking up huge box office, I thought I'd give it a swing. I mostly wish I hadn't bothered. Like most super-hero movies nowadays, it's one gigantic battleship of a movie, weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time. How many sub-plots do we need? How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff. But the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah. Did I give a damn about any of the characters? Did I really care what was going to happen next? Nope. Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is "County"?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch. The one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together. So, all in all, I wish I'd spent the time some other way.
5.0~I'm disappointed gaborjoo Sign in Permalink For me, 'Batman Begins' is the ultimate Batman movie and I was very much looking forward to The Dark Knight. I had some reservations about Heath Ledger and thought that the hype about his playing is created only because of his untimely death earlier this year. But I was wrong as he was excellent as the Joker. As a matter of fact, he was so much better than anyone else in this movie that he sort of played the others 'off' the screen. The acting the other big names did in this movie seems very weak if I compare it to Ledger's outstanding work. This is his movie,no doubt about that. My real problem with this movie was that the plot is weak and a lot of things are predictable. While '..Begins' builds up the world of Batman and explains his motivations, clearly shows the links and connections and does all this in a stunningly dark & sinister atmosphere, The Dark Night fails to build on the heritage of Nolan's first Batman movie. Techincally this movie is 10/10 but as long as the story, characters and playing are concerned, it is just lame at several points. Bale's 'Batman voice' is just terrible and ridiculous at the same time. Instead of adding to the 'batmanism' of Bruce Wayne this voice-thing makes him funny, in a very lame way. I was more than annoyed by this while watching the movie. All in all, I so much wanted to love this movie but looks like this won't happen. My mark is 5/10.
1.0~A massive let down after the brilliant Batman Begins newstarinthesky Sign in Permalink Review of one of the most surprising let downs follows. There are no spoilers, the film spoils itself enough... It's fair to say that prior to this film coming out I had concerns over the use of the Joker in this film. Concerns that only got more pronounced when I'd heard they cast Health Ledger in the role. Then I saw Brokeback Mountain and I became convinced that actually the guy had a raw talent and that maybe, just maybe, he could pull it off. Until the trailer came out and I was immediately concerned again. So how was Heath? Neither good nor bad. He was a live wire, and gleefully unpredictable and a shambolic, almost serpentine presence at points. But it wasn't spectacular. Talks of post-humous Oscar nods though are an exceptional exaggeration and unfortunately I believe this to be motivated by grief for Ledger. Aaron Ekhart's not bad, but I'm not really sure anyone knew why he was really there. I did NOT believe in Harvey Dent. Maggie Gyllenhaal was awful. It is a terrifying thing to say that Katie Holmes was better. You actually have your fingers crossed that someone will kill her right from the start. Morgan Freeman has a couple of nice moments but despite being given more screen time he contributes very little. Same with Gary Oldman. Seriously - what happened? Even Christian Bale seems to have lost a sense of what he's doing, Batman's voice getting ever closer to sounding like Rod Stewart's singing voice that at times I couldn't take it seriously, assuming you can make out what he's saying at all! It's difficult to comprehend that the same cast is in this film and Batman Begins, they really don't stack up side by side at all. Everone feels wasted. The Dark Knight is over long, it takes forever to really get any momentum going and then at the point you think it's starting it fails to launch. There are set pieces that don't really hang together and if you think about any of them for too long (which you will, as it does tend to drag) you'll find that they don't all make sense. One of the things that made Batman Begins so strong was a sense of realism - even going to great lengths to try to rationalize the ridiculous (a man dressed as a bat....). Tragically, The Dark Knight seems to have forgotten this entirely. Yes the Joker is larger than life but does that explain the obviously CGI enhanced stupid moments such as the Bat Pod cycling up a wall to flip over? There are too many of these moments - turning every cell phone into a sonar transponder in order to trace the Joker. Um? What? Also EVERYONE felt very written. Everyone's dialogue seemed to be furthering the plot rather than sounding like anything approaching reality. Michael Cain turns into Aunt May giving twee and convenient platitudes and nothing else - there's no sense of connection between him and anyone else. Gyllenhaal - even managing to leave twee and convenient letters to be read at twee and convenient moments. Aaron Ekhart seems to basically behave like a character bio rather than feeling terribly real and the whole descent into Two-Face thing STILL doesn't work. If you loved Batman Begins (and I did) you won't love this I'm afraid. You may not hate it, but I don't think you'll be impressed. I hope to watch this again at some point when the let down has passed me by and I'll hopefully enjoy it a bit more. There are three recent films I've been to see I had low expectations for - Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and The Dark Knight. The first two surprised me and exceeded my expectations. The latter has left me feeling a bit flat. I'm just very disappointed, Batman Begins set a very high mark. The Dark Knight by comparison is almost worth avoiding.
1.0~One of the worst films I've ever seen lunagranger Sign in Permalink This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The actors are good, as is the cinematography and the editing, but that's that. The script is a bunch of completely rubbish lines with no real meaning and special effects that have been done thousands of times and aren't interesting enough to keep our attention. The score is distracting. The villain is the most implausible villain I have ever seen. People who do evil things have purposes, the Joker doesn't have any. Even if there was a person like that, s/he wouldn't be able to have minions, because that kind of madness isn't a shared one. People kill for power or revenge, (or money, which is another type of power), basically. They have to have a purpose to unite and do evil things. All of the BS the joker said about evil and good completely miss the point about good, evil and humanity. They simply don't make sense. And what makes me furious is the fact that a lot of intelligent (or at least more or less intelligent) people are quoting those lines as if they meant anything. They don't. And they aren't even entertaining.
10.0~Movie Making At its Best !! jai84@yahoo.com Sign in Permalink The sheer brilliance of this film cannot be described in words. The Nolan brothers have delivered one of the most riveting and powerful scripts in recent times with lot of technical panache'. This is a film that never lets go of its momentum right from the beginning and holds your attention till the most morally complex climax in a summer movie. Do not treat this film as a superhero or a vigilante story. It has lot more going for it. For instance one of the many "Aces" in the movie is the Joker - heath ledger. He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenever he is on screen. The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be remembered for years to come. "The Dark Knight" is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story between good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective motives. Batman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the sacrifices he makes for the city he believes in. This is beautifully depicted in this movie and we feel for him when the movie reaches its pinnacle. There are lots of positives one can see within this 2 hour plus epic. In simple words. It is a 10 on 10 and must see.
6.0~So close, but not there Steve-275 Sign in Permalink With such effusive love offered for this movie here I feel out of place. But I don't think this is as good as Batman Begins. It's a good movie, no question. But I found it plodding more than once--the pacing just didn't work for me--and it stretched credulity too often. Batman Begins never lost that sense of credibility for me, but this one does. I expect to have to suspend disbelief for this genre of movie, don't get me wrong. But not this far. Batman Begins' pacing kept me better engaged as well. Nevertheless there was a lot to like here. The plot was solid, it advanced the characters and mythology of Batman well, there were inventive stunts and plot twists. There was plenty of good butt-kicking, the acting was superlative, and the new technology was great. It's a solid action film movie, just not one of the greatest ever. Some example of the issues I have follow, but they have some spoilers so I saved them for the end. (*Spoilers*) The way the Gotham citizens immediately decided that made an anarchist's demands were Batman's fault didn't wash either. I think the plot could have been stronger there. The make-up on Two Face was ridiculous. A burn that eats away most of his cheek and he's up and about within no time at all? Yes it looked a bit cool, but there's no way he'd survive it or could live that way if he did. (*Spoilers*) Then you have the Joker who seems to be able to plot excessive mayhem without anyone so much as noticing. "Let's plant 500 lbs of C4 all over a hospital. Heck, no one will notice!" Cell phones can't be triangulated in this movie. A guy with a reputation for randomly shooting henchman can get an endless supply of them. And it goes on. I still liked the movie, but there are plot holes that I just can't paper over and the movie was too long so I can't give it the 10 that so many are giving it here.
10.0~You will not know when the time passed. saurabhisgood-1 Sign in Permalink While watching this movie one does not realize time pass. We get so much involved we loose track of time. It is a must watch. All actors are good, story is good, action sequences are good. I cant think of something I don't like about the movie. Great Work! I enjoyed every minute of it. Normally we can guess what would happen in most movies near the end. In 'The Dark Knight' it is not easy to predict outcome of any scene. It is not even easy to imagine how the story would end. If you take three hours out of your normal busy life to watch this movie, I am sure you will not feel disappointed at the end of it. This is definitely way better than other super hero movies where the hero just always does the right thing without any logic.
8.0~Good Movie. zcmenefee Sign in Permalink I personally feel that the Dark Knight is a overrated film. It is not one of the top 10, or top 100 movies every made.It is a good movie that I recommend seeing and it is by far the best super hero movie to be released. But to call it one of the best and put it along side with movies such as Schindler's List and the Godfather is giving it to much praise. I know I am going to get a huge negative response for this comment due to the fact that everyone loves this movie so much but I personally don't think it is a flawless movie like everyone makes it out to be. It is good the acting is good the special effects are good,but the hype for this movie didn't reach a crazy level till Heath Ledger passed then right before release everyone started throwing a fit over this movie. Give it a watch and treat it as it deserves to be.
10.0~The Cinematic event of a generation scared_stifff Sign in Permalink There is a pantheon of movies that define a generation. Star Wars, The Godfather, Jaws and now, The Dark Knight. A cinematic masterpiece, the films 2 and a half hours are both too short, yet so immersing it seems like days. Not one frame of wasted celluloid was included. The cinematography was unbelievable with sweeping cityscapes and intense, explosive action sequences. The acting was also unbelievable; Between Heath Ledger's tour de force (which is definitely deserving of the Oscar buzz), Aaron Eckhart's tragic Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Gary Oldman's ever brilliant presence as Lt. James Gordan, and Christian Bale's intense and driven Batman/Bruce Wayne, everyone involved is absolutely stellar. However, what truly makes this film the cinematic event that it is, is the story. Truly epic in it's scope but always aware that personal tragedy is what drives it. This is a rare cinematic masterpiece in a time where summer movies have come to mean mindless fluff, this transcends the typical superhero movie to achieve something truly spectacular. Seeing this film was an experience that I will not soon forget and I truly hope others derive the same pleasure from seeing it that I did.
2.0~Very disappointing -- what a pity Hibk Sign in Permalink I'm downrating this movie strongly in response to the unbelievable amount of positive hype it's gotten (objectively I'd rate it a 4). I'm usually easy to please with movies; I loved Batman Returns. But "Dark Knight" was badly screwed up, IMO. What a pity. Pros: the acting was excellent (Ledger gives an all-out performance), and the visuals were great. Cons: some people have described this as a horror movie. But it's a horror movie without a good plot, without heroes, and without any emotionally satisfying defeat of the horror. Plot's a mess. Script was written by the director and his brother. It feels like the two pontificated and out-clevered themselves into writing a script that 1) tries to crams in *way* too much material and 2) feels awkward, meandering, preachy, and more interested in ideas than in characters or stories. No coherent storyarc; pacing is wrong. About halfway through the movie, there's a big death scene that in any other movie would have been part of the movie climax. But here, it's just another in an ongoing string of disasters. You have no idea where the movie's going after that; it devolves into one threat/action scene after another. Movie goes on far too long (people were muttering thru the last half, in my theater) and then just -- stops. No sense of triumph or closure; just another limp failure. One guy behind me said, "Well, whatever. I need a beer." Characterization was screwed. Multiple characters did things that made no sense logically in the story, or for their established personality. Because dialogue depends on decent characterization  much of the dialogue sucked. The romance elements? Yawn. Interpersonal relationship and conversational insights into characters? Double yawn. The heroes are shown as failures -- flustered, outmaneuvered, emotionally and morally bankrupt. Yeah, I want moral complexity in a superhero movie  but it also helps if the heroes are sometimes allowed to be, you know, heroes. Overall recommendation: worth seeing for the acting and visuals, but plot and characterization stink.
5.0~Overlong, overfunded, overstaffed, overrated---merely okay. JWJanneck Sign in Permalink I suppose many people might be offended by the simple suggestion that this movie could be anything less than "the best movie ever" or perhaps just "the best movie of 2008", that it was merely okay, for superhero action drivel. But to me, that's what it was. It's the old good vs evil thing, the good billionaire dons latex suit to fight the evil for no apparent reason other than that he's the good guy, and the bad guy being ridiculously-over-the-top so, with a similarly solid rationale. Then there is the another good guy who has to experience a biographical kink in the form of a girlfriend blown to pieces and some cosmetically challenging facial events, and he becomes the semi-good guy. Lots of explosions, pseudo- technology, vehicles driving above the speed limit, lots of fighting, the end. I never really understood the appeal of the Batman franchise, which turned a unremarkable set of comic books (uh, "graphic novels") into an unremarkable series of movies. Yet, many people seem to love it, and consequently another one of those hit the streets, bigger, better, more expensive, and this time with an IMDb rating that even made me curious. To be sure, there are many interesting and impressive aspects of the movie. The director, for one---I very much enjoyed Memento, and give Nolan a lot of credit for it. The cast of The Dark Knight is nothing short of impressive, with certified talent such as Caine, Ledger, Oldman, Bale, and Eckhardt. And, of course, the special effects are great, the fights are well-choreographed and fast-paced, the cinematography is excellent, and so on. It is, no doubt, a technically well-executed action flick, which I suppose is all that it wants to be, and probably all most of the people seeing it in the cinema expect it to be. But it is also other things. Overlong, for instance. The trivial comic-book plot does not sustain 150 minutes of interest, its self-indulgent repetitiveness becoming boring quickly, the little character development happening in cartoonish hit-you-over-the-head-with-hamfisted-symbolism style, the rest being fights, battles, destruction, and some more fights. The range of excellent actors that make up the cast remains woefully underused, although we do get so see some excellent acting, most notably from Ledger and Oldman. Ledger's Joker, in particular, does not require a very broad range, but it's far out in the crazy and psychopathic part of the spectrum, and Ledger manages to turn a fairly ridiculous and cartoonish villain into a three-dimensional and utterly creepy character, which is testimony to his acting ability. By and large, however, one does get the feeling that performance per talent ratio isn't a very good one, and that this crowd could have been put to better use in a more grown-up production with less of a focus on expensive action sequences. Overall, this movie is way over-hyped for what it is, it's not among the top ten movies of all time in my book, but then neither is "Shawshank Redemption" or "The Empire Strikes Back". It does have its moments, though, but it could easily be cut down to 90 minutes.
4.0~Solid Teen Film jax713 Sign in Permalink This is one of those films teenagers can see and then feel like they've seen a meaningful movie with great action scenes and grown-up themes, a movie that seems to present deep moral philosophies and it has the additional benefit of a cast that has real acting credentials. All in all, I suspect teens will rave about this movie as one of the best of all time. In reality, TDK shows what Christopher Nolan can - and can't - do with a big budget. He wallows in his own zeitgeist, stuck in the quicksand of his creativity and unable to hone & polish a slush fund of ideas and concepts about explosions, car chases, the rantings of a killer called The Joker, and the fortitude of a hero called Batman. The movie drags on and on and on looking for its core, but never finds it. Ultimately, all it finds are the excuses it needs for the special effects. Heath Ledger's performance is outstanding, but then his character is the only one in the film that has much of anything to say and, since he's a caricature, he can ham it up to his heart's desire. Character development is not high on the priority list. The supposed romance between plain-faced boring Rachel and Batman is like a red herring, serving what purpose I could not see. But then, plot development isn't a high priority for this story, either. There is a weak attempt to bring a mob crime boss into the plot as an accomplice to The Joker, and an even weaker sub-plot about moving money to Asia, but all of this is treated so superficially you can see how Nolan just doesn't have the artist's discipline to edit out unnecessary footage. He thinks *everything* he writes and films is important, forgetting that the mature audience is not looking for a ride on his ego trip. TDK has the look of a storyboard or perhaps a comic: blocks of scenes, dialogue, and graphics. It lacks the fluidity of true drama that is paced with suspense and emotional connections between characters. It lacks the wit that is absolutely necessary to make a fantasy entertaining and involving. It is overwrought, overlong, and bloated by its self-importance. But because it's Batman on a big budget and has little competition and critics are starved for something to praise, it will sell.
3.0~Tries to be more than just a superhero movie, and fails. Miura88 Sign in Permalink A film that can only be viewed in the Cinema. The overbearing score and use of Imax are testament to this. Also, this film would have been a 15, but Nolan wanted to break the box office records, so he toned down the violence and some of the realism so that little 12 year olds could be brainwashed into thinking this is a masterpiece. I have lost all respect for Mr Nolan at this point: This film is way too in love with itself, and for a film that tries oh so hard to be uber-realistic, it fails at many different points in the movie. Nolan was too ambitious in making a complex blockbuster, it's caught between two different worlds and remains confused about whether it is a serious gritty crime thriller, or a superhero movie, and fails on both levels. Batman Begins did the realism much better, with a better script and far better action sequences. This film suffers from poor editing, poor pacing, needless scenes, glaring plot holes, far too many improbables, and relies on the viewer suspending their disbelief for so long that the viewer will be unable to believe anything outside of Chris Nolan's Heat-inspired universe of Batman. Heath is good though, I'll give it that. But to call this one of the greatest films ever is an utter insult to every truly great director that has made far more and far better films than Christopher Nolan. A poor film that doesn't hold up on repeated viewings. I'm ashamed to admit that I preordered this "film" on DVD :(
10.0~I got my money back by the end of first half - second was an added bonus ! vijis15 Sign in Permalink Woooowwww !!! If I were Christopher Nolan, I would be thinking - "How would I make the sequel of this one and manage to better it??" The movie has got it all - Action(There are 5-6 of these and they kept me at the edge of my seat), the thrills, comedy(we all know whom we are speaking of),emotions, morale When the interval was announced, for a moment I thought that the movie is over and I was still happy to leave the hall. But, there was more coming! The cast was picture perfect except for Rachel(Guess we can live with that). Heath Ledger lead the way, Aaron Eckhart was not far behind and Christian Bale was still at his Batman-best. Add to all these some very impressive quotes through out the movie. and btw, hey IMDb - How do I rate a movie 11/10 ??
2.0~9.0??? You must be joking! Deckart71 Sign in Permalink After watching all three movies I must come to the conclusion that this is the weakest part of the three and that my initial thoughts of this movie were right this movie tries too hard! My first problem the main villain(who has more to do with The Crow than The Joker)besides a gag or two isn't funny(for all the over the top and campy acting of Nicholson his performance is much more true to the character and maybe even more menacing than Ledgers interpretation)and though it's a solid performance by Ledger(it's one of the good points in this movie)it isn't that impressive. The city has nothing to do with Gotham City whereas in part one you got the distinctive feel of a Gothic City in the second and third movie they seem to forget why Gotham City is called that way(it's more Techno-punk or Tech-noir than Gothic IMO) It takes itself way too serious and here lies the problem if you want us to take it seriously than there has to be something as logical plots and story-line.And you have to give us more than one dimensional characters if you want us to give a damn about them(and it's not that the talent is not there with a cast like this,but it's rarely used( example Gyllenhaal) IMHO Watchmen does a far better job and maybe because it has that seriousness in it's source-material whereas Batman has not(not in it's original form that is)which explains idiotic clues,like the scene with investigation of the bullet(It's The Joker NOT The Riddler),and inconsistencies in the characters e.g. The jokers says that he's like a mad dog chasing cars and acts psychotic while everything he does is very carefully planned far in advance that you have be rocket-scientist to plan like he does(if The Joker stands for chaos then it takes an awful lot meticulous planning and order to create chaos).And the transition from Harvey Dent into Two-face is plain silly. The score; somebody put Zimmer in a straight-jacket please has that man ever heard of the expression "less is more" important parts of the movie are totally spoiled by the far to present score.And then the giving of musical c(l)ues when something is going to happen,as if we are idiots(when you hear the beehive-like sound)becomes quite annoying. Maybe Two-face is actually the right comparison for this movie it's neither fish nor flesh it wants to be a great action-adventure comic - based movie on one side and a serious study into justice,power,chaos, terror and control on the other and that gives the whole movie a an artificial feel and it becomes frustrating when scenes for the sake of making a point interrupt the flow of the movie. all in all it tries to be two things at once and fails at both. 2/10
10.0~A strong Oscar contender that goes beyond being just a comic book superhero movie DrEbert Sign in Permalink "Batman Begins" set the tone for Christoper Nolan's take on the Caped Crusader by being more than a superhero movie. Instead of stringing together a plot to link huge action scenes and crazy villain antics, that film was a serious exploration of the psyche of Bruce Wayne, an attempt to understand what motivates a man to become a bat. Now, with "The Dark Knight", Nolan has done it again, but on a whole other level completely. "The Dark Knight" is not so much a superhero movie as it is an exploration of the nature of human morality. On the one hand, there is Batman, a hero for the causes of good who will never be seen as heroic because he is, in the end, a masked vigilante whose primary weapon against crime is fear. Bruce Wayne seeks the day when Gotham City will no longer need Batman, when a true knight-in-shining-armor will rise, somebody as incorruptible as Batman but also highly visible and inspirational. Batman stands for good, but he's no role model. Wayne sees such a role model in Gotham City's new district attorney, Harvey Dent, portrayed very strongly by Aaron Eckhart. Like Batman, Dent is a force for good. But, because he is on the correct side of the law, he can not only do good but also inspire others to do good. For Bryce Wayne (and many others), Harvey Dent is a savior, whereas Batman is a stop-gap solution. But, in order for Dent to remain a savior, he must truly be incorruptible, which is not easy. The film does a brilliant job of exploring exactly how much a man of good can be pushed. And who is there to do all of the pushing? Who is here to represent the forces of pure evil? In steps the Joker, a violent psychopath who unleashes chaos in Gotham City purely for the heck of it. This is not the cartoonish clown of prior Batman incarnations, who uses gags like exploding jack-in-the-boxes, hand buzzers that electrocute, or lapel flowers that squirt acid. No, this is a fiend who is pure evil. I don't use the word "evil" lightly and I feel like it is used too lightly in our common lexicon. For me, evil is beyond being very very bad or even irredeemably bad. Someone who is evil must fully understand the difference between right and wrong and still choose wrong out of disdain for what is right. That is what this Joker does, going beyond that to not only mock the forces of good, but to place them in situations that force them to question the nature of right and wrong. The Joker traps people in their own morality. He is in every way the Devil in a clown suit. Everybody knows about all of the buzz surrounding the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, and Ledger far exceeds expectations. He lives up to the hype and goes far beyond. There has not been a performance this strong in a very long time. Comparisons are already being made between Ledger's Joker and Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter from "The Silence of the Lambs," but the fact is that, as menacing and chilling as Lecter is, he's got nothing on the Joker. Hannibal Lecter can creep his way into your head, but the Joker will ask questions of your very soul. There has been much talk of giving Heath Ledger a posthumous Oscar for this role, but I will go one step further: if Heath Ledger does not win the Oscar for playing the Joker, then the award should not be given out this year at all. Not much has been said about the other characters, but they all give solid performances. Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon is something of an unsung hero in this film, in that he is what links Harvey Dent's brand of morality with Batman's brand of morality as well as being the link between Dent's actions within the law and Batman's actions outside the law. He stands in the movie speaking for us as an audience that supports Batman's vigilantism but also understands the needs of a civilized society and knows why Batman cannot become public policy and must remain an outlaw to be effective. Oldman has been known for his many villain roles, but here he plays a hero who doesn't have to wear a mask. There's an equally brilliant performance by Michael Caine as Alfred, a paternal figure for Batman who tries to keep him on track with his morality, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Batman's gadget man who makes a rather poignant remark about the morality of eavesdropping that feels particularly relevant in this day and age. By tackling an issue like morality, "The Dark Knight" has so deeply grounded itself in reality that it can be appreciated even by those who are not comic book fans. It is this that enables it to be more than just a superhero movie and which makes it a strong contender for the Best Picture Oscar. This is not just a comic book movie for kids. This is a powerful action movie, a technical and cinematographical masterpiece, and a serious philosophical exploration of morality for a mature, thinking audience. It is not only the best film in 2008 but also one of the best films to come along in a while.
10.0~Why The Dark Knight is one of the best movies ever created. jarzan2003 Sign in Permalink Although I realize that movies are a subjective experience and is unique in such a way based upon our preconceived ideas and presuppositions of what may or may not be entertaining to us personally, very few movies dare take us to a place that we know instinctively is true about each and every one of us and describes it in a way that becomes a creative mirror in which we are forced to look upon ourselves, and become disgusted or intrigued. What we have is a great movie that surpasses others in respect of revealing the truth that hides beneath the veil we create to make ourselves more respectable to others and to ourselves. It's a mask that we all put on everyday to make ourselves feel better about ourselves and our integration to those we consider to be our friends, our relatives and our world. When we see the Joker, we become revolted (at least I hope so) by his maniacal desire for destruction and reckless abandon of anything good. The Joker is motivated by nothing but pure hate for everything, even himself. Hate has so filled his soul that he seems distant, but so familiar. He seems to be the antithesis of what we desire, but not so removed that he becomes a figure we cannot associate with. How do you battle that level of hatred? Tolerance is impossible to give to the intolerant. Love is a mute weapon to those that have been hardened by hatred. It is here that we find the Joker within all of us. Have you not hated? Have you not been intolerant? Are we so beyond corruption that we can't see that Harvey Dent's transformation is far too plausible in each and every one of us? The Joker simply motivated Harvey by his pain and encouraged his hatred. He transformed. We see this in Anakin Skywalker who becomes Darth Vader. We see this in many movies but not so distinct and psychologically arresting as the Joker. The Joker goes beyond the limits of reality but reveals the truth that lies within our hearts in a personal way. Our ability to hate everything and to wish hurt upon others when we are in pain. Even if you keep it hidden within, you know the capacity is there. It's not beyond us, it's with us each and every moment, and all it takes is one incident and you too become that which you hate to acknowledge is part of yourselves. Batman wasn't immune to its effects either. Hatred motivates Batman just as well as the Joker. The two become symmetrical. To fight invincible hatred, you too must become one that hates as much, or more than your opponent. We know that hatred is wrong, but it's the only weapon against hatred. You become what you fight, you become something you abhor. This is Batman's dilemma. When we look at the two ferries and their ability to destroy one another or to succumb death in the absence, do we find ourselves wishing that we had the strength not to blow the other boat to bits? It becomes fantasy that one of the boats didn't destroy the other, and we have the gall to call this movie dark? Real life is far darker that what we want to believe since we have deluded ourselves to believe that we cannot enter that realm of self denigration. Who would have thought that a fantasy movie could be as bold as to show this and under a cover of an action flick? What we are presented with is a vivid documentary of our own corruption that lies within all of us. This is where The Dark Knight treads its dark path. Whether or not the true intension of the movie was to reveal this mystery of the human condition, the brilliance of The Dark Knight shows us something that we are at once familiar with, but in many cases, as the voting suggests, we are also repulsed by it. For those people who didn't enjoy the movie, it is because The Dark Knight reveals too much truth for comfort. The Dark Knight isn't simply a great movie, it's an absolute masterpiece that is awe inspiring to those that have the honesty to look into themselves and see the revelation of their own condition and find that they too are weak and susceptible to corruption, given the right conditions. What is that condition? To either find yourself in the presence of hatred, or to be consumed by it. We can see those truths within Hitler and how an entire country succumbed into the madness of hatred. We see it more today when we see "radical Islam" with its complete and utter intolerance towards the west and towards others that don't align to its agendas. This is the level of hatred that replicates the ideology of Nazism in its entirety. It's there for everyone to see, but we refuse to see. We don't want to believe that that type of hatred exists and we become self deluded when we refuse to see the truth. The Joker's level of hatred exists within this world, and we face the same dilemma as Batman. Do we fight against this evil and consider it evil to battle against it? This is exactly what is happening today! It's relevant, and we wish it weren't that way, but that is exactly the point. We wish, and we become self deluded when we do, and become useless against stopping hatred from thriving. Hatred has a way of expanding, having a life of its own. The Dark Knight reveals the truth about hatred and we will either acknowledge it as being true and relevant, or dismiss it simply because we cannot tolerate that much truth being revealed. My prediction is that The Dark Knight will win at least 3 Oscars including picture of the year.
10.0~Heath Ledger's Dark and Brilliant Swan Song filmquestint Sign in Permalink I couldn't believe "The Dark knight" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. "The Dark Knight" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.
2.0~Not even the best movie of 2008. p_h_a_r_o_a_h_e Sign in Permalink To start, I would like to say that this movie is not even as good as Batman Begins. Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors, Batman is one of the best super heroes, but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather. This is a very good movie, but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it. Health Ledger's death had more of an impact on this movie's critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie. The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool, not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS. People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker. Also, Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film, which is quite annoying. After seeing the movie, you might even realize that Christian Bale's obscure placement throughout the film is a major flaw. The Godfather is around 3 hours, this is around 2&1/2 hours, yet this movie feels much slower. Rather than keeping a steady pace, the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out 30 minute action sequences. It's ridiculous. The best movie of 2008 is In Bruges, not TDK.
1.0~The film was contrived long boring and designed for a captive audience Ozzy2000 Sign in Permalink Having negative opinions about this film does not constitute "Trolling" as defined by Wikipedia. The film was entertaining but was arguably worse than other Batman films from the past. There appeared to be a shift from the Comic book hero being the main protagonist to the "Joker" being the main character. The purpose of such a film had more to do with the marketing of the film within the controversy of and blatant exploitation the Actor Heath Ledger's death. This has lead to arguably and debatable claims about Ledger's performance in the film. This is understandable as his fans will not tolerate any negativity with regards his performance. as a result this message board is dominated by those who totally dismiss the great performance of other Batman villains such as Danny De Vito as the Penguin and the list is long. There as has been some very intelligent comments detailing how this film veers from the comic book hero, upon which it is based, to a dark "Cop" film. None the less the film is a hit and Ledger fans expect Heath Ledger's role as the "Joker" to earn an Oscar and go down as the greatest performance of an actor in the history of Film. I personally believe that Heath Ledger's and Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the Joker a bit too morbid but none the less effective as a villain. Overall the film was contrived and formulated and the script was a bit dodgy as far as story line but so are all Comic Book hero films. I thought Christian Bale's performance as Batman was great but the digitally enhanced voice effect made him seem too dark a Knight. In fact judging by this forum one would think that Batman was now the villain and the "Joker" was the great good guy. It was far from being a great film and eventually the hysteria from the more juvenile minds will subside and the film will fade into the esoteric world of the "Batman" collector.
7.0~great but doesn't deserve to be compared with masterpieces rodigon7 Sign in Permalink Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable. Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks...
6.0~Where's the Gargoyles? charlie262 Sign in Permalink Once again, I fell for the hype. I went into the theater fully expecting another Titanic or Star Wars. Nope, not by a long shot. The Dark Knight is a routine noisy summer blockbuster with lots of explosions, gunfire, and car chases. Ledger's overly talky, Joker-meets-Hannibal-Lechter performance borders on the annoying; about two-thirds of the way through the film I just wanted him to shut up. Christian Bale is wooden in and out of the bat suit--I can't think of a single scene he dominates as Bruce Wayne. Far from being the greatest comic book movie of all time, Dark Knight falls well short of the first Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal is no Kim Bassinger, and modern-day Chicago is no Gotham City. Where's Wayne Manor? Where's the Bat Cave? Where's the friggin' gargoyles?
5.0~Distinctly average and surprisingly rather dull pfgpowell-1 Sign in Permalink It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all.
10.0~Amazing!! to say the least........ myselfr7 Sign in Permalink Let's start with Batman's last line "You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain". This movie is surely the best of the year so far and deservedly so. I'll keep it short...all the characters and are given a worth time on screen(although i still want more of heath:p). The direction is superb as well is the acting by whole cast, even the small characters of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are very well dealt with. But the most important person who steals the show is one and truly MR.Heath Ledger; even Batman looks a bit frightened by him(look at the eyes of batman when he interacts with joker in cell). This is easily the best batman movie and way better than "Begins". So i'll just say watch it even if u are not familiar with batman franchise. Watch it simply for the cynicism of heath ledger and u'll know why is there an Oscar buzz. Hat's off to Nolan and RIP Heath Ledger we'll miss ya. EASILY 10/10 AND HEATH 100/10
1.0~The worst Batman Movie ever. mithril013-1 Sign in Permalink This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The dialog was often difficult to hear, especially Batman who, for some unknown reason, seemed to be suffering from Laryngitis. Because of the "Dark" nature of the movie it was often far "too dark" to see what was happening. All which meant that the plot was far more difficult to follow. Since the days of Adam West, we have seen several different "Batmen" not least Val Kilmer and Michael Keaton to name two who were far better at it than Christian Bale. As for Heath Ledger, I thought his character was so over played that he stole the show so to speak but as for awarding him a posthumous Oscar, well thats another matter and I personally don't think so.
10.0~Best Superhero movie of the year or Best movie of the year ? madguzzzzz-1 Sign in Permalink It is very rare that we see a movie with as much hype as this live up to it, and even more rare that it will surpass all expectation in every way.... this did. Fromhe plot to the acting everything in this movie is in my opinion perfect. Sure some people out there will say that with a running time of two and a half hours that its to long.... well who ever says that you f*cking wrong. This should remind the Academy that it possible to make a blockbuster and a masterpiece.... that it is possible to have great action and acting. Heath Ledger has cemented his place in cinema history with this role, this twisted sick version of the joker that he created will stand the test of time, will be one of those characters that will be talked about long after we are all gone. Jacky N. look out your becoming nothing more then a memory of things that came and went Ledgers performance makes Jacks look like B performance. Leaving the theater all i heard all around me was talk of the Joker,unfortunately i feel that the re of the cast will be over looked Arron played and incredible Harvey Dent/ Twoface a well, his turn to the "dark side" was so believable that its freaky, Bale is yet again amazing as batman and quite possibly gave a better performance here then in begins. So i raise the question... ...Best Superhero movie of this year or the best movie of this year?
10.0~Best. Comic. Movie. EVER. LennyRenquist Sign in Permalink I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet. But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' MASTERPIECE of a superhero film. To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'. While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the viewer's interest. And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too. But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down to the cast. Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose it's pretty appropriate. Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how can I put it...? It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just looks...well...lame. If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment. Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks. As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea. Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz. Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK. Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz. Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister! The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and action. I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin), but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.
10.0~It sure put a smile on my face! bigtimage Sign in Permalink I've read past comments saying this was a poor movie due to it being irrelevant to the original comic storyline and the dark ambiance that this movie portrays to younger audiences. But think about it. This movie had everything! Not only was the acting of the entire cast (not only Heath Ledger)superb, but it had action (shooting and explosions), horror (just look at the Joker), romantic toils, suspense and comedic jokes here and there. The meaningful dialogue teaches the audience great moral of order and anarchy, but isn't covered up by the special effects and CGI, which were still impressive. Frankly, after seeing that movie, I don't really care for the original storyline of the comic. Nor do I care that it's somewhat long. Nor do I care that it's unsuitable for younger audiences (like me). This is the best movie since Godfather!
9.0~I am speechless mavluvsleafs Sign in Permalink I can't put into words what I had witnessed in this movie. I can't call this a movie because it's so much more than that. this movie has acting than you see a mad truly loose his ming on the screen. This whole movie I was holding back tears because you witness a actor surpass acting and fake into reality. On top of all of that the acting is amazing and the filming angles and the story direction keeps begging for more because of your pure awe. To put I simply this movie will blow you away and make you analyze the film industry in different light. The film surpassed my expectations and a have been a huge batman fan since the day I was born. I thought Iron Man was amazing till this movie... RIP Heath Ledger
8.0~Shouldn't Be In The Top Fifty kendalc Sign in Permalink This movie was very well done, but does not compare with most of the movies in the top fifty. Hype has built up this movie, coupled with the over-played fact that Heath Ledger overdosed on medication. While Heath Ledger made the character interesting, his acting does not compare with TRULY emotionally impacting roles. Compare his acting with Jack Nicholson in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". While Heath Ledger's portrayal was effective, the SCRIPT and the director made the movie truly effective. Also, this movie did not possess the intelligence of other Christopher Nolan movies. In my opinion, the best part of Christopher Nolan's movies has always been his manipulation of time. This is the first of his movies that did not make use of this. Movies like Memento and the Prestige made use of time to create a sophisticated twists and turns. These movies did not reach the rating given "The Dark Knight" due partly because their sophistication caused them to lose widespread popularity, and also because they were not hyped as large summer blockbusters. The widespread popularity of this movie, as well as undeserved hype, will eventually calm, and this movie will be pushed out of the top fifty.
10.0~The dark and sinister mood of the film really sets the theme of the movie the-movie-guy Sign in Permalink (Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him. (My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)
3.0~Some action movie -featuring Batman mikl-11 Sign in Permalink Like many a thing, keeping it simple is one way to make it good. As much as I loved Batman Begins, I disliked The dark Knight. The movie wanted to cram so many sub-plots into it that at some time I didn't know exactly where it was going. And is this movie really about Batman??? If it was, there are some features in it that made it look like a CHEAP Batman: 1. OK, Wayne's manor was destroyed, blah blah. But making Batman roar out of a CONTAINER??? Can we make this any cheaper? An underground lair for Batman that seems to contain NOTHING but a table and a chair and a few other stuff???? Production could have made a little effort there, really... 2. Batman's costume, frankly didn't look THAT better than the Batman wanna-bes. And what's that fuss about dogs? Batman's costume isn't dog proof. It's bullet proof, fire-proof, shock-proof and nearly stupid-proof but please don't unleash the dogs on poor Batman... pathetic, really. The movie in itself does not lack action and blow-away special effects, but the storyline really lacks of substance. We see Batman in a supporting role, to do what others ask him to do, we don't see Batman as the leader and coming up with unexpected plans and twists - U gotta bring back the Chinese guy, OK I'll go. -U gotta save the hostages, I'll go. U gotta do this, do that? I'll go. Anything else? Tea or Coffee anyone? Not the best movie, at any cost. Not of the year nor of any time, sorry...
10.0~Is The Dark Night the best movie of all time? vincylou Sign in Permalink Is The Dark Night the best movie of all time? On IMDb.com, a popular movie database with over 300,000 members ranging from occasional moviegoers to film producers and financiers, The Dark Night has vaulted over The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption as the #1 movie of all time. The rankings, an accumulation of user votes that are generally more favourable to the great modern movies than those of the Silver Screen era, have, in the past, been prone to such invasions  The Return of the King debuted at #3 before settling into its current position at #14  but in the 10 years that I have used to the site to build up my vast wealth of movie trivia knowledge, I have never seen a film as universally well received as The Dark Knight. Consider the demographic breakdown of the votes: As expected, males under 30 love the movie, with the under-18 male crowd giving the movie an average ranking of 9.7 out of 10. A more unexpected result is 8.0 out of 10 average score among females over 45, an astounding number for a Batman movie. So is The Dark Knight potentially the greatest film ever made and can a question like that be asked and answered less than a week after the film made its debut? Most of us have a favourite movie. The question is, when does a person realize that their favourite movie is their favourite movie? For me, I knew right away. I watched Lawrence of Arabia for the first time, after ordering the video during the infamous days of Columbia House, and instantly fell in love. I have never seen, then or since, a movie of such visual depth, and the main characters in the film were aged, experienced politicians and monarchs, wise to the world and aware of the complexities of life. When they spoke, they revealed an understanding that few men achieve, none more so than Prince Feisal, who tells us that, "Young men make wars, and the virtues of war are the virtues of young men: courage, and hope for the future. Then old men make the peace, and the vices of peace are the vices of old men: mistrust and caution.". The story of the World War I Arab revolt in the dessert is of important historical significance, and even if the film is a largely fictional representation, Lawrence of Arabia is a vital piece of art. I digress, back to The Batman. Reading through various blogs, I find the Internet buzzing. Film critics have almost universally proclaimed the movie to be a highly entertaining piece of Crime Fiction, but they hold their cards close to their chests. No self-respecting critic, after years of studying 1000s of films, will anoint last weekend's Hollywood blockbuster as the new King of Cinema. Even The Godfather, easily the favourite film of the Baby Boomer generation, hasn't achieved that status and is still climbing to the top 36 years after its release. The Godfather is a masterpiece for many of the same reasons I listed for Lawrence of Arabia, and its dark cinematography and reflective dialogue give us a riveting glimpse into a world gone mad. Is the Dark Knight the same kind of seminal work? Stripping away most of the silliness of comic book style movies, keeping only the unfathomably useful gadgets of the Batman, and the circus style flashiness of the villains, The Joker and Two Face, The Dark Night explores the tension of a city under siege from the point of view of the main protagonists. Much like The Godfather and Lawrence of Arabia, the Dickensian aspect of the story is largely ignored. Innocent bystanders aren't of interest here (the one exception being a remarkably tense sequence on two passenger ferries trying to leave the city), they are just the money on the table in a life or death poker game between Heath Ledger's manic Joker and Christian Bale's reluctant Batman. The movie is a visual spectacle, but the distinct feature of this 'comic book' movie is its willingness to throw out good and evil as character descriptions, making the film a study in criminal behavior and the moral decisions crime fighters must make for the good of the society as a whole. Harvey Dent, destined to become Two Face, and Bruce Wayne, The Batman, must ask themselves what they are willing to do to stop The Joker, whose terrorist plots threaten to destroy what little innocence the 'good' citizens of Gotham cling to, resulting in Dent and Wayne making questionable moves that don't always gain the support of those around them, as when Batman decides to monitor the cell phone activity of the entire city, The Batman's own interpretation of The Patriot Act. I wondered earlier what makes a person decide on their favourite movie. I suspect a lot of people will now say The Dark Knight, but I think its impact will remain shrouded for at least a decade, when George Bush is long removed from the White House and the days of terrorist hysteria have hopefully subsided in our society. Only then will The Dark Knight's allegorical undertones have a full impact on viewers. For now, I think this film is a masterpiece of noir cinema, potentially a brilliant metaphor for our times.
3.0~Expectations met me-2767 Sign in Permalink I originally didn't intend to see this movie but invited out by a person I couldn't ignore I went along to see if this movie was hype driven and it appears to be almost completely the case. I am not going to waste anyone's time by commenting upon direction, actors qualities and the art deco ambiance and other such pretentious twaddle because stories are just that and this one was a largely thought free action movie on a par with snakes on a plane (which I respect for being exactly what it intends). Based on the American wrestling formula, where the ultimate victor starts off by winning then takes a pounding only to come back and win the day, it holds roughly to that formula. Still this is to be expected as it is from a comic book and so was aimed at the 10-14 age range (motorcycles with rocket launchers kinda crap - need I say more). If your of an analytical mind then don't waste your time, if your 10-14 or of that mental age then go for your life you'll love it.
6.0~Totally overrated michelhovenkamp-1 Sign in Permalink Seeing as this movie was in the IMDb top 10 of all times i decided i should have a look. So yesterday i decided to watch it and my expectations were very high. First off; Yes it is an enjoyable movie, but does it deserve to be in the top 10 of greatest movies all time? My opinion is no, not at all... Heath Ledgers plays his role really good. He is the scariest and best joker i've seen in the Batman films so far. The way he portraits the joker sometimes makes you wonder if he's acting or just really insane, brilliant performance! I found the Batman character a bit overdone by Christian Bale (his voice is a bit overreacted in my opinion). So does this have the best acting in movies of all time? No.. its just Heath who does a good job here for me... The story evolves around Gotham being terrorized by the mafia and the joker. Harvey Dent (who later becomes 2 face) wants to clean up the city. He succeeds in this at first, however he did not get to the real mastermind, the joker. The Joker is a criminally insane mastermind. The movie has some action scenes that evolve about people being kidnapped and batman saving them. I know its an adaptation to the comic book version, but i found the story to be really weak and predictable. And the good guy gone bad (harvey dent) is one big cliché. I've all seen it before! Even the kidnapping.. i mean come on... this is one of the best story's told of all time? No.. so what makes the movie get this high rating then? When i finished watching the movie i was absolutely shocked... How did this movie get an 8.9 on IMDb? How did it end up in the top 10 of best movies all time? Really.. I think this is a good movie, but one of the best... no way! It does not have the deep involving storyline of the Godfather nor the unique plot twists Pulp Fiction has. It also does not have the epic feeling any of the Lord of The Rings movies have. Actually i can find nothing where the movies really stands out compared to other typical action movies. And if you want to compare it to comic book movies... Sin City does a way better job at creating a unique atmosphere and also has a more unique story. I find this to be an enjoyable movie, but also one of the most overrated movies of all time. I seriously can not see why this should be on par with: The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Lord of the Ring or Sin City.
10.0~A Masterpiece that will satisfy every Batman and even Non-Batman fans! Watcher87 Sign in Permalink I had my reservations about watching this movie, especially since I was not hugely sold on "Batman Begins". I had my objections with the cast upon first glance - Aaron Eckheart being too pretty a face (and just that for that matter) for Two-Face and Heath Ledger was DEFINITELY not my first choice for the Joker, cos lets face it... A guy whom girls swoon over just by hearing his voice is someone who is ill suited to play a sadistic, barbaric and nutty homicidal maniac. Yeah, thats not the case anymore. Heath Ledger - Boy was I wrong! From the moment he stepped on screen at the bank I was blown away by how evil and dark he immediately came off as. I was actually curled up and scared in my seat every time he wielded a knife, fearful for what he would do to the people he eventually killed. I laughed with wide open eyes in surprise with the jokes he pulled to kill off those in his path ("I'm going to make this pencil disappear!"). It was truly one of the best performances I have ever seen, a re-invention of the Joker that stays true to the comics and retains a constant pull on the viewer throughout. Gary Oldman - This man is pure brilliance! I really didn't know if they would kill him off or keep him alive, the silent communication between him and batman was an excellent dynamic to play off of. The last scenes in the movie had me on the edge of my seat, feeling him plead for the lives of his family - utterly heart wrenching. He truly embodies the loyalty and purity of the Jim Gordon we know and love. Aaron Eckheart - Again very glad to be proved wrong. Obviously his portrayal of Harvey Dent would be flawless, but Two-Face? Personally I was pleasantly surprised by another actor who could do evil the way he did Two-Face. Wayyyy better than Tommy Lee Jones by light years! Plot wise: Everyone goes into the movies these days with the idea that "ooo its definitely going to work out this way" and if they deviate from the norm, the plot is worked into a deus ex machina. Well NO!! The writers deserve every award possible for this script, every turn every move was well thought out - except for the Harvey not killing Joker thing, that was just plain... dumb. The only thing I regret about this movie is the lack of Batman. He's supposed to be the world's greatest detective and we have yet to see that in any shape or form, because he was always always at a disadvantage against the Joker and even Two-Face. Also I still am not convinced by Christian Bale (because he is just the muscle and pretty boy). And Michael Caine is too good for the role of Alfred. Still, this movie was sheer genius and I hope everyone gets every award possible for this movie.
1.0~Terrible acting, screenplay and direction. alex57366208 Sign in Permalink Terrible acting (I burst out laughing a few times at the voice of the actor portraying batman), non existent character development, a plot so thin you can see through it in the first ten seconds of the film, and, on occasion, direction so incompetent as to not warrant comment. It also goes without saying that this is pure, unadulterated, US propaganda, designed to legitimise wrongdoing and evil, of the most laughable kind since Transformers. Really, it's not even the best film I've seen today. Also, don't believe the online hype, most of the people commenting on this page will be paid shills. I have yet to meet anyone IRL who thinks that it is anything like as good as these reviews make out.
5.0~A Batman Movie? Stamp-3 Sign in Permalink Anyway, I finally got round to seeing The Dark Knight and, given the overwhelming and fanatical praise the movie has engendered, a rather negative critical evaluation which pours cold water on the mass hysteria seems a bit pointless. Because what do I know? But here goes anyway! So let's confine ourselves to a couple of observations that might give the adoring fans some food for thought. The plot, whilst completely linear, and in fact, rather banal, was confusingly laid out, and not because Nolan was trying for anything enigmatic or even thought provoking; simply it was a tale not very well told. Muddying up a plot, especially one so basic, is not the mark of a clever movie, simply a poor one. The fight scenes were likewise confused and consequently rather uninvolving. And somebody must have been on a bonus to see how many shots of the back end of the "Batcycle" could be included in the final cut. POSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENT POSSIBLE SPOILER ELEMENT But the real surprise for me was the misuse - and I think it is misuse, however deliberately it was conceived - of the central character of Batman. Batman was essentially a bystander in his own movie. He didn't really seem to do anything, other than swan off to Hong Kong, a sub plot that seemed to be taken from a another movie altogether. Harvey Dent was the protagonist of this film and The Joker the antagonist. Batman was seemingly cast adrift, totally peripheral and rather ineffective. It seemed to me that everyone's destiny was settled without much help from Batman, and even the Joker achieved pretty much what he wanted to do. I'd almost go as far to say that if the movie had done away with Batman and had been rewritten as a straight crime procedural, it would have been a better movie. Now Nolan and his buddies obviously know what they wanted to achieve, which is fair enough. I am just surprised with the impression I was left with. Still as I said at the beginning, I am really the wrong person to critique this film. I was cajoled into going and I thought, well it will probably be OK. And, being kind, that is just about what it was.
2.0~What a disappointment rps-2 Sign in Permalink Okay. Heath Ledger was worth it. He has created a classic screen villain with his Joker and he deserved his (posthumous) Oscar. The rest of it? Whaaaa... Batman seems to be another classic film franchise that now takes itself seriously. James Bond has become a serious guy and the movies no longer are fun. Same here. Remember both the old Batman TV series and the early movies with their WHAM POW graphics and their delightfully camp dialogue? (Holy hockey pucks, Batman....) (Come to think of it, where was Robin in this Batman outing? Probably auditioning for Hamlet.) Chicago just doesn't make it as Gotham City which used to have such a dark, surrealistic quality. And I had trouble sorting out the good guys and the bad guys. There are no white hats and black hats here. They're all varying shades of grey. Even Batman is a bad guy. Or is he? The effects are good but no better than what the computer now has made routine. Really. They have to do better than blowing up everything in sight and rolling police cars like yo-yo's. Been there, done that! I won a voucher for a free movie in a scratch and win promotion. It was due to expire yesterday so I thought I'd pick up a movie I wanted to see. I had read all the rave reviews about this one and about its various awards. Even the IMDb rating is a rare 9. Gotta be a great evening. Uh uh. At least it didn't cost me anything other than a couple of confused hours.
1.0~Keep it real Virilant Sign in Permalink I gave this movie a 1 to balance the media hype and sheep that placed this movie so high on IMDb ratings. The movie was absurd and far too long. Given the ratings I was really expecting something special. Its a shame this has been voted a 9 above some of the more deserving movies... A few scenes really killed it for me. The bike with balloon tires that rides up an bounces of walls was madness. The blue eyes that could see the cell phone signals... ouch! The car that jumped between the missile! Nice, but NO! And that painful voice. Did I mention it was far too long? I hope more people vote and leave this movie with the 5.0 that it really deserves. Filter by geography might help to keep it real.
10.0~I waited to see this movie......... beatlebug0066 Sign in Permalink I waited to see this movie just because there was so much hype and I wanted everything to calm down and go in the theater with an open mind. I finally saw it yesterday. It was brilliant! Great story, wonderful effects, and the acting was amazing. Heath Ledger freaked the heck out of me....and I can not say that in any more simpler words.....he was a FREAK in this movie. I loved it. I cannot believe anyone who does not like this movie...especially if this kind of movie is their cup of tea. I recommend seeing this one on the big screen. As people are saying, this was Ledgers Swan Song....well he sung it to perfection. :) Christain Bale, of course, was wonderful playing Batman. Along with Freeman, Cane, and Oldman, it was a superb cast. I love the fact that we have this mega-blockbuster with some incredible credited actors! YES!
2.0~Horrible Movie measureman1 Sign in Permalink 1) A general comment... This movie typifies why I would like to see IMDb have a system that deletes user ratings every year for ten years after a movie is released (maybe keep the last years ratings and delete the years before that one's user ratings until ten years is up, if you catch my drift). If "Twister" 1996 came out now a days there would be 300k people voting in 3 days and giving it an 8.6 rating (still to high at 6.0, but the movie wasn't very old when IMDb started up). 2) Review... I couldn't finish watching "The Dark Knight". I tried earlier this year and then again the other night. It was horrible..... Let's start with the actors shall we... Ken dolls trying to act; a "cough-cough" not very attractive leading lady; and, of course, the highly overrated, yet not all that terrible, performance from Heath Ledger. Let's face it, anyone who saw "Batman" 1989 could see the rip off with Ledger's Joker. Michael Caine as Alfred???? Could you take him seriously as Alfred after seeing him in Austin Powers. The Chinese bad guy was the best actor in the movie...Are you starting to understand how bad this is yet?! I just can't go into how poor the story elements are too much. I'll get a migraine. Example: The prosecutor punches the witness and then takes a gun off someone, pulls it apart and then leaves it in front of the defendant. No, I didn't oversimplify it. I didn't leave something out. It's really that stupid. The rest of the movie (at least as far as I got) is also that bad. I think that's all I need to say. There's just no point in going on. I'll just add the one positive aspect... The effects are top notch. 3) Summary... Money, hype, dead actor hype, special effects, blah blah blah. You know the drill. You only get one pair of eyes, so take care of them. Stay away!!!
9.0~Close to perfection tam_toby Sign in Permalink The chills that I got while watching this movie was something i don't get that often. The already legendary role of the Joker played by Heath Ledger is nothing more then ... well legendary. Ledger isn't playing the Joker in this movie, he is the Joker. To me Ledger makes a big part of the movie. But however it is unfair to only credit Ledgers performance because there is so much else that is good about this movie. Let's not forget the terrific job Nolan has done in making Batman come alive again. I honestly thought that even though Batman Begins was good Nolan was never gonna be able to live up to the whole Batman vibe that was going round for months. Well I can also honestly tell you that the movie knocked my socks off. So i guess i was wrong. And then there is the great chemistry between all the actors. It just works. Christiane Bale does a more then decent job in portraying the Batman once more. Michael Caine an Morgan Freeman both flawlessly take on there roles and then let's not forget the breathtaking Maggie Gyllenhaal. Who shows convincingly that she was up to take the role of a blockbuster dame. Also Aaron Eckard does a great job in portraying the overly good Harvey Denth. And Gary Oldman isn't the least boring in his role as a fighter of injustice in Gotham. Everybody in this movie adds an important deal in the clever storyline that Christopher Nolan has set out for the Dark Knight. Because The Dark Knight indeed has a clever and not at all predictable story line. Batman is still a blockbuster so don't expect a memento like plot but it's definitely better what we are used from Warner Bros blockbusters. Even though it's all that people talk about I still want to end this review with the performance of Ledger. When I first heard that Heath Ledger was assigned to the role of the Joker I was a little more then surprised. I mean don't get me wrong hes made some good movies before this, but the Joker isn't exactly the same as a gay cowboy. 'You need someone a little disturbed for this role'. Well who knew that Ledger had a bit of psychopathic terror in him after all. In his role as the Joker he makes Hannibal Lector look like a family entertainer. Ledger completes the movie. The Dark knight is good, but Ledger is Phenomenal. This is a movie that you have to go see! Even if you don't like Batman, then just go see the Joker.
5.0~Disappointing stephenmarch Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight has slick production value and impressive acting, but much of it is poorly paced and poorly written. It amazes me that a movie could at once be so stellar in terms of execution, yet so lackluster in terms of conception. I say this because it's apparent that many of the people involved in cinematography, costume, makeup, sound, special effects, editing, etc. did very good work, but no amount of talent could save such a weak script. There's really no reason to care about any of the characters, and I was actually bored throughout much of the movie. The Dark Knight masquerades as a high-quality crime drama, expertly manipulating the audience into thinking that it's going to be a good movie, to such an extent that many people have actually been tricked into believing that it is a great movie. The Dark Knight somehow never lives up to its hype. Despite the fact that many of the people who worked on this movie really tried to make it great, The Dark Knight's inability to reconcile its pretensions of sophistication with its silly, comic-book origins ultimately causes its reach to exceed its grasp.
7.0~Deserves another look for the performances alone... Doylenf Sign in Permalink For a film based on a comic strip character that runs for some two hours and forty-five minutes, I feared I'd be bored long before the film was over. Usually I'd be checking my watch in the dark if a film runs this long without any redeeming qualities. But there's plenty to like in THE DARK KNIGHT--most of all, the performance of HEATH LEDGER as "The Joker", a much darker and more fully realized "joker" than has ever been shown before. The dialog is well sustained throughout, moving the film along briskly despite all the explosions and action sequences that you expect in this sort of thing. And everyone plays their roles with so much authority that you find yourself drawn in by the many characters on display. Along with HEATH LEDGER, there's Christian BALE, GARY OLDMAN, MICHAEL CAINE, MORGAN FREEMAN, MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL (a welcome replacement for Katie Holmes), CILLIAN MURPHY and ERIC ROBERTS (Julia's brother), and all of them are admirably cast. Special mention, too, for AARON ECKHART's role as Dist. Atty. Harvey Dent or Two-Face. He's excellent. Furthermore, the cinematography, sets, costumes and CGI are of the highest order, as is a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. If you relish this sort of entertainment, it's not to be missed. And I certainly agree that Ledger's energetic performance must have required an amazing amount of energy and skill to pull off. He's created a vivid portrait and surely deserves an Oscar nomination this year. Summing up: Definitely not for the kiddies. Too much of it is on the dark side. Stunning to watch.
9.0~An Objective Review MOOVYZ Sign in Permalink I have never been a comic book fan. The last one I ever read was an "Archie" from the 1960s. That being said, I do like adaptations of comics and graphic novels. They make great stories and even better movies that even reach the mainstream audiences. Recent example like "Spiderman", "Ironman" and "The Incredible Hulk" have shown that these films handle the crossover very well when in the hands of competent direction. I loved "Batman Begins". It seemed a much more realistic and serious attempt than the earlier "Batman" franchise movies. Even with Jack Nicholson as the Joker, those movies came off as more silly than fun. SPOILERS*** "The Dark Knight" was obviously on my short list of movies coming out this year that I really looked forward to. And overall, I wasn't disappointed. The is a really good movie. It is not, IMHO, an exceptional movie. It IS an exceptional performance by Heath Ledger. A true "tour-de-force", knock-you-upside-the-head, smile-till-it-hurts performance that makes the film stand out as this summer's best. Dead or alive, he deserves the Oscar and I'm betting he will get it, albeit posthumously. You can tell that he totally "immersed" himself in the role and that might have created the environment that led to his death, as reported. One can't easily move in and out of character when one takes it "so seriously", pun intended. But as I hinted in my overall enjoyment of the film, this performance alone does not make this an exceptional movie. I realize that the Fanboys are going to take exception to that comment. But if all aspects are looked at objectively, this, I believe, will be the common opinion. Christopher Nolan takes us on a great ride. He is easily placed near the top of a list of directors who can envision the transformation from comic to film with ease. He tells a great story, fills it with unique action sequences and captures the feel of the darkness that lives and breathes in Gotham City. But it is partly this "capturing" that keeps it from being a truly great film. The overall look of the picture is dark, very dark. Not just visually (which it is greatly) but also in a negative emotional level. Very few scenes show daylight. Very few scenes show hope. And at 152 minutes... that's a lot of "darkness" for a viewer to experience. Yes, I realize that the movie is called "The Dark Knight". And that "darkness" was an important factor in "Batman Begins" to let the audience feel what it is that drives Bruce Wayne to become this hero of the night. But in this episode, it just goes a bit too far. That coupled with Batman's gravely voice (done to extreme by Christian Bale) makes the movie hard to see and hard to hear. My ears aren't that great, but even someone with perfect hearing is going to have trouble getting all this dialogue, in one viewing, as it's often mumbled. The other performances are generally up to, or above, what you would expect from such a great line-up. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, give their usual perfect performances in roles that suit them well. And Gary Olldman is at the top of his form as Commissioner Gordan. This is one of the finer portions of the film as he gets to expand his character beyond past entries. Aaron Eckhart, I'm sure, did what it was that the director likely wanted for him but his performance is hurt by a mild flaw in the story writing. He plays the new District Attorney Harvey Dent who comes into town on a white horse, ready to take on any and all bad guys at any cost. But in the latter part of the story, he suddenly becomes unable to survive the "any cost" part. His love, Rachel Dawes (played sufficiently by Maggie Gyllenhaal, but not as tenderly as Katie Holmes did) dies near the end and suddenly this White Knight can't see beyond the pain to go after the true culprit in her death. He morbidly becomes "Two Face" (arch criminal in some Batman comics?) and blames Gordon and Batman for all his woes. This was the weakest part of the story for me, and I believe that had they left out this plot-line it would have made the movie a bit shorter (which would have helped the overall picture) and it would have kept the focus on the duel between Batman and the Joker, and that's where the focus of this film should never have strayed from. Just as in "Spiderman 3", this movie is hurt by 1 too many plot-lines. But these are simply minor annoyances that, although they do detract from the film, simply keep it from being the best Superhero movie of all time. That award, I think, still belongs to "Spiderman". In conclusion, go see "The Dark Knight", you will not be disappointed. And the performance by Heath Ledger is absolutely not to be missed. He makes Jack Nicholson's attempt look amateuristic, which it truly wasn't. But this one goes so close to perfection that anything pales in comparison. My rating for the movie would have been a 7+. add in Ledger's stellar performance (a perfect 10) and we get the movie close to a 9. A half point deduction for the "Two Face" distraction and the length and darkness of it and we end up at a very solid 8 and 1/2! I know that many fans will think this a perfect 10, and I can understand their point, but they are biased. For the overall movie lover who gets as much enjoyment out of "WallE" as he does "Shawshank Redemption", this movie will fall somewhere just below those but well above many others.
10.0~A fantastic movie, truly a worthy successor to Batman Begins. Universal_Traitor Sign in Permalink I went to see this movie with fairly high hopes that it was going to be a pearler. All the trailers looked good, the press were raving about Heath's portrayal of the Joker, and most of all it was a Batman movie. A character i had grown up with watching on TV. While this movie, like the previous title Batman Begins takes a big leap away from what everyone except the Batman comic book lovers have seen. It lands solidly on a firm ground made up of fans who are going to find this movie an absolute joy. Christian Bale is back as the Batman and he works just as hard as he did in the last movie to bring that character to life. He plays Bruce Wayne down to a tea and his aggressiveness and ability to fight Shine through the big black suit. His voice, while some call it too strained and annoying as Batman I find fitted the role well. This is not the Batman we are used to seeing. But I hope to see a lot more of it. Heath's acting in this movie is unlike anything i have ever seen before. Both he and Director Christopher Nolan have done an amazing job with the character. Never has a character made me feel afraid, horrified, confused then had me laughing in hysterics all in the space of 10 seconds. At times he truly is a horrifying figure to watch, then he switches to to a lunatic you cant help but laugh at. They have managed to truly capture what the Joker really is in this movie. A dangerously insane human being. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/2 face. His performance was also excellent. You could sense the frustration within Harvey's character in his fight to clean Gotham City of the mob families and the Joker. Yet there was such a change in character once the transition from one to the other took place. And he did it superbly. I look forward to seeing this character develop. Other notable performances were Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Eric Roberts as Salvatore Maroni and a small role by William Fichtner as the bank manager (But I'm just a fan of whatever he does :) ) Overall the film is a monster coming in at a runtime of 2 hours 32 minutes. But in no way do you feel it. The movie manages to stay fresh and vibrant throughout. The action comes at you fast and intense and there is plenty of it. All in all this film will surpass any hype you have seen or heard about it. Its worthy of any awards it or its actors are nominated for.
5.0~A Dark Night At the Movies mercuryix-1 Sign in Permalink This film should almost be titled "Two-Face", because it tries to be two different movies, and fails at both; one that presents itself as grim, depressing and adult, the other one aimed at 14 year-olds. The result felt like watching "Portrait of a Serial Killer" aimed at kids. Watching this big, expensive, super-hyped movie was a strangely joyless, almost depressing experience. At the end, I was as worn out as if I had watched a documentary on spousal abuse, complete with raw footage of victims being beaten while we helplessly watch. The mob bosses are presented as idiots who can't stop one guy, and the cops, who start off being competent, become more and more incompetent throughout the movie until they start to resemble the cops from the Adam West Show. Moments of silliness do not transition well with scenes of police officers being brutally murdered by shotguns at point blank range. If you want audiences to enjoy the movie on a comicbook level, then don't show graphic scenes of people being murdered, threatened with mutilation and being pushed to their death. It's these two things together that make for an unpleasant viewing experience. The moralizing is extremely fatuous: "you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain". Really? So Superman, Spiderman, et. al are due for villain status pretty soon. Firefighers and police officers if they live long enough will become criminals. Pronouncements like this in the movie sound slick, but don't hold up on examination. "But it's only a comicbook movie". That's the film's trouble. It tries to have its cake and eat it too. The three lead characters, Bruce Wayne, the Joker, and Harvey Dent are presented as the only competent people in the movie. Even Gordon is seen as ineffectually leading the incompetent police. Batman is the only character in the movie able to throw a punch to stop an armed gang, even in scenes of rooms crowded with men. Forcing the audience to watch long, protracted moments of the Joker holding a knife to a helpless victim's face as he threatens to mutilate her, shot in loving 360 degree panoramic closeup, is like being forced to watch a snuff film shot by Martin Scorsese. Worse, it forces the audience to participate in the victimization. The makers of the film call this being "grown-up". Since when is showing graphic sadism being "grown-up"? They want it to be a "grown-up comicbook". Fine; then don't show the rest of the characters as being incompetent cartoon buffoons, and assume your audience is stupid; this constant shifting is playing fair with the audience. The Joker seemingly has an army of hundreds of highly organized commandos, but all of the unbelievable pyrotechnics are orchestrated by one person and a handful of schizophrenic patients. Even comicbooks have some kind of credible storyline and idea of what's physically possible, and this completely ignores them to the point of disregarding the audience's intelligence (and patience.) Finally, Heath Ledger's performance. Heath Ledger tries very hard in this role, and you can't blame him for lack of effort. He plays a twitchy, sadistic psychopath in clown makeup. But is it the Joker? Well, that depends on your view of the Joker. If your view is a twitchy, sadistic psychopath, then he has succeeded in presenting it. If it's someone who is fun to watch,with a deranged sense of humor that makes you laugh in spite of yourself, then it isn't. The Joker as presented here is as joyless as a serial killer who only feels when he tortures someone, and as irritating as a Bugs Bunny character that is drawn as one step of the good guys, defying physics and logic, so he can continually dangle victims out of windows and force the victims into making sadistic choices. Finally, this is the filmmakers' view of what this comicbook is. It isn't necessarily ours. To add to the irritation, there are long, long interludes where the Joker gives his personal commentary on life's meaninglessness, as he threatens and tortures his victims. These commentaries are presented as "deep" and "heavy", when they are in fact as meaningless, and without relevancy; comicbooks succeed better than this. Finally, we reach the end, which provides an irritation and insult to the audience all on its own: the movie actually makes the statement that the public can't handle the truth, that unless it is covered up, all the criminals will be freed and society as we know it will fall apart. Therefore, in order to continue and have hope, the public must continued to be deceived, and Batman must be martyred and chased by the hounds for the crimes he did not commit. Uh, what? Nice statement there: Bush's administration is correct after all (in fact, all institutions are correct), and we, the ignorant masses, can't handle the truth about one person, without losing all hope and reason. The idea that hundreds of criminals will be freed, and that crime will win, just because one district attorney became criminal, is ridiculous. The end actually sets Batman up to be a martyred Christ figure at the end. I found myself laughing at the end, much to the annoyance of my friend, at this "poignant" moment. This film took itself much too seriously, and its audience not seriously enough. At the end, the score is: Batman competent, everyone else helpless and stupid. That's the message of this film. I came to see a movie about a comicbook character, and instead was inflicted with a pompous, psychobabble morality play instead. It was not fun. And after all, isn't that what a comicbook should be?
3.0~The cinematic equivalent to a run-on sentence. captkirk_4 Sign in Permalink Spoilers: I am trying to figure out if I saw the same movie all these teenage boys are coming on here and claiming to be the best movie ever. Back in grade school when I was learning to write there was a concept called a run-on sentence. This was including too many ideas in one long un-punctuated line. This is essentially what the filmmakers gave us with Dark Knight. This film is in MAJOR need of an editor. First off all, there are way too many plots and subplots going on. Both the Joker and the Two Face story lines should have been treated as separate movies. Watching this movie I felt myself to be bored and was constantly looking at my watch. At over two and a half hours, this film was way too long. Compare this to a fast paced, entertaining well edited film like Plains, Trains, and Automobiles and you see how longer doesn't mean better. There were at least 3 incidents with the joker that I thought was the conclusion to the movie only to have it drag on for another long anti-climatic showdown. Secondly, I had never really thought of Michael Keaton as Batman, but after seeing Christian Bale's portrayal, Keaton is looking better and better every day. Unlike Keaton, or even Val Kilmer, Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is an extremely unlikeable character. A total jerk I felt little sympathy for unlike the affable Bruce Wayne Keaton gave us in the scene where Vicky Vale is looking at his collection of Samuri outfits. Batman Begins has a stupid beginning and an utterly idiotic ending, but at least the middle portion of that movie was entertaining. The Dark Knight was a complete bore. Another thing is that Ledger's Joker character came off more like the psycho loner from the original Dirty Harry film than the charismatic villain from the comics. And in this supposedly "realistic" interpretation of the Batman concept, the Jokers henchmen came across as the worst from the 60's TV show. All in all this movie was a disappointment, a real boring mess.
10.0~I'm not a Batman geek or overexcited teenager, but I still liked this movie a lot lual Sign in Permalink I really don't like to jump on a band wagon like this. Though I had been longing for this movie for over a year and though I was expecting great things from it, this nerdy and geeky talk of comic book fans ("best movie ever") really got onto my nerves. Living in Germany, I had to wait until yesterday to finally watch the movie and I could watch all the craziness going on on the net from afar. I still wanted to like the movie, but I really feared that all this hype might ruin it for me. Well, now that I have finally seen it I have to say that my fears were to a large part unnecessary. the movie is great and I think it is as good as a movie like this can be. Though I still get annoyed by teenagers who yell that this is the best movie ever, I can understand where they are coming from. Every decade or so there is one movie that becomes a real phenomenon. And if you never experienced this than you become part of the group that says "this is our movie and we won't let grumpy idiots take it away from us". When I was at that age for me it was "Jurassic Park" and later to a certain extent also "Titanic" and I bet most of the kids who hype this movie have not been consciously around then. I thought the acting was great overall. Heath Ledger definitely stands out. Christian Bale is great, too. His work as the twisted Batman/Bruce Wayne character has to be a lot more subtle in this movie and he achieves that wonderfully. Unfortunately, due to Ledger's tour de force performance, Bale's work seems to go unappreciated by many here. I could go on and on. There is not a single weak performance in this movie (although the Mayor becomes a bit distracting because of his heavy eye-liner, but that's not the actor's fault). I love the scope of this movie. The main storyline is always in focus but there still is room for subplots here and there which are all set up perfectly and fit within the overall plot. And even though you might wish to see more of some characters (like Alfred) you nevertheless don't feel that they were underused. The pacing is great as well. You keep being interested the entire time and the movie flows so naturally that you never get the feeling that this action sequence here happens because there has to be an action sequence. So, is this the best movie ever? I leave that up to everyone to decide for himself. It is not perfect but no movie, even the best, is completely flawless. There are things in this movie that I didn't like too much. I wish they had done more with Two-Face and the whole bit about the cell phones seemed a bit gimmicky for me (I also didn't like Batman's eyes in these scenes). But there is so much to like in this film. One has to applaud the filmmakers for going against conventions by for example killing of characters not just at the climax of the movie but right in the middle. I also loved it that the movie does not end with the big machine of the villain that he has to start in order to rule the world (even "Batman begins" fell into that trap). They found a perfectly neat solution to it all and though I think the ending is not perfect, I think it still is great as it is. The same thing can be said about the whole movie. I love it that the script of this movie is so smart that it even takes time to ask philosophical questions. Sure, it doesn't go too deep but it is mentioned in a way that most moviegoers will be able to think about this. I had a perfect time at the cinema and think that for what it is, this movie can indeed be called a masterpiece.
10.0~can you avenge evil and not become it? tejas_rizer Sign in Permalink First things first, Nolan had redefined "Batman" in the 2005's "Batman Begins" in such a brilliant and unexpected way.He helped Batman to retain the standards that the character was loosing. So it was very important for him to make the sequel more powerful & fully of impact to overcome the hype. Now the movie opens with unexpected and witty entry of the joker .Once in an interview it was asked to Nolan that why Ledger and he answered because he is fearless. the joker character is excellently pulled by Heath ledger,I wish he was alive to see how great work he has done with joker. The joker does not believe in following the rules he just does what he wants that makes him dangerous and fearless like Nolan said. This movie is not just about action and special effects,but has many ideologies that a person should learn from this movie. There's a line in the movie where Harvey dent played flawlessly by Aaron Eckhart ,"You either die hero,or wait your entire life and become a villain". Until the intermission or just 20 minutes before it you would think that this movie entirely belongs to the joker.But Nolan has made this movie in such a way that it can be called as Joker: Batman=4:1, that means if there are four great scenes pulled by joker then there's one scene of the batman to equalize it. Rest of the cast especially Micheal Caine and Maggie she has given the role of Rachel Dawes her own touch.It won't for me to praise this masterpiece as you know it is ruling the B-O. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>10/10<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
10.0~Best movie of all time simonparker1990 Sign in Permalink There is a reason I have waited quite a long time to finally post this review in actual fact I saw this movie (on Imax) a few weeks back, and since then I have seen it again on a regular cinema screen. You see I have been waiting three years for The Dark Knight, followed it from the very first signs of post production, and got caught up in the huge amount of hype surrounding the movie from very early on. The tragic death of Heath Ledger added tonnes more interest to the movie and has no doubt helped increase the huge box office the movie has been receiving, to date in the USA alone it has over $400 million and looks set to overtake Star Wars as the second highest grossing movie of all time. So the big question really is, does the Dark Knight live up to expectations. Good god yes! I would go as far to say now it is my favourite movie of all time. The Dark Knight is pitch perfect. Christian Bale once again is amazing as Bruce Wayne and Batman (although I still do at times question his voice for Batman), but this movie does truly belong to two actors. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, and of course Heath Ledger as the infamous Joker. This is a very smart and brave movie, while there is a lot of action it doesn't take centre stage. At the very centre of the movie there is a pivotal story revolving around three men, Bruce Wayne, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent, three men who want to do good in a very bad city. And then of course The Joker comes along to mess things up, because its just so much fun! The story is extremely grand and uses the most of its two and half hour run time, in fact any shorter and the movie might fail, it really needs its length and is involving throughout. So onto the performances. Christian Bale is not getting half as much press he deserves for this movie. Bale really is perfect as Wayne and Batman, he is the definitive Batman of our time and makes him extremely believable. I'll confess I prefer him playing Bruce Wayne to Batman, I just find the Batman voice a bit odd every time I hear it for the first five minutes. Still he does no wrong for the most part. However as I have said the movie belongs to two people. Heather Ledger and Aaran Eckhart. Ledger to be honest deserves the Oscar for next year, he really does. The Joker is completely insane, there is no other word for it. He's funny, manic, but also downright scary. The scene where he tortures a cop on video camera is downright scary because of Ledger's voice in the background, just hear him growl "Look at me" and feel the shivers go up your spine. Also he is never overused. That was always one of my biggest gripes with Nicholson's Joker in the original Batman, while he was a laugh, he was also used way too much. His best scene by far involves a brilliant pencil trick, that is truly priceless. Aaran Eckhart is the other shining light of the movie. I have never seen Eckhart in anything before, but here he is pitch perfect. For the none-Batman fans among us I will not spoil what happens to Dent, but let me say it is brilliant how it is done. His best scene has to be the speech to the public regarding "the dawn", once again chills went up my spine. The rest of the cast do equally as well. Gary Oldman once again shows his talent as Jim Gordon, his character gets a hell of a lot to do this time and it made me appreciate the character all the more. Maggie Gylenhaal does a better job than Katie Holmes as Racherl, once again will not spoil the story surrounding her, but it gives her character much better moments than she ever had in Batman Begins. Morgan Freeman does well in his all too limited screen time, and Michael Caine provides excellent comic relief once again as Alfred. Of course the key to The Dark Knight, as it was with Batman Begins, is brilliant storytelling and direction. Christopher Nolan really ups the ante with this movie, in my mind this is by far Nolan's best movie and I will be amazed if he ever tops it. The story here is extremely compelling and I love the fact The Joker is never really explained, he comes onto our screens fully formed and its a breath of fresh air. Its nice not to have his madness truly explained, he's a mad dog unleashed on the world and he's brilliant. There are several surprises to be had in the movie, not least of all a scene involving a hell of a lot of cans of gasoline, which I cannot spoil, it shocked me to the core and left me on edge for the rest of the movie. The action is mighty impressive here, the bike sequence is thrilling and by far my favourite of the action sequences, a hospital scene is brilliant but also funny as anything, and the big final fight, while not the best choreographed has a huge amount of tension surrounding it. I highly recommend people watch this on Imax if they can, it was my first Imax experience and it didn't disappoint, the opening shot especially is a stunner. So as you might have gathered I liked the movie, a lot, and I cannot wait to see it again. Really if you want the best Blockbuster in many, many years then you have to see this movie. Hell its by far the best superhero movie ever, and so much more. Dark, violent, but brilliant. The Dark Knight really is the definitive movie experience of my time.
10.0~Ledger's Last Laugh Takes Him One Final Step into Immortality! PinkPurple Sign in Permalink I liked the previous movie, but this one blew me away. It actually strives to be far more clever than you'll see coming. It must take a lot of guts and balls to push ahead for some of the things they got away with. So props to Nolan for sticking to his guns and producing a movie that feels twice as much like one of his films than the last one did. I imagine it has to do with finishing the set up stuff and being established enough to trust his own vision more freely perhaps. The result is something far more interesting and much more adult. What needs to be said about the rock solid backbone provided by the legends of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman. Freeman can do those kind of parts in his sleep and yet he still brings an added twinkle in his eye, which suggests a lot in small amount of time. I've always enjoyed Michael Caine and always adored his dynamic with Bruce and how he brings him back down to earth. Gary Oldman embodies Jim Gordon so well, finally we see his evolution to Commissioner. From being baffled by his 'death' to being touched by the contrast of gentle family man and desperate hardened last of honest cops. He has a wonderful acting three way dance with Bale and Eckhart. He knows his role and how to serve it so well. He proves again why he's the chameleon of chameleons. Maggie Gyllenhaal comes off more convincing than Katie Holmes, at the same time, the character is still the weak link. I get that shes tough but thats all I get about her character. So Alas her fate failed to get the desired emotion from me but it actually didn't seem to matter that much, as the pace didn't slow down enough for it too sink in and was too other wise exciting. Christian Bale certainly brings the special brand of intensity to the table. Bale makes him so much more human but also isn't afraid to remind us of his unlikeable qualities too. Or too allow us to see just how freakishly unstable he looks when he's pounding criminals. His shining moment is probably his being perfectly happy to cripple in lieu of killing. You do see the ghost of the wounded boy he once was in rare moments of nice subtle quite acting. However he's not without flaws either. The prime one being that darn Batman voice he puts on, it's really cheesy and hard to keep taking seriously, especially when he insists on using it privately with people in the know. The New boy Aaron Eckhart does an extremely admirable effort in a considerably layered turn as Harvey Dent. I needed to care about him and that I was able to do individually speaking. The makeup was fittingly gruesome and the transformation was careful enough. They didn't even really overdo the coin routine. I liked that he didn't compete with Joker, it was a good contrast. Two-Face is ruthless no nonsense stone cold aggression personified. It does get very intense the way he goes after Gordon's family and it's genuinely shocking how he becomes the catalyst for the ending's change of direction for the series. Yes I've saved the best for last. The now late great Heath Ledger completely washed away any doubts I had, almost from the moment we see him in full stride. As a die-hard Joker fan, I must thank him for such a parting gift for cinema goers. I honestly can't remember the last time I've been so entertained by a single performance. He was literally everything he needed to be. Loved the crowish makeup and the idea that he carved the permanent grin onto his face. I especially liked that in such a serious love to hate performance, he still never entirely lost that sense of black charisma, he is after all in addition to whatever else he is, a black hearted entertainer in his own mind. The blowing up the hospital part was a prime example of just enough underlining humour for the audience. But best of all had to be all the little touches from the comics. The nod to Alan Moore's Killing Joke, the being an compulsive lier, how he changes his story of how he got his scars for each different victim. And yet whatever did really happen, thanks to Ledger's gritty acting, you really feel he's reliving something horrible in those moments. There you see the pathetic shell of a human being behind the Greece paint, the man who loathes the rest of the world for being emotionally stronger than he is, refusing to take the easy way out or to get the joke as he sees it. The ultimate twist on the tears of a clown. It basically shows in spades how much it must have took that uniquely dedicated an actor, willing to go to such extremes to dig up such a real performance. I have to agree with those who hail it among the rare special performances that don't roll round often. It must be said that he is indeed well matched by very accommodating writing. The use of school buses and mental patients who can't know any better really visualise the depth of his evil. Finally the sweetest touch was probably the sheer lenghs they went to in order to show us his intelligence rather than giving endless lip service to it. The opening with the build up's elaborate domino effect of double crosses tells you everything before you even see his face and is perhaps one of the best openings of movies in general. A hell of a movie, it's told the rest of the summer offerings a big ol' "beat that!" So get yourselves back to those cinemas folks, you haven't a moment to loose, to your peoplemobiles away!
4.0~I am very disappointed kuponka Sign in Permalink I am very disappointed because up until now IMDb has never recommended so much a movie I consider unsatisfying. How can you put this movie as #1 ? Do you really think this is the best movie - if it is I should never watch cinema again !!!!!! Batman begins was a way better then this ! I am just coming from the local cinema where I saw the premiere - I was so thrilled all day long i was dreaming to watch such a big disappointment ! It is too long, too many people are involved in the scenes and sometimes you catch yourself trying to understand what the hell is going on ? Battle scenes and heroes like the joker are OK of course, but our number one should be much more then just effects don't you think so ?
6.0~Nothing special: don't believe the hype! FlorisV Sign in Permalink TDK was a passable film, worth a single watch, nothing more. If you'd start to ask the Nolan fanboys what they really, really liked, you get answers like: -Well, it was dark! -Heath Ledger was brilliant! -It was realistic! -It's a Christopher Nolan film! In reality, in all of these aspects, the movie is a joke. It's an OK film in plenty of aspects, but in the departments it receives it's high praise it's completely undeserved. TDK never gets truly dark. Batman never kills, he's never morally grey. Yes, The Joker is a real psycho. Woopty-doo. Heath Ledger had a nice sound effect on his voice, created in the studio, makeup did the rest. It was not THAT special. Many plot holes have already been pointed out, it's not a realistic film. But what's awful is that it pretends to be. Realism cannot be the primary goal for films about the fantastic, or it may get too boring. Nolan has made far more interesting films and while he's a fan of the Bat, he's not cut out to make superhero films at all. His Gotham City looks bland, boring and devoid of personality. He's not much of a visual story teller, his talent lies in playing around with inventive concepts and plot twists. He always casts the same people too, which is really boring and cowardly. Would be nice to see more new faces there's plenty of talent out there. Tim Burton makes the same mistake but at least he made a more colourful Gotham City.
5.0~Good action movie, overall mediocre solar-21 Sign in Permalink Just came back from seeing this movie. For an action flick it's OK I suppose. Good acting, great special effects. Story is... well as one would expect from a Batman movie. Okayish with a fair amount of cheesiness and very shallow at times. There's nothing really in the story which makes you strain the thing between your ears. Just sit back and be "wowed" by all the bright and wonderful special effects and horrible villains. That's all fine by me and pretty much what I would expect from a Batman movie. What I honestly don't understand how this movie made it to #3 in the IMDb. Seems very out of place. In my mind, it shouldn't even make the top 100.
10.0~A solid sequel BruddanChrist Sign in Permalink Nolan made a wise decision in separating The Dark Knight from Batman Begins in that he never tries to mimic it. While the dark and gritty feel of Begins is certainly prevalent in the sequel, Knight is its own film with its own story. It rarely, if ever, feels like Batman Begins 2. It goes without saying that the performances are stellar, but I can't not praise the actors. Christian Bale is as he needs to be, as is Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman. Even though Maggie Gyllenhaal was cast due to Katie Holmes's inability to return, I think she was a necessary change in order to show Rachel's growth. Aaron Eckhart is always a joy to watch, and he certainly doesn't disappoint here. Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar; I'll leave it at that. The story is fresh and full of conflict. It's almost as if Gotham is worse since Batman took on its corruption and saved it from annihilation. The absence of any threatening criminals gives the Joker room to stretch out and set the world on fire. He manages to plunge Gotham into anarchy like Ra's Al Gaul before him, but does it without a grand scheme. He is a lethal dose of impulsiveness and malevolence, a dog chasing cars with a bomb strapped to its back. The music in this movie is haunting. There's the familiar (but not the same) theme from Begins, and the rest is new and frightening. I'm very pleased that Zimmer and Howard combined their musical talents and developed a new score instead of relying on the previous one. My only complaint with The Dark Knight is that there's too much happening. Wayne's relationship with Rachel is muddied by Dent's presence, the remaining Gotham gangsters are trying to get back on top, the Joker is causing mayhem, the Joker is ousting the gangsters by their own means, Dent becomes Two-Face and goes on a murderous revenge tear... It's all done very well, which is why it pains me to complain, but it's just too damn much for one movie. It's easy to get lost. Complaint aside, The Dark Knight is everything it should be. If you're one of the 10 people who haven't seen it, see it.
8.0~New Classic bartekfm Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is unlike any superhero movie that has come before it, and that includes the stellar Batman Begins. While 2005's origin story was a breakthrough with its Gothic visuals and harsh realistic tone, director Christopher Nolan's next entry in the series shatters what we've known as the walls of the superhero genre. An ensemble political thriller as much as it is a tale of revenge and derring-do, The Dark Knight is a wondrous, terrifying epic. Heath Ledger's Joker is the embodiment of all terror and rage, an evil force as illogical as a tornado, and fearless in the way only a sociopath can be. He sets his sights on Batman only because he wants the game of crime to be more fun, and wages a war of aimless chaos against Gotham while taunting Batman to reveal his face. The Joker demands that Gotham accept a life without rules, and as Dent, Gordon and Batman become increasingly desperate to stop him, they're each forced to break the rules they've lived by. The Dark Knight is peppered with lots of talk about dark vs. light, good vs. evil, freak vs. human-- familiar comic book stuff, and familiar stuff for Christopher Nolan too, he of Memento and The Prestige. Nolan believes so much in the real-world implications of Batman's story that what seems hokey in other movies feels desperately urgent here. There are lots and lots of speeches, with deeply intoned aphorisms about morality and truth, but they fit into Nolan's larger portrait of a city just barely teetering above chaos. As the Joker says near the end of the film, "Madness is like gravityall it takes is a single push." Each of the main characters, the Joker included, are standing on a ledge. They say every era gets the kind of hero it deserves, and The Dark Knight is surely a superhero movie for our times, in which even the best of men can find themselves doing wrong. The hopeful exuberance of Spider-Man, made before 9/11, isn't bad in comparison; it just doesn't fit with where we are now. Nolan has shown a new way to tell a superhero story, and it may turn out to be the only way to tell a story about heroes in this troublingly amoral time. We may want our white knights, but it's the dark knight that we need.
1.0~This is not how Batman should be done! Adrianapolis Sign in Permalink 'The Dark Knight's box-office takings were recently overtaken by those of 'Toy Story 3'. Frankly, I'm not at all surprised. The Disney picture blows this away in terms of sheer entertainment. What Christopher Nolan does not seem to have grasped is the utter absurdity of the main character - 'Batman' is a nut who runs round Gotham City in a rubber suit solving crimes. The 1966 series/movie with Adam West and Burt Ward got him about right - it was played entirely for laughs. 'T.D.K.' takes him very seriously indeed - big mistake. Christian Bale is bland as 'Wayne/Batman', and Heath Ledger's 'Joker' cannot hold a bat-candle compared to Cesar Romero's and Jack Nicholson's earlier portrayals ( had Ledger not been foolish enough to die just before the film opened, I doubt whether anyone would have given it the time of day ). 'T.D.K.' also squanders the talents of the lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal ( brilliant in 'Secretary' ). The film as a whole is bleak, ugly and depressing - not my idea of a fun movie at all. I think I'll stick with the excellent Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher quartet of the '80's/90's. No more 'edgy' Batman pictures, okay?
7.0~The greatest movie of all time ... naaah arant-agrawal Sign in Permalink This is a solid superhero movie no doubt but the greatest movie in the history of film this ain't. I frankly for the life of me can't fathom how people are giving 9.5 *s to this movie. I found it really unrealistic in its portrayal of the main protagonists. How can the joker a psychopathic maniac get access to the millions of bucks to pull off the stunts does in this movie. This movie had so many glaring irregularities and obvious loose ends but you can forgive all that in a mindless action; not something billed as the "greatest movie of all time". Well my suggestion is to take this movie with a pinch of salt and see it for what it *is* - a superhero flick not some high brow comment on the human condition etc which every one is making it out to be.
10.0~The Best "superhero" film ever thepumpkinslayer Sign in Permalink I am a batman fan. Not a fanboy mind you, I have read the comics, seen the other films, and like batman story well enough, but unlike a few of my friends, I haven't been following the release for this movie like a bloodhound. But thanks to above mentioned friends, I have been passively looking forward to it. So we booked our tickets, got to one of the first showings in the world (I live in Australia) and got ready to see a movie that could not possibly live up to the hype that has engulfed the world. I was so wrong, so, so wrong. This film stands so far above its predecessor it is on another planet. Nolans script is, like most of his movies, a complex and involving one. Unlike his some of his other films, the acting, story, cinematography etc all belong on the same pedestal. Never before have I felt the palm sweaty excitement of a gripping film take hold of me for a complete running time (and keep in mind this is 2 and half hours). The lack of CGI is one of the films biggest assets. The action feels gritty and real, involving you more than the graphics heavy iron man or Hulk ever did. Id heard talk of Ledger being nominated for a posthumous Oscar but had thought it a silly move, why give awards to someone who cannot accept it? But his performance is mind blowing, creating one of the best villains ever to grace the screen. I don't know if an Oscar is the right way to do it, but his performance needs to be acknowledged for the masterpiece it is. Id heard a critic call this the "empire strikes back" of superhero films, and it really is the perfect comparison. This film proves that some "superhero" movies don't belong in a little niche, to be weighed against each other, not the "serious" films, but can instead be acclaimed as deep, involving and above all exciting works of film-making.
4.0~Too much Hype. The movie isn't that good triplec_chainsaw Sign in Permalink This movie is not as good as everyone says it to be, so please don't listen to the hype. Now don't get me wrong, the movie is not good but Heath Ledger is. He is the only reason that this movie is rated so high. His acting as the crazy madman that we all grew up to is the probably the only reason i stayed in the movie theater. There is no plot in this movie, and the technology they use defies logic. I believe that if Ledger didn't die that this movie would be rated much lower because 150,000,000 wouldn't have saw it to pay their last respects. I give this movie a 4 out of 10, but I give the Joker 10 out of 10 and definitely and Oscar Nomination.
8.0~I'm sorry everyone, this is no masterpiece. jfmvp Sign in Permalink ** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, it's quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits. It is a given that Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the film's opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworld's combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit. So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldn't have been. Uneven scripting there. But that's nitpicking in comparison to the film's greater faults. The ultimate reason why "The Dark Knight" falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time. OK, here is where people start saying: "But it's a movie! It doesn't have to be possible." I know, thanks. I agree, it doesn't have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as "The Dark Knight" wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they don't want this to be considered as a mere "superhero movie," or "action movie." Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me. (1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys he's finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesn't work because The Joker's plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they aren't smart enough to be effective as help. It's a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act. (2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but c'mon, he doesn't exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesn't have supernatural powers, so he shouldn't have a supernatural aura. (3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didn't notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken. I'd actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledger's performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated. Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but he's almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. He's also a little bit stiff when he's in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in "The Prestige" was more emotional, effective, and polished. Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in "Thank You For Smoking." Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but that's not saying much. I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but I'll spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such "The Dark Knight" succeeded in escaping the "superhero movie" label. But it's not a masterpiece. Plain and simply, it has too many holes.
1.0~The Dark Knight is overrated. lightstab Sign in Permalink Yes, Joker was really great, but overall this movie was a total letdown. A few totally stupid things that killed this movie for me. *Spoilers* Joker blows up a freaking HOSPITAL in BROAD freaking DAYLIGHT and makes his escape in an ultra fast SCHOOL BUS, which no cop seems able to stop, even though they've been warned that Joker will, you know, blow up a hospital. You see, this is totally believable because the cops apparently set up a perimeter two freaking miles away, just to be safe. It's not like they could have used a helicopter or something for surveillance. That would just make too much sense (sarcasm). Batman falls several stories to the ground, not once, but TWICE and gets up without so much as a broken bone, but hey, that's okay because his super duper special armor, (which is so strong that a dog can chew through it) protected him from the fall. That's totally realistic! Right? What's that you say? The metal roof of the Taxi totally cushioned his fall. Well, that's even BETTER! How wonderfully realistic. If I ever have to jump out of a burning building it's nice to know that a kevlar vest and a strategically placed car will break my fall. Police Commissioner Gordon pretends to be dead so that Joker will chase after Harvey Dent instead of his family (huh?) and Joker proceeds to kill six innocent people in the middle of downtown Chicago, uh, Gotham City, but this is okay, because by drawing the Joker out, the police are protecting the public from harm. No reason to clear the streets of pedestrians and traffic and stuff while transporting Harvey Dent as bait for a sicko maniac killer. Joker manages to keep a pencil perfectly balanced on a table while a large gangster stomps across the floor to fight him. Cool, but stupid. Joker burns a pyramid of money, because you see, money is not important to him. What's important to him is blowing and burning stuff up, which is exactly why he robs banks for a living. Makes perfect sense, no? Batman speaks with an annoying rasp which hides his Bruce Wayne voice because as everyone knows, Christopher Nolan wants this to be a REALISTIC depiction of Batman, which is why we have sonar cell phones in this movie and magic armor and explosive laced Bat Mobiles that turn into motorcycles which do gravity defying 360 turns on walls. Other complaints: There was no Wayne Manor in this film. No Bat cave. Chicago looks a bit too bright and modern to be Gotham City. Seriously, what is Gotham City without, you know, Gothic architecture? The girl playing Rachel Dawes is completely ugly, but for some reason Bruce Wayne is so obsessed with her that he decides to have sex with the whole Gotham City ballet, just so she can't go on a date with Harvey Dent. I know lots of people got drawn into the hype of seeing Heath Ledger's last great performance, but besides Joker, there is no redeeming value in this film. There's no iconic battles. No real hero to root for (seriously, you will hate Batman in this movie). Christopher Nolan gets a special mention for trying to inject at least some intelligence into a summer blockbuster, but there was just one too many stupid things to justify the price of admission. If you haven't seen this film, just wait for it on DVD.
1.0~Packaged Hipness and Faux Aggression lindamcevoysolicitors Sign in Permalink "The Dark Knight" is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I've disliked most of Christopher Nolan's prior work, but was willing to be converted, and the rave reviews psyched me up. Drained of humor (even black), plot less, structurally inept, poorly shot, one-third of the movie coming across as a Pierce Brosnan Bond movie (Bale even goes into Bond autopilot without noticing), Nolan hasn't a clue how to make pictures or what makes humans tick, and I wish the undeserved hype around him as a director ended now. Ledger is dreadful, but the poor chap's role is so wretchedly written that his character never stands a chance. Not to mention Nolan's amateurish decision to make Ledger copy Vincent Price's "Thriller" voice, undermining any authority the character is supposed to have. By attempting to ground the Batman mythology in contemporary reality, it just comes across as plain silly. Nolan makes films for technology age emotionless drudges hiding their lack of self-esteem and identity crises behind a mask of hipness and faux-aggression. By going to see "The Dark Knight", Nolan is dictating to them that they are cool and superior. That the film is a horrible, poorly made, highly manipulative piece of work, is irrelevant.
1.0~Needs to get out the top 100 films of all time!!! david_james5 Sign in Permalink All i think i need to say is this was a good film but needs to be out of the top 100 movies of all time.. ITS NOT THAT GOOD!! Its just a Batman film and thats all it will ever be, OK it may be the best batman film made but thats not hard to do was it. People need to really think before they vote and not give it ten out of ten just because the joker is now dead. i would have really given it an 7/10 but gave it a 1/10 because it needs to get out of the top 100. but all in all its worth a look. 7/10 VOTE THE FILM NOT THE ACTOR!
5.0~Note to Dark Knight staff: silentcheesedude Sign in Permalink From the desk of Warner Brothers Marketing department: Please note that the release of the new Batman movie we just completed already has plenty of fanfare behind it. Sadly, one of the actors can no longer partake in the new photo shoots and ads. Our job will be to catapult it above any other movie, and we have a plan for this, but first, let's discuss some things about the movie. I know not all of you have seen the movie in it's completion because, frankly, it's a mess. The editing department couldn't make heads or tails out of half the scenes before we had to involve the director to see what in the world was going on in his mind. So here it is in a nutshell: We all think it turned out to be an good action movie. It's story was fairly well constructed, with more going then just a simple superhero against the bad guy movie. Being better than 'Begins', you didn't have to go through the origins of Bruce Wayne, & instead focus on the meat of the story. And we like Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey. It all sounds great, but that's where the great ends. See, the movie just had to cluster another bad guy, Two-Face, into the movie an hour and 45 into it. It made for a tremendously long movie. In a movie like, say X-men, it's good to be long, since each character can share some interesting interaction for screen time. A movie like Batman should never clock more then 2 hours, yet at 152 minutes, Dark Knight over-stretches it's welcome. Scenes that just went on and on with conversations. Even during the movie, we knew editing could have been better, and some speeches between the characters were either redundant or overdone. The story even dwindles with the Joker, teasing us with past issues that could have been real but perhaps aren't. When Alfred said "some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.", he described Joker pretty well, and it was one of the best quotes in the movie. But the purpose of a good movie that has good vs. evil is that the bad guy has more depth then the good guy, in some cases, we fall in love with the bad guy and can almost seem to go along with him, if not his actions, then the ends to his means. Or perhaps the fallacies that we see in all of us, as scary as it seems to see that deep into ourselves how the 'evil' in some movies reflect that mean spirit in some of us represented with a social comment, like media or government. You can even compare a movie like V for Vendetta and you can begin to see what we mean. Batman may be the ultimate representation of a good guy with an 'attitude' that goes after criminals that seemingly have no agenda but to be out of their minds. He was grown and started as a creature during the depression, as a shining light against the evil corporations and government. We see it in the comic books. Dark Knight, however, will be a raging success, not because it makes a social commentary or deep character study, but because the general public eats up popular figures with action scenes that doesn't have to make us think, only try to fill in our desires of revenge with interesting technological gadgets. Here are some better movies: Better action: Matrix, Wanted, cheesy 80's sci fi movies, like Terminator Better story lines: Sin City, V for Vendetta, Seven Samurai Better Superheros with Attitudes: Wolverine, Hellboy, Conan, Lobo And of course, Better bad guys: Hannibal Lecter, Darth Vader, Anton Chigurh (from No Country For Old Men), hell we even like Kaiser Soze- Any of the above bad guys can have an entire book based on them. I can write a description of the Joker in one small paragraph. Another problem may be that Warner Brothers has put all their eggs into Batman, Superman notwithstanding. Marvel comics now owns the rights to superheroes on the screen, together with Iron Man, Hulk, & the upcoming Thor and Captain America. They have a vision for the big picture for the future of "The Avengers" in 2011 (?) That's a crap-load of heroes but if they play the cards easy, & it shouldn't be too hard, they will have a winning formula for future projects involving even more comic book heroes. But whereas Marvel was busy creating a production company to make business with many of the characters in the Marvel Universe, we.. well.. Anyway, what we need you all to do... every single one of you, from the cameramen to the gaffer, is to sign up on places like IMDb and other movie sites, and give Batman a 10. Write up a review that shows none of the above, make sure you plug for emotional effect with the passing of our fine fellow actor, & make it seem like he deserves an Oscar. -WBMD PS: After the write ups and ratings boosts are done, come back to the premiere party next week for biscuits and coke!
10.0~Best film of the year. Best ever?... CMOT_Dibbler Sign in Permalink I'm no major authority, but I have followed the Batman character across multiple formats (even the camp TV series as a kid). To me this is the real Batman that Kane invented. Too often Batman is shown/written/spoken about as a pure vigilante. In this film, despite all the effects etc. we see some of the intelligent driven detective, the selfless public servant (of sorts) and the dark core of his broken psyche. In Burton's original and Batman Begins I like the dark yet virtually always in control intelligent character, but in this film, for me, he really comes alive. Mainly because of the humanity of the performance. His dual persona's are highlighted by his love for Rachel in both identities, by the knowledge that as Wayne he can't beat Dent's good guy charisma and as Batman he can never be a lover to her. His choice of the good guy over the girl highlights that regardless of his personal feelings, his higher calling to fight crime (and to a lesser extent his seeing Dent as his way out of being Batman) is his overriding concern. Eckhart is probably a loser in this, in that no matter how well he plays Dent he's up against two of the best actors of their generation. You can pretty much see how his descent into madness and the Two Face persona occurs without feeling that it's contrived or underplayed. You know the Joker is already insane and Wayne/Batman is just this side of the line, but you see in Dent how a psyche can go from virtually one extreme to the other so quickly and so believably. But in the end, the Joker is the main act here. He doesn't take the whole show from Bale, because to me, many forget that Bale is in effect playing two characters (and to a lesser extent Eckhart). But because he is such a well written character and the fact that both the writers and the actor seem to clearly understand the Joker, he is the strongest single character. The key to the Joker is his lack of limits. Anyone who has read the Dark Knight Returns, or more appropriately The Killing Joke, will see a villain who has no moral compass in any way shape or form. He does what he does because he enjoys it. He has no desire for money or power, no revenge motivation, no love interest. In his sick, brutal and twisted way he is just having fun. He's the ultimate sado-masochist. I think Ledger got that the guy is insane, he is twisted and he is amoral, but most of all he gets that the guy does it purely for the enjoyment. It may not be considered by many to be the best film ever. I think it's classification as an action movie (some times I really hate the pigeon holing of movies like this) undermines it's impact as a well written, well imagined, well filmed and above all, well acted spectacle. I wonder how next one can even hope to top this?
1.0~SO Disappointed!!!! chaitov Sign in Permalink OK, I know I am not that well versed on all the action comics from which these movies are made, but this Batman was one of the worst films I have ever seen that is based on an action figure. True, the acting from some of the main characters was very good,the Joker by Heath Ledger and Batman by Christine Bale,(although his Batman voice gave me the creeps) but,having seen the movie four hours ago all I now remember is Car Chases, Explosions, A hospital Being Blown Up,(the noise was so LOUD I had to hold my ears)and such intolerable camera work that I became totally dizzy and had to look away. It took me a long time to know who was who..maybe I am slow to understand, but the plot was so incomprehensible to me jumping from scene to scene that I kept looking at my watch.Where was the real fun that I remember? Even that old Batman Series on TV in the 80's was so entertaining.. Robin,the Penguin,Catwoman..and the plot was so SIMPLE..no Digital enhancements...just good scary fun for the kids!! Remember the on-screen "BAM".."ZOOM".."KERPLUNK"..etc?? It was FUN..FUN!!for adults as well as kids. How could kids feel comfortable watching this..a gun held to the head of a little boy!..so much darkness..and things Blown Away!! How this could be rated #1 in theaters is all about HYPE..the death,sadly of Heath Ledger, who I thought was an unforgettable Joker but a little scary for kids! I kept asking my son "Who are the good guys and who are the bad ones?" It really left me empty! The script was boring..the dialogue empty and the acting predictable. I loved "The Fantastic Four","Spiderman",and "The X-Men." They had clever scripts and good character development. In "The Dark Knight" ..there was none of this! Please..to parents out there, don't WASTE your money and don't SCARE your kids...this movie is boring, loud, and an utter disappointment..I do not care how much Money it has made so far!! Wait for it on DVD or do yourself a favour and PASS on this mixed up melange of drivel!!!
6.0~Extremely Overrated and Over-hyped duane-93 Sign in Permalink I'm shocked that so many people are rating this 9 or 10 out of 10 stars. I'm amazed that so many people are calling this the best movie of 2008 and the best super hero movie of all time. This was an "OK" movie. Not a great movie, not even a great super hero movie. As far as the plot is concerned, it was mediocre, a bit scrambled, and didn't really offer anything new. And did I mention it was too long? As a rule, I love long, epic movies, but this just exhausted me. I walked out of the theater thinking it was too long. It just went on and on. And not in an adventurous way, which probably would have made me appreciate the longevity. No, it just dragged on...just when you thought they were wrapping things up, you realized that a whole other part nine was just getting starting to get greased up. If someone who loves long epic movies is sitting there thinking "oh my god, it's not over *yet*?!", there's a problem. As far as Heath the Joker is concerned: No. I mean "no", as in No, it was not a Oscar performance. Cool, yes. Different, yes. Understated in a good way, yes. But Oscar-spellbinding? No. I wouldn't even have minded seeing more of the Joker, because just like the the first Tim Burton Batman, the directors of both managed to make the main character, Batman, about as interesting as wet paper bag (sure, the actors didn't help much), so more wacky Jack Nicholson or surreal and twisted Heath Ledger would have been very welcome. Which brings me to Batman himself...I couldn't understand half of his dialogue because of this over-played bassist growl that Christian Bale emoted in all of his Batman lines. What the hell was that? Could anybody understand a word he was saying? I thought it was me, but I would turn to my girlfriend and ask "what did he say?", and she would shrug, and I noticed others doing the same. Far and away from being the best super hero on screen, light-years away from X-Men, Spiderman, and dare I say it...even the first Ang Lee Hulk, which I still think gets a bum rap. Should have been titled Batman Unmemorable (because I really can't remember much about it all or what happened.) 6 of 10.
2.0~9.0 Are You Kidding Me? cbron1921 Sign in Permalink I just watched "The Dark Knight" and I really am shocked that people who vote on this site can possibly say that this film is on the same scale as "The Godfather", better than films like "Ben- Hur", "Raging Bull", "Goodfellas" and pretty much every film made since talkies started in 1927. I mean everyone who could possibly rate this film so high has to be born after 1990. I mean I'm 38, have seen and own over six hundred films, and to me this was an overlong over-hyped film to the max. Being a video/film editor I thought the editing was appalling. The acting, well it wasn't bad I mean Heath Ledger was good in his role his acting was tremendous. His character, however has no background, all we know is that either he or his father gave him scars. Bale's Batman which was great in the first film, doesn't know whether to hang it up, be a hero, or become a hunted animal. The rest of the cast well, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman can never do wrong, but in this film they are really just used for show. Gary Oldman, one of the best actors working today who is generally a chameleon when it comes to characterization, doesn't even bother to try to cover his English accent. Eckhart's Dent was just plain annoying until he becomes Two-Face, and that's almost 2 hours into the film. I was just disappointed, the first film blew this away.
2.0~The Most Overrated Over Bloated Batman movie ever!!! bora_mustafa Sign in Permalink After the excellent Batman Begins, I expected this sequel to be so much better, instead we are left with one big mess of a movie. Don't get me wrong, all the actors do a splendid job with their roles especially Heath Ledger (RIP), however the film itself is just not very entertaining at all. In fact, this is hardly a Batman movie itself, the film focuses more on cops and corruption, which is fine so long as you remember that your supposed to be watching a comic book hero. The problem here is there is too much going on, and with little explanation, the film starts to get very confusing, as you start to wonder who is really the hero and who is the villain. Batman's Gotham City now looks more like New York City, and his Bat cave is absolutely horrendous, not to mention his irritating voice. In its defence, the actors perform well, and some of the special effects are quite good, especially the opening scene where Batman kicks butt, only trouble is, its well too brief. If your going to watch The Dark Knight in terms of action, then you will surely be disappointed as there really isn't much action at all, only about fifteen minutes at the most. If you want a proper comic book superhero movie, I recommend Iron Man (a far more entertaining movie), or even the second Hulk movie with Edward Norton. Its just a shame, that this second Batman movie was not what I expected, and after the brilliant Batman Begins, The Dark Knight is a big disappointment. Take my advice; stick to the excellent Tim Burton classics, they are far more entertaining and faithful to the comics. Or just watch Batman Begins and skip the sequels.
6.0~Self-important, over-dramatic, uninspired. The_Dead_See Sign in Permalink It's hard to say that the Dark Knight is a bad movie. After all, it's well acted, well directed, and deals with some heavyweight, complex social and ethical issues. Problem is... is that what you really wanted to see? A drama? A deadpan, straight-faced, humourless, mostly action-free drama? I like dramas... I really do. Some of my favourite movies fall under the drama umbrella - Shawshank, Shine, Goodwill Hunting, Once were warriors, American History X, The Assassination of Jesse James, Ondskan... But lets be honest with ourselves shall we? We're sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a green-haired clown. How much drama/realism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment? Sadly, not this much. And I'm at a complete loss as to how this movie got such a high IMDb rating (9.4 at the time of writing). The only thing I can speculate is that an entire new generation of over-enthusiastic, and apparently very easily-pleased, youngsters just reached movie-going age and skewed the results. Go figure.
10.0~Phenomenal shashthezarch Sign in Permalink Its a masterpiece. I dont even have to say anything for this memorable and epic movie
9.0~He is not a Hero!!!! hpagan14 Sign in Permalink First of all we need to know that Mr. Nolan is not playing around to see what comes out, every time he decide to make a movie he has a clear mind in all the things he wants to deliver to the audience and this time is not the exception. This is a solid movie with a solid script and over the top performances by all the cast members. Dark Knight is not just another superhero movie it is way beyond that I'm sure it is not a superhero movie at all; this is a perfect example of a hard critic to today's society within all the explosion martial arts fights, blowing buildings, there is something more than just fireworks flying around. There is a message that we all need to hear. Mr. Ledger on his hand with his fantastic incarnation of the JOKER is the vehicle that director Nolan uses to deliver us a warning message and he does it in a way the will put you nerve to the test, hi is no doubt about it the best JOKER EVER!!! and this is the role of his life (surpasing his role in of Enis del Mar in BBM).This JOKER is fearless,sarcastic,sadistic,maniac,and much more my God he is perfect. Bale in the other hand is in one word THE BATMAN he is up to the test he maintains the mystery of the crusader and takes him to a place that any superhero is familiar with he will make things to show you he is not an ordinary superhero that will save the day and make everybody happy ohhh no he is far from that. We can not call him hero his is just THE DARK KNIGHT.
10.0~I'm going to make this pencil disappear... super-cow Sign in Permalink The opening sequence (which most people have seen online due to the footage being shown on some trailer reels) sets the stage for the entire film. An eerie score, brilliant directing, and spot on acting. There isn't too much that I feel comfortable saying about this film that hasn't already been said a thousand times, and wouldn't give anything away. I will tell you that The Joker is incredible. The trailers (thankfully) don't really give away too much of Heath Ledger's incredible acting, so I recommend seeing it for yourself. A lot of people are complaining about the length of the film, but the film covers a lot of ground and shortening it would be murder. Go see this while you can, it's a classic and raises the bar for all super hero films.
1.0~Overrated to to max freddoeriksson Sign in Permalink This movie was OK, but it wasn't anywhere near as good as people claimed. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was great, but his dialog, for the most part, was not all that interesting. I was having fun with him at first, especially when he told the story about how he got his scars (the first time anyway) But when he told that story the second time, I was not impressed. Once was more then enough. When it all comes down to it, this movie was simply OK, but because the death of Heath Ledger was such a shocker to the Hollywood community, this film got way more credit than it deserved, and that's all there is too it.
10.0~The Highest Peak. lagriff05 Sign in Permalink Well, it's here, the movie of the summer and likely the movie of the year, too. Everyone had high hopes for The Dark Knight, and they were raised as new trailers were released and even moreso after Heath Ledger, our new Clown Prince of Crime, died, and the movie itself surpassed all of them. For one, let's talk about the movie as a whole. It's clear that Nolan and the main actors have all read their comics - Ledger apparently loves The Killing Joke - and done their homework, as on the prequel to this one, Batman Begins. What I love most about this is that it doesn't stray from the comics just to make the movie more watchable on screen, but rather to make the series fresh and innovative. Nolan takes the fabric of the Batman story and contorts it into something that it very well could have been if started in 2008 instead of 1940. Never does it feel forced or cheap, just...an alternative. A well made alternative at that. This is definitely a success as a comic book movie, but we also have an added dose of hyperactive, metal-spiked flaming tank ownage via Die Hard 3, vamping the levels of ass-kicking up about ten notches. Seriously, this just rules all the way through, with a polished sheen and a ton of edgy, super-memorable scenes that will keep you coming back again and again. There's a lot going on here, about three different subplots, and I definitely didn't catch everything on one viewing. But the speed is just another reason this is good, rather than a detractor, as in the first film. Everything is done a step up better than on the film's prequel, and that is how any sequel should be, but usually isn't. The acting is the other high point. I felt that the acting in Batman Begins was sometimes inadequate, but that has been fixed here. This is more relaxed, calculated and well performed, with sterling performances by Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart (honorable mentions for his excellent Two Face, nobody could have done it better!) and especially Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is indeed of the Killing Joke school, except he's even more dark and devious than he was in that novel. Every moment he's on screen he captivates, being the perfect counterbalance to Batman's rigid, often frightening justice stance. The "disappearing pencil" trick, the "Why so serious?" scene, and his final moments, laughing in the wind of the night...all masterful, completely superlative. Every inch of the praise upon him is worthy. Believe it. So basically this rules, see it instead of whatever other movie you were planning on seeing in 2008. The bar has been set high for a third installment to this series, and even if there isn't one, well, it's always better to go out on a high note. And that's what The Dark Knight is; a high note. My highest recommendation.
10.0~The movie that dethroned THE GODFATHER. daredevilstrider Sign in Permalink -----spoiler within------ I don't know if you will like this review but I tried my best to deliver what I want to say (Actually it's just some words) about movie and what is the movie???? "THE DARK KNIGHT" (after I saw itit's my best movie of all time) some of you may say; what the hell you are talking about ,,where is the 'THE GODFATHER" , well THE GODFATHER was my best movie of all time and I thought it will never change but what happened is a miracle. Batman Begins was the best comic-book film ever and it was one of the best C.Nolan's films (actuallyexception of his debut film, Following¸ the man has never made a movie that didn't end up on IMDb top movies list, and my top ten list) , and comparing BB to TDK , BB look like an opening scene for TDK, it's really that's epic. TDK is epic, dark, emotional, that you don't want this movie end, you feel the chill from the beginning to the end, every scene is a gem to surround the crown (the film) , thanks from all my heart and the people who waited this movie and got what exceeded the world's imagination, thanks to whole crew from the director to the last person in this franchise . All the actors did memorable acting and I salute them for that," Bale"(my favorite actor because his capability mentally and physically) the only actor who justify Bruce Wayne Batman, "Oldman" makes you believe that they clowned Gordon from the comic, perfect, "Caine" the father Bruce didn't have and the adviser for him , "Eckhart" the white knight, the real Two-face, better than Tommy lee  hell yes,100000000000 times, the new face Maggie Gyllenhall who beautifully portrayed the love of Dent and Bruce ,she brought more softness than Kate," Freeman" the thinking man for Wayne's company and Batman's supplier for gears and gadgets. And Of course the Oscar-worthy actor the late "Heath Ledger "who didn't just portrayed The Joker, he portrayed pure evil, chaotic , psychopath, Mass murderer and the bad ass villain of all time, the whole film I tried to find one proof that this guy wearing Joker make up is Heath but I couldn't ( you can't of course, Heath didn't locked up on himself month for nothing ) he bounded with the character like magnet, every scene he stole the show and every scene is a star on this movie ( my favorite scene is the pencil trick ) can he win an Oscar ???? Not just the Oscar, he must win every award known to human, he devoted himself to this role like he knew that he is going to die. (After Heath's performance as The Joker I am sure that any body will take his role will be in his shadow and will never top him, only if GOD will) Is it better than THE GODFATHER??? For me yes...But why??? THE GODFATHER is classic, original; you don't feel that you see a movie you feel this is a true story and you fell what the feel and the actors were the best of the best of their time Now let's try that with TDK ,it's not classic but it well be with time ,original ,story that make you think Batman is on earth and living with us ,the atmosphere of the movie the screen writing the unbelievable acting, the phenomenal job Director , the great composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard how brought the real theme and the hunting music to this movie and make it epic and dark ,they really knew how to deliver a score about evil, chaos ,distraction ,hope ,courage, love, Hero, sacrifice and reality. When you see TDK you don't see the comic superhero colorful and no-body-die thing, no here you see the real world of crime ,blood ,bombs ,the world is burning here, there is scene where Bruce telling Alfred : ( there is people dying Alfred what you want me to do ) or something like that , I mean this is not for kids, it's for adult , the plot will not be easy for the kids under 16 or even 18 to understand ????? I don't know what to say but this is will be on top of the movies for a long time, I hope, maybe till Nolan tell us that he will complete the trilogy and that will be such a risky move by him because I don't know how can he tops this movie but I hope he do and break the dreaded comic-book film trilogy curse. About the rating of "IMDb's" 250 film of all-time, as someone wrote: TDK will most definitely slide down the list. Why??? Because the jealous fans of movies that are in the top 10-20 will not like that TDK has bested their favorite movies, and these losers will spend the next weeks making multiple accounts and constantly voting the movie 1/10, this people will make it their life's job to find anyway possible to lower TDK's raring and bring it down. And I say to them what ever you do or what you going to do THE DARK KNIGHT HAS WON ,and it has dethroned THE GODFATHER as the #1 IMDb movie of all time , if only for a couple of days . There is NO OTHER movie done that, and it's the first movie of all time to cross more than $300 million in less than two weeks, and after TDK done his mission, KNOW WE (THE FANS) MUST CONTUNIE OUR MISSION BY SUPPORT THIS MOVIE AND SAVE IT FROM THE LOSERS WHO WANT TO BRING THIS MOVIE DOWN. Thanks and excuse my English.
6.0~Thinks too Highly of itself NobleIndianChief Sign in Permalink After the success of Batman Begins, this was perhaps the most anticipated movie in recent years. frankly, this movie was way over-hyped and there's no way this can better than Forrest Gump, Godfather, Shawshank redemption, etc and etc.Superhero Movies are made to entertain and this is what recent superhero movies like Iron Man and Hulk accomplished. even the infamous Fantastic 4, the first one that is, managed to do this, while TDK simply didn't do it for me. Sorry. Was it because it was over-hyped ? perhaps. Was it because it's three hours long and too deep ? Probably. A combination of both factors ? definitely, This movie gets a 6 because of Heath Ledger and Maggie tough
10.0~It's going to be a long dark night MacAindrais Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight (2008) **** Why so serious, Batman? Well, because it's the way you were meant to be. The Dark Knight is just as its title would suggest - this is a dark, brooding, and maddening film. Lead by an array of characters, Christopher Nolan's new installment weaves, dances, and smashes its way through its story. This time out, Batman of course does battle with the Joker. This is not your Jack Nicholson Joker, nor your campy 60s Joker. Heath Ledger takes the legendary character and turns him into what he was meant to be - a maniacal, socio-psychopathic agent of chaos. He adds moments of humor, indeed, but in the darkest and often most disturbing of manners. Given how many people want to see this, I will waste little time in divulging plot details. Suffice to say that the story by the Nolan brothers and Goyer twists and turns its way through a continuous maze of carnage and chaos, full of surprises and intelligence. This is a long one, clocking in at 2 1/2 hours, but it moves with break neck pace while maintaining nail biting patience. Nolan makes use of tense build-ups, and some chillingly effective moments in the score. The camera work is fantastic, with the camera often weaving and spinning its way through scenes, creating an almost unconscious sense of bewilderment and dizziness. To call The Dark Knight a comic book film is entirely inaccurate. It has more to do with a standard crime thriller (or even a horror film) than standard comic book fare. Which is in no way meant as an insult to comic book films (or comic books). This is simply an observation. Nolan has taken Batman and made him real. Chicago is again used as Gotham, and this time gets even more into the city streets. Action is flanked by towering buildings along narrow city streets, creating a sense of the real down and dirty violence that simply is not afforded by other CGI fantasy cities. Even Batman Begins is nowhere near the level of realism presented by Gotham here. The entire film is shot with the hand and eye not just of a true filmmaker, but a great one. Christopher Nolan has breathed entirely new life into the Batman legacy, which was once almost doomed to camp and cornball antics in the 90s. This is such a dark, gritty, and mesmerizing experience, one that transcends the boundaries of standard filmgoing experiences, and literally makes you feel like you are there. Nolan deserves all the praise in the world for taking on a pop culture project and turning it into an intelligent, thoughtful, and darkly artistic portrait of madness. Much praise must also go to the actors. To begin, Heather Ledger, who steals every scene he is in. His performance is a work of mad genius, that likely will garner him at least an Oscar nod. Of course Christian Bale also continues to show why he is the best Batman ever. Aaron Eckhart also gives a very strong performance as Harvey Dent. They all play second fiddle to Ledger though, and all seem very happy to have done so. Now like any self respecting cinephile, it's often difficult to praise the genius of a film the likes of Batman. It's pop culture mainstream fair. You can see that in the reviews of lots of critics. But it simply would be unfair to deny the greatness of The Dark Knight. There are only a few minor problems with the picture, none significant. Its everything it needed to be. And while I may not be able to say if this is the best fest film I've seen this year, it's certainly the one I can't wait to see again most.
9.0~Sometimes the Truth is not Good Enough claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City. "The Dark Knight" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from "Prison Break", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, "The Dark Knight" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but "sometimes the truth is not good enough". My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "O Cavaleiro das Trevas" ("The Dark Knight")
10.0~To call it a must see movie is a definite understatement. wontusethis1 Sign in Permalink The Hero we wanted, the Hero we expected ,no Super Powers, no Super Villains , just two master minds ,one destroying the city and the other trying to save it, what makes The Dark Knight so different is not only its script or actors but the unique adaption of what a hero really is, this is no ordinary movie, every single cast member plays a role here, and for a minute there I thought the whole thing was real, but at the end of the movie I think we all realize that the man who stole the show is simply The Joker, I just can't believe how perfect that role was, I just can't ,if Heath Ledger doesn't get an Oscar then I don't know who will, a man who lived alone in a hotel room for a month, adapting all the characteristics of Joker, he even wanted Christian Bale to beat him as hard as he could to get the feeling of what was required from one of the scenes. The Dark Knight is a movie beyond expectations, if you haven't seen the movie already then stop reading this and go watch it now; this was an experience that I will never forget, a true Masterpiece. "Let's Put a Smile on that Face"
7.0~Do NOT believe the Hype nicaqua Sign in Permalink To be honest I went to the cinema with great expectations since the movie scores so high. I felt like I wasn't informed correctly by IMDb. Especially some of the voters. Yes, the joker is portrayed nicely by Heath Ledger. Much darker and menacing than Jack. And yes, this movie is very close to the comicbook - real life conversion. Yet, during the movie I felt no oh or ah's in my soul. Nothing new that hasn't been seen before. The highlight of this movie is truly the interplay between Batman and the Joker. The rest was OK at best but unimaginative. (Did no one see the old trick of: "Give it a quick sound and people might not notice that batmans bike doesn't move quick at all on screen."??? Like in all the other movies and series?) This movie does not deserve a 9 nor a 10. It certainly isn't worth more than classics like the godfather. To be frank, I enjoyed batman begins more! That was a solid 8. Since you cant give 7,5 in IMDb I gave it a 7. At the end 1 person started clapping no one followed, in the jam packed cinema. The clapping died after 5 seconds. An honest opinion by a disappointing IMDb users.
1.0~Nothing special to remember about this film. kolokithokeftedakia Sign in Permalink I was expecting much more from this film with a IMDb-rating of 9.1 (silly me) and I was disappointed. It left me untouched and uninspired 99 % of the time. I found the dialogues and the script most of the time boring. There is a psychopathic hyper- criminal with mass destruction capabilities (BTW, he would have to hire a whole army of commandos just to place and wire all that TNT, gasoline barrels etc without anyone notice!) and the police and the Batman are trying to arrest him or save his victims, while we, the viewers, are watching their efforts for 2 and a half hours! Now, what is the point? To have fun? Sorry, it wasn't much fun. Some SFX was good and that's all. Some other wasn't convincing at all! There wasn't anything special to remember about this film. Nothing special in script, in acting, in action, in SFX and most of all, nothing inspiring and diachronic. We should demand more quality from the movies, not just explosions and killings with impossible enemies. The money we spend and especially the time we spend to watch it, should worth it! We should exit the theaters with a feeling that we have gained something special, not the opposite! EDIT: On a second thought, 3 stars (which I gave it initially) might give the wrong impression, so there you are: 1 star for your lousy film! Try harder next time!
5.0~Not such o good movie. abbie1404 Sign in Permalink Sorry but this movie just doesn't do it! For me, the best Batman movie is in fact the first one with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson! But thanks to Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, I stayed 'til the end of the movie. The other actors including Bale were very below average. I saw all superheroes movies, but the worst one is this one. At the top of my list is Spider-Man : it just got better and better since the first movie. Batman does not deserve to beat all those records at the box office. What a pity ! Iron Man was good, very good. The Incredible HULK was OK, but I prefer the first HULK (with Bana). I do not know, but for me, to be entertaining a movie needs to have a soul, which is not the case for Tha Dark Knight. Désolé, it's a bad movie. That is all I have to say.
10.0~The Dark Knight Pauly_Tozer Sign in Permalink Batman Begins was an excellent film nothing to special, but a beginning none the less for Batman. Now with the same cast and crew excluding Katie Holmes and adding Maggie Gylenhall the film "THE DARK KNIGHT" is in a league of its own. I can only remember once ever walking out of a film just feeling blown away and that was to the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy. I came out of the Dark Knight in awe of what they have created from the directing to the acting to the musical score to the cinematography and so on and so forth. The story is so relevant to today's age and there are so many references to what the world is becoming. Its all in the script listen carefully. Christian Bale is wonderful as the hard headed hero, Maggie Gylenhall does a great job as Rachael Dawes as I believe Katie Holmes did as well, they both brought something special to that character. Micheal Caine Is wonderful as Alfred Pennyworth always thats all I have to say about him. Aron Eckhart Is fantastic as Harvey Dent/Two face a very powerful performance. But of course the real star of the show is none other than Heath Ledger as the Joker. I will be honest with you I've never seen a performance as amazing as this. He was so terrifyingly shy in real life and to have created a character so intense and horrific, is beyond me. The joker is psychotic, fearless and merciless and what late Mr Ledger did was create history and reach insanity for this part. I believe he dug to deep into the joker and lost his sense of reality which eventually killed him. He will certainly be remembered for his excellence and commitment to acting, a legend in my eyes. If you haven't seen THE DARK KNIGHT, I would advise you to attend, its simply superb.............Paul
6.0~The Grand Guignol of comic book films merrywood Sign in Permalink Amidst the clamor there might always be a dissenting voice with a different perspective and one who climbed up to the top of the high risers to view this production perhaps a few dozen yards above the gargoyle-like, statuesque Caped Crusader. Here, banter about the nature of a criminal mind and sweeping sky flights and explosions replace story values and depth. Continuity is sacrificed for action. An over the top performance wild enough to be suspected for dope fueling by a now beloved, dead actor keynotes the scenario and etches deep into the psyche deep enough to be indelible and appears to bring glory to what is really an overblown, contrived production. Extreme cruelty and sadistic enterprise replace plot and hammer away the chain of promises of the story. Where in Batman Begins we had a fascinating account and worthy characterizations we now have unsupported, unfounded surprises with gaps in character development. The personality dysfunction is so extreme as to press painfully against the science of psychology and the logic of common sense. What is it that drives the audiences and critics so wild about this production where the budget soared to almost $200 million? In the annals of film history we were uplifted by life affirming values, the motives of true heroes and were rewarded by story somehow easing a small aspect of our tedious, sometimes painful, boring lives. Instead we now are treated to the Circus Maximus, the Flavian Amphitheater, blood, gore, and easy, cheap death. The film theater critics rave and drool. Bob Kane simply turns, uncomfortably in his grave.
9.0~an Awesome movie, but a few complaints JoeB131 Sign in Permalink This movie totally had me until the last ten minutes... where I think they blew it. Let's start with what I liked. The characterizations. First, you have Heath Ledger as the Joker. Very in line with the best of the Batman comics, such as Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight" and "The Killing Joke". He brings a manic energy to the character, as someone who could kill someone with the casualness of swatting a fly. He is a force of pure chaos, as devious as Jigsaw in the Saw movies. The traps he sets up for Batman are brilliant, a truly worthy opponent. Michael Caine is awesome as Alfred. Alfred is Batman's conscience, what keeps him from going over to the dark side his adversaries inhabit. Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. They got it right. The Burton/Schumacher Batman movies never understood the importance of the character, but BB and TDK understand him perfectly. Morgan Freeman also did an awesome job as Lucius Fox. Now we move on to where I don't have the warm fuzzies. Maggie Glyenhall- Not as pretty as Katie Holmes, I really didn't connect with her character, and her demise didn't have the emotional impact it should have had because of it. Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman- Not as strong as he was in the first movie, probably because he got overshadowed by all these other characters. Also, his vocal changes between Batman and Bruce Wayne, his Batman voice comes off as raspy. (In the animated series, Kevin Conroy had two completely different vocalizations for Wayne and Batman, and they worked.) Aaron Eckhardt as Harvy Dent/Two-Face. His performance as Dent is brilliant. When he transforms into Two-Face, it's less convincing. Also, the CGI they used strained credulity. He looked more like a decomposing zombie than a scarred supervillian. Which brings me to the ending. I think everything was fine up until the point where Two-Face was holding Gordon's family hostage. Batman pushes Dent off the structure, and they both fall. Batman survives the fall but Two-Face dies? (Apparently?) So Gordon and Batman agree that Batman will get the blame for Two-Face's murders, so the memory of Harvey Dent will be kept alive. Two-Face is probably Batman's second best villain (after the Joker). If anything, he deserved his own movie as the chief antagonist, instead of just being killed as an afterthought. Overall, I think this movie had too much stuff going on in it. It would take one or two viewings to take it all in. Still, I recommend the movie.
1.0~Are You Kidding Me? gpatton858-1 Sign in Permalink OK look...this movie doesn't deserve one star. But it definitely doesn't deserve 10 (or even 9 or 8). The only reason I gave this a one star is to even out for all the lemmings that gave it 10. In my humble opinion this movie could fall in the 7-8 range and I would tend to say, "OK that sounds about right." At what point is this movie the masterpiece that deserves 10 stars? What makes this movie so innovative and groundbreaking that someone could give it a perfect score? Just because someone leaves a theater saying, "Wow, that movie kicked ass!" it doesn't mean that it is in the same category with movies like "The Godfather", "Star Wars", "Casablanca" and other movies that rewrite the beliefs of what great movies are. I wouldn't even say that "The Dark Knight" is the best movie in the Batman franchise, much less one of the greatest movies of all time. It's not even the best Batman with the same characters. Go back and watch "Batman" with Michael Keaton and Jack Nickelson and tell me with a straight face that "The Dark Knight" is better film and I will be content to know that the world is doomed. Having said all this, "The Dark Knight" was watchable and I did enjoy Heath Ledger's (RIP) role as the Joker. It is a shame Christian Bale's poor Batman character had to spoil it.
10.0~The best Batman film yet. leanes-1 Sign in Permalink One couldn't help be sceptical of the hype surrounding The Dark Knight before having seen it, scepticism was certainly weighing on my mind as i walked into the cinema. I couldn't help thinking 'is this going to be as amazing as expected, or is the hype just an inevitable reaction to the death of Heath Ledger?' I can safely say to anyone still having not seen The Dark Knight; the hype would've been just as massive even if Ledger hadn't tragically overdosed during filming, The film is mind-blowingly amazing! The action sequences, The dialogue, the editing, the lighting, the costume, the score, the cinematography, The Ledger, The Bale, The Eckhart, The Freeman, The every-single-tiny-bit of cinema... is brilliant. There's not the slightest whiff of the child-friendly-cinema that tore Tim Burton's vision apart all those (not many) years ago. Eckhart's Dent/Two-Face, blows Tommy Lee Jones out of the metaphorical water, the only shame is that his performance will be overshadowed by Ledger's even better one, and indeed his tragic demise. Every insane laugh from Ledger's lips echoes with excellence, Jack Nicholson should be very very very proud. However, Ledger's delivery, commitment, presence and dress-wearing-ability far surpass the realms of merely paying homage to Nicholson's Joker. Nolan and Ledger really show Burton and Nicholson just how darkly immense the joker can be. Not to forget Bale, who brings his portrayal of Batman (and the barking voice it brings) to the next level, the depth and inner conflict create an excellent empathy effect on the audience and also create ridiculously good viewing. I could go on all day, going into every actors success, about how immense The Dark Knight is... but i think you probably get the message by now. As undoubtedly one of the most difficult films to bring to the public, a film so swamped with hype, tragedy, death and scandal; The Dark Knight could easily have been written off with the tragic death of Heath Ledger, we should thank God that it wasn't.
5.0~Badman st-shot Sign in Permalink One has to sit through a lot of idiocy in this sado masochistic wet dream in order to glean some exciting moments as this loud bombastic endless piece of highly polished garbage bashes it's way to a sequel. Given the running time there are plenty of thrills and chills that more or less simply repeat themselves for the last hour by which time it becomes a race between losing interest or your hearing. Gotham City is in danger of being picked clean by the mob. Only crusading DA Harvey Dent and Inspector Gordon stand between them. Enter the Joker, a sadistic yukster who can't get or deliver enough mayhem to all concerned. Even Batman has his hands full with the cruel overly optimistic and principled (it ain't about the money) bad Bozo. Now the stage is set to destruct much of the city, kill and injure much of the populace and give the Joker every opportunity to escape. Batman has always walked a fine line between fantasy and gritty realism (sci fi meets noir) that I felt succeeded when the tone was light. But this follow-up to Batman Begins allows even more darkness to seep in. The caped crusader is even more conflicted this time around since he's still sweet on his ex, now the DA's girlfriend. Then there is the impervious Joker. Still the energizer bunny to punishment he bounces back like a Joe Palooka doll no matter how bad the beating. After all if you kill him, you maim the sequel. The mirthful maniac, so crucial to keeping the train running is simply replaced by another less resilient villain. As Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale displays an ambiguous menace. As Batman he exchanges boiler plate philosophies (sprinkled with Bush administration policy) with cops and crooks sounding as if he has severe emphysema. It's hard to say if it's Heath Ledger or the make-up that makes him so ominous. Certainly the most sadistic Joker to date he lack's Nicholson's breezy take and better cosmetics as well as TV Joker Caesar Romero's boundless comic energy. But even with an Uncle Fester intonation he is a disturbing and convincing example of the fearless nihilist. Director Chris Nolan pours the chaos and carnage on like syrup with sensorial disregard. There's a well edited bank heist at the beginning of the film and Batman gets to tool around Gotham in a really cool motorcycle (Bat cycle?) but the biggest budget on earth (this may well have been) cannot disguise the fact it it is an inferior work to his gripping and imaginative Memento. Like another Indy phenom Steven Soderbergh he has chosen to sell out (Who can blame him, who wouldn't want a piece of the film gross?) to make bloated shiny movies that make a lot of noise and cash. The Hollywood moguls gain is the art house loss with this one time original filmmaker. The evolvement of Batman from the unique comic book crime fighter to the satirically brilliant TV show to the mega monster super film franchise has gone through many transformations to date. From the record breaking box office returns most would agree that it's for the better. Call me sentimental but it will never improve over the comic I would read twice while sitting under the maple tree in my yard and then trade even up with my friends for a Flash or a Green Lantern. Loud as this slick and crass masterpiece of marketing is it will never deliver the bang for the buck that the pages of the comic fed my imagination without all the noise.
6.0~Everyone thinks this movie is such a masterpiece.... except me malikroberts16 Sign in Permalink There's one thing about "The Dark Knight" that I just don't get... why? Why do so much people make it out to be something that it's not? I don't call it a masterpiece for enough reasons. 1) I didn't find it gripping, and I thought it was schmaltzy as hell, just like all the movies I see these days 2) Sure, it was good, but it's not a masterpiece because I don't call it groundbreaking, despite the fact that it made a helluva lot of money and was the biggest-grossing movie of 2008. Honestly, even I've seen better and I'm almost 17! I don't think it's the kind of movie that leaves a mark on the worldwide consciousness and it doesn't mean much to me personally 3) It was WAY, WAY, over-anticipated. I honestly don't know if there's any ground left to break, but sure, we can still show audiences that artistry and business shouldn't be two different things. I'd really like to see Hollywood do more stuff like that. Bottom line, what was good back in the Golden Age is still good now. I think both the American people and people all over the world can still handle craftsmanship. I gave the movie 6 stars out of 10 just to be generous. I'd love to see someone pull it off but I don't know if they'd have the guts. To call "The Dark Knight" a masterpiece is to say that the viewer clearly has not seen a wide range of films. You wanna know what a real masterpiece is? Give "2001: A Space Odyssey", the first two "Star Wars" films, "Casablanca", "The Wizard of Oz", or the first two Indiana Jones films a try and think about it.
1.0~Are You People Kidding Me? ganrush2 Sign in Permalink The only list this movie should be at the top of is "Most Overrated". When I wasn't dozing off, I was hoping a fire alarm would evacuate the theater. I won't jump on the Heath bandwagon because he's six feet under. He was AVERAGE. To quote another review, if Heath gets nominated for an Oscar, I will never watch another Hollywood movie again. Plot holes the size of the grand canyon, overall terrible acting, and about 45 minutes of useless fluff at the end. Had this been the real world, The Joker would have been caught about 15 minutes into the movie and the credits would have rolled. Too bad that didn't happen. I will not be seeing the next Batman in the theater. That I can guarantee.
9.0~Definitely worthwhile amalank Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight has been the most eagerly awaited summer blockbuster of 2008. After the phenomenal success of Batman Begins, the announcement of a sequel has had Batman fans on the grip. Then the hype exponentially increased after Heath Ledger's untimely passing back in January. Now with the movie finally released it seems to have lived to the hype with all the great reviews and all the box office records being broken. I was rather astonished when the Dark Knight reached number 1 on the IMDb Top 250 list. To be honest this is not one of the best movies I have seen. Nevertheless it is still a great movie. There is a good storyline. There are some intense moments. Of course credit has to go to the late Heath Ledger for his role as the Joker. The ending also allowed way for a third movie to be made. I was however not that impressed with the action in the movie. It seems that The Dark Knight has done the job it has been expected to do and has created a landmark in movie history together with The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption and other classic movies.
4.0~Why is everyone in love with this movie? SiskelPEbert Sign in Permalink First things first: there is no expression, "close to the CHEST". The accepted expression is "close to the VEST". Getting this wrong is small, perhaps, but making up your own expression is just stupid. Nowadays, the difference between getting something right and getting it wrong is "whatever" but this is remarkable to me that they simply got it wrong or made up their own expression. Oh, I'm sorry: you can't just make up your own expression. The movie is waaaaaaaaay too long. We hear the same speech like 9 times. And not just one "same speech", a same speech from Bruce Wayne, and from Batman, and from Rachel and CERTAINLY from The Joker. And the last 25 minutes is a story-within-the-movie that doesn't need to be there. I couldn't tell what little threads were important and which one's were not. That's a good thing in some movies but not here. After Gordon is dead/not dead, I kept waiting the Rachel Dawes to reappear. Was she really killed or fake killed? OK, again, maybe that's me, but it was a distraction. So is the presence of Anthony Michael Hall; why is he here? He's too familiar, typecast to be in the movie. Again, a distraction. "Oscar buzz for Heath Ledger?" Are you kidding me? Makeup I did not like, a nervous pulse in his voice (but just for the first half of the movie. In jail, he doesn't have the consistency of that nervousness.) But an Academy Award? For what? HIs death, that's what. This was an interesting performance but that's all. Just interesting. I'm just being critical of an actor whose performance is being overrated. Further, you just know that when Heath died, these guys put in every single scene he filmed. Like pigging out at the buffet, you have to show some control. They did not. The movie is EASILY 25-40 minutes too long. And frankly, the whole "savior vs. vigilante" line that the whole movie hinges on is really pretty abstract. Gotham is being destroyed by crime, why split hairs? Batman Begins was clearly, more sharply focused, crisp. This is fat, overwrought, overweight and a waste of a really good cast. Maggie G. is perfectly fine but in her media interviews, she's beginning to take herself a little seriously. Hey! Maggie! You're no Olivier, baby. "Batman Begins" used violence as a metaphor; this movie is really just about the violence. Which, I guess, is why everyone likes it so much. This is a mediocre movie, tops. But since I loved Batman Begins, I'll just watch that again.
10.0~Sometimes people need to criticize... brujahonly Sign in Permalink Let me make this quick: What exactly do people expect from a comic-to-movie conversion, is unknown to me. Still, please don't babble about the crying children in the theater or latex fetish or anti-gay fascist crap. It is just disrespectful to the deceased. Do you buy a product without knowing the content or ingredients? The person who takes his child to this movie, which is described almost everywhere I've seen as "violent, dark and disturbing", is rather a foolish one. It is obvious that a kid might be effected negatively. Never seen better "crazy acting". I think Ledger rules and will rule this domain for a long long time. As for Bale, he does the best he can, but there is a limit where you can't reveal your face. One can stare at the villain so much and as Bale's voice is digitally altered when he is in his costume, you can appreciate that he made the best out of his scenes. Action was good and much more fluent than the prequel, shorter and more exhilarating car scene and all. That's it. This is all I can say without giving out spoilers. -Mehmet
1.0~A waste of 45 minutes of my life susan_k_tam Sign in Permalink My husband and I waited hours to see this movie (my stepson loves all the old Batman series and we do, too!) to finally find a few seats in the third row. What a disappointment! For 45 minutes, we endured bad action scenes with no apparent plot. The Joker's makeup was cool, but we were not impressed with Batman. His voice was like he was speaking from one of those box things for guys with throat cancer. I also wasn't impressed with the technology of the Batman suit. I guess our expectations were just too high. To be fair, we may try renting the movie another time (and sitting through the whole thing!) in the distant future.
10.0~The Dark Knight: more than entertainment! nicolasbaires Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight, in my humble opinion, is nothing less than a masterpiece. But there are different colors for different tastes, but don't worry, I won't say "you are a fool if you didn't like it". Why is this movie a masterpiece? Well, here we go.... Let's have something clear first: this movie is not about Batman, is about Gotham city. I live in a country intoxicated with corruption, and after all these years, well, let's say you can expect anything... But, recently, there's a new possible president, and, as the way everybody is seeing it, he will be our Harvey Dent... Let's just hope he won't have an accident involving gasoline and fire!... Anyway... I think a movie is a masterpiece when it can portrait this things in a very actual and natural way (like Costa-Gavra's Z), how great cities are made of! when you know the basics in sociology, philosophy and psychology, you realize there's no good or evil, everything is relative. There is only one thing we can achieve: the greater good. But this is not something you can achieve in one day, is something you have to go a very long way just to have a glimpse. There are a lot of great movies and books that had portray this in a very faithful way. Like Goehte's Faust. Between the lights and shades, you can see a great city sunk in corruption, drugs and misery, hoping for someone who can actually fight for their rights, making real justice. And as you saw in the movie, Harvey Dent, The white knight, is this person. Too bad he had the accident, but Hey! there's always irony in our universe. You have to see and explore the dark so you can comprehend the light, and I think Nolan has always known this, and that is why I love all of his films. At the end of the movie, neither Dent nor Batman can prove by their own means to be the hero Gotham wants, but needs. And they make this sacrifice for, as you know, the greater good... Glorious... I left the cinema with tears in my eyes... remembering a lot of sacrifices in real life, made by real heroes, that passed unnoticed, just for (here we go again) the greater good! I expected more from the joker and less from the movie... at the end, I was amazed! The dark knight has the perfect measure, so every character is great and amazing! Don't get me wrong, I loved the joker, but with all the viral marketing WB released before the movie, I thought they would give more relevance to the joker than Batman or the movie itself, but gladly, they didn't. What I loved the most? Above all, the script. It's great. The acting, the cinematography, the music, the direction... Everything! I'm not saying this movie is perfect, but how can we, humans after all, describe perfection? Art is subjective, so for me, The Dark Knight is Perfect!
1.0~Simply the worst... psycho_boy Sign in Permalink Simply the worst... I was hoping for some good movie...Hell! I fought it'll be great! My brother saw it first, and said it was good sh it. Than it was my 'turn'. I remember, when I was already going out from cinema, I've wished I could Punch (twice) Nolan in his face. Batman is my fave comic hero...but it's not important right now. What's important is that God Damn Nolan gave us piece of Max Commercial movie for little kids. It's not realistic, as Nolan said it would be. And it's not 'dark' either. I should've known that The Dark Knight will be the same sh it as Bat: Begins...But it doesn't help for my frustration. I wish Burton could make few more Bat Movies...His dark vision of Gotham was incredible. Art Deco with style and fashion of 50s, combine with present time...o.k. with late 80s...And Jack as THE JOKER...I think it was a role of his life...H. Ledger was good, but he didn't beat Jack The King... but he was really good....Shame, that Ledger was the only one who knew what he was doing...And in the end...Joker didn't save the day...and The Dark Guano is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 1 of 10 is more than it deserves. I'm not from The Great US of A...or England. So if my comment seems a little shi tty, give me a brake... Post Scriptum Bale was totally without balls in this movie. I like him butbut I'm telling what I've seen. But what totally destroyed the movie, were giant holes in plot and this incredible stupid device, that converts mobile phone in Allah, God, Buddha, Confucius knows what. PS2 I must tell thisdo any of you believes that prisoners on one of those boats loaded with explosives, wouldn't have blown to high sky that other boat? And the same about those good citizens
10.0~One of the best films i have seen joe_jegede Sign in Permalink Being a huge fan of superhero movies. Batman in particular has the right balance of amazing sound effects, score, visuals effects and all round action to keep my eyes glued to the screen and wanting more after the end of the film. While most films are so focused on big explosions and sometimes an overload of special effects, this film manages to deliver great dialogue in between the action scenes and in doing so setting a good pace for the action to follow. Going to recommend it to those who haven't see it yet. A definite must watch.
6.0~New Dawn Fades zofos Sign in Permalink I thought "Batman Begins" was the best Batman movie of them all when I saw it and I still think that. It was the first Batman movie to fully explore how Bruce Wayne became Batman by showing his training by a mentor (Liam Neeson) and it made you fully appreciate what he was trying to achieve by turning fear back on the evil-doers. Even without the big Batman villains of The Joker, The Penguin and Catwoman, the makers of "Batman Begins" managed to do something new and different with an old character. It ended with a reference to the arrival of The Joker in Gotham City and it set the pulses racing with anticipation. Heath Ledger's casting as The Joker did raise some eyebrows, he wasn't an obvious choice and hadn't previously shown any of the manic energy necessary to play the Clown Prince of Gotham. While the calls (or demands more like) for an Oscar for Heath Ledger for his performance here are stretching things, he does bring an interesting energy to the performance. Jack Nicholson really nailed the character of The Joker, so it was going to be hard for anyone to live up to that. I guess Ledger did as good as anyone could have expected. The action scenes in "The Dark Knight" are spectacular and they are the best thing about the film. The real problem is the script. Christopher Nolan brought his brother on board as screenwriter, he hadn't been involved in the first film and it shows. The script is too long, we could have easily done without Harvey Dent/Two-Face in it (although the make-up effects on this character are excellent). If you cut his character out, you'd have a much more streamlined movie. Heath Ledger was never a comic actor and Christopher Nolan's movies aren't known for their humour either and that's another problem here. The Joker's funniest scenes are in the hospital when he goes to visit Harvey Dent. Dressed up as a nurse with a red wig, the only dialogue the writers can think of for The Joker to say is: "Hi." (Couldn't they have thought of something funnier than that?) Then, when the Joker blows up the hospital by remote control detonation, you keep waiting for the funny lines to come, but they never do. There are constant silences where there should be one-liners. Jack Nicholson had some tremendous quips as The Joker in Tim Burton's "Batman," Heath Ledger never really gets the same service from the screenwriters. That's a pity. After 9/11, many new security measures were brought in and some of them lead to protests about invasion of people's privacy. There is a scene is this movie that mirrors that when Batman uses the cellular phones of the people of Gotham to track The Joker through sonar (it's also the visual equivalent of the hallucogenic scenes at the end of "Batman Begins"). Morgan Freeman's character, Lucius Fox, proffers his resignation rather than "spy on 30 million people." It's a clever scene and it elevates The Joker's attacks on Gotham into a context we can all relate to, unfortunately it's only a brief moment in a very long movie and the rest of the film isn't as clever. Christian Bale seems to be growling his lines even more as Batman here than he did in the first film and it does get a little irritating at times. He's also not as buffed up as he was in the first one. The character development of Bruce Wayne that was so interesting in the first one grinds to a halt in this film. We find out precious little about him here, that goes for The Joker too and I feel the film suffers as result. Michael Caine returns as Alfred, but he doesn't have much to do this time around. The same goes for Morgan Freeman. The cast doesn't feel as special this time even though it's the same people all over again. Overall, this doesn't have the tight structure of "Batman Begins", it feels bloated and could have been fixed. It's just one robbery, kidnapping or car chase after another and it does start to get repetitive after a while. I hope the next Batman sequel is more in line with "Batman Begins" than this one.
5.0~This movie was not nor ever will be a good movie one_or_the_other Sign in Permalink At most this movie is only popular for 2 reasons: its Batman, and Heath Ledger died after the making of this film which in turn made it a pity movie much like 'Queen of the Damned' did for Aliyah. At first I believe this movie was taking a very exciting and enriching role in the modern and 'realistic' feel most of the new super hero movies are trying to do. But somehow, they tried too hard. We all know that Heath Ledger died. He died of an overdose at a famous twins' place. Does that mean I have to like a bad movie just because he plays the joker? He really did do a great job but the script it self and the drawn out plot just kills the move. I honestly thought it ended 3-4 times around the hour and a half marker. Too much for one movie makes it a bad movie. Try making 2-face the next villain in the NEXT movie. Most say this was the best movie ever. If it was so great then tell me why without saying anything about Heath Ledger and his great performance that everyone already knows. Without mentioning that this is indeed a Batman movie remake made to look real and modern. Nothing about the length or the script or even how it drags on and on? Good movie. Only if you watch the first hour and half.
10.0~The Dark Knight, spectacularly intellectual arijit_das87 Sign in Permalink Watching The Dark Knight on a big screen is an experience comparable to few other pleasures one can think of immediately. I honestly can't remember the last time I felt this satisfied coming out of a film. What's genius about director Christopher Nolan's latest Batman installment is that it's not only a spectacular comic-book movie, but also one with an intellectual heart. It's not all chases and explosions and action scenes – although there's lots of that – it's also a really smart film about characters with edge and a plot that actually seems to make sense. Christian Bale slips into the bat suit once again to play the Caped Crusader who thinks of hanging up his boots when he becomes impressed with District Attorney Harvey Dent's crime-fighting resolve. But when clown-faced psychopath The Joker shows up, Batman realises retirement is a long time away. In addition to new characters like Harvey Dent (played superbly by Aaron Eckhart, by the way), all significant characters from Nolan's previous film Batman Begins return for this new adventure. Police lieutenant Jim Gordon (played by Gary Oldman), Bruce Wayne's faithful butler Alfred (played by Michael Caine), Wayne's go-to guy for fancy gizmos Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman) and assistant DA and Wayne's love interest Rachel Dawes (played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal) are all back and have respectable roles to play here, but The Dark Knight is ultimately about Batman and The Joker. It's a much darker film than any of the previous Batman movies, and it goes into directions that few comic-book films have taken before. Much of that edginess comes from The Joker and his sinister plans. Not merely content at killing his enemies, The Joker chooses to psychologically torment his rivals by forcing them to question what they stand for. Inheriting the character completely, delivering a text-book performance that is hard to forget even days after you've watched the film, the late Heath Ledger IS The Joker. The greasy hair, the make up-smeared face, the red scar of a grin, the tongue snaking out of his lips, and that sloshy voice - not only is this Joker a complete contrast from Jack Nicholson's largely comic take on the same role in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film, but Heath Ledger as The Joker is undoubtedly the finest, most menacing villain in any comic-book movie yet. For those interested purely in the spectacle value of the film, there's enough to keep you excited. Cars explode, jails and hospitals are blown up, bombs are put in people's mouths, even left in their stomachs. There are some fantastic chase sequences, and there's one particularly jaw-dropping scene in which a massive truck flips in the air like an Olympic diver. There's also the Batmobile which transforms itself into an armored tank and even a turbo motorcycle. Naturally all this means it's a long film– two hours and 32 minutes to be precise – but it's unlikely that you'll complain because you're sucked into the drama pretty early on. Allowing Ledger and The Joker to steal this film from under his nose, Christian Bale as Batman takes a backseat during this ride. But Nolan gives him that one magnificent scene which makes up for whatever complaints Batman might otherwise have. In this scene, we see Batman leaping off a Gotham skyscraper, swooping down into the night, his bat wings rustling in the air as he descends on the city he's here to protect. It's one of the most fantastic scenes you've seen in film for a long, long time. And this is a fantastic film. Go with a big bucket of popcorn and prepare to have a great time. It's for the pleasure of watching films like this that reclining seats and giant screens were invented.
1.0~Horrible Movie!!! sanctuary_v Sign in Permalink I went to see "Dark Knight" because of Heath Ledger, only. "Batman Begins" SUCKED, Chris Nolan SUCKS. "Batman Begins" made no sense at all(For people with brains, that is). (Spoiler) First; Chris Nolan's direction was nauseating, there were too many camera movements during some action scenes, where they could have been better without. Second; Nolan under-used the best villain in the movie(Scarecrow) and mis-casted the other one(Ra's al Ghul-Watanabe should have remained and Liam Neeson should have been out). Third; During Bruce Wayne's training on top of the mountain, he was asked to execute a "Perp", he refused, than started a brawl with the clan, burned down the monastery, killed most of the clan, including the "Perp" that he refused to kill in the first place, and saved the life of the one person that he should have let die(No common sense at all). (Spoiler) I had hoped that "Dark Knight" would be better, with less camera movements(Didn't happen). There were cameras rotating in circles around people just standing still(Very annoying and un-professional, it's bad for people with REM(That's "Rapid Eye Movements" and ear infections). Nolan did used his villains well in the "Dark Knight". The Non-Traditional Joker was maniacal in a good way, Two-Face was well used, he did a great job, even Rachel Dawes was wonderful. (Spoiler) The bad part about this movie was the Batman himself. If all these people who commented on this movie, actually saw the same movie that I saw, they should also note that Batman did absolutely nothing in this movie, there was nothing "Dark" and nothing "Knight" about Batman. All he did was abused and brutalized the Joker, inside a police interrogating room, no less(Amazing), when the Joker was already dazed and drained. There was a couple of minutes of fist-fighting with the Joker on top of a balcony, but nothing confrontational, or face Two-Face(Ha-I made a funny).(Spoiler) There was a ridiculous scene, where a couple of citizens dressed as Batman, doing their own vigilante things, using automatic weapons, and costumes that looked like Batman's(How/where did they get those copied costumes?), fighting a hooded Scarecrow, I think(Nolan left us with no details). If it was the real Scarecrow, I'm sure he would have used his "Fear Agents".(Spoiler) The writing was bad for Bruce Wayne as well, he had a few tacky lines, that made him look more stupid and repulsive, instead of pretend-clumsiness from Tim Burton's Batman. If you have a brain inside your skull, save your money for the DVD, at least you will get more extras for your money. Ignore those "Fanatic" nerds, who believes that "Dark Knight" is a great movie. Watch it for Heath Ledger only, on DVD.
10.0~This film is on a plane most movies only dream of attaining inoneedschool Sign in Permalink What is so amazing about this movie is that it transcends good and evil. While it is generally agreed upon that the Joker is bad and that the Batman is good, this is not quite accurate. In fact, the Joker represents pure anarchy, a concept that, as it is poorly misunderstood in a civilized world, is seen as evil. However, in this movie, we see that order, chaos' counterpart, must sometimes break its own rules to hold its own. This movie reminds me very much so of the works of great playwrights like Shakespeare and more recently, Miller, in its almost poetic symbolism and themes. As for the acting; Chirsitan Bale is, as always, an exceptionally talented actor and, when it comes to Heath Ledger, there is not much to say. The performance will speak for itself. I will only say that, in my opinion, he does deserve the Oscar for best supporting actor, and not just out of pity for his untimely death. This truly is one of the best performances I've ever seen and even rivals that of Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will be Blood. There is also plenty of incredibly intense action scenes as well as suspense that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats, so don't think this movie is just for the hardcore movie goers who look for all the themes and the incredible I was referring to earlier. In short, whether you're just trying to find a good movie to pass the time, or you're looking for something much deeper, this movie is simply perfect. Although please don't go seeing it expecting a light experience; this is one of the darkest and most serious movies I've ever seen, despite what anybody may think about a movie that portrays a comic book hero. In any case, this movie is pure perfection and Christopher Nolan has actually managed to outdo himself, something i thought not possible, I being a great fan of his works (Memento and Insomnia being among my favorite movies, not to mention Batman Begins). In my opinion, this is one of, if not THE best movie ever made.
9.0~The dark knight made Batman my hero! Palakhmoon Sign in Permalink I watched "The dark knight" in an IMAX theater in Houston last summer. Like many others who have seen the dark knight I would describe the film in one word: Wow. It was incredible. The movie went quickly to the top of my Netflix account so I was able to watch it again immediately after its DVD release. unfortunately (or fortunately) I have not seen any other Batman movies before so Batman was not my hero when I first saw the film. The story, however, does not require any background to masterfully make you fall deep into the stream of Gotham city events. The movie begins strongly, progresses constantly and ends amazingly. There are five actors at their best performances in this movie. Christian Bale (Batman), Heath Ledger (Joker), Gary Oldman (James Gordon), Michael Caine (Alfred), and Morgan Freeman (Fox). Other actors and actresses are also good. Although I think that Rachel's role deserved a much better actress than Maggie Gyllenhaal. The cinematography and music is excellent. Although you may need to watch the movie in an IMAX theater to fully acknowledge it. It was one of the best movies that I've seen in years. I won't be surprised if the movie wins 8 Oscar awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Bale), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ledger or Oldman, God that's a difficult choice), Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing. 9/10
10.0~This had better win a ton of awards or I'm gonna be mad willrd91 Sign in Permalink There's nothing to dislike about this movie. All of the acting is great- especially that of Heath Ledger. It really stinks that they won't be able to use him again for any sequels. Christopher Nolan is a good director and his brother sure can write. I loved the way Heath Ledger created a Joker that wasn't criminally insane, but just pure evil. I wanted more from Christian Bale when I first saw Batman Begins, but now that I've seen The Dark Knight, I understand the progression Bruce Wayne went through more. There were plenty of action sequences that never got old. Christopher Nolan kept the action moving forward and avoided repeating old scenarios. This is a must-see.
2.0~No bootderek Sign in Permalink OK, while there some new effects for the franchise, this film had its problems. Like Batman Begins, it brings in the guy who wants revenge against the guy that's causing the problems. Enter Heath Ledger. I really do not think that he did a good job. I mean, the first Batman film in 1989 introduced the joker, so why bring him back? Jack Nicholson stole the performance, and Heath ruined it. The problem with the Joker in this film is his looks. Jack's Joker had a smile surgically fixed on his face. Heath's Joker has a smile painted on his face. Pathetic. The original look was better. The jokes and puns are terrible, as are most of the action sequences. Now, seriously, someone bring back Michael Keaton? 2/10 sorry, guys, but this is just my opinion.
6.0~get a grip on yourselves guidodanen Sign in Permalink honestly, the best batman movie that was made until now. BUT!! you'd have to be mental to say that this is the best movie ever made!!! I mean come on, this movie gets nowhere near movies like The Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather. In short, it does NOT deserve a place in the top 10 of IMDb's top 250. If you would say, Heath Ledger's appearance of The Joker is so good that is should be in the top 10 of best appearances, then I would totally agree with you. as it was stated in previous comments, the movie is so full of plot lines and has some credibility flaws which make the movie overfull. I always loved the Batman movies, including this one. So I'm not saying this because I just want to be pessimistic. it is a great movie and I enjoyed watching it, but a classic or a the best movie ever made?! I don't think so! absolutely not! I also agree with the people who commented on the appearance of Bale. He is just too stiff and arrogant. He lacks in character which makes him come of like a cold hearted asshole. which may be right considering Bruce Wayne's past, but Bale overdoes it in a way so that it looks like Bruce hasn't got any depths. to conclude, an interesting, enjoyable movie which should never be confused or compared to real classics or top 10 movies. that would be an insult to those movies.
10.0~I love Christopher Nolan.... grantmalf Sign in Permalink Dear God I love Christopher Nolan. In his five film career, beginning with "Memento" he has not put a foot wrong, building a body of work which supports the assertion that he is the most talented director of his generation. With The Dark Knight he has created the best comic book film ever. Period. Dark Knight is the most perfect blend of style and substance, action and drama that I've ever seen. It's technically brilliant, with awe inspiring action sequences that must be seen to be believed. The action however, is not superfluous but feeds off the dramatic subtext of the script. Nolan explores what it is to be a hero, and the pitfalls of protecting a city that seems to be suffering because of the very existence of that so called hero. Each actor slips perfectly into their role, with honourable mention going to Aaron Eckhart who did far better than I expected as Harvey Dent. Towering above them all however is Heath Ledger. Almost 20 years ago Jack Nicholson portrayed a Joker that many felt could never be topped or re-attempted. Whilst it is unfair to compare the two, one certainty is that it will be at least that long again before any other actor can don the maniacal grin once more. True, the Joker by his very nature is bound to steal the show.....true, the Nolan brothers have scripted the Joker in a unique way, filled with memorable dialogue. Nothing however, can take away from Ledger, who's every movement, every word, every physical nuance is part of a meticulously crafted madman. This Joker ranks among the greatest of villains as he seemingly needs no motivation for his actions other than the constant thirst for chaos. The Joker is all animalistic instinct and in Batman the Joker has found a nemesis whom he enjoys being pitted against. For the Joker it is not the outcome that is important but the fight itself. His lack of fear or reverence to anything is truly terrifying. Ledger's final completed performance is perhaps the mot bittersweet piece of acting to watch as it now serves as a swansong, rather than heralding the arrival of a monumentally talented superstar. There is nothing I can say about Ledger, or the film that hasn't already been said but in there lies the film's true brilliance......I feel the need to rave about it anyway.
6.0~Hyped up chdh1 Sign in Permalink After reading several reviews hyping up this movie as IMDb's best of all time, I had to se it. As with most movies i have high expectations to, I get disappointed after seeing them. This is no exception. There are several thing that bugs me in this movie. First the hangover whiskey voice of the batman character is annoying. It would be better if he spoke like Bruce Wayne. We know its him anyway. Second I think its to long. Instead of introducing yet another character (Harvey Dent/ twoface) they could have cut him and at least 30 minutes of the film. Third, I was waiting to se more of the joker character. I also noticed really lamer editing at the end of the movie. After twoface dies, batman tells Gordon (Gary Oldman) that he takes the blame for killing the innocent people and cops. Then the movie drifts of to where Gordon holds a press conference telling everybody what happened to Harvey Dent. Then suddenly they cut back to the same scene with batman and gordon at the scene where twoface just died. For me this movie is far from the best movie ever made (like many IMDb reviews states). To mention a few, Full Metal Jacket, A Clockwork Orange, Requiem for a Dream, Scilence of the Lambs, The Shawshank Redemption, Schindler's List, Goodfellas, Fight Club, The Shining and many more beat this movie by lightyears. The only thing stopping me from giving it 4 stars is the joker. Heath Ledger is the best joker to date.
10.0~Oh yes, It's that good! regarcia86 Sign in Permalink I have to admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of "Batman Begins", actually right after I watched it I came right here to IMDb, and just tried to explain why the movie didn't work for me, while every person on the planet came out loving it. 3 years later, I really don't care much about "Batman Begins", but I loved this movie, "The Dark Knight" corrected everything I didn't like about the first one, I loved every second of it, I even loved the Scarecrow cameo, the Falcone mention, and of course this movie works in every level, because it gives us a formidable opponent for Batman, and that's of course The Joker, he really steals the show, he really is as crazy as you think he's gonna be, the way he lies about everything (even his origin), the way he explains everything, the nurse outfit, everything was just perfect about him, Ledger really deserves an Oscar, this role alone makes him worthy, and I think that the millions of people that watched this movie can really discredit the Academy if that doesn't happen. I read the review I made three years ago for "Batman Begins", and really, even if you hated the first movie, there's nothing of that in here, Bruce Wayne is the ultimate anti-hero/hero/not-a-hero, Alfred is not a pain in this movie, Lucius Fox it's not just there for the lines, Rachel is really strong and really becomes a tragic hero, and Two-Face was really great, and not just a second fiddle to the Joker, he really is just the two extremes of a man, Gordon finds his place in Gotham, and the Mayor is Batmanuel. The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard works this time around, and is not just buzzing in the background like in the first one (By the way the Joker theme works really great on the screen) OK, the reason I did all of this, is because I needed to tell everyone, that this is the Batman movie you've been waiting for, the movie that goes to those dark places you knew these movies were destined to go, but actually never went. So go ahead and watch the movie already, stop reading my bad writing, and put a smile on your face...
10.0~Even better than Batman Begins. cpl-cuteness Sign in Permalink It seems Hollywood has finally cured the disease about sequels not being better than the first (Hellboy 2, The Incredible Hulk remake). Hopefully, I didn't just jinx that, but The Dark Knight punches its way past Batman Begins without a sweat. The Dark Knight is so much darker than the previous Batman films. Heath Ledger portrays the Joker's evil side extremely well as well as the Joker's dark sense of humor. Ledger gives the Joker a whole new life with a performance that seems to be unbeatable by any past and upcoming comic-based films. The Joker is finally how he's supposed to be. Ledger cleans the mess left from Jack Nicolson's Joker in Tim Burton's Batman. The other cast members also do a wonderful job in their acting. Christian Bale is, by far, the best Bruce Wayne/Batman. And the other actors/actresses play their parts just as good. The special effects were pretty sweet. The film makers gave Batman some cool new toys. And the hand-to-hand fight sequences were much better than in Batman Begins. You could actually see what was going on. Even though the fight scenes didn't seem as fast, it seemed more realistic which gave the feeling that a man (or woman) could actually do these things, which made Batman even that more kick-tail. This movie had some really good moralslike about sacrificing for the innocent and friends. This film was very clean. No sexual content. And hardly any foul language (1 sob, 2 A words, and 2 H words). I really enjoyed this film. It's definitely this summer's best film by far and it totally deserves the high ratings. Support this film! R.I.P. Heath Ledger

3.0~This city deserves a better class of movies... anarchyintheuk-steven Sign in Permalink I was could not wait to see this movie on the opening weekend. The critics and audiences everywhere were giving this movie such high praises. So I rushed to my local theater to catch what could be a known as the greatest superhero movie ever made in history. Two hours and something minutes later after the movie was done I realized the greatest thing ever made in history was the marketing package for The Dark Knight. Boy, did they over-hype this colossal nonsense of a movie. SPOILERS! 1) I don't understand why the martial arts style, Keysi, was used in the film. It just doesn't look cinematically pleasing in any sense. In the documentary for Batman Begins, the choreographers wanted Batman to look like an angry beast that would just run over people with his attacks. They didn't want to make the fighting look like a dance (like traditional Wushu). Great. So then what they decided to do was get a bunch of guys who look like they made a fighting style up. They look like monkeys hammer fisting each other! If you don't believe me check out the documentary: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVWyqBdE5RI). As a result the fighting was clumsy, poorly staged, and filmed. Batman is supposed to be stealthy, nimble, yet powerful. But instead, he moves heavily and lethargically. 2) Choppy plot development: Right after Batman dives off the building to save Rachel, what happens to the Joker? We're made to assume he left because Dent was not there. But was that it? Joker crashes a party, finds nothing, and just leaves? It's a movie about The Batman vs. The Joker!!! It's their first interaction with each other – isn't that suppose to be a grand event??!! Nope, instead Joker drops Rachel, Batman goes to save her, and Joker leaves the party. Its plot points like that that really weakens the movie. Another example is Batman's batpod chase throughout the city. At the very end of the sequence, Batman hurls himself at the Joker and falls off the bike. WTF???? No grand battle between good and evil? No epic moments of struggle between the two forces? Then James Gordon saves The Batman? Then why do we need Batman???? Which brings me to another point 3) WHY EXPLAIN SO MUCH? I DON'T CARE WHERE BATMAN GOT ALL OF HIS TOYS!!! It's like every scene had to explain why Batman could do what he does. Batman can bend guns cause his gauntlets have steel clamps built in them, Batman has white eyes because it's part of the sonar technology, Batman can now move his head around because the suit is now segmented instead of being once piece, Luscious Fox helps Batman utilized an escape method that was used in the 1960's by the military and so on and so on and so on and so on.If Batman is suppose to be this mythic creature, then why bother to demystify him at all? From the way they are explaining Batman, it just seems as if ANYBODY can be Batman. All you have to do is get martial arts training and a lot of money and that's it – NOW YOU ARE THE BATMAN. I can understand the explanations being used in Batman Begins, because it was an origins story, but in the Dark Knight, let's see why he's so good. Why only Bruce Wayne can be The Batman. 4) And why all the philosophizing? I can understand the serious themes of the Batman mythos. In the books like "Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth", ""The Long Halloween, Brian Azarello's "Joker" they take the time to explore the Dark Knight's world and the characters that inhabit them, but without trying to cram pompous banalities into your mind. In between the action scenes were benign philosophical interludes that were pretentious. And Batman talks way too much. Yes, Batman is more than just a muscle bound superhero, but couldn't we see that through his work as a Detective (which is what he is)? And the voice Christian Bale used was horrible to begin with so making him ramble on and on about right and wrong wasn't appealing at all. 5) This movie was The Joker movie. It wasn't about the Batman. Nolan said he tried to make it more about the hero. He didn't want to make the "mistake" that Burton did with his Batman films where the hero was more of a minor character. Nolan repeated that mistake. Joker was once again the main focus of the movie. 6) It was way too long. The movie should've ended after Batman defeated the Joker. Why bring Two Face into the picture at this point (where I was getting ready to leave the theater)? I really wished they saved Two Face for the third movie. So hopefully in the third movie they take a step back and really try to slow it down a bit. I know Nolan was ambitious in his creation of the sequel, but I felt like those ambitions blinded his ability to see the details. Too be honestI probably should have just rented this instead of paying $15 for the IMAX showing.
1.0~Best film ever? AHAHAHAHAHA apeternier Sign in Permalink OK, Batman TDK is a good thriller, worthing maybe a 7 out of 10: but is simply not conceivable that it is ranked more than masterpieces like The Godfather and other wonderful pieces of art. Batman TDK is NOT a piece of art: is just entertainment. Good entertainment, even if the movie is a bit long, the plot confused and sometimes non-sense (what about the logic of the ending? Mobile-phone image scanning?),etc. etc. as other reviewers already commented. The Batman character voice is also pathetic with the forced laryngitis-like tone: do you want Batman to talk like a 140 kg wrestling player? Nah... Those things may perhaps have impact on kids but look ridiculous to any other (more mature) audience. Heath Ledger's performance is good, in my opinion the best thing in this movie. I liked his performance when the Joker is coming out from the hospital before the explosion, when he walked in a very strange psychotic-way, dressed like a nurse. Ahaha, I liked his mimic! I put 1/10 on this movie knowing that it deserves probably a 7/10 to reduce this insane over-rating.
1.0~what happened? scifimaniac Sign in Permalink OK first of all i happen to be a real superhero fan hell you should see the space used here to store all my comics so i usually don't have high demands for a superhero movie i like em all at least until i went to see dark knight that is i went expecting a superhero movie instead i got violence violence some more violence and to top it off some violence at some point i actually started to check watch hoping it would be over soon this movie didn't need a batman the way it played it reminded me off those old B-movies you know the good guy gets ticked off and goes after the bad guys bad guys are usually crazy pure violent guys and you end up with 90 minutes of killing shooting and so on this is basically how the movie went first you have the joker who wants chaos and destruction thats is the entire story about the joker no debt in the entire character that is his only motivation and you never get to know why so the movie starts with the joker fighting everyone batman the Mafia you name it this goes on and on and on when you finally think the movie is over and batman won it starts all over again then they add two-face the only believable char in the entire movie but he plays like 5 minutes overall i went in with high hopes after 30 minutes i hoped the story would get started after 90 minutes i was checking watch hoping it would be over soon i think movies like that should have an LBO warning (Leave Brain Outside) when i noticed the score this movie got i felt actually depressed and i really hope someone boosted this score by cheating the alternative is so horrible i can't even describe it so i keep on trying to convince myself the world is not as bad as that score tells me it is
10.0~2008 Greatest Movie stewartgill34-1 Sign in Permalink I have just returned from a premiere in Newcastle, Australia(15/7/08), let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of 2008. Every performance in this movie is just fantastic, and Heath Ledger Owns The JOKER, I don't think anyone could match his style and he eats up every scene he is in. This has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed, this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the original. Make 2008 the year to see and enjoy one of the years best. And i hope in Feb 09, Heath is nominated for an Oscar, he will always be remembered Cheers
10.0~It's enough~ fanchy1025 Sign in Permalink This movie I have been see twice. And this is my first time see a movie twice. And this is my first time see IMAX film, too. Because some views are full screen. So I saw the movie all in IMAX theater. I afraid there has no this visual effect in DVD in the future. I always enjoy the movies that director is Christopher Nolan, like "Memonto", "Batman Begins", "Pritage"... They all can see again and again. Every time I see, will have different feel~ Although the movie is perfect, but I hope there has no sequel any more... it's enough. A: Because Heath Ledger was gone, I don't want to see any other guy to act as a substitute. B: TDK is a masterpiece. Its sequel very easy to be bad than TDK.
7.0~Overrated, but still a good film Poke504 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight has won numerous awards since it's release almost a year ago, but in my opinion doesn't exactly deserve the top 250 list. A little too long, lacking an opening, and containing the infamous Batman voice Bale used, this film gets a lot of flaws ignored that some other films would get trashed for. Still, though not the most fantastic film of the summer, it is an enjoyable movie for all and anyone will at least like it. Throughout these mistakes, we are given the fantastic acting of the late Heath Ledger to make up for it, which undoubtedly is one of the best villains we've ever seen. Though overrated, this amazing performance and good story making is sure to entertain. Your Batman fanatic will love it, and you will enjoy it.
5.0~Not the greatest film ever made JohnSeal Sign in Permalink Time for a corrective. As I write this review, The Dark Knight is, according to IMDb voters, the Best. Film. Ever. At the risk of incurring a hail of brickbats, I must demur. Yes, Heath Ledger delivers an excellent performance, as does Gary Oldman as Lieutenant--er, COMMISSIONER Gordon--and it's always a pleasure to watch Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart. But The Dark Knight is an overlong, over plotted, logically flawed, and philosophically confused film that cannot (and should not) be mistaken for great art. Compared to most comic book movies, it's not bad. Compared to La Regle du Jeu, it ain't so hot. The film's first half is actually quite good, and seems to come to a timely conclusion somewhere around the eighty minute mark. Unfortunately, this being a summer blockbuster, there's another 70 plus minutes to go, and the film's second half is a distinct letdown. Instead of ending on a neat and tidy note, The Dark Knight spirals off into a muddled mess of bizarre plotting (how DID that prisoner get the bomb sewn into him?), illogic (how does Harvey escape the hospital explosion--and why is he apparently impervious to pain?) and confusing action (too many ass-kickings in too little time). I don't expect 100% logical consistency from my genre product, but there are so many flaws and elisions of simple common sense in Christopher Nolan's screenplay that utter frustration sets in around the two-hour mark. By the end of the film, we're expected to believe that, for some reason, the residents of Gotham now need to revile Batman rather than reward him for his good work, setting up a police pursuit into the sunset that presumably will end with our hero receiving a ticket for speeding on the Batcycle. So let's tell it like it is: in terms of 2008 comic book flicks, The Dark Knight is inferior to both Hellboy II (which at least is charming and amusing) and Hancock (which raises far more interesting questions about the nature of the super hero).
6.0~Massively overrated crustysaltmerchant Sign in Permalink Forget all the hype of it being the best film ever and it being the best film of 2008 and Heath Ledger being fantastic. None of these things are true. Yes the film is good, bordering on very good. But that's it, no way is it as great as everyone is making out. Let's start at the beginning the story, the story is just not involving enough, there's a power struggle between gangsters and Batman/the police, the Joker offers to kill Batman in exchange for half the gangsters money. The end. That's it? that's the whole story? Yeah, OK we have the relationship angle with Rachel and Harvey and Bruce but seriously what a ridiculously dull storyline. The action is good without ever being exciting or involving, personally I didn't care how many anonymous henchmen Batman fought with or how many faceless extras were put in danger by the Joker. This film needed a major face off between the two and that just didn't happen. As for Heath Ledger's performance, the characters name is called the Joker, clue is in the title, he just wasn't funny. I can't remember a single wisecrack in the whole film. Joe Pesci in Goodfellas is the perfect template of how to play the Joker - likable, hilarious with a serious threat of explosive violence. Heath just wandered about looking like a mad goth grumbling in a Richard Nixon voice. As for Harvey two face what really was the point in introducing him right at the very end of the film? a total waste of a character. Overall I feel slightly cheated by this film. It's not the fantastic movie I was expecting, it's an above average sequel. Nor is it up there with THE great superhero films Superman - The Movie and Superman 2, Spiderman and Spiderman 2. These are great superhero films, these set the benchmark way above whatever this can reach. An enjoyable film but not worthy of it's overblown status.
10.0~Beyond a comic book movie, and more of a masterpiece in filmaking algjgg Sign in Permalink Brilliant. Just pure, absolute brilliance. The Dark Knight is, above and beyond, and greatest (super)hero to ever be conceived of. It's been hyped up for over a year, with a strong and aggressive marketing structure, and after walking into the theater and walking out, all I have to say is you haven't seen nothing yet until you see this movie for yourself. Christopher Nolan is the brains behind this masterpiece. His complex and thorough ideas shifted the Batman franchise from weighted failure (not Burton's version, more like Schumacher's) to critically successful. Starting with Batman Begins, he gave the series new life by showing a side of Bruce Wayne/Batman that we've never seen before. The same can be said with The Dark Knight. The plot carries right after Batman Begins. Bruce Wayne continues to subdue and eliminate the scum of Gotham City, criminal by criminal, and with the help of Harvey Dent aka "The White Knight of Gotham City", they come close to achieving it. But when a new villain called The Joker enters the scene chaos, death, greed, and lies begin to unfold. And soon Bruce must find a way to stop the Joker before he rises to ultimate power and prove to Gotham that Batman is more than just caped crusader. After the untimely death of the late great actor Heath Ledger, the film received more hype from not just Batman fans, but also Ledger fans as well, much like my older sister. She fell in love with nearly all of his movies, and she counted down to the very last second to see this, even though she doesn't know anything about Batman. Heath's performance as the Joker was, in every sense of the word, horrifying. When I heard he passed away, I mourned that The Dark Knight would get canceled. But after dying nearly six months before the movie was released, just seeing him on screen gave me a haunting sense that I was watching an angel play a villain. I pray that he wins an Oscar for best supporting actor, or least nominate him for doing such an overly outstanding job at portraying the Joker. Aaron Eckhart did as much of a awesome job as Heath did. His portrayal as Harvey Dent was PERFECT. Tommy Lee Jones has got nothing on Eckhart. Eckhart brings a more prepared and live Dent than in Batman Forever. In Forver, Harvey was a more disillusioned psychopath that killed people for fun. But in TDK, he's a more developed and complex character, with certain goals and no limits. And his transformation into Two-Face is by far the most intriguing and powerful moment within the film, because we see an innocent man who believed in saving Gotham from evil and turning it into a haven, and is now turned into this man who has seen the ugly side of life, much like what Bruce experienced when his parents were killed, and instead of turning into a vigilante, also much like Bruce did, turns into something that perpetuates and blurs the lines between evil and insanity. And although Two-Face may not be the main-main villain of the film, he still brought a good portion of the atmosphere that The Dark Knight had. The Dark Knight has it's share of awesome moments the define it. Nearly every single second it worth watching. Cinematography was amazing, mostly in Chicago, of which I only live 63 miles away from. The action is fully delivered in a more dynamic way than in Batman Begins. I liked the fact that the film lasted for about a good 2hrs and 30min, but at some points they should of went for the 3 hour mark. Now I know that may sound a little TOO much, but it would be worth seeing more of Eckhart in action as Two-Face. But thats just my opinion. The Dark Knight is'nt just a comic book movie, but more of a well played drama with spectacular action sequences, with flawless acting sprinkled all over. And I'm also speaking out for Batman Begins. Both movies prove that comic book movies can be so much more than just themselves. There is a line in Batman Begins and it is "Why do we fall? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up." And in truth, what both of these masterpieces have done has forever changed the way Batman will be. The franchise fell on its knees in the early days (again Schumacher, not Burton), and picked itself up in the new millennium. Both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight aren't Batman movies in my eyes, but a more stylized way at how we achieve things by taking the initiative into our own hands and making it mean something. This review was written in memory of Heath Ledger, April 4, 1979 - January 22, 2008. R.I.P. Heath Ledger and thank you so much for the God-given talent to perform in the movie industry.
1.0~Very bad yoda-134 Sign in Permalink I must be the odd one out. I saw this movie with my son. Both of us found the movie very bad, bad story line very bad action. Only reasonable acting was Heath Ledger as the Joker. Yes there is action, lots of action. But the action is action for the action, it hard to see a story line. The story is also very over the top. I know it is a kind of SF movie but unlike Starwars the action and gadgets are totally exaggerated. I liked the other Batman movies better. So overall a wast of money It was hard not to fall asleep. .. .. ..
1.0~Who edited this film?? A disappointment. batleh Sign in Permalink Well, the praise for this movie must be due to Heath Ledger's death, or at least I hope that's the reason, because the movie is pretty disappointing. Ledger is a convincing maniac, but the rest of the cast falls short. Is Christian Bale in this movie? I think he gets the least screen time of the three leads (Ledger, Eckhart included) and really doesn't get many good lines. The only scenes I enjoyed were between he and Ledger. The editing of this film reflects the Joker's theme - chaos...was that intentional? If so, a poor choice. After the wonderful simplicity of many superhero films, including Batman Begins (I'd give that a 9/10), Dark Knight may have not been edited at all! It seems thrown together with no accounting for the viewer's intelligence. I've seen better episodes of television.
9.0~The Dark Knight Breaks Comic Book Adaptation Barriers. Matt_Layden Sign in Permalink A new villain is in town and he's a homicidal clown known as The Joker. Batman must do everything in his power to stop him, while Harvey Dent takes the lime light as the new face of good. Not since The Matrix Reloaded have I been hyped to see a film. Where Reloaded failed to deliver on that hype, The Dark Knight soars with bright colours. Is it everything that a Batman fan wants it to be? Yes. Is it everything a film lover wants it to be? Yes. The Dark Knight takes you on a ride through action, suspense, humour and drama. It rests in a genre that makes you suspend a little reality. This is the comic book world, where there are green monsters, flying men in tights and teenagers swinging around in New York. Very bright, very over the top and very fun. The Dark Knight turns all of this on it's head and delivers a raw, realistic and genre defining film. Along with Iron Man, The Dark Knight sets a new standard for comic book adaptations. Without a doubt, every review the one will read will praise the chaotic energy that Heath Ledger gives in the role of The Joker. Can a role really live up to such hype? Yes, and this is it. Heath Ledger goes where many people do not. He becomes the character, he becomes the Joker. Nicholson played the part well, but Ledger embodies it. Every little quirk, from the flicker in the eyes, raising the eyebrows or using his tongue to wet his lips, draws you into the character. It's safe to say the Ledger does indeed steal the show from everyone and the film knows this too. It's a shame we will never see where Ledger career would have gone, because this role is juicy and Ledger nails it. That's not to say that everyone else isn't good either. Bale brings more tragedy into the heart of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Even with the world around him crumbling down, he still stands for good. Michael Cain reaches more depths with simple looks in his eyes. Both Alfred and Fox have moral dilemmas in this film, both play them well. Oldman has more screen time here then he did in Begins and he takes the character of Gordon to new heights. We know him as a good cop that doesn't conform to the corruption, but here his range explodes into more emotional decision making. Aaron Eckhart has the most troubling task here. He must play two completely different roles, within the same character, and we have to believe the transformation. His anger and hate mixes well with his confusion in what to do after his 'accident'. Finally Gyllenhaal, replaces Holmes. The character finally has some more range, but Gyllenhaal doesn't get enough screen time to bring it to us. Again, it's sad to say but this is the weakest link. It may just simply be the character. Everything about this film hits the nail on the head. The acting is top notch, no longer are roles in comic book films cheesy or one dimensional. These character are psychotic, dangerous, funny, defenseless and everything more you can ask for. Back when these characters could never be taken seriously, now are awing us with their presence. The script is fabulous. Every line of dialogue spoken by The Joker is chilling, now times that by ten because Ledger somehow gives the lines more chills. The action sequences are entertaining. We have car chases, fight scenes, race against the clock bits and anything else The Joker can come up with. With ever scheme he tops himself in the absurdity and craziness. More action then it's predecessor, more drama, more villainous and more dark. This isn't your Adam West Batman. This is Nolan's Batman. Nolan has recreated what once was lost. When nipples and bad ice puns were where these characters were, now are set back in the right motion. Nolan has given us, not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie. You don't need high theatrics to create a great comic book film, you need substance. The Dark Knight has boatloads of this. I found myself wanting more of the Joker, I was so enthralled by the character and the performance. I found myself in awe of where the film goes, in terms of plot and character development. I applaud Nolan for not making a happy go lucky film, but for given The Dark Knight his true colours. He's a tormented soul, the events in this film push him to the limit, to his breaking point. There are some minor setbacks though. I wasn't too thrilled with the bits in Hong Kong. Trims here and there could have saved the running time, which clocks in at 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes. As well as too many scene where the camera decides to spin around the characters a couple times, it gets a tad annoying. The Dark Knight will break barriers. Comic book films will be more serious, more character and plot driven then CGI laden. Heath Ledger will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a sick and twisted clown. People will want to see what happens in this world and the people in it. The Dark Knight does create a new world, a world of fear and excitement. Where in some cases you kind of secretly want to root for the bad guy. This is a world I applaud, this is a film that I applaud. This is a perfect example of what a film should be.
1.0~A Testament to the Stupidity of Our Times barrygermansky-1 Sign in Permalink Although suffering from a muddled plot, ill-defined characters, a typically uncharismatic performance by Christian Bale, and a lack of energy, The Dark Knight proved to be on of 2008's greatest commercial and critical successes. The fact that this film is in the Top Ten list tells me two things: 1) Most of the people who rated this highly are either 10-year-olds or adults with the attention span of 10-year-olds. I do not mean to offend all 10-year-olds, because there are some rare exceptions. But, you can catch my drift. 2) People who rated this highly have not seen many of the other, better films on this list. They have nothing to compare The Dark Knight to. Anyway, I just hope this film's current standing sinks down far below the 250 mark.
1.0~This movie is the proof that the world is becoming a sick and dumb place mcdegg Sign in Permalink I mean,this is the best movie ever??the number ''1''??Is it better than ''the godfather'' or ''Braveheart''? I think not. People are talking a lot about Heath Ledger's performance,but in my opinion,Jack Nicholson was a much better joker,because he had a twisted sense of humor and a background that the viewer could relate with,this new joker is just a sick individual with no clear motivation and an absurd point of view. Shall the Academy give an Oscar to Ledger??Who cares???Everybody knows who are going to be the winners months before the ceremony,and i wouldn't be surprised if this stupid action flick won best movie,best director and all the other Oscars... Batman should be made for children to see it,how is that possible??This as an ultra-violent movie with Batman being a torturer in some scenes. Some people give ''the godfather'' 1 star and this bizarre experience 10...what is the world becoming??Does special effects and bizarre characters make a good movie??the best one ever???Only for the small minded... The good old days are over...and with this ''turd'' on the top of the list,IMDb looses all the credibility...if the Corleone's were living in Gotham, this joker wouldn't last a day uhauhauahauuahua....
10.0~New standard for comic book movies tomimt Sign in Permalink A daring bank heist kicks open the second Batman film directed by Christopher Nolan. Continuing on the path provided in the Batman Begins, The Dark Knight balances itself between reality and comic book fantasy. The action certainly is from the comics in the way of realism, but the style is nothing but gritty realism, but even that it seems to do in steroids, which is not a bad thing. As some other reviewers have stated, this movie is not about the Batman (Christian Bale), but the Joker (Heath Ledger), who is not given a similar birth story like he was in Tim Burton's Batman film, but who just enters the room, so to speak, and is utterly insane and fascinating in his own deadly way. In fact I was mesmerized how little Ledger resembled anything I'd seen him before this. I wasn't looking at an actor, I was looking at the Joker, ripped from the pages of the comic books and thrown on the screen in his full insanity intact. The second criminal in the tale is Twoface, aka Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's a district attorney of Gotham city, who has a transformation of his own in the tale, all thanks to Joker's twisted little games. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The story twists and turns in every way, but it manages to keep in tact better than some films with simpler lines. Well chosen actors mixed with good score, well woven plot, stunning cinematography and breath taking action makes The Dark Knight one of the best films to come out in ages.
1.0~Are you all out of your minds? Beaucoul Sign in Permalink This movie is overlong by at least a half hour. I am so tired of films that have about six or seven endings. It's become a bit of a cliché. Just when you thought it was safe to get up from your seat and start filing out of the theater, another epilogue begins and you're forced to sit through at least another ten minutes of ridiculous, overblown, pretentious blather that's been well-covered in the previous four or five epilogues. Some writer/directors just don't know when to say when, and that's usually a sign that they don't have confidence in their material, nor their approach to it. This movie is a prime example of that kind of narrative drawback. But that's just the beginning of my complaints about "The Dark Knight." Loud, obnoxious, puerile, without one whit of wit, this movie also represents the extreme destructiveness of a relentless hype machine that's intent on whittling down our collective sense and sensibilities. The acting, which ranges from wooden to hyperbolic, seems as if it's being carried out by inter-planetary aliens who have no idea what it's like to be human. The script sounds as if it was written by someone who barely made it out of bone-head, freshman composition. I've never heard or seen so many clichés strung together in a misguided attempt at profundity and universality. As each new, cliché-ridden set piece followed another, I began to feel beaten down, as if my defenses against such obvious manipulation were being fed upon by my own desire to enjoy what everyone else seemed to be accepting so readily. Fortunately, my will to survive such cultural mediocrity is strong, and I was able to withstand this latest onslaught with my dignity intact. Please understand, I enjoyed "Batman Begins," a story that was told in a simple, straightforward manner, with some minor attempts at profundity that were in line with the childish, comic book subject matter. To try and make something so "de profundis" about a superhero running around in a bat costume chasing down some uber-villain in grease paint and fright wig, is truly akin to putting lipstick on a pig. After it's done, you can't help but wonder: "are they really expecting people to take this crapola so seriously?" I'd rather see Adam West and Cesar Romero go at it, then have to sit through this load of pretentious, horse manure. At least I was able to get a laugh out of the original TV series, which was undeniably a camp classic in its original incarnation.
8.0~More carelessly told than Begins, but Dark Knight redefines the comic genre in film Jack_Acid Sign in Permalink This is one of those rare films where my expectations were not only a bit higher than normal, but they were also equally fulfilled. Nolan is giving us a number of stories here, almost more like a Gotham Chronicles story than JUST a Batman story. This film is as much about Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent and even the every day people of Gotham as much as it is about Bruce Wayne/Batman or the Joker. What impressed me about the writing is how Nolan was able to convey, in a very real-world sense, the anxiety and life-questions that a man like Bruce Wayne would have to make as a true, living breathing crime fighting vigilante. There was cause and effect of being such a figure and his impact had more repercussions than he foresaw. The psychological warfare between Batman and the Joker (even Dent) is mostly well-handled and illustrated, adding a nice layer of richness to the film's finished product. However, sometimes Nolan tries to include TOO MUCH, and there's times where scenes are left a bit unfinished or have loose ends, which is too bad, but mostly forgivable. On the flip-side of "real-world" sensibility, one personal disappointment is that the credo of Nolan's Batman about "realism" (technically and physically) is nowhere to be found here. All the care and effort to explain Batman's gadgets, his trials and errors as a rooftop leaping vigilante all are gone. We don't see the time it takes Wayne to develop something of Fox's into his Batsuit or repertoire. In one scene he's shown it, the next he's using it in almost unbelievable scope and fashion. Much of the action demands much more suspension of disbelief (unlike in Begins), and a lot of it plays out like a James Bond film. In fact, this is more or less "Batman 007", which ultimately, isn't such a bad thing since we're talking comic source material here. Nolan makes up for this deviation with purely satisfying Batman fanfare action sequences and capturing our hero at his best. The film is a bit bleak and very dark in tone - Nolan doesn't pull a lot of punches and the result is plenty of moments of grim suspense and anticipation. This is wholly satisfying for many Batman fans, especially the Joker, who is played at his darkest core. I found myself holding my breath with anticipation at a few moments, and Nolan seems to change up the outcomes JUST enough to keep you guessing. I wouldn't recommend this to kids under 12 or so. Not so much gory, as it is intense subject matter and mature themes. I found the performances of all the cast to be top-notch. In fact, the Joker (exceptionally well-played by Ledger) begins the film as a question mark, and ends it just the same, which I think was sort of the angle here. His purpose is more or less to force Batman to question his own limits and reasons for purpose, using madness for this reason above logic, making him Batman's most enigmatic foe. We also get to see the promotion of Jim Gordon to Commissioner, which was anticipated given his lesser badge status in Begins. Oldman steps up his game from Begins, and his role serves as the best view for the audience. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a more watchable Rachel Dawes, but her character is little more than a device here. By the end of the Dark Knight, it's clear her purpose was far better suited in Begins as Bruce's childhood friend. Still, Gyllenhaal is plenty serviceable and doesn't take an ounce away here. Harvey Dent is perhaps, the biggest surprise of the story and I was impressed with Aaron Eckhart's performance. His story is perhaps the greatest arc of the film, although I thought his "point of no return" was a little rushed and hard to believe. Morgan Freeman is back as our new favorite "Q", Lucias Fox, offering up new technology for Batman's disposal...but we also get to see a bit of his role as head of Wayne Corporation and his own personal convictions and responsibilities. In the end, I would qualify the Dark Knight as the the best Batman film to date, going back as far as you want to. I can also say this is quite possibly the best COMIC film to date. But what surprised me, was that this was one of the best CRIME films I've seen in a long time. The Dark Knight offers plenty of bang for your buck.
3.0~The dehumanizing product of a morally stunted culture ShiiStyle Sign in Permalink I know people will hate me for giving this movie 2 stars, but allow me to explain why the rating is deserved. I watched this movie twice and my initial impression of it was confirmed on the second viewing. The tagline of the movie is "Welcome to a world without rules." But even someone who likes the movie must realize this is absurd, because the rules of the film are strictly defined from the start. Batman is PERFECT GOOD, and the Joker is PERFECT EVIL. Whenever it's the cops versus Batman in this movie, we know the cops are wrong and Batman is on the side of good. He's just that good. And the Joker is so evil that he doesn't even have a motive. He's there to create a force of perfect chaos which Batman is duty-bound to fight. To deny that this movie is about terrorism is to deny the well-executed thrill elements such as the videos released to the press and closed-circle moral tests (on the ferries; similar to United 93). These are borrowed directly from the terrorist playbook, and one persistent element, the ticking time-bomb scenario which Batman solves by brutally beating people up until he gets the information he wants, is derived from our fear of terrorism even though ticking time-bombs NEVER happen in real life. When you compare the movie to reality, though, an outrageous discrepancy is made evident. Terrorists are not born psychopaths like the Joker. They are poor, scared people driven to violence only by persistent reinforcement of hatred and duty. That's WHY there are no ticking time-bombs: true psychopaths do not act like the Joker, and terrorists are not true psychopaths. In this movie, the only mistake Batman makes is when he injures himself swerving his motorcycle so that he doesn't kill the Joker. He is just too good to kill his enemy. Three thousand years of storytellers are laughing themselves to tears in Heaven at our image of a hero. Read Shakespeare. Read the Iliad. See if you can figure out for yourself what kind of travesty this is. The areas where this film deviates from standard superhero crap only condemn it further. Batman creates a magical cell phone network, which his buddy says a violation of privacy; the film makes his buddy out to be a spineless coward, because Batman needs his magic to do good. Do you see the problem here? Here it is: Batman doesn't exist in real life. To call this movie the best film of the year, or, as IMDb currently reckons it, the best film of all time, is to admit that we want to believe in a world where good battles evil. It creates a worldview where "good" people will not have to admit their own problems, and "evil" people can be rounded up and beaten half to death without any moral qualms. It is EXACTLY this kind of mentality which has caused the war in Iraq, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo Bay. I award this movie eight stars for execution, but subtract five stars for its incorrect, dehumanizing, and morally stunted outlook on human nature. Thus, it ends up with three stars, which I think is more than generous.
10.0~Seduced by Evil. A Hero's Struggle rnakamur Sign in Permalink This is the first Batman movie that's not about Batman. It's no traditional yarn about a protagonist fighting a villain, with audiences hoping the hero beats the bad guy. On the contrary, it's a thrilling story about the cost of heroism and seduction by evil. Tim Burton explored anti-hero themes with Michelle Pfeiffer's brooding Catwoman in "Batman Returns," and although Burton failed to flesh it out, many people agree Catwoman was the best part of that film. Director Christopher Nolan knows better, having demonstrated a Hitchcockian mastery of psychology with themes of guilt (Insomnia) and competition (The Prestige). In his film, we meet Joker (a chilling Heath Ledger), a sociopath with a taste for anarchy. He doesn't want revenge or power. In one scene, he burns a mountain of cash. The mobsters call him crazy, and before he cuts them to pieces he mutters "It's not about money. It's about sending a message." Right away, we know he isn't a villain we can predict or understand. Consequently, he's pretty terrifying. Ledger's Joker is so compelling that he has the best lines and the most memorable scenes. Usually we watch superhero films to see how the protagonist overcomes the villain. But in "The Dark Knight," we strangely cheer as the Joker kicks ass at robbing banks, manipulating the mob, and even destroying a hospital. Strangely enough, we walk away from the experience not wanting to be Batman. We want to be Joker. But that's not what I mean when I say this movie isn't about Batman. It's actually about DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, whose strong performance will be overshadowed by Ledger's). He is Gotham's White Knight, and his tragedy revolves around an anecdote told early in the film about the Roman who guards his city not out of power lust, but of civic duty-- to which his girlfriend and Assistant DA Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) wisely refutes, "Don't forget, the last man given that duty was named Caesar." Here lies the central theme-- a man holds power until death or long enough to see himself become the villain. It's deep stuff for a Batman movie, but it works extremely well. Many may leave the film wondering why, but it has to do with what we missed from "Star Wars Episode III." Although we're horrified by Joker's mind (whose villainy rivals Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter), we can't help but be strangely drawn to his eerie confidence, manic charisma and unstoppable power. Due to some grueling and unexpected events, Dent falls from grace and becomes seduced by Joker's evil. Let's not forget Batman, who is common-denominator (but not centerpiece) to the war between Dent and Joker. Dent proclaims Batman as Gotham's hero, but others don't agree-- including Bruce Wayne. Wayne is still a jealous, self-absorbed, and emotionally tortured brat in many ways, as we learned from "Batman Begins." He doesn't see himself as a hero. And although he despises Dent for stealing Rachel away from him, he deeply admires him. Here we draw the dichotomy of "White Knight" (Dent) and "Dark Knight" (Batman). Bruce Wayne knows that he can't have Rachel unless he gives up Batman forever. But there's a pain within him that keeps him out at night fighting his personal demons. He loves Rachel, the same way Dent loves Rachel, but he won't give up being Batman. Bruce Wayne is not a noble, self-sacrificing hero. He has his cake and wants to eat it too. Equally, Dent wants to fight a hard line with crime. He's incorruptible, unwilling to compromise, doing it for principles of righteousness rather than personal glory. He, too, refuses to be a hero. But unlike Batman, he is self-sacrificing, fighting in broad daylight in full vulnerability, even if it puts him and his loved ones at risk. Don't worry-- Nolan never lets this character drama drag the story. The movie is wall-to-wall action, with sensational stunt sequences that exceed any prior Batman film, primarily because it uses very few digital effects. It's got a gritty, organic feel of urban combat, like Michael Mann's "Heat" which brought us into a downtown LA war-zone where gunshots echo off the walls of buildings. As we witness a chase between an 18-wheeler and a SWAT truck, we know it's actually happening. Many filmmakers neglect what Steven Spielberg calls "geography," and consequent quick-cutting and stylistic shots make the viewer lose their sense of setting. But Nolan keeps things very real, using helicopter shots and wide-angle lenses the way he did with prior films that depended on atmosphere (Insomnia, The Prestige). Most people familiar with the comics know that Dent becomes the villain Two-Face. But Nolan makes a statement with Dent's transformation to evil. Harvey Dent succumbs to crime because his life has endured tragedy, and everything he's stood for has fallen to pieces. Meanwhile, Joker isn't so much a villain as a sardonic force of nature, reminiscent of Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh in "No Country for Old Men." For most of the movie, Batman merely assists Dent in his war on evil. But in the end, Batman takes the fall for Two-Face's crimes, allowing Dent's legacy to live on. In this, he truly becomes "The Dark Knight," because he allows the White Knight to triumph. Even though evil has apparently won the battle, Batman refuses to allow evil to win the war. I think many people write off superhero movies assuming they don't hold literary merit-- this was the case with Burton's zany Batman and Joel Schumacher's cartoon-like Batman. I hope "The Dark Knight" proves that such a belief is untrue. Check out the original comics or the animated series and you'll see there's a lot more being said with these characters. The Joker is not funny, like Jack Nicholson or Cesar Romero. He's scary. He's scarier because he doesn't take the world seriously. Fortunately, the film takes itself seriously, and it's one of the best in recent years.
9.0~this batman trilogy needs to get it together jg-gryphon Sign in Permalink I love Batman, and I bet a lot of people do. What was great about the film.....nothing. When I saw Batman Begins I was like OK thet was waste of money and time. TDK was no different performances sucked the costumes WTH. this movie was crap Christopher Nolan great director just stay out of the batman franchise. So here is a list of things that should be fixed. Batman Christian Bale sucks get a new batman i'm just not seeing it with him. Get someone else to play him. He's a terrible actor in it. He looks like someone dressing up as batman not the real batman. He makes Bruce look like an idiot. Racheal They killed her off for no freaking reason. There was obviously something going between her and Bruce why not use it instead of having her blown to bits. Harvey They should have saved this character for last there was no purpose in putting him in this film. Aaron Eackheart needs to review his acting skills before making a movie of complete bull. Too adultish What's next D.A.'s in Scooby Doo. The movie is just some stupid crime drama. Hopefully he'll fix this trilogy not making it a bunch of stupidness.
10.0~The Dark Knight Zarathustraz11 Sign in Permalink Yeah the movie may be really long but people who thought Batman Begins was good will love this movie. See batman begins set up the plot and past history about Bruce Wayne. This film has action, suspense throughout. You have no clue whats going to happen next to any of the characters and thats the rush. Also Heath Ledger brings some maniacal comedy into the film seeing a whole dark shade of the joker. One of the best films of the 2008 I loved every minute of it, its like a roller coaster ride that you don't want to end. If you love Batman and has a need to see some carnage rent it or buy it. Its a great movie and i think heath ledger should win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
6.0~Overrated colm-hearne365 Sign in Permalink I don't know if I'm part of a minority who found The Dark Knight be a big disappointment but I don't really care. I mean I've always been a big Batman fan and I love Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises but The Dark Knight just didn't work for me even though it's often considered one of the greatest superhero movies ever. But I think people are giving it FAR too much credit. I mean IMDb users put it higher than such classics as The Lord of the Rings, Psycho, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Rear Window and many more on the Top 250 list. That's just going too far! Okay, I'll admit that there are some really good things about the film such as Heath Ledger's performance. Of course, everyone thinks he was the best Joker. I mean before I saw The Dark Knight, I had never even heard of him, I didn't even know he had died even though he was a rising star with such films as Brokeback Mountain and I'm Not There. But I have to say he totally deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor even though some people make controversy about it. And the action scenes are really good too. But what I really don't like about this movie is that the plot isn't very subtle or coherent. I found some parts confusing and I'm surprised how overlooked the plot holes are. Also I was disappointed with Two- Face. I mean he wasn't in it for very long and it felt like he didn't really add anything to the story. He was just angry that his girlfriend Rachel died, he wasn't really suffering a mental illness, he just wanted to get revenge. Also I never liked Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel because she was weak and ugly and I think she didn't really fit the role. I preferred Katie Holmes. Also I think the film focused more on the Joker than Batman even though Ledger's Joker was excellent. But Batman is the main character. Maybe one of the reasons why this film gets so much hype and praise is because it was one of Heath Ledger's last films and they're being generous to it or he's the main reason why everyone loves it. But I personally think this film is very over-hyped and overrated. But even though I'm a huge Batman fan, I'll just stick to watching Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns and Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises.
5.0~The Dark Truth bexandbarn Sign in Permalink What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth.
10.0~A masterpiece in every sense! RagDolly Sign in Permalink A thrilling, action-packed, visually stunning movie that had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish! Hands down, the very best of 2008! It's impossible to imagine a more perfect film! Christopher Nolan delivers the prime example of what happens when so many perfect things come together to make a work of art! A brilliant, exciting storyline matched with an intelligent, witty yet deliciously dark script, makes the foundation for this incredible production. The look of the film, costumes, make-up, sets, locations all fit the atmosphere and make the Gotham City that this film requires. And now the big one... The actors make this film as mesmerising as it is! Not a single one of them can be faulted! Christian Bale is an amazing Batman and a great Bruce Wayne. He handled the change in his character really well! Gary Oldman is awesome as Gordon, Michael Caine is the perfect Alfred and all those gangsters are brilliant! Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel very well and Aaron Eckhart is simply incredible! He plays Harvey Dent, Gotham's white knight with charm but also vulnerability and then makes an almost too believable transition into Two-Face! But the best of the best, Heath Ledger, of course! His portrayal of the joker is legendary! Such a change from his other, also great, roles, but just as real! You know that you're a convincing villain when you can make 30 year olds hide behind their jumpers! I could ramble on forever about this truly incredible film but, really, if you want to know what The Dark Knight is like, go and see it! It won't let you down! Promise!
10.0~The Best Batman Movie dpowers2 Sign in Permalink I saw this film last night (opening day) and I stood in line for an hour to get a ticket and a half hour to get into the theatre and I was not sorry about the wait. The Dark Knight is amazingly written, produced, and acted. I don't know if I agree with the rumor that Heath Ledger could be up for an Oscar nomination because of his creepy and awesome performance as The Joker, but he is definitely great as the psychotic clown. Aaron Eckhart is also a scene stealer as tough and fearless District Attorney, Harvey Dent. The effects are what make this movie. It is truly eye-opening material. The story holds you the entire time with twist after twist. The film is a little too long in my opinion, but it still held my attention. The Dark Knight is worth the wait and is worth seeing. I predict definite Oscar nominations for Effects, Score, Make-up, Editing, and Cinematography for this thrill ride into Gotham City that no other Batman film has matched.
7.0~good, but not the movie of the year (and certainly not of all time) cookie88 Sign in Permalink I went to see the Dark Knight last night and it was exactly as good as I thought it would be. But it certainly isn't the masterpiece you'd think it is after reading most of the reviews on IMDb. Sure, Heath Ledger is brilliant as the Joker. And yes, for a movie that lasts two hours and a half, it's extremely entertaining (especially considering the fact I usually avoid blockbusters like the plague). It really got me hooked. But that's it. To me, some characters just weren't that well thought out. Harvey Dent and Rachel in particular that is. Did anyone believe for a second that there was this 'true love' happening between them? The woman was obviously just thinking: so Batman still doesn't have any time for me, I'll just stick with this bloke, who, for some crazy reason (since I'm obviously not that beautiful plus very annoying), seems to be crazy about me. So yeah, Rachel was a huge let-down. Another thing I really didn't like, is the fact that they were showing Dents face all the time after he came out of the hospital. Suggestion is so much more effective. But hey, Batman and the Joker definitely made the movie worthwhile! With the right casting, the next Batmanmovie by Nolan should be a real classic.
2.0~Boring, pretentious and far from the Batman comic book Flaviaj1991 Sign in Permalink As a fan of Batman, this is undoubtedly the most unpopular opinion of my entire life. But I cannot stand this movie. For me this is the most pretentious and overrated movie in the history of cinema. Heath Ledger's Joker was charismatic, but taking it away ... What do we have? We have a movie that makes Batman a mere supporting character in his own film. A Batman with no balls and no detective soul. Confused, messy, uninspired fights. Boring, lifeless, uninspired scenarios. A Gotham turned into some another generic and commom American city. An overly dramatic, heavy, humorless and violent tone. Batman is usually dark, yes, but one thing is to be dark, another is to want to sound like a play by Shakespeare. TDK takes itself very seriously and this sucks. Oh for God's sake, at the end we are talking just about a guy who dresses in bat and walks around town for fighting crime. It doesn't have to be complicated, it doesn't have to be too complex, it doesn't have to be very philosophical. I just want to look at the movie and think, "This is a Super-Hero movie!" Exactly the same feeling that Spiderman 1, 2 and Burton movies always makes me feel every time I watch. The Dark Knight is not a genuine Super-Hero movie. It's simply a police story that happens in a generic city by chance called Gotham where by chance Batman and the Joker are inserted, with Batman being only a supporting character.
10.0~The dawn of the Comic Villain TheJoker-JB Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight was and still is nothing short of a masterpiece and a mind bending acting demonstration. The plot, special effects, acting, choreography, and the ability to entice a viewer into the movie itself, puts it in it's own category of genius. Heath Ledger is THE MOVIE. A perfect example of an actor who put on his best final performance, never coming out of character and before you know it; is dead. The Box Office original I saw 5 times. It was not that he died before the movie blew the box office up that made it do unique to me. Lots of people watched only because the actor was dead. That simple minded persona of the character was routed by him winning an Oscar and not being there to even accept it. Christian Bale did a great job, although I will state that the difference in his voice as Bruce Wayne and Batman was a little bit too dramatic. It is a comic movie though, so that makes it a minor mostly unnoticed issue. The greater picture is that The Joker came forth as not just someone who was funny, but pure evil, making the movie more realistic than its predecessor. This is not to take away from Jack Nicholson, as his resume' needs no drawn illustration, since he was the leading actor in only two movies to sweep every category of the Academy Awards ( The second being, The Silence of the Lambs ). Words cannot reiterate the acting that shook the world in The Dark Knight.
7.0~Highly overrated, but Heath saves it. gamer-9 Sign in Permalink "The Dark Knight" is the most anticipated movie of the summer, partly because it's Nolan's follow-up to the fiercely adored "Batman Begins" and partly because it features Heath Ledger's last performance, as the Joker. That makes one good reason to see it. As much as I disliked "Batman Begins," finding myself not just unmoved but bored by its alleged darkness and moral complexity, I concede that it was at least a real movie, with a thought-out structure, a reasonable degree of character development and, most significant, an adherence to visual logic that was at least workmanlike. "The Dark Knight" offers the same degree of murkiness, both visually and thematically, and maybe even a little more. And Nolan gives us enough multilayered subplots to at least fool us into thinking this is a work of intellectual and moral complexity. But as a piece of visual storytelling, from shot to shot, "The Dark Knight" is a mess. Characters disappear from one locale and show up inexplicably in another, thanks to the magic of editing. At one point, we learn two characters have been abducted, but Nolan doesn't bother to show us who did it or how. (Later, he explains the "who did it" with dialogue -- the lazy way.) At the end, a major character is left hanging, literally, as we are figuratively. If this is genius, give me hackery But "The Dark Knight" looks as if it were made from a messy blackboard diagram with lots of circles, heavily underlined phrases ("Duality! Good vs. evil -- in the same person! Kinship between hero and villain!") and crisscrossing arrows that ultimately point to nothing. With "Batman Begins," Nolan assured his audience that he understood that the characters originally created by Bob Kane -- and further developed by the likes of Frank Miller -- were rich, fascinating ones, and they are: It shouldn't be hard to write good stories around them. But what the Nolans have come up with here is just more pretentious poot, dumped onto the screen in a style that pretends to be fresh and energetic but is really only semicoherent. This time, Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne finds himself involved in a romantic rivalry with the handsome and extremely principled Gotham D.A., Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who has taken up with Batman's onetime love, assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes. Katie Holmes, who played Dawes in "Batman Begins," has used her newly found Scientologist shape-shifting capabilities to morph into Maggie Gyllenhaal, and the effect is pleasing: Gyllenhaal's Dawes is a tough cookie in a Stanwyck-style bias-cut gown, and the movie feels smarter and more supple when she's on-screen. Many of the characters from the first movie return here, busying themselves in this or that corner of the plot with little or no consequence: Morgan Freeman is back as the tweedy genius Lucius Fox; Michael Caine, as Alfred, miraculously gives the movie's overserious dialogue some genuine dramatic heft; and Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon (he's not yet commissioner), so terrific in "Batman Begins," seems lost here -- in one scene, his enunciation was so bad I wondered if he wasn't just trying to underplay the movie's self-important dialogue. (That dialogue includes choice pseudo-topical sound bites like "Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. Some men just want to watch the world burn.") Nolan moves his characters around the screen, in jagged diagonals and crazy swoops, in an attempt to explore the dark side of human nature. We get robber-clowns in scary masks, Batman look-alikes committing evil deeds, troupes of urban villains that come in all colors and sizes. A lot of stuff is blown up. The violence is swift and brutal -- including a pretty nasty trick involving a pencil -- although Nolan tastefully (and wisely) cuts away sharply at the crucial moments. There's an assortment of perspective shots that create the illusion we're looking -- or falling -- down from the top of some extremely tall buildings. To encourage thoughtful beard stroking among his audience, Nolan throws in a "Lifeboat"-style (Who should die first? Me or the other guy?) plot device. There's no dramatic arc in "The Dark Knight" -- only a series of speed bumps. The moments in the movie that should be the most dramatic are glanced over so quickly that we barely have time to register what has happened. I'm not sure the actors know what's going on, either. Bale was a tolerable Batman the first time around, even though he ultimately failed to dissolve the distance between us and that mask. Here, he tries to build on that earlier performance. In "The Dark Knight," Batman is misunderstood and mistrusted by the people of Gotham, who see him as a vigilante and not a hero who strives to protect them. Bale is slightly better as Bruce Wayne -- he's such a good actor that he's capable of conveying the deepest anguish in a single, flashing blink. But his Batman, lumbering through the movie in a suit that's supposed to be lighter than previous incarnations, is a flat, dull creature, with no new tricks up his gauntlets: Playing this moody superhero, Bale has run out of shades of gray to work with. Ledger's performance is unsettling and difficult to watch, partly because it's impossible to remove it from the context of his death. But it's a fine performance regardless, and I wish the movie around it were more deserving. "The Dark Knight" may be somebody's idea of a masterpiece, but I doubt it would be Hitchcock's. Nolan may want us to believe in the darkness that lurks within each of us, but instead of leading us to it visually, he chops it up and sets it out in front of us, a grim, predigested banquet. The difference between Nolan and his idol is that Hitchcock demanded that we trust ourselves; Nolan demands that we trust only him.
7.0~good but overrated krzysiektom Sign in Permalink I wanted to love this film. I hoped it would live up to the hype. I feel it does not. It is a solid film, ambitious and serious. Maybe too serious. Most of it are chaotic chases and fights or serious, somber talk about politics and commitment. Almost entire film is in the urban dark surroundings, literally dark, which is a lot to take in a very long movie. And too much Republican agenda for my liking, characters say it has to be worse before it gets better, u should endure a period of unpopularity, u stand for more important things than the public image, there are guys who do not follow logic, they just want to see the world burn, vigilantism is a price of freedom etc. One might think this Batman is, ehm, George W., Joker is Bin Laden and Gotham is America. Too much in a film about a guy in a plastic suit with two protruding ears who can fly, chasing a megalomaniac made up like a clown. A maniac that defies realism too, being able to be in many places at will, move around secretly tons of explosives etc. For a movie that takes itself that serious the transition of Dent into TwoFace is simplistic and shallow. Of course he fails to shoot the little blond boy because Batman intervenes at the last moment. It was a scene like from Peter Pan movie. And Batman has to beat Joker up to get the whereabouts of kidnapped Dent and his girlfriend but on two other occasions he knows where Dent is, just to intervene in time. For me the music was the only stand out, on its own keeping the adrenaline up.
5.0~Mediocre Cosmoeticadotcom Sign in Permalink Yawn. A few years ago, despite repeated critical praise and entreaties from friends and colleagues, I gave up on ever wasting my precious time on earth watching another Steven Spielberg film. Time and again I was told, by others, 'No, this time I really mean it, it's a GREAT film,' and time and again I would leave the theater angry or nauseous. But, now I am at the point where I feel the same way about ALL Hollywood tripe. As with the Spielberg crapfests, I was told how wonderful excrement like Brokeback Mountain and Crash were. They weren't. Similarly, almost all the reviews of The Dark Knight were glowing; especially praising the performance of Heath Ledger (the cock-mumbling hero of Brokeback Mountain) as the Joker. And with his demise shortly before last year's premiere of the film, the inevitable chorus of Oscar buzz for his performance rose, with him, indeed, snagging a posthumous Best Supporting Actor nomination and win (ala James Dean). So, was this the greatest film of all time? Was Ledger's performance one for the ages? No. In fact, not even close. And, as badly hyped as the Spielberg stool has been, and as nauseating as the PC films named above were, The Dark Knight, and Ledger's performance, have to be the two most over the top unbelievably hyper-hyped things Hollywood has ever unfurled. Why? Simple. The picture barely rises above mediocre, and Ledger is nowhere near as good a Joker as Jack Nicholson was, twenty years ago, in Tim Burton's Batman. The Dark Knight simply goes on for far too long- 153 minutes- and gets worse with each passing minute. It goes from a possibly good film, in its first hour, to a barely passable one in the span of the last hour or so. A good 45 minutes could have been lopped off with no discernible detraction from the film. In ten years, few people will care about this film, and Ledger's Oscar win will go down as one of those great WTF? questions wiser generations will chuckle over. The Dark Knight is not good comic book stuff, it's not good sci fi, it's not a good action film. It's just hype. Yawn. (the sequel)
1.0~Really bad movie disguised (and not very well!) as a good one! hnt_dnl Sign in Permalink THE DARK KNIGHT is ALL hype and no substance! I've seen it 3 times and it is just plain awful. Basically, it is too long and convoluted as all get out. It felt 4 hours long to me the first time I saw it...no kidding! I guess the confusing part is worse than the long part. If a film flows smoothly for its run, length ought not be an issue, but TDK is utterly messy and confusing for it's running time. So Nolan wants a REALISTIC version of BATMAN? Then explain SOME things to us! The big one is HOW DOES JOKER SET ALL THIS STUFF UP? At least BATMAN BEGINS was grounded in realism, explained motivations, techniques, and plans, and had a aura of realism. After BB was over, I remember thinking I LIKED THIS MOVIE! Although I'm a Burton Batman fan, I admit that Nolan did a very good job with BB; it feasibly defined a realistic Batman world while still embodying a sense of fun and had a lot of entertainment value. And the plot made sense! But after TDK was over, my impression was WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? Some points about why TDK is a weak film to me: *Harvey Dent swallows all that gasoline and isn't even sick enough to hurl! He is badly burned, but his rage and need for vengeance dulls his pain and he easily walks around and does not scare the Bejesus out of anyone? NO ONE is shocked by the way he looks! Seriously, Nolan? *Gordon and Batman decide that Dent/TwoFace will be a hero and no one will know that he killed 5 people. EXCEPT for them, Gordon's family, and that bad cop Ramirez! I'm sure they will ALL keep it a secret...Plothole! *Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes not attractive! Katie Holmes from BB wasn't jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but she WAS fairly easy on the eyes! And Holmes worked much better in this role in BB, had a LOT more chemistry with Bale, and had an important function to the story. When Joker says that she (Gyllenhall's Rachel) is a beautiful woman, I was like, NO SHE'S NOT! Gyllenhaal is perhaps a better actress than Holmes, but Holmes was actually much more right for the role of Rachel Dawes. Gyllenhaal literally has nothing to do and just doesn't cut it in TDK. *Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman, who just exists in this film, nothing else) has the ability to do ANYTHING technological? This includes constructing a sonar device that can scan all 30 million cell phones in Gotham City simultaneously. Or did Bruce Wayne in his very limited technological training and experience do it? Either way...OK. Yeah. Right. Whatever. In BB, the stuff Fox was selling Wayne at least seemed plausible. In TDK, it comes off as just plain absurd technobabble! *Batman and Joker get the crap beat out of them repeatedly, chewed up by dogs, fall from multiple story buildings and don't even get hurt. When Batman saved Rachel, they fell from the penthouse of a CHICAGO high-rise for cripe's sake. That must have been 100 stories easy! No bones broken, no trauma, just ho-hum, back to business. *That climactic ferry boat scene is pure de Hollywood manipulation! It is there solely to reel the viewer in to make it seem like TDK is some kind of original, provocative piece. Instead, it comes across as sappy, maudlin, and empty. The ending to that scene is soooooo predictable! *In general, though, TDK is choppily edited, is populated with one-dimensional, lifeless characters, is humorless, convoluted as heck, has dull dialogue, and is VERY cliché. I mean, it's barely even a DECENT movie! Christian Bale was great in BB, but in TDK, Nolan's hack direction and the script really let him down, making him look like a laughingstock as a hero. He was barely even in TDK and when he was in it, you didn't get any feel for the character so well-established in BB. What makes Bruce Wayne/Batman tick? What does he really want? Just based on one dinner where Dent spouts about being a crusader, Wayne thinks that he's THE ONE, the savior of Gotham City? Not very deep character development. In addition to Freeman, you have Michael Caine as Wayne's butler/accomplice Alfred, Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, all giving rather lifeless performances. Ironically, I think Eckhart has the biggest male role in the film, but unfortunately Dent is not very accessible and rather empty to the viewer. Really, Bale shares lead honors with Oldman, Eckhart, and Ledger; actually, Oldman and Eckhart may have bigger roles in this than Bale and Ledger! Who wants a Batman flick where neither Batman (the main hero) nor the Joker (the main villain) have the biggest role? These skilled actors are unfortunately operating from a vapid script and extremely short-sighted character development. Tim Burton's surrealistic, neo-noir, skewed, artsy, comic book BATMAN flicks (BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS) are truly the best Batman movies. We accept at face value those films because Burton's unique vision not only strived for something different for a superhero movie, but also succeeded in a way that Nolan's films just cannot. Batman the bad guy who is hated by the entire city of Gotham?!. No way, not in superhero world, not acceptable! And I don't care what these nouveau moviegoers so enthralled with this film think!
1.0~Complete waste of time shamboo Sign in Permalink Shooting, killing, shooting more killing some effect by batman doing his stuff. the Characters in the movie does not grow like at batman begin which was awesome, every thing looks the same boring junk movie, no surprises I really don't understand how this movie got this high review score. Nothing exceptional, nothing interesting nothing funny, nothing spacial, just a really boring movie. HAfte 1.5 hours we decided to leave the theater, which actually happened to me only once before. This movie sucks big time. Do not waste your money and your time. If you are a movie maker and you don't have new ideas for sequels please do not waste money, and our time on stupid movies. I rarely go out of movies in the middle, this really really don't happen to me - and I did saw all the fantasy/ Batman,Spiderman, Action Heroes movies ...
2.0~Did I see a different film than most of you? Zaffy-1 Sign in Permalink I watched it yesterday. I came here to read user comments and I was :O, No 3 movie of all times? If it wasn't 3 hours LONG I would go and re-watch it just to see what did I miss that most of you loved so much. I honestly fail to see what all this hype-hysteria is about.. First of all I think the film is way too long than it should be and got to be repetitive after one point. I mean how many times you need to see Joker doing the same things to understand that he is a very intelligent maniac/schizo/sociopath/whatever and can trick and manipulate everyone? Yes we got it, Joker is a schizophrenic genius or whatever, like Ledger's irritating acting wasn't enough. Oh yes, there are many horribly given Oscars out there you will soon can add one more for Heath for probably the worst performance of his career. If that wonderful and extremely talented actor was still alive he wouldn't even get an nomination. Except if you think that talking like crazy and overusing your tongue tick to show you are unstable is a first class acting. I thought Jack Nickolson typecasts but his Joker was a masterpiece comparing to Ledger's. Its really unfortunate that for this caricature acting he will be remembered and honored. The only performance worth of mentioning was Gary Oldman's. As for the rest of the movie, directing was first class, art direction not bad, cinematography was OK, the music was good, the script was.. ...What was the script about again? OK its a comic so that could justify the numerous plot holes (I can't even imagine how Joker with the help of mentally ill people can trap a whole city like this, not to mention the ridiculous two-face unreal makeup to name a few..). What else the script was about? That you can only beat chaotic terrorists by bending human rights (the mobiles sonar system) but its OK if you only do it once? hmmm dangerous! That good in people always beats evil? yeah! that! it 's like ethics for dummies...but maybe this is what young people need now-days, basic ethics and values teached by a rather boring Hollywood Movie. Which now makes me understand why it is rated so high.. doh.. hmmm dangerous.. learning values from Hollywood...
9.0~Falls short of greatness aSinnerMan7 Sign in Permalink I finally watched it this evening and i have to say i was thoroughly entertained. no question about it. However, The Dark Knight falls short of greatness for several reasons. But if anything about the movie is great, then it has to be Heath Ledger's performance as the joker. I think he is the reason why some people are (wrongly) jumping on the bandwagon to label TDK as the greatest movie of all time. At best it might be the greatest superhero movie ever made but i wont pass any judgment on that particular point. I give this movie a 7 and that is mostly because of the entertainment it provided and ledger's joker. I can't possibly give it more than a 7 after seeing how unconvincing the Harvey Dent/Two-face character became towards the end. His transformation is hardly given enough time and as a result is totally unconvincing. As far as i can remember, it was not foreshadowed either, nor did his actions later on make any sense (e.g. why would he let Joker go free but decide to kill Maroni (the mob leader)? because according to Two-face, "the Joker is just a mad dog. I want whoever let him off the leash." lmao! give me a break!) Okay next up is the ferry subplot or whatever you might wanna call it. I've seen some people branding it as "useless". I beg to differ. I think the subplot/scene had great potential, only if the director/scriptwriter chose NOT to resort to the typical "good overcomes evil" thing which is prevalent in Hollywood and i guess in Disney and superhero movies in particular. First of all, although none of the ferries blew each other up, the point that the Joker was trying to prove was well-proved (at least to the audience). Because, think about it. The ferry voted and as much 400 people were FOR blowing the other ferry up while ONLY 150 people were against it. however, when it came to actually press the button of the detonator, nobody had the guts to do it. Fair enough, but how in the world does that prove the Joker wrong? If anything, it proves that not only "deep down, everyone is as ugly as him", but they are cowards also! Therefore, to pass it off as some kind of a "good vs evil" thing where good wins the day is a futile attempt. And last but not least, the idea of all of Gotham's notorious thugs and criminals suddenly becoming moral beings with no intention of survival was laughable. You see, this is where the Joker should have had his "moral" victory over Batman. The people in the ferries should have killed each other. And in that way, some kind of a balance would have been established and The Dark Knight would have truly become a "dark" film, because as we know, in the end Batman does not let the Joker win by taking all the blame on himself. And that brings me to the next point. The ending was forced and didn't make much sense. So the highly principled DA of Gotham goes nuts after his fiancé's death and after losing half his face and then, ACTUALLY KILLED a mob leader and corrupt cops? And Batman takes the blame for this? lol WHY ON EARTH would people hate Batman for killing a mob leader and corrupt cops? Again, makes no sense. So these are the few things that bugs me most and I'm not even gonna start with the pretty poor script with its flaws and stretches (which are quite a lot even for a superhero movie). As for the entertainment value, yes i was entertained as I've said before but i have to say that i found the action sequences to be very ordinary. I think at the end of the day, it is Heath Ledger who makes it a (slightly) better movie than Batman Begins. I can't say Christian Bale gave a good performance because frankly, he didn't have much to do! But it's a shame that we won't be seeing Heath Ledger in a Joker makeup again. It breaks my heart. If I give this movie a 7 out of 10, I would have to give Ledger a solid 10. I hope he at least gets an Oscar nomination.
10.0~One of the best movies ever made! emotionalcripple Sign in Permalink WOW!! I honestly do not know what else to say except wow. Usually "superhero" kind of movies do not really impress me, but this one is incredible! Wow wow wow wow! Anyone who loves good directing, good story lines, incredible acting, great art and absolute awesomeness will really really really love this movie. It's going to be one of those movies that I will not forget for a very very long time. I was not so thrilled to watch the movie at first because I was very sad and shocked about what happened to Heath Ledger. But a few years later, I was bored and decided to just A movie. I stumbled upon The Dark Knight and decided to try and watch the first half and if I didn't like, I'll just look for another movie to watch. Well, the movie was amazing that I was was hocked from the first few minutes. I was watching intently the whole time. R.I.P to the amazing Heath Ledger. What an incredible and an unforgettable performance, you will be badly missed! If you haven't watched this masterpiece, then I recommend you do.
1.0~This was not a good film. ha55an Sign in Permalink As a guy who loves the Batman Character and used to own a chain of comics stores in the late 80's through the 90's I found the new Batman film to be abominable. The handling of the Batman character was the worst I have ever seen, and I say that being someone who hates all of the other Batman Movies (with the exception of Batman Begins). It was a classic modern tearing down of an iconoclastic hero that was less realistic than it's printed counterpart. The Batman character would never consider revealing his identity to appease the Joker, because he understands that you cannot appease pure evil. He would instead redouble his efforts to find the Joker, not eating or sleeping until he did. The Batman of the comics is a detective who uses classical detecting techniques, coupled with a healthy dose of bruised knuckles as he harasses the underworld to find his query. In other words he uses no shortcuts he works hard. Hollywood used the opportunity to make a political statement, having Batman build a machine that taps into every cell phone in Gotham City, allowing for the altruistic Lucius Foxx character to opine about this act of immorality. A none to subtle swipe at the Bush administration. Then you have Harvey Dent (Two Face) who as the DA of Gotham, is described by Batman as "the best of us all" killing two dirty cops, and to save the fragile collective psyche of Gotham City, Batman takes the blame for the deaths of the cops. Why it would not make more since to simply reveal to the public that Harvey Dent went Coo Coo after the death of the women he loved, as a result of another act of murder perpetrated by the Joker, with the help of the aforementioned dirty cops and the trauma of being disfigured, is beyond me. Save that it fits into the paradigm of liberal thought that the people are to be protected from the grim reality of the world. Better to tear down the real hero of the saga and have him chased by the police. Keep in mind that the film establishes that the villains of Gotham know from experience that Batman will not cross the line and kill the worst of them. but we are supposed to believe that the public of Gotham will swallow that Batman would kill two innocent cops. WOW! Batman is a character who is truly good, and he has been tarnished by this film. In a world where Superman in his last film was reduced to a peeping tom hero with a babies mama. Psychopaths like Marvels Wolverine and the Punisher are hailed as modern heroes. A world where so many young people leave the theater declaring how cool Heath Ledger is as the Joker and not how scary the character is, I find that world tragic. As one of our old comic shop patrons used to say: "Give me the days when a hero had a letter on his chest, a magic word, a cape and a pet or side kick. A hero that fought the bad guys because he was good and they were bad and they needed their a$$e$ kicked. Let justice be done.
8.0~Noisy action ,thrills, chills and dazzling production design ma-cortes Sign in Permalink Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman). This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character. A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average.
3.0~Weird, sadistic, no redeeming value, really ericjg623 Sign in Permalink The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch "The Godfather". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book. That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story. Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from "Goodfellas" or Luca Brasi from "The Godfather". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon. 3/10
10.0~Why did the movie have to end? leopisces Sign in Permalink I caught this film at an evening show and left the theater so excited I had trouble sleeping. From the very first scene I was captivated. The movie itself had a long running time, but I could not get enough. There were times that I thought the movie was going to end, but was treated with a little "but wait... there's more". In short, this was one of the best films I have ever had the fortune of watching. In terms of acting, I was pleased to see Maggie Gyllenhaal in the role of Rachel Dawes. I felt more of a connection to the character than I had in the previous film. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman re-prised their previous roles and, as always, delivered wonderful performances. Christian Bale delivered what was to be expected of him, and I was glad to not be let down in this sequel. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face was surprisingly a really strong fit. He played both sides of the coin well, and I found myself empathetic to his situation as both the hero and the villain. All others aside, Heath Ledger completely stole the show. My expectations were not only met, they were left in the rear view. I found him likable, disgusting, evil, insane, and so many other adjectives I think I need a dictionary and a couple of hours to look up every word that applies. After his performance, I can't imagine anybody else ever playing this character again. This was a "Batman" movie and it felt as such. Batman Begins was Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. In this film it's Batman with a little Bruce Wayne sprinkled here and there. It came, we saw, it conquered. I will be going back to the theater to see this movie again. In conclusion I can only really say great job to all involved in making this film, and someone please give Heath the Oscar!
10.0~Very, Very, Very Good! g-bodyl Sign in Permalink This is the best movie of 2008 and possibly the best movie I have ever seen. This movie rivals the third Lord of the Rings movie for my favorite motion picture. After you see this, you will never view Batman in the same way even if you hate Batman. The new villain in this movie is no other than what Jack Nicholson played in the original Batman, the Joker. The only words to describe the Joker and the late Heath Ledger's performance is: shockingly amazing. If you do not feel anything like the chills when the Joker is on the screen, I regret to inform you that you must have something wrong. The Joker is not the normal, ruthless evil guy. He is much more than that. The other actors did a fine job in their respective parts: Christian Bale as Batman, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel( a good improvement over Katie Holmes), Gary Oldman as Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face/Harvey Dent. The overall tone of the movie is way darker that Batman Begins. There is more action and even some humor(from the Joker.) The car chases are great, too. The music is appropriate for the tone. The score by Zimmer and Newton-Howard is deeper, darker than what you would expect. If this movie could win one Oscar, the award should go to Heath Ledger as Best Supporting Actor. We'll see what happens in February. Overall, this is a fantastic film that is more violent that Batman Begins. I rate this movie 10/10, should be 100/10.
10.0~Devastatingly beautiful fishbon_bg Sign in Permalink I just came home after the projection, and I remain mesmerized. If you're like me and go to the movies only once a month or less, make sure you don't miss out on The Dark Knight. I'm sure you've heard all the praise about it. Well, it's true. It has the carefully crafted dark atmosphere of Batman Begins, but Nolan takes it up a notch, so that it really hits you hard. It has the commanding performances of Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, and Aaron Eckhart. It is also Heath Ledger's swan song, which is more like an oratorio. While I hadn't seen much of his previous work (surely an omission on my part), his Joker took me in completely. Whether he was wielding a gun or wearing a nurse's uniform, his presence was infectious and menacing. His masterful portrayal of the agent of pure chaos, combined with the really heavy topics the film tackles (love, loss, justice, revenge), leaves a deep imprint in the mind of the beholder. The technical side of it - camera work, make-up, costumes, SFX - is immaculate, particularly because it does not get in the way of the characters for a single second. Batman has always been my favorite superhero. I am grateful to Christopher Nolan for reinventing him so skillfully and making him so human and so tangible. He has assembled a wonderful cast of endlessly talented actors and crewmen, and I look forward to his next title. Although, surely, The Dark Knight will be hard to beat.
10.0~Legendary Ledger..!! da_ledgeaun Sign in Permalink Truly a movie that must be seen by all..I am a Batman fan,my favorite superhero,and Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knight,he did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knight,he confirmed it..But to me,i really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledger's breathtaking performance here,i mean how can you not be blown away.?!I'm sorry to Jack Nicholson,he was still incredible in the original but Ledger,WOW..I have always been a fan of Ledger,seen pretty much all of his movies,and with this performance as The Joker,he needs to receive some kind of award,because (RIP) had he been alive,i can guarantee,he will be wanted by all movie directors/studios to be a star of their movies..So,I bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger/ The Joker..
1.0~Senseless Evil John K.-2 Sign in Permalink This comment is labelled as containing spoilers. In fact, it describes no actual events from the film, but it does talk about underlying themes, and it refers to 3 lines of dialogue. Read on if you wish. Batman has a new enemy - the Joker - and a new potential ally, Harvey Dent, the new up-and-coming District Attorney. The film quickly develops into a study of good versus evil. We discover the Joker's motivation for the evil that he does ... he has no apparent ultimate aim, he simply enjoys being evil. The sheer senselessness of his acts makes him unpredictable. As the film unfolds, the forces of good appear powerless; whatever they do, there is a greater evil, a more twisted motivation that they are unintentionally feeding. The film's title is, in fact, a triple pun ... it is metaphorically a "dark night" for the city, and much of the significant action takes place in a single night. By the end, we are asked to consider whether good or evil are simply a matter of luck, and whether truth as well as law are an inconvenience to doing good. The film is therefore thoroughly postmodern. It could be described as doing for justice what "Titanic" did for love ... showing it to be worthy and desirable, but ultimately unsustainable in the face of evil, corruption, and random blows dealt by Fate. There are some events in which good is seen to triumph, but in hindsight these are plot contrivances ... to do evil would have been so much easier. The film itself is also senseless in some ways. The factors that made the Joker what he is are never laid out. Nor are the (sometimes incredible) feats of anticipation and cooperation, which allow the Joker often to have an extra card up his sleeve, ever explained. There are two subtexts beneath the central theme of overwhelming evil: one is intentional, the other (I think) not. The first one is Batman's credo: "sometimes, to do good, you have to act outside the law". The second is based on a line spoken by the Joker: where good and evil clash on equal terms, evil is more powerful, because the good have to follow rules, whereas the evil have no rules. The film is well made: the special effects are very impressive, the acting is generally good, and it's technically very well made. But I found it disturbing and (literally) hopeless.
1.0~Best film ever? You must be Joking... jamesmmason Sign in Permalink This film wasn't awful - it was pretty decent. But the rating isn't for the film itself, but as a counter to all those who have over-rated it. Were it not for the exaggerated response to the movie (through people's want to have seen something great, rather than to have actually witnessed it) then a rating of 6 feels right. Film is over-long, doesn't sufficiently build characters to the point where we care what happens to them, relies heavily on shocks, crashes, bangs and gadgets, and is probably best suited to teenage boys who are already Batman fans. Spiderman and Batman (the original) were better movies, and this feels more like James Bond (without the humour) than a standout classic.
1.0~Just four words kitbellew Sign in Permalink Ridiculously overrated, monumentally disappointing. Whoa, IMDb won't let me post this. It's too short, obviously. Well, then let me tell you this - I never cared for the re-franchising of Batman. It's just more of the Hollywood-style money making. And the more money they put into a film and its promotion, the more hype they create. But it sadly isn't just about them wanting us all to go see the movie. No, they get really greedy and after a certain point is reached, they proclaim this same movie is a piece of art. It's that simple. And if you can succeed in believing it is, it makes your life easier and jollier. You go to IMDb.com, you give it a 10, you read some exuberantly positive comments and smile contentedly, you read some unfavourable ones and mutter to yourself that there are always idiots who just don't get it, and you're happy, cause millions of people are desperately trying to prove to each other that they are part of something bigger than life, and are succeeding in that endeavour, and you are one of them. Not me, guys, not me. I like a lot of stupid films, but not this one. It makes me sick, for it reminds me how gullible we all are and just how much we want to dream. But we only want the dreams to come on the big screen - this is one of the many possible ways, kindly provided by our great benefactors, we can spend our ugly dollars on something shiny and new and inspiring, and harmless. And easy to digest. So, be happy, eat your popcorn, feel nice, eat well after the movie, sleep tight, dream beautifully, but don't bother trying to wake up, cause we are all in a really comfortable place and waking up will be very painful. On the other hand, the dream factory could keep you contented by offering you another piece of art for 10$ or thereabouts. Kudos to our benefactors and encore!
10.0~Truly one of the greatest anand5059 Sign in Permalink First thought.....Excellent work by Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger(feels bad to miss a great actor)....This movie might be considered by masterpiece by many(including me) and some people just give 1 rating because they don't accept it as the masterpiece....Its OK but giving 1 rating is too harsh.... This is a kind of movie of movie that has something for every fans..Its really a great thing to combine action,strong message to people,entertainment and giving it in a fast paced way..There are lot of thoughts in each character Batman - Wants to save his city Bruce Wayne - Using his resources to save the city Joker(the best) - Wants to prove the ugliness deep inside every human Harvey Dent - Even the best can go wrong Gordon - A uncorrupted cop and a lot of good characters....If u r a casual movie goer u will enjoy the movie...If u watch it deeply and closely,you will feel the greatness in the movie...I watched the movie around 3 times....and every time i find something more interesting and deeper thought......Hatz Off Nolan....No matter Wat other users have to say....I'll go with the the critics...Its my favorite movie of my life time....
9.0~The Dark Knight Rocks! josh-bassett Sign in Permalink I was lucky enough to take an early afternoon off work and catch this film at the Melbourne IMAX. After downloading and watching the HD teaser (opening 5 minutes of the film) off of Demonoid I knew I had to go see it. Who ever said file sharing hurt Hollywood in the box office sales? Pfft. I'm sure this film would still be as exciting on a regular cinema screen but like someone else said: if you've got the choice go see it at IMAX. Some of the aerial cinematography really blew me away in all it's full high-def glory. Earlier, I was reading a review where the critic was saying the film was slow to start but that's a load of BS in my opinion. I reckon it started at about 7 on the adrenalin gauge and cranked it up from there. All the performances were surprisingly authentic for a big budget Hollywood film. Heath Ledger WAS the Joker...no wonder he was disturbed by taking on such a psychologically deranged character. Anyhow, fans of the series will be able to comment more authoritatively on how well the movie does justice to the Batman saga. I'm simply writing this from the perspective of someone who enjoys seeing an action film from time to time, and no doubt - The Dark Knight delivers. Word!
10.0~The Dark Knight lives up to the Hype and Exceeds even the Loftiest Expectations aerock19 Sign in Permalink Since the first time I saw 'The Dark Knight' teaser attached to 'Knocked Up' last spring, I couldn't stop thinking about the film. With unprecedented hype and speculation, the latest Batman adaption has created the loftiest expectations for millions of people (fanboys and moviegoers alike); myself included. After seeing an advanced screening of 'The Dark Knight', I can honestly say: 'The Dark Knight' is amazing. 'The Dark Knight' left me breathless. 'The Dark Knight' is the best Batman movie to date. Christopher Nolan's latest film, without a single doubt, dethrones Tim Burton's 'Batman' and his own 'Batman Begins'. It's immense, unpredictable, and believable. Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' transcends the "superhero" genre. The IMAX format is absolutely beautiful. Do yourself a favor and go see 'The Dark Knight' in IMAX if available to you. There were moments during the picture where the IMAX-specific sequences left me speechless. It was unreal. It made the cinema-experience that much better (though I'm nearly positive that IMAX or not, you'll still love this film!) The last thing I'd like to mention is the wonderful acting in 'The Dark Knight'; specifically Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman. Their respective performances were uncanny. Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is outstanding and deserves the praise he's been receiving from many early reviews. Eckhart is excellent and showcases his multi-talented abilities through the movie; I believe in Harvey Dent. Oldman's role as Jim Gordon was a personal favorite of mine, and I left the theater in amazement. To avoid spoiling anything to you, I must admit to you that my review is only scratching the surface. I loved this movie! Great work; Great film.
10.0~Wow teeshirthappy Sign in Permalink I really like this movie. It was a lot better then what I thought it would be. Heath Leger did an amazing job on this movie. I did not expect much of the movie when i first saw it but this is really good. Later I showed this movie to my mom and she hates super hero movies but she really like this one. Or she just like Christian Bale. Any way this is a movie really worth to check out. It has an amazing story line and the actors are just incredible. It locks amazing to. If i was to describe this movie whit one world it would be... outstanding. To bad Heath Leger pass away. He was south a god actor. R.I.P Heath.
6.0~The Dark Blight... dphin8313 Sign in Permalink This is the future of Cinema. A lot of over the top special effects, lots of violence with a mediocre story at best. A world where special effects and action have now taken precedence over story. I do not know how people can see movies like this one now a days and think they are exceptional. The first of Bale's portrayal of Batman, I thought, was very good. Of course their was some violence and some special effects, but it had a very good story and good character development. This second in the Batman series was nothing but a lot of ridiculous special effects, ridiculous occurrences and a lousy story, full of plot holes, with hardly any real dialog and character development. I could not believe how many times everyone, including Batman, seems to let the joker get away and nobody seems to take him as any sort of a threat. He just keeps getting away over and over again and Batman never thinks to put him into submission when he catches him. Also the thought that Joker could all of a sudden be a criminal mastermind and setup some of the most unbelievable moments in the movie was absurd. I'd also like to know how in the world Commissioner Gordon knew that he would be able to jump in front of Harvey Dent, save his life and have the foresight to fake his death after the fact to get to the Joker. RIDICULOUS!!!!! Another stupid scene was with the 3 ships that were each given a detonator that would blow up the other ship and save themselves. I think everyone with any common sense would just chunk it over the side and assume that someone on the other boats would have the intelligence to do the same. Another thing I found to be far fetched was the whole using of the cell phones as sonar devices. That was so far fetched it insulted my intelligence, as many moments in this movie did. Also the ending stunk. Why in the world would Batman take the blame for Harvey's death when he and Gordon could just say that some of the Jokers men killed him which would have solved the issue. Such a pathetic ending to a lousy movie. I only wish that Hollywood would focus on making good action movies with a 80 percent focus on story instead of a 90 percent focus on special effects that they seem to be shooting for nowadays. You might be able to win over the mind of a teenager who grew up in our video game obsessed society but you won't win over someone like myself who grew up watching classic movies like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Back to the Future, etc. that didn't rely on special effects to win the audience over but relied on great stories that really drew you into the movie and made you care about the characters and what happens to them. Sorry to say, I didn't care a lick about any of the characters in the Dark Knight or what happened to them.
2.0~Dull slim_adie Sign in Permalink Seriously, this movie is long, tedious and predictable, and in all honesty you cant be bothered what happens in the plot because the characters are so two dimensional. in fact, its been a few weeks since I watched this movie and for the life of me i cannot remember what happened in it... That perhaps tell you how good it was? Anyway, god knows what crack these people are smoking who have given it 8/10... IS THIS TEN LINES YET???? Pope
1.0~Best movie ever made? billy-jackson56 Sign in Permalink If Heath Ledger deserved an Oscar for this then why didn't Mickey Rourke win one for Sin City? simple answer is Sin city is a film based on a comic book, whereas The Dark knight is some kind of post 9/11 view of the world in which terrorist's like Osama o'Ledgers character go around blowing up buildings and sending the police and the worlds media videos or viral's or what ever the hell those crappy scenes are supposed to represent in order to instill fear and panic nice one Nolan for ruining a comic book fantasy by trying to be Stanley Kubrick or whoever the hell you were trying to be with this movie, and I am getting fed up with people saying this is how Batman should be represented just read the comic books, where's robin how the hell are they going to write the penguin or cat woman into the story it was okay with the joker because they just stole the look of James o'bars the crow and attached it to a caricature of certain terrorist's that in the last 10 years have caused death and destruction and let a film go out to the worlds media every now and then just like the joker in this film to let everyone know there still around, I can't even describe how pretentious this piece of c**p is it was okay with batman begins but with this it seems as if Nolans made a serious political statement while using the guise of a comic book that was written in the 1930's. Personally I think the first Batman film despite it's many flaws is still the only true representation of batman from Gotham city to the noir aspects and even the characters, Heath Ledgers joker is in no way comparable to the joker character Bob Kane created, and the way he played the joker was just irritating I just wanted to punch him out I found him not in the least bit scary or intimidating he just needed a good punch to the throat, if you want to check out some good performances of lunatics check out Dennis Hopper in Blue velvet Rutger Hauer in the hitcher or Gary Oldman in Leon who also happens to be the only good thing about this film, Christian bale is just c**p as Bruce Wayne and batman like he was the last time and like he is in every other movie he has made with the exception of American psycho in which he played a t**t basically just had to turn up to set and be himself. But just like the godfather this is just going to be another over hyped piece of garbage that people rave on about for the next thousand years or until some other film maker makes another batman film where he is this time played by a woman in space on a space station fighting Genghis khan because this is how far these movies are moving away from the source material this very film is based on. The film is disgusting to look at as well, at least Burton and Schumachers Gotham city's looked original (and yes I know he put the statue of liberty into batman forever but this film is just garbage) and not just like new york. They might as well as called this film heat as well seeing as it has so many shots of tall buildings in fact I might just go watch heat as it is a better made film without a pretentious plot and decent actors with a good script with well thought out direction and alarmingly a faster pace then this turgid piece of excrement, if you want my advice watch batman 1 then heat and then turn on the news after that and you will pretty much get the gist of the dark knight but in a more enjoyable way and won't have to sit through this demoralising piece of rubbish. If you happen to be below the age of thirteen or just a geek who can't get a girlfriend or boyfriend then you will probably think this film rules personally i think it is c**p
3.0~What Joker gave this film a PG-13 rating? chase-13 Sign in Permalink Perhaps if this movie had been rated R, I would have been prepared for the graphic brutality of it. Instead, I found myself thinking that I just wanted to walk out. Yes, the production values are high and the performances are good, but I didn't need to spend ten bucks, only to want to look away from the screen repeatedly. Eventually, I rationalized that one of the points of the movie was to show Gotham's descent into chaos and crime. It did that very well. And the situation with the two ferry boats, and its resolution, was intriguing. But if I'd have known how relentlessly depressing and violent the movie was going to be, I'd have stayed home. (Gotta say, I did like the bike!)
5.0~The Dark Knight and a Marketing Quest. victor7754 Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight's marketing campaign was very luring and the super charged trailers for this multi produced dark and monotone film were done very well, tempting the moviegoer's curiosity. The film starts off on a somewhat implausible crime and an introduction to the evil that Batman will have to face. Gotham is in trouble. It seems that since the 911 attacks several films have been portraying destruction and violence in a form of terrorism. The Dark Knight has a parable to the current terror that the Western World is facing and fighting against. The Joker, Batman's antagonist in the film is the symbol for this new terrorism...he is a disturbing character that is faced with impossible feats of terror. The film jolts the senses and keeps the consciousness focused on defeating this terror and how but, the impossible meets the impossible and a reminder that this all comic book fun with a little propaganda involved. It's the hero's journey done all over again. Cinematographer Wally Pfister's lighting is the best part of this hyped film. Heath Ledger played a great Character Role that has been played well in the past. Chistian Bale seemed bored and tired or perhaps that was his Character as batman would be tired and bored with existence and wondering why he is bothering when the cops in the film are portrayed as mediocre, corrupt, stupid...why would Batman continue...Rich, successful, powerful, superhero, attractive...The Dark Knight is full of questionable feats and watching the editing in places did not convince that what just occurred on film is too hard to accept even on comic book level. This empty and sad film leaves the senses the moment the car door shuts. Like a rickety roller-coaster...glad to see the credits role.
10.0~Stunning visseradw Sign in Permalink Tonight I went to see the movie for the 2nd time. I do this with every movie I highly enjoy seeing the 1st time: this way I can see whether it was just a whim of excitement that got me, or the movie really was that good. This second time around, I had a good view of the acting, but most of all the story itself and the way it's directed. Enough has been said about Heath Ledger in other comments, and my opinion is these comments are right. The other characters in the movie are overshadowed by him, but certainly do perform excellently. Eckhart sublimely works up to his performance of Two-Face and does that well too, while Bale shows us a Batman who's more and more becoming aware that maybe he's not the hero Gotham needs. The rest of the characters were cast very well; I always enjoy Caine, and Gyllenhaal replaces Holmes in a very good fashion. The story itself is so fast-paced I felt like the movie had just been running for 15 minutes when the half-time break arrived. The run-time of 2.5 hours is certainly not too much for what the screen gives you. This is of course promoted by the way it's directed: the scenes are woven into each other in such a way that you'll never get bored. I can't see how the scenes could fit any better than this. The excellent story combined with amazing pacing and directing, and the presence of this wonderful array of actors all a perfect match for their roles results in what I think is the best movie I've seen so far in my life. As a final note to this movie, I'd be surprised if this one doesn't receive at least some nominations for the academy awards. Seeing it win a couple would be fair the way I see it.
1.0~Terrible pk19652001 Sign in Permalink By far the most overrated hunk of junk i have ever viewed. Who the heck thinks this is a good movie. Its just another in a long line of stupid super hero/comic book movies that have come out to the theater in the past few years. The acting is terrible. From Batman himself who i couldn't understand half the things he was saying. To the very barely average performance of Ledger. They consider his role Oscar material? You've got to be kidding. You want to see a good performance, go rent Monster's Ball. Even the Patriot he was better. The special affects are nothing to go crazy about. Just your typical CGI thats not so spectacular nowadays. And that plot. Like that made allot of sense. But i guess like Adam Sandler movies, people like this garbage. To think this movie is getting higher ratings than the Godfather movies, Shawshank, Pulp Fiction, Schindler list, Star Wars and Casablanca shows you the mentality of todays movie viewer.
10.0~Christopher Nolan deserves this 2 Oscars. akshatvaishya16 Sign in Permalink I couldn't believe "The Dark knight" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. "The Dark Knight" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.
6.0~Ledger sublime, film over-plotted mattrochman Sign in Permalink This was a pretty good film. The production quality was magnificent and Ledger's performance as the joker was magnificent. Overall, it opened strongly and for the most part, it was an engaging film with plenty of action and plot twists. However, there was something a bit "overdone" about the film. As another reviewer said, the ending felt as if it was built on as it was not born out of the main storyline. Second, there were too many sub-plots that distracted from the over-arching plot of the film. Similarly, there were abnormalities and things we feel are important seem to drop in and out of the storyline. Was Wayne still in love with Rachel? Was she still in love with him? Why did this fade in and out of importance? Was the joker trying to catch the batman for a share of the crime syndicate's money? Yes, no, but yes.... but ultimately no. Is Batman retiring? Yes!.... no! But why would he? Seemed the reason given was vague and confusing. What happened to the Lau? The crooked accountant snatched out of Hong Kong? The transformation of Dent's character was a bit odd and the dialogue at the end about Batman being the "dark knight" was a bit dumb! I did like it, but the screenplay and plotting was overdone and not enough focus was given to the primary plots. So in the end, it came off a bit scrambled. Excellent performances all round, I must say.
10.0~Answering the critics visene Sign in Permalink Looking over the comments from those who hated this film, I noticed a lot of people complaining that the film has a.) poor editing and cinematography, b.) undeveloped characters, and c.) and incoherent and/or meaningless plot. Not all criticisms say these things; some smart viewers genuinely don't get this film and that's cool. But a LOT of viewers claim the film is both stupid and nihilistic. Let's discuss. (If you're already nodding, cut to the last paragraph). First, it should be noted that the film's cinematographer, Wally Pfister, has already been nominated for an Oscar twice. These nominations are not driven by money or by poor taste; they come from other cinematographers and they speak to the artistry of his work. Pfister is a master of deliberately imperfect framing and visual misdirection. His work isn't easy to watch and his work rewards repeat viewing. It is NOT incoherent and, in fact, most of his scenarios are VERY clear after a while. He makes you work for clarity and why this should be a problem, especially when visual sophistication is something that usually makes films better, is beyond me. Second, the editing, though very rapid, also comes together after repeat viewing. The cuts usually bring together different IDEAS about what a scene means, not just different angles-- that is, the plot information carries thematic information inside it. Those who don't want to work for this information are perfectly entitled not to, but they might reconsider their right to complain about it. Third, concerning character: the critics are right. The characters are in fact "underdeveloped" and that's only a problem if you think every film should be judged as if it is a Merchant Ivory production. The fact is, Christopher Nolan is a science fiction director. I don't mean that all his films are science fiction; I just mean that he focuses on ideas, not characters. If you aren't into this, fine, but it's a genre issue, not an issue of quality. Complaining that a science fiction film doesn't have "well developed characters" is like claiming that Atonement was a poor film because it didn't have an alien invasion. I liked Atonement and I liked knowing who the characters were and where they were coming from, because it was a work of dramatic realism. In The Dark Knight, the Joker's "origin" is NOT THE POINT--which is why he keeps making up various stories about his origin. The point is the social role he plays. It's also not the point that he actually plans things. OF COURSE he actually plans things: he just CLAIMS that he doesn't plan because that's the role he wants to play. Every major character in this film plays a role, a social and public role, and the clash among these roles is the point of the film. Again, if you're not into this, fine, but it's a matter of genre preference, not an issue of what makes a film good or bad. I like Merchant Ivory films, and when I see one I expect well developed characters. But expecting every film to have them is weird. Lastly, the question of the plot. The plot is about terrorism and its meaning for those who are, or might be, victims of it. This is an interesting idea and I think it's handled in an interesting way. We're shown both the evils of terrorism and also--this is the controversial part--the opportunities it provides to test our own willingness to be free. If you didn't "get" this when you saw the film, that's cool--but that doesn't mean it wasn't there. It just means you were not, for whatever reason, looking for it. I usually don't bother to write reviews for big-budget stuff, but something about the hypocrisy of the negative reactions to this film really bothers me. First people claim that the film is too dark, not entertaining enough, etc.--in other words it's not the lightweight fantasy fluff they expect from a comic book movie. They go on to complain that they didn't get it, that it was hard to follow, that the characters were unsympathetic, etc. So basically, they condescend to the film for not being easy to watch, which is not exactly a reason to condescend to a film. Some people want comic book movies to be fun and light and that's okay, but if a director wants to use this genre to do something serious, what's wrong with that? If art directors can make comedies, why can't pop-genre directors make serious "essay" films about serious topics? Maybe some of us can't accept that serious pop-genre films will NEVER look like Atonement or whatever (for one thing, they won't have "deep" characters). For the rest of us, The Dark Knight is a breakthrough.
10.0~Stunning! Heath Ledger will blow you away! Naylie Sign in Permalink Wow! It's so....wow! I've always taken a liking to Batman, including many of the other superheroes such as Superman, Wonder Woman etc etc and the Batman movies (not too many I can remember seeing) were pretty good and decent, but this one....wow! Out of this world! The movie takes place right after Batman Begins (and yes it is a sequel if some of you did not know that, it's best for you to go watch the first one before going to see The Dark Knight) and this one, as you may of known or heard of, focuses on the new villain The Joker (everyone's favorite Batman villain) play by none other than the great Heath Ledger (who passed away 6 months before the movie's released T_T) also, you will see that Batman's rocky relationship with Rachel (who is play by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replace Katie Holmes from the first movie) has hit rock bottom when she starts dating a guy named Harvey (Whose play by Aaron Eckhart) Everyone from the first movie has return (expect of course Katie Holmes as I already mention) and you get to see a lot of surprises while watching the film. Heath Ledger has totally pull it off! At first when I had saw the previews last year, I find it weird that they chose him to play The Joker, but after watching it today, it's like wow! That guy knows how to act! The movie is two and a half hours long, but you'll never have a dulling bored moment once you get hooked on it! You will find a lot of action and some great humor stunt by Heath. Besides being known for his role in Brokeback Mountain, Heath Ledger will always be remember forever in our hearts for a long time! We love you Heath. May you rest in peace!
5.0~The Dark Knight Overrated! dreaminginthemidnighthou Sign in Permalink I believe if Heath Ledger had been alive this would have been maybe a 7/10 and his acting was good but not great and anyway he played second fiddle to Christian Bales Batman. To be honest I think and have talked to people who think it fantastic and then some that hadn't heard of Ledger's death and interestingly these people gave him about a 6-7/10 for his portrayal of "The Joker" Whilst Ledger is a great actor and will be sorely missed I think that this being his LAST movie and all the emotion has boosted it up. The same thing happened with James Dean with his blockbuster and last movie "Giant." Ledger was a creepy joker and did well to play his part but I think the fact that he was dead made people look at him all throughout the movie and not other actors. Good Move RIP Heath Ledger, a sad loss to the industry
2.0~What a joke! smits59 Sign in Permalink When a write this, this farce of a movie is ranked 10 in the top 250. Has anyone who rates this movie so highly actually seen it? The timing in almost every action is so unbelievable wrong. Anything happening a split second earlier or later would not have lead to the outcome portrait in the movie. I love comics and the don't have to be logical. But if you a make an illogical movie please make is obvious that you are making a farce. There is no logic in a house that just has been raided by the thugs to be proclaimed as "the safest place in Gotham". just a few scenes later. Don't make everything as realistic as possible, make a comic-movie. The badman-series where lovely to watch because they understood this to be true. OK, the acting is not to bad but almost all the action is horrible predictable.
10.0~It's not just a BATMAN...It is 'MUST SEE' movie! saratr Sign in Permalink First of all, I am a big admirer of NOLAN brothers since MEMENTO and I was expecting this sequel to be good. But, its beyond my expectation. All ingredients, directing, casting, screenplay, cinematography, etc... Everything is in place. You don't see the BATMAN as a cartoon character but an eccentric business man with lots of sources,strong willed,intelligent, in great physical shape, but not a super human being... Even the other characters, Joker, Harvey Dent(Two face). I can not stop and add this mentioning his name;amazing JOKER performance by Heath Ledger. Can't be described by words, you need to see it. All the actors were great; Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Cain, Gary Oldman but I need to say this even though I love her as an actress, Maggie Gyllenhaal wasn't not in the character. Thats the only criticism, I can do about the movie. From the fist moment, you feel like you live in GOTHAM CITY. It comes from great directing skills of Christopher Nolan. Camera moves, details of surroundings, they are just amazing. Two thumbs up for Jonathan Nolan for making the very well-known story in to something else. So, don't say it is a BATMAN sequel, go and see this great movie. It will worth it.
1.0~COLOSALLY over-hyped crap-ola!!!! libalibi Sign in Permalink Unfortunately, this is my first review here at IMDb. And it HAD to be this "movie".. First of all, I enjoyed Batman franchise and, of course, start of Nolan's career..he promised so much!! Boy was I in a surprise.. After hearing media bragging the acting of sadly, now deceased, young Ledger I thought OK, Nolan is back in his saddle where he belongs.. Not only I realized he's not back, but that he's discovering new depths of personal and spiritual descension. Christopher, if you're reading this, please take time and sit back in your comfy chair, turn off the lights and start pondering on your future..This is the point of no return, choose carefully. Making good films, or blah films like this. And to people calling this art,just one remark..the only art involved in this film was PR, and nothing else. Filmmakers, stop letting your financiers do the "work" your film should do by itself..exploiting someone's death like that really makes my stomach churn. Chris come back to basics, and satisfy yourself as well as true film lovers. Forget cash..wish you all the luck, mate. PS. Dreck Knight's optimum grade should not be over 6, but I voted it 1 because it seems mucho people need a brain transplant
7.0~Not as good as the first. pgwhite95 Sign in Permalink I went to see the "dark knight" on opening weekend with my girlfriend. Both of us are comic book junkies, and we absolutely loved "batman begins." We went into the theater with the anticipation that we were going to see a continuation of the first movie. Although, the story has evolved since the first film, I was not as moved by the screenplay as I was before. I guess the first and foremost problem is the use of Maggie Gyllenhaal as, Rachel Dawes. Yes, I know that Katie Holmes turned down the roll, (not very smart on her part), however that subtle difference made me think less of her roll and more on the fact that she wasn't Katie Holmes. The second part that I had a problem with is that the trailers of this film, and all the hype leading up to it made Heath Ledger's roll as "the joker" less appealing. Although he does pull of the job of being disturbed quite well, this is in no way what I had imagined him to be. It almost seemed like his character was subdued a bit, and should have been done with greater emphasis. I still contest that Jack Nicholson was the best joker. Anyway, it is still a great movie, I saw it twice in the theater, and own it now on DVD. Inspite of all the flaws of this film, I still recommend it to comic book junkies, like myself, and anyone else who likes a good story.
10.0~One of the best movies of the year chefskater Sign in Permalink "Batman: The Dark Knight" is a great movie movie. I went to see it at the drive in and i have never seen any batman movies or anything and was never really interested in any of it until i saw the dark knight. At the drive in i had had the choice of watching "Step Brothers" or "Batman: The Dark Knight" and I'm glad i chose Batman because it was a really good movie and step brothers was probably crap compared to it. I would probably recommend that anyone should watch this movie, even if you haven't seen any of the other batman movies you would definitely still enjoy this movie. I've also heard that it is much better than the other recent batman movie batman begins. i have never seen batman begins, so i cant really say that but i can say that this is one of the best movies I've seen in the past year along with "I am Legend".
1.0~Erm...really? (may be a couple of spoilers) planetsurreal Sign in Permalink Wow. Once again my faith in the rational persons ability to discriminate between depth and breadth, is verified, in that I have none. The film was long. Not deep. I think there is a misunderstanding. The film had the veneer of an epic film. It had all the right elements to be an epic comic-book adaptation to screen. Yet it faltered, mainly because everyone was so wrapped up in the idea of Ledger giving a career defining performance, they couldn't see past it. It's almost as if they accepted the brilliance of his performance before they entered the theatre, off of the back of the hype and the critics reviews, and all that was left was to actually watch it and be able to validate this belief. Disregarding Heath Ledgers untimely death, can you really say that he was a better Joker than Jack Nicholsons? I for one, cannot. Others have already said it; he had no back story. A character without a past and a motive - especially when they are a killer - is just not one that is appropriate to a story about good and evil. The things we like about villains is that we can relate to the reasons they do the things they do, whilst asking ourselves whether their reasons are justified. We get into a dialogue, and we ourselves get to decide who we side with - the good or the bad. This villain left me feeling flat and unfulfilled because he had no real motive, - making it impossible to choose which argument, good or bad, I sided with - and left me feeling like I was a voyeur, watching a guy kill loads of people. Everyone has been raving about the script, which I thought was plain dreadful at points. Others have raised the questions here. What was with his voice? He would make a great nursery nurse. The poignant moment on the boat when the sailor said something to the effect of "They haven't pushed the button yet, because we are still alive" was just plain embarrassing. The fact that Batman kept leaving in the middle of a conversation became irritating instead of cool and enigmatic. Why can't he just hear someone out. And at the end when batman runs home like Charlie, I was nearly dying in laughter. I could hear the music 'I've got a golden ticket'. There were other embarrassing script moments, but because the film was so bad, I can't even be bothered to mention them. The phone device for one was utter... The rhetoric of the characters in their oratorical moments was again, limp. It was as if the writer had started a sadistic, flowing evil speech, but had not had the tools with which to really elaborate. Because he had decided to keep the Jokers background exclusive, the speeches were neither funny or scary. They were punctured and lacked conviction. The fact that this is the number one movie is embarrassing. IMDb should take it off out of principle. If this wins an Oscar, I will never watch a Hollywood movie again.
4.0~I Turned It Off With 25 Minutes To Go mikeboyd1986 Sign in Permalink It just got so boring. Lots of silly chases and explosions and people doing dare-devil stunts. Whoop-dee-do! But what about the plot? What about a bit of realism in the way people would react to the stuff shown in this film. And what about trying to stick to the laws of physics when doing these ridiculous stunts. But mostly, I couldn't really care what happened to any of the characters in this film. I couldn't care less if Batman or the Joker got blown up or shot. And it just went on and on and on... Good grief, they could have cut an hour off and it might have been a good film. I kept looking at the time and thinking "How long to go before I can get out of here?". I see someone on the message boards has a topic "I haven't met anyone who hasn't liked this film". Well, now you have.
3.0~Nothing special, just another blockbuster duster-13 Sign in Permalink After reading numerous reviews on IMDb and other websites, and also finding out that the movie got the top position in the IMDb Top 250, I expected to see something really special when I got to the cinema. However, all my expectations faded away throughout the 2 and half hours of "Dark Knight". Probably, the only outstanding performance is Heath Ledger, whose character is for sure the most charismatic guy of the story. On contrary, Batman looks cold and boring. The pace of the movie is a bit too chill down and relaxed in the beginning with all the action starting after 1/3 of the "Dark Knight". Story is rather good and often unpredictable. However, there are many illogical situations so much typical for blockbusters. For instance, at the end, why should Batman confess that he killed several good guys, if it would have been much easier to tell everybody that Joker did all that? Movie is full simplistic, naive assumptions about human behaviour in different situations. In sum, it's not a bad movie, probably it's worth to watch it once, but I really don't understand how could it get such reviews and rankings.
5.0~Where is Batman? patrigan Sign in Permalink Watching this Movie you get to see Batman and Two Face and The Joker. All good things, if you are into Batman. But to me it does'nt feel like a Batman Movie. They tried to make it so realistic and stuff. But thanks to it's realism some scenes are just way over the top. It looks like a Halloween version of the Godfather. Man in silly costumes fighting and trying to be bad-ass. Hilarious! Batman is a superhero! There is no need to make an realistic Movie about an Superhero! I like all the supernatural elements of the Comics and in this Movie they took them all away. Take Bales costume away and wipe Heath Ledger's Make-Up away and you have a somewhat boring Gangster-Movie. Leave the costumes and the Make-Up and you have a very boring Batman Movie. Please let Tim Burton do another Batman!
1.0~Avoid if you are an adult spoiler7 Sign in Permalink I finally saw this movie because everyone kept talking about it. But for anyone who has seen more than a few movies (ie somebody over 20) there is just nothing there. Even without the hype I found this movie to be really painfully bad. A few points: --- It seems the movie is trying to be realistic starting with something that looks like a somewhat believable heist. But then there are so many totally improbable things like batman's hideout and gadgets, the joker somehow getting zillions of minions, etc. So which is it a gritty crime movie or fantasy? I can't tell. --- Haven't we seen "witty" dialog like this 100 times: Batman: "Let her go" Joker: "Oh, very poor choice of words" (drops her out window) When this happened my jaw dropped. This is worse than a Rambo movie. --- I get it that Heath Ledger playing The Joker is supposed to be some crazy psycho. Hardly original or award worthy. Just looked like a hundred others we have seen before in other movies. --- All "characters" are totally off-the-shelf. There's no depth or surprise to them at all. --- What does Rachel Dawes see in Bruce Wayne? In the scene in the restaurant ("I own the place") he seems like a braggart and feels the need to arrive at his own party in a helicopter with three arm candy women on his arm. (Why isn't he already at his own place?) --- Oh look a fancy party in Wayne's penthouse. I wonder what's going to happen? Look the bad guy comes in a starts tormenting people. Then Wayne has to change into his batman costume to save the day. How is this not 110% predictable. --- Again, is the movie supposed to be realist? When arrested The Joker would really be forced to wash the makeup off his face. --- Bruce Wayne saves the armored truck from a collision by placing his Lamborghini in between it an on coming truck. Aren't armored trucks stronger than sports cars. Yeah, I know Wayne has some magic tech. So at this point we are supposed to suspend disbelief. --- I could go on. Obviously some people really like this movie. That's great but please don't say its anything like the best movie ever until you have seen some films from the AFI's lists http://www.afi.com/10TOP10/
10.0~Wow, What a good film!!!!! matthewberry10 Sign in Permalink Well, what can I say. This makes Batman Begins seem terrible. Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne is on top form and better than ever(Especially with the scene involving the jump off the IFS in Hong Kong). I would hugely recommend that you watch this film. I've seen hundreds of films and in my opinion this is the best of them all. Heath Ledger's Joker was fantastic. He brought humour and action to the whole film. I must say that Ledger's Joker has to be better than Nicholson's 1989 portrayal however the jokes were not of the same calibre. Anyway, this film had it all - the action - the jokes. The storyline was great. It showed the joker's rise to power and it had plenty of action to help. Especially with the Party Crash scene, the street scene where the tumbler explodes :( (But there is a surprise at this point), and when Gotham General hospital has some structural re-modifications ( Gets blown up). The ending lacked a bit of fight from both batman and the joker and both should have suffered a few more cuts and bruises. Anyway the whole film was brilliant and a must see for all movie lovers. Absolutely brilliant film that balances -suspense- action - laughter and adventure. Absolutely brilliant, just like the cast and the director. What more can I say?
1.0~Another mindless movie petryshark Sign in Permalink I must admit that this movie should receive the trophy of "Anthem of a generation" for incredible bad movies of the new era of film making. First time I've heard of this movie was from a friend who told me and I quote "Man, this movie is on the top of IMDb list, we have to see it" so I did see it. I was expecting something great , but after one hour I was sick of it and left the room. It is non stop action with no script ,nothing at all.All you see and hear in this movie is bum-bum,bang-bang and not even some cliché lines, nothing artistic ,the only plots in this movie are kinder garden plots and they are tied in an anarchic structure.The only reason to look at this movie is to see special effects and CGI.Batman begins is a much better movie than this one. Christian Bale's performance was less than mediocre even if everyone praised him for reinventing the character of Batman.It brings nothing new the Batman concept, the only actor who did something was Heath Ledger (Joker). You would probably ask why is rated so high.The answer is that the marketing and the propaganda did a great job infusing in people minds the idea that this is a good movie, plus the rating of a movie it is mostly subjective and when you say that a movie costs $180 million and it has all of this presumed great actors people will say "Gee that is a great movie".And the critics do you think that they are honorable people who rate movies with objectivity for the good of the people, of course not they have to sell the newspapers they work for.And once i asked an American friend why do you listen to a popular band at that time and he said because it is what is cool now and what people listen, i don't agree with him so when you rate a movie listen to your inner self not others.
6.0~The most over rated film of all time! cdietz94-667-599244 Sign in Permalink (Well besides the Shankshaw) The film is nowhere near as good as it's predecessor "Batman Begins", the closest it came is when the tumbler blew up. Heath Ledger as Joker = God awfulness!!!!!!!!!! It sounds like Eddie Deezen got cast as Hannible Lecter, now thats illegal use of the Deezen! Gary Oldman really deserved that Oscar, as did Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman. Christian Bail, dose he have lung cancer or something?! Maggie Gyllenthaal was bad casting she looks nowhere nowhere near as Katie Holmes was, her dying made jump up with cheer! Harvey Dent is like Sasuke from Naruto. How? You want to bash his head in every time you see him. It would take me all day to clear up all my problems with this film. The car chase although is hands down the best part of the film and probably the best car chase ever put on film! The ending ticked me off the most, the first time I watched it I wanted to destroy the disc because I was so disappointed. But still not that bad. Despite the gigantic plot holes at the end. Its an okay movie, So don't go ape-S**t if you don't agree with me. 6/10
6.0~Vastly overrated as of this date Paul-271 Sign in Permalink Unlike many others, I'm not going to rate this a one star to counterbalance the lunacy shown by many IMDb'ers in giving this mediocre outing a 10. I will instead rate it fairly by my estimates. Pretty much all the adverse criticism you'll find by reading the one or two star reviews are accurate. The issue isn't if this movie fails continuity time and time again, but if it matters. After all, isn't this a cartoon? Yet it isn't. I'm not a fan or cartoons or the previous Batman offerings. I consider the 'dark Gothic look' of Gotham City which some so love to be puerile. At the start of this, I enjoyed that instead of fakey doo dark city infested with grotesque characters, we were in Chicago - a reasonably lighted place with humans as the dominant residents. However, if you are going to change the ground rules so you are in normal human space, then you need to adhere by these rules. Having some guy in silly makeup able to appear anywhere even in the company of his continually refreshed gang is jarring to say the least. Where did he get his superhuman cameo powers from? If you wish to posit at the start that the villain isn't human,or has supernatural powers or is an alien like Predator, then OK, but don't make him a human driven by human needs, cut off any back story and then give him powers which could easily defeat both Alien and Pedator. Also for gosh sakes, do a little homework. At one point a fellow removes a pistol from a criminal in court. Like criminals can just waltz into court with handguns so he can then later attempt to shoot the prosecutor. Worse, when the fellow is disarmed the guy doing the disarm move claims it to be a .28 caliber....Good grief. Was that supposed to be a joke or is Hollywood that lazy not to even note that there is no such thing in a modern Glock like pistol. In the end, this is a movie with no bright spots. It's despair all the way. There is no hope for goodness. Instead, we're given the choice between anarchy or oppression. Worse, the oppressive ones are the government who lack the will to deal with the anarchists.
10.0~Best movie of 2008 hands down! manuel_de_dios Sign in Permalink I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance. Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display. Nolan has made his "I will always be remembered" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!
4.0~Why the big deal? gjaensch Sign in Permalink I don't understand the big deal over the Dark Knight. Sure its OK and the actors are OK and all but its not GREAT. I believe that the movie wasn't all that great and was way to boring. My opinion is the movie is O.K. The atmosphere was the main theme of the movie, it was meant to shock us, gore us out and make us feel sympathy. It dragged on to long and by the end i was half asleep and was glad it was over. As soon as it started I was excited to be watching and by the end i was waiting for it to finish. Most of the actors irritated me. I laughed when the love interest died. She annoyed me. But the movie wasn't horrible. Im not saying its the worst movie I've ever seen - but its not one of the greatest. It definitely has no right to be up there with the greatest. No moment in this movie made me stop and think - wow this is good. If you like action you may like this movie but if you like non-stop excitement you won't. Sure there will be people out there who think that this movie is a masterpiece and there will be people out there that don't like it like myself. But I don't believe such a movie has the right to be called one of the greatest movies of the year, or of all time.
1.0~Ledger good, movie bad thepancakeman Sign in Permalink ***This comment DEFINITELY contains spoilers. :-)*** Okay, let's get the good stuff out of the way, because it won't take long. The acting is good, and the movie is probably worth seeing just for the Heath Ledger role. Most of the rest of the cast does a fine job as well, with the exception of Maggie Gyllenhaal who was pretty flat and lifeless. And the rest of the movie...bad. I'll try to stick with the high...er, lowlights. Action: the chase scenes and most of the action scenes in general were chaotic to the point that you couldn't really follow them. "Somebody shot something at someone, but someone else maybe interfered somehow so the outcome is unclear and can prolong the scene but we're not sure how or why. But stuff blew up, so it must be cool!" The biggest issue is plausibility: apparently the Joker (who doesn't make a single joke, BTW) can roll 1000's of 55 gallon drums of gunpowder and/or gasoline all of the city, including the police station and hospitals without anyone noticing. Per Rachael Dawes, "The safest place is Bruce Wayne's penthouse." Apparently, she has short term memory issues, because the Joker and crew just waltzed in there the day before. That's right, he can walk thru any security perimeter without the slightest issue. We are not given any reason why this is so or justification for it, he simply appears whenever and wherever the script calls for him no matter how ridiculous. Oh, did I mention he's invulnerable? That's right, he can blow stuff up so that everyone around him is dead or unconscious but there's not a scratch on him. Also, every boat captain carrying a prison population would take a popular vote with the convicts as to what to do with a detonator, right? This is just scratching the surface of issues with this movie, but hopefully it gets the point across. There are lots of other timing/continuity flaws, character inconsistencies, etc. to keep you entertained as well. It is generally against my policy to skew my vote to try and push a rating, but this movie doesn't belong in the top 100, let alone number one all time. I give it about 5/10.
4.0~One of the worst Batman films JoeJanuaryII Sign in Permalink THIS MOVIE IS WEAK! Unfortunately, this film fails to deliver the same way Batman Begins did. The characters were mishandled (Nolan should do MORE research) and the acting was unsatisfying. Ledger did great, only he was NOT the Joker. The man hardly giggled. I'm sorry, but if you're going to play someone like the Joker, DO NOT go off on a tangent and try your own thing. In a medium like comic books, they're different from books in terms of we get visuals. We know EXACTLY what the Joker is supposed to be like. Ledger dropped the ball big time and Nolan should have done something about it. CELL PHONE SONAR?????????? That was awful. Two-Face looked good and Eckhart was an awesome choice but he had very little to work with. They should have given his character the attention he deserves, meaning his descent stemmed from his childhood, not his damn relationship with his co-worker. Gordon could have been good but he wasn't. Apparently he had to die to catch the Joker. WHAT? The ruse was mishandled. Let your audience know what's happening. Batpod? Whatever. NO BATCAVE???????????? Michael Caine plays an excellent Alfred only he had nothing to do. Does anyone recall the whole thing from Begins about Why do we fall? Apparently EVERYONE forgot it in this one. Everyone had a moral dilemma in this and that's fine, but WE DEALT WITH THIS IN THE FIRST ONE!!!! This is a damn superhero movie and why do people like superheroes? Because they beat up the bad guys. The fight scenes are poor at best because the camera is too close and YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS HAPPENING. I want to watch Batman kick the hell out of an army of jerks, not have it implied. These scenes were the weakest part of the film. Batman films, whether you agree or not, should have scraps like the ones in City of Violence or the hallway scene in Old Boy. THOSE ARE FIGHT SCENES! Does anyone know the plot of this film? Look, I know the Joker was supposed to be insane and never plan a damn thing BUT THERE WAS NO CLIMAX! Every scheme amounts to nothing and in the end of the film, THERE IS NO MOMENT OF TRIUMPH FOR THE BAT! Especially since they locked him up once and THE JOKER GOT OUT! WHY IN SWEET HELL WOULD THE JOKER BE AFRAID OF INCARCERATION?????? Plus, the scene at the end with the boats was a little too far-fetched (I know that's a risky thing to say since this is a film about a man who dressed in a rubber suit to fight crime). I mean, I just don't see people blowing each other up, especially when the National Guard is involved. WEAK! And back to that cell phone sonar thing: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!!! BATMAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DAMN DETECTIVE!!!! WHY HAVEN'T YOU DEALT WITH THAT???? HE DOESN'T NEED THE DAMN SONAR TO FIND JOKER!!!!!! Ultimately, what kills this movie is the writing. Awful!!! David S. GOYER!!! STOP BUTCHERING SUPERHERO MOVIES!!! FIRST THE DAMN CROW (did you think I'd forget, dumb-ass?) THEN NICK FURY FOR TV WITH HASSELHOFF AND THEN BLADE (Goyer's third Blade, which he directed, SUCKED) AND NOW BATMAN. WHY DO THEY HIRE THIS MAN??????? People, this movie was terrible in terms of WHAT THEY COULD'VE DONE WITH THE MATERIAL!!!! If Nolan decided to do a third, he should FIRE himself because he cannot direct comic movies and TURF GOYER!!!!! There are some fine ideas in this film but they are masked by the garbage. The bank scene is great but the subsequent ones fail to deliver. All in all, I WISH I liked this movie. But if left me suspicious of a third and slightly hoping they'll reboot it again. I thought Bale was a great choice for the mantle but he phoned this performance in. If he doesn't step it up, get someone else or start over. Ugh.
1.0~Overrated david-546 Sign in Permalink I gave this movie a one (1). Not that it deserved it. But what it doesn't deserve is the lofty 9 from IMDb viewers that put it #4 on the IMDb list. The movie is good but it is not great. So I give it a one just to balance all the ludicrous 10's. What was good. Well Heath Ledger as the Joker was the most obvious. Unpredictable but never over the top. A scary Joker - Jack Nicholson - who? Aaron Eckhart was also quite good as Harvey Dent/Two Face. And finally Christian Bale was a good Batman the best of the bunch. Didn't feel like a hero at all. Oldman was good as he always is. Finally Maggy held her own. So I had no complaint about the acting. I just found the story jumpy and confusing at time. Christopher Nolan is a good director but his stories get lost amongst all the gimmicks. And that is just annoying. I hadn't seen this picture before nor the other Nolan Batman's either. And now I know why. No not really a bad picture. Just not worthy of a 10 or the overall 9 rating let alone a top 250 IMDb. Not that my one is going to make any difference .
10.0~I Just Want My Phone Call darlybrito Sign in Permalink After I saw Batman Begins, I became so obsess with movie. Batman Begins was my favorite batman movie, superhero movie and my favorite all-time. For some time, I had mix feelings about the movie when I heard The Joker was the villain. The reason was because I hated The Joker in the original batman movie. When I saw the first photo of Heath Ledger as The Joker, I then became obsess with The Dark Knight. Then I finally walked to the theater and I was blown away when I left the theater. After cleaning most of the streets in Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is finally set to finish the job in Gotham City. With the help of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent/Two Face (Aaron Eckhart) things look better than ever in Gotham until The Joker (Heath Ledger) sends total chaos back in Gotham. Batman is force to cross the line between hero and vigilante that leads to an ultimate showdown between The Joker and Batman. The story in The Dark Knight is so much better than Batman Begins. There are so many great themes in the movie that people and the world can relate to. Another thing I love about the story is that there is all kind of emotions in it. It was an absolutely thrill ride from the beginning to the end. The performances in the film are one of the best I've seen this year. After seeing Christian Bale in Batman Begins, I thought he was the best batman yet and he has proved it again in The Dark Knight. Bale did a great job playing Bruce Wayne's multiple personalities. Heath Ledger was absolutely astounding as The Joker. This is The Joker that I wanted to see in a long time. Ledger stole the whole movie and he is on my list for best movie villain. I won't be surprised if he doesn't get an Oscar, but he needs some kind of award for his performance. Your performance will be forever remembered. I thought Maggie Gyllenhaal was great as Rachel Dawes and better than Katie Holmes in BB. But I still think she did a good in BB, unlike others, they she was horrible. Also new in the cast is Aaron Eckhart aka Harvey Dent/Two Face. I really like his acting as Harvey Dent, Two Face was even better. I didn't expect that much from Eckhart, but he did shocked me and fans and did an amazing job. The action scenes in the movie are awesome. In my opinion, the Batpod chase scene was the best of all. I wasn't really sure about the Batpod before watching the film, but after seeing it on the big screen; I couldn't keep eyes off the damn thing. It is such a cool looking ride. The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie of the century and the darkest of the century. Heath Ledger performance was mind-blowing, terrifying, and fun as hell as The Joker. In my opinion, He is the best villain of all time. The ending really sets the tone for the whole movie and the music was so amazing. I say bring another installment even if it can't top The Dark Knight. A great story will do it for me.
4.0~My, oh my... Soysoy Sign in Permalink This is starting to be downright ludicrous. Another naked king makes it to the top of the charts, helped by massive publicity. This is just another generic action blockbuster, based on tired clichés. It's not different from, say, those old Schwartzenegger movies: it's just updated for current trends and mass appeal: more effects, more speed, more violence, more noise, more music, just more of everything (except the intelligent stuff of course). The whole thing takes itself so seriously, and even pretends to bring some, er.. philosophical insight (sic) to the mix. Yeah, right. You end with a product that is not only mediocre, but aggressively and arrogantly so at that! Yes, Ledger's acting is a treat. And there's even a ~30 sec. good scene halfway through the movie. Er... That's about it. "Overrated'" doesn't even start describing the irrational hype around this formulaic and forgettable action flick for teenagers.
6.0~The Most Overrated film I've ever seen! MovieMaster95 Sign in Permalink When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story. Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot. Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same. And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup. The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.
10.0~A-maz-ing ihatespike Sign in Permalink I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!
9.0~Holy Crap it was amazing. LostinMind Sign in Permalink Well me and some friends went to see the dark night. As we left the theater I left in silents. I thought and thought was this a good movie? Normally I can pick up every flaw a movie has and can easily predict what happens. But while watching this movie every time i thought i knew what would happen bam! total flip. Something unexpected would happen. So far this year the movies I watched i could have just watched the previews and could have easily said I have seen the movie. But with the dark night So much happens that watching the previews is not even close to what the movie is. The movie exceeded my expectations. Words can't come close to the awesomeness of this movie. It has it all Unexpected twists, Comedy, Drama, Insanity, Action, Romance. This is not like any Batman you will ever see. They say wants you reach the top the only thing you can do is go down. Not true with This Batman movie. With only 9 movies now made I believe Chirstopher Nolan is already up their with Tim Burton, Jonathan Demme, F.W. Murnau, Charles Chaplin (the little tramp), Ron Howard, and many more great directors.
6.0~Why IS it so serious? CuriosityKilledShawn Sign in Permalink Three and a half years after the hype, sycophantic reviews, and mass hysteria have died down I am now ready to review this film with a level-headed opinion. Is it good. Yes, quite. Is it the icon of intelligent summer movie perfect that the fanboys proclaim it to be? No, certainly not. The Dark Knight has faults, not the least of which is the unjustifiably bloated running time. With criminals in Gotham now looking over their shoulders (or should I say to the sky) for Batman, the crime-rate is gradually falling. But when anarchic, nihilistic Joker appears to stir things up between the cops and crooks the fight against crime is cranked up to the max. The Joker is out to create as much chaos as possible, not caring for himself or others. Meanwhile District Attorney Harvey Dent tackles the criminals as honestly as he can with Rachel Dawes glassy-eyed and Bruce Wayne competing for her affections. This is spread out over 153 minutes, and in long stretches you'll begin to feel every second of it. Much of this film's running time could have been trimmed and many scenes jettisoned. I know I am not alone in admitting that a sequence midway through the film involving dead bodies in an apartment and the re-building of a shattered bullet just confuses me. The sequence seems to come out of nowhere. I know Batman is supposed to be a detective but this was just nonsense. Nolan could have come up with a better method of leading Bruce Wayne to the trap with the window and sunshade. Also, there is a moment near the end when Salvatore Marone tells Commissioner Gordon that he knows where the Joker's going to be. Nothing becomes of this. You'd have to be pretty stupid not to connect the dots when it comes to the corrupt cops who sell-out Gordon at every opportunity too. Real lazy writing there. I just couldn't get involved with Harvey Dent either. His story, struggle, and motivations did not interest me in the slightest and I found the character flat and boring. Gary Oldman as Gordon also bored me to tears. What exactly are we supposed to like about this character? With the exception of temporally faking his own death he never once proved himself to be competent. I longed for the Joker to show up and put them all out of my misery. Not much of the dialogue is memorable. It sounds as if the characters are talking out to the audience while none of the words actually gel and no eye-lines connect. Little of it feels like a realistic conversation. It's virtually all just perfectly rehearsed movie dialogue from over-written comic-book characters. I wish that Nolan would stop shying away from violence. When you watch the movie closely you'll notice you never actually see anything. The pencil trick happens fast (and off-screen), no blood effects follow gunfire, few of the punches are seen connecting. I understand the need to keep it a PG-13 but come on! Aside from a car and helicopter explosion there aren't many deaths seen occurring on screen, most of the time leaving you wondering what happened (as with Gambol's death). There are entertaining and breathtaking spectacles within The Dark Knight, but take away Bruce Wayne and the Joker and you're left with nothing at all that could identify this story or setting as something that truly belongs in the Batman universe. Like Batman Begins, it's all so straight and brick-faced. I really ought to ask Christopher Nolan "Why so serious?"
6.0~except direction & BG music everything looks average in this movie ankit-iitpunjab Sign in Permalink first i tried to watch this movie 2 years ago (because of its popularity & rating & also m a big fan of bale & morgan freeman) , but i could not make upto 1 hour & switched off. Then after many of friends forced me , so i tried at least 15 times , even random clips from whole movie , but i didn't like it at all.yeah some of the dialogues were pretty good(mostly Alfred). i bored like a hell in every scene . i think people like this because most of other people like this movie (they want to fit in the common people) & some of them want to prove they understand "deep" acting by talking about joker. though his acting was gud , but that should not be the reason like a movie that much. & other people like because they like superhero sh!t . Because they have seen him from childhood & they love him .
4.0~If this is as great as everyone tells me, why do so many people agree with my criticisms! cosmorados Sign in Permalink Gotham is cleaning its act up, Batman is a successful crime fighting Legend, Jim Gordon is moving up the ranks and Harvey Dent is a tour-de-force for the city as its high flying District Attorney. Nothing can go wrong, can it? Well that it is except for a lunatic criminal called the Joker decides to bring chaos to Gotham, Batman is faced with a criminal who will stop at nothing to make a point and is seemingly always one step ahead of the Dark Knight, will he cross the line and kill to stop the madman and make Gotham safe, and will Bruce Wayne get to hang up his cape and get the happiness he deserves. After Batman Begins the scene was set for a bigger and better film to follow and after hearing all the hype I felt that this film could not fail ...I was very wrong. There are a number of issues that I had with the film that I have yet to hear a good defence for. The great films may not be liked by everyone for bizarre reasons but their criticisms are usually swept aside by the faithful. There are far too many errors in this film for it to pass such tests. I will address them one at a time, as one by one these spoilt the film for me. The first is that the film drags and drags and drags. Around the time of Batman's big decision of who he gets to save seems to be the perfect time to end it, on an Empire style ending, instead it goes on and on and we have about thirty to forty minutes extra to wrap everything up that the film simply doesn't need. End it with suspense, leave me on a high, but if I'm looking at my watch you've failed. Two, the performance of Heath Ledger is not all that. Yes, he is dead and this is sad, but the Joker we get in this film is sadly not the Joker of "The Killing Joke" or the Joker of "The Dark Knight", sadly it is somewhere in-between and this version is very mish-mashy, added to that the make-up changes from scene to scene when the jokers skin is supposed to be white all the time, also the make-up should make him look like he's smiling, DO YOU GET IT WRITERS, HE IS CALLED THE JOKER. Did he laugh that often in the film, I think not, he hardly smiled at all either, what's that for? For me, the big star turn in the film is by Aaron Eckhart who is magnificent as Harvey Dent and seems to steal every scene that he is in. Eckhart cranks the film up and makes it his own, and this is what increases the rating as it does. The action sequences that are so gripping in the first film are sadly lacking here as the editing to make it a lower rating and get more bums on seats have cut the films strongest feature to shreds. The last thing that really trashes the film for me is the end sequence with the Joker's final trap, as there is little explanation of how he has done this, are we expected to believe that the Joker is magic as that is what it feels like the director is saying. I'm all for big surprises but this was just too unbelievable, and I'm saying that about a film that has a man dressing up as a giant bat! Many of the people I have spoken to claim to love the film yet so few have any defence of the errors I speak of here, many of them Jump in and agree, and sometimes even add to the list, which annoys me for two reasons, because it will mean that more rubbish will get churned out that is supposed to be good and also because people's standards by accepting sub-standard films as good are lowering and we should always, as viewers, expect more, and pace, performance, writing and even make-up should all be first rate when $170 million dollars have been spent. Maybe many people feel that because there is so much hype for a film, and so much critical acclaim that they must be wrong for not liking it, when the truth is that the people who don't like it all that much are the ones who are right and those that just suck up to the critics view are very wrong. Thankfully I have been here before and faced exactly the same backlash 14 years ago for saying I didn't enjoy "Jurassic Park" which had similar levels of hype and got similar levels of public favour at the time of release. I find it interesting that it is now so very far down the rankings as, upon release, it was supposed to be the best film ever, according to the critics. No film could get a reaction like this on these boards without some element of over-reaction, and in this case it's to Ledger's death, the best time to judge this film will be in a year's time when the hype has died down, and for those who can admit they made a mistake to rethink their over-hyped ratings. Disappointing.
10.0~Hall of great villainy!! manoj-aryan Sign in Permalink The Joker roars "Come on, Hit me!!" as he staggers on the streets of Gotham with a gun and knife out challenging the Batman riding on monster truck 2-wheeler Bat-pod in movie's biggest action sequence. There is a polarized manic jolt in his voice that shots frisson of grit. In Christopher Nolan's terrific new film The Dark Knight fierce forces of evil and good are colliding just like that shot and like never before. This one is a hell of movie!! Compared to Batman Begins(extraordinary in every bit), Dark Knight moves out of lurking shadows and silhouettes setting bigger ambitious story on wilder canvas and into full blown reality. Rock star of the show is of course Joker. Late Heath Ledger embodying a perfect evil genius as one of the mesmerizing and memorable screen-villains to hit celluloid. A dangerous upshot of the Batman's crusading campaign - Joker is a supremely intelligent arch rival to Batman (riveting and irreplaceable Christian Bale) and Nolan places him right at the focal point of the plot. First two hours of movie are breathless. Joker orchestrates his own diabolical magnum opus in city of Gotham. At relentless pace we watch Joker throwing whole city in mayhem with his ingenious sinister schemes. Movie is a chase for Batman and a game for Joker. One after other ingenious schemes, Joker embroils heroes of Gotham with moral and ethical dilemmas to hammer on their faith in good. Nolan and Ledger made Joker so diabolical so complex he is not a mere villain, he becomes a force, vaults through the film, bringing Gotham on the brink of annihilation. And Heath Ledger is shooting on all cylinders. Uncanny performance by the late actor in his final, most celebrated and by far his best role. In all his fireball scenes, with sloppy make-up and jagged tone, delivering lines like flickering matches Ledger makes every inch of Joker hypnotic and terrifying. Loaded with dynamite screenplay by Chris Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan dazzles with sharp dialogues and strong characters. Batman genre has its genes in film noir (at one point we see Bruce Wayne doing ballistic analysis for the next clue) and finally we have a director who understands it. Nolan explores the dark lore with intense fascination. Apart from evil out there with arsenal, hero-villain dynamics forms the core of the film (director cites Michael Mann's masterpiece Heat as heavy influence) which is far more complex than one might possibly fathom. Movie delves on themes where these cops-criminals form a strong labyrinth connection to the point they need each other. There is a brilliant scene when hero and villain come face-to-face in an interrogation cellar where Joker tells Batman "I don't want to kill you. Youcompleteme." In Comic books city plays like a character, well, Gotham is no exception and Wally Pfister's cinematography puts a gorgeous film on screen perfectly capturing the texture of the comic book frames. Lee Smith's razor sharp editing so brilliantly done with challenge of several plots running never loses its momentum and dynamics keeps audience on the edge. And music score is operatic. These outstanding production values make a visceral,thrilling experience. This is so far the best film of the year. Movie's grand finale is staged on an unfinished skyscraper - Joker suspended on wires floating like a Gothic shadow figure in the air, his overcoat flowing like cape unravels it all for Batman. It is the intelligence. "This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. We're destined to do this forever", he says. It's fascinating to watch Ledger's devil at work. My favorite shot is where Joker leans out of a police car with his manic laugh, hair flowing in the wind, blurred city lights behind him and director has injected this sinister sound. This is a hallucinating shot. This is a hunting film. Ebert says Comic book movies live and die by their villains, well then the Joker and The Dark Knight are immortal.
1.0~The Dark Knigh- The Most Overrated 'Movie' of All Time!!!!!!! jonz_3 Sign in Permalink Ill give The Dark Knight 1 out of 10 stars, just so that its rating on the website will go down, because it doesn't deserve to be anywhere on the top 250 list. Its incredible that heath ledgers acting carried the entire movie on its feet while the rest of the cast tries to entertain us with mediocre acting, plain action scenes, bad screen writing, and the worst batman of all the movies, Christian bail with all his terrible speech impediments! I wouldn't think twice to consider this a 'film.' The original Tim Burton version is a film. it's sequel is a film. but christopher nolan puts a horrid scratch in the line of movies. The dark knight with its mediocre plot, character development, story, acting (exception of course for heath ledger) just makes for a not so epic 'movie' only worthy of a 6 out of 10 rating. The Dark Knight sucks! You don't understand film if you think this mess is an exceptional piece of cinema. And i hope that Daniel day lewis will turn down the joker roll for the next movie. they're getting the best actor possible to play the joker, hoping that he'll do the same as heath did, score 500 million in the box office. RIP Heath
10.0~Not enough good words to describe this film! fhcbaseball19 Sign in Permalink I honestly can say this is the first in a extremely long time that a movie actually met and passed my expectations, Star wars Episode 3 was pretty darn good though but it really was nothing was this film. Spidey 3 was awful, same with X-men 3, LOTR was great but a little long, and cloverfield was a downer to me. I have been blown away leaving the theater only 4 times in the last few years, Episode 3, No country for old men, The Departed, but the movie that takes the cake is The Dark Knight. Tremendous story, jaw-dropping action, all-star cast, one of the only movies that has a great start, middle, and end. But without a doubt, Heath ledger (RIP) carries the film and makes everyone else better he is in a scene with, his performance is one of the best of all time, no doubt about it. TDK leaves you with "man i cant wait to see that again." Which i cant, easily 10 out of 10. GO SEE IT NOW!! I saw the 3 15am show and it wasn't packed, which is was nice. Ledger's performance alone will take your breathe away! Thank you Heath for entertainment that no one could duplicate, wow. The great thing about this movie is that you don't have to be a comic book fan to enjoy, its a amazing crime drama. Go see it everyone!!!
3.0~very Over-hyped(might have spoilers) cmbstudio Sign in Permalink I watched the movie twice to see if my first reaction to the film is correct. The second watch confirmed it! It was awful. Christian Bale performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman was so cardboard. I'm a big Batman fan and what Christian Bale did to the character was a crime. The voice of Batman was just the beginning of the end for me. Here we are, we have the one of the worlds most greatest Detective and he couldn't figure out anything the Joker's hair brain schemes. Everyone died around this man. He saved no one! At least Michael Keaton's Batman gave Joker a run for his money(Joker:He stole my balloons!). But in this film, he made Batman completely incompetent. This movie should have been called the Joker's revenge, Because it was all about Heath Ledger in this movie. Heath Ledger did a great job. But it seems Christopher Nolan was so into his performance, he forgot about the rest of the cast. Fight scenes were laughable! anyone really in a suit like that and decided to fight crime would get they ass handed to them. Take notes from Blade!!!!!! Speaking of annoying casting, Maggie Gyllenhal was the most painful to watch. Her voice just pierced my soul like a piece of hot coal. Her trying to be sexy! LOL LOL LOL LOL! sorry i'm back! The Movie dragged! especially the last hour and a half of the film. Don't want to spoil anything, but the boat scene was drastically drawn & boring! The best part of the film was when it ended. I have no desire to see this film again. The bad part about this is I found others who felt the same way but so afraid to speak against this film like its the Holy Grail! Give me a break! So many better Superhero films. Spiderman 1 & 2, Blade 1 & 2 Xmen 2 Ironman Punisher Warzone & Incredible Hulk! was more true to the characters.
4.0~Not all that dark if I'm honest raypdaley182 Sign in Permalink OK, ignore the so called "great opening scene" of the bank robbery. It's good but its nothing to be spouting the word "brilliant" over. The 2nd scene with fake batmen is better but you don't know who the real Batman is, especially when he's talking like he's got a really sore throat or is doing an incredibly poor Clint Eastwood "Dirty Harry" impression. And that's what ruins his dialogue with Chief Gordon in the 3rd scene in the bank vault and in the rest of the movie in fact. Call me old fashioned but I like to be able to HEAR clearly what the lead character in a movie has to say. The movie looks OK, its suitably dark in places. The plot is average at best with The Joker robbing mob banks to get their attention so he can offer to kill Batman for half their money. Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker is unimpressive, its not this ultra-dark madman that all the critics & fans will have you believe it is. Cesar Romero's Joker was scarier than that. Jack Nicholson's Joker buries Ledger & keeps the shovel as a souvenir. Ledger's Joker is not only not scary he's also a liar who can't keep his stories straight. Like the story of how he got the scars on his face. That his father did it or that he did it to himself with a razor to appease his wife. In the scene where they are having the parade for the dead Commissionar is that Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh as one of The Jokers gunmen? We're shown Gordon is killed (and the movie just jumped the shark at that exact moment) and then Bruce Wayne offers to turn himself in as Batman to stop Joker's killing spree. Local District Attorney Harvey Dent organises a press conference then outs himself as Batman to the surprise of Bruce Wayne. During the prisoner transfer scene there's lots of views of Lower Whacker Drive so yet again this was filmed in Chicago and they obviously don't think anyone has ever seen The Blues Brothers. More vehicle chase and the ONLY good moment of Ledger's Joker is him demanding Batman run him down on the motorcycle then Joker is captured & its revealed Gordon wasn't really dead & he's appointed Commissionar. Telling Batman he's captured Dent & Rachel (Batman's love interest from the previous film) he then reveals where they both are so Batman can only rescue one of them. Batman goes to where he thinks Rachel is but it turns out that's where Dent is. Rachel is killed in an explosion (unfortunately her "dead" body blinks when we see it) and half of Dent's face is burnt (this is how he becomes Two-Face). Having distracted Batman & the Police away from the station Joker uses his phone-call to detonate a bomb inside one of his men then goes to find the Japanese Mob boss that the police had in custody. The trouble with the movie is it's at least 1 hour too long. It takes too long for Dent to become Two-Face, it takes Joker too long to put his millions of plans into action & achieve all their aims. Threatening the hospitals to allow Joker to get to Dent. The other back story (fronted by Two-Face) of 2 traitors within Gordon's unit (with the 2nd turning about to be Gordon's PA) is played alongside the main plot of The Joker trying to get people to kill each other is just one of the reasons why this movie is too long by an hour. You can't have 2 villains with 2 different agenda's. Pick 1 guy and 1 story and stick with it. In the hostage situation it was painfully obvious that the clowns were hostages as soon as Gordon looked at them through the binoculars (only a brain dead idiot didn't work THAT out in a microsecond). To have Batman attacked by dogs a 2nd time is just to return to the start of the movie (and whats the point in doing that so close to the damn ending!) and we already knew he'd improved the costume to be bite-proof so this was a pointless scene. The only really good scene in the whole movie is the reaction of the prisoners on the ferry (throwing their detonator out of the window). The conversation between Joker & Batman is too long and pointless, the movie should end right there (actually it should have ended over an hour ago but that's beside the point) but the director felt the need to close his final storyline with Gordon confronting Two-Face (not like Gordon ever did anything to Dent but why let a huge plot-hole like that spoil you dragging out the ending of your movie). Two-Face shows exactly how weak (for weak read "incredibly crap paper thin plot idea") his justification of taking Gordon's family is. When a villain is actually telling you the audience that his motives are crap, you (Warner Studio's) should really be considering sacking the person who wrote the script as he's completely derailing himself as having a believable motive. Two-Face shooting Batman is pointless as the audience already known his costume was upgraded with Kevlar after the 2nd scene. The ending (if you can call it that) is sheer crap. Batman telling Gordon to make Dent a posthumous hero & blame the deaths he had caused on Batman. Batman telling Gordon to send the police after him. And not finding out what happened to The Joker. An incredibly weak movie, WAY too long for its own good. Too many villains with individual story lines to follow. What little ending there is is left gapingly open to allow for a sequel.
1.0~Plot so thin, it passes unnoticed. rasmus-a-persson Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is not a good movie, by any measure. I will now proceed to provide reasons for this statement, in the process of which SPOILERS will abound. In this film Batman (The Batman, as the characters refer to him) possesses superpowers rivaled only by Superman: he bends gun barrels using his bare hand (yes, only one hand) and falls from ridiculous heights, not deploying his cape, and lands without as much as a scratch to his body. The Batman is apparently not aware that it is not the fall that kills you, it is the quick acceleration at the end, and no matter the quality of the Batsuit, that acceleration cannot be reduced. On the other hand, his kevlar Batsuit which, evidently, is impervious to bullets of small hand guns fired at close range, is unable to withstand dog bites. The Joker, whose obvious insanity is the only light of the movie, is well-played by Ledger who flares with his eyes and mouth to give him an almost rabid portrayal, but other than being a dark menace to society, his odd manners and, at one time, drag outfit, provide comedic relief in the film. Apart from being just a regular killing maniac, he also possesses superpowers of his own: in the film, he is depicted with an apparent and sporadic invisibility to police forces. That they do not notice his deformed face without make-up in their own ranks during a salute may be pardonable, but when blowing up an apparently unsurveilled hospital on prior warning and then leaving, in full make-up, in a school bus (his escape vehicle of choice, also from bank raids), his failed apprehension seems unpardonable. Unless, of course, all the cops had their lunch break, as the sun indicates it is around noon. The plot is so thin at times, you expect it to crack at any moment. It is like there are many small plots, in all of which Batman, the purported main character, plays but a small role. Whatever the Joker has been doing all his life, before going on a murder spree, is pardonable to omit, but when he breaks into Bruce Wayne's penthouse (probably using his cloaking capabilities), the same locale that a few scenes later will be referred to as "the safest place in town" by the same person who was tossed out a window during this same brief encounter, it is an interesting question just how the maniac and his armed gang are persuaded to leave the party full of Gotham's economic elite, something they must have done without causing much further harm as it goes largely unnoticed by the other characters. Batman speaks with a deathly voice, that is so ghoulish it could scare off any foe, would he just make more use of it against his enemies, and not blather like that to his friends. That he finally tracks the Joker down, is not due to any superior detective skills, as he gets good help from prying on all of Gotham's mobile phones that he immorally and secretly has replaced with his own brand, all in one night's work. More ridiculous plot element is hard to come by.
8.0~Batman just got really modern pbertovich05 Sign in Permalink This was the most hyped movie of the year and probably one of the most hyped movies ever. Even with the overhype I had to see Heath Ledger play the joker because the trailers looked awesome. So I finally paid my ticket and watched the movie. The movie starts off really strong, the opening scene was an absolute blast (literally). From that point on though I didn't feel the same action. The rest of the movie just seemed, drawn out and completely over the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in Gotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was something that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks it's brilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker from one place to the next, the joker must have had a helicopter or a really loyal taxi driver. One second he's here and the next he's on top of that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman showed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to show the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is now in every movie, an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft spoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as the scary convict on the boat. After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared and disappeared the movie finally ended, and it ended in a very cliché way. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film, thats never been done ever? and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie, being able to track people's cell phone calls. This little gimmick is in way too many movie these days. so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt, I wasted ten dollars on a cool movie, but one that wasn't as good as people claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough drops before showing up on set.
4.0~Dark? As dark as high noon on a summer's day koz-10 Sign in Permalink Well, maybe not. I won't bore you with any of the plot details, believe me when I say The Dark Knight will do this for you. Tedious, that's one way of describing this film. As well as insipid, dull, uninspiring, boring, and yawn inspiring. I seriously can't believe the ridiculously high scores given here. Did we even see the same movie? I'm starting to think not. The one I saw was achingly long, had A-Team level violence (you know, explosions and a lot of shooting but never any blood), and a hero who disguised himself by adopting a stupid 'I'm disguising my voice so you'll not recognise my lantern jaw' voice. Heath Ledger was okay. As in OK. As in not great. I half suspect that the only reason people are gushing over him is because he's dead. Anyway, this film has a LOT of flaws and certainly isn't anywhere near the masterpiece it is touted as being. I'll give it a 6/10 for some solid cinematography, -1 for being so damn boring and another -1 for failing to live up to any of the hype.
9.0~When the greatest figure is disfigured... and the mastermind is out of his... ElMaruecan82 Sign in Permalink I stupidly avoided "The Dark Knight" for ten years because it rose on the Top 250 at the expenses of my all-time favorite "The Godfather". A ridiculous fans ratings war resulted with "The Shawshank Redemption" as number one. Another uproar was to start when Heath Ledger's testimonial film failed to garner a nomination for Best Picture, despite being one of the most acclaimed movies of the year, the snub of "WALL·E" didn't help either. So the Academy expanded the number of nominees to ten, an effort as laughable as laudable, since not many new movies of the caliber of "The Dark Knight" were made after. That's to establish how pivotal the film was and how much I anticipated it. But I needed to re-watch the first Batman movies. And my ecstatic reaction after "Batman Begins" convinced me that I had another thing coming with "The Dark Knight". Indeed, the film is not just a good sequel but so good it makes you totally forget about it being a sequel. It's a continuation in terms of the narrative but it accomplishes something that a few sequels actually do, not the first anyway: it deconstructs all the values Batman stands for. If his heroic quest brings up the worst possible psychopaths, what good can he be for "Gotham City"? The film destroys whatever the previous film built up in a sort of constructive chaos, just when you thought that it would 'consolidate' Batman's heroic status, it does the exact opposite. Why? Well, the script has a saying about 'how things working according to a plan' can be as debatable and questionable than so-called chaotic turns of events, so our expectations are contradicted for their own good. And for our fun... if "fun" can be applied to the film. I think it can. But let's get back to the question of heroism. The film dissects it as if it was some philosophical essay and the answers are provided of course by the two most memorable characters: the Joker (naturally) and Harvey Dent. It's fascinating how Bruce Wayne aka Batman becomes almost a peripheral character but the deeper we get in these two alternative arcs, the more it questions the existence of the iconic vigilante in Gotham City, and the more it does so, the more it justifies its status as one of the most fascinating and iconic comic-book character. It's one hell of a virtuous circle thanks to a remarkably written script and a magnificently executed action-movie. Speaking of the awards, contrarily to its predecessor, it garnered many Oscar nominations and grabbed every possible award for Best Supporting Actor. There's no doubt that today, the Best Picture nomination would have been a lock, but I think the Writing deserved a nod as well, and even Aaron Eckhart is unfairly underrated as "Two Face", perhaps not as flashy and creepy as the Joker, but as tormented and complex as Wayne. And I love how Nolan doesn't keep on zeroing on Batman, he handles the supporting cast as importantly as the hero, because they might say more about him than he would himself. The film, along with "Spider-Man II" and "Iron Man" were said to have revived the popularity of comic-book movies, but I don't know if they are as daring as "The Dark Knight" in their critical approach to the hero. It seems like today, whoever is in the poster must be admired, glorified, must stand for something immediately deemed as inspirational and empowering. "The Dark Knight" puts these so-called strength and power into an equation whose resolution is a triumph of intelligence-within-entertainment. Batman becomes a hero in the way he acknowledges that the general public isn't ready for his heroism and would benefit from a hero like Harvey Dent despite this latter having surrendered to the temptation of vileness. But even this vileness isn't your typical "mua-haha" trope, although it features a lot of it. Like heroism, vileness relies on a state of a mind starting with feeling such as deceptions and resentments, we all have "scars" behind our smile so to speak. And the Joker isn't much a villain to be defined by what he does, unlike the 'hero', but evil by the way he enlightens us about the darkest abysses of our soul. See, some people can be funny by saying funny things or making points in a funny way. The Joker makes points in an evil way, and that's why he's so mesmerizing, and that's why Heath Ledger's performance is one of a kind. Many things can be said about Ledger but I loved that line from the New York Daily New by Joe Neumaier: "It says something about the curious nature of film, that someone can be so alive onscreen, when we're all too aware that they've passed away, how we are mortal, and films are immortal." I guess this is why this film is immortal and why Ledger had left this world with a performance that enriched our lives, featuring a villain who drives not only the action or the (anti)heroes' arcs but becomes a philosophical force whose appeal rises above the movie. Now, I ended the my previous comment about "Batman Begins" with an unlikely connection with the adventures of Scrooge McDuck, I'll say in the same fashion about "The Dark Knight" that it reminded me of that "Simpsons" episode "Lisa the Iconoclast" when she refused to reveal the truth about Jebediah Springfield saying that the myth has brought up the good in everyone, and that's what Batman and Harvey Dent indirectly stated, and what the extraordinary "bomb" sequence has illustrated (and God, what a plan!). It also reminded me of that sacrifice of Rocky Sullivan in "Angels With Dirty faces", one I wouldn't spoil here. Destroying your legacy is perhaps the greatest mark of heroism, when great causes are worth fighting for them... and being fought. Seriously, what can you do when the greatest figure is disfigured and the mastermind out of his?
8.0~Let Me Tell You About These Scars wessdread Sign in Permalink Being the Batman fan that I am coupled with all the hype surrounding Christopher Nolan's sequel to Batman Begins, it's only natural that I was a little disappointed in The Dark Knight. Before you read on, please know that this review is by no means looking to slam the movie. I ended up thinking it was quite good, but the few faults it had kept me from thinking that it was amazing. There's been a lot of talk about how The Dark Knight transcends the super-hero movie genre and has more in common with movies like The Godfather II and The Departed as opposed to the rest of the super-hero movies out as of late. When comparing a new film with the works of Scorsese and Coppola - much less one that has little similarity to either director's body of work - there is obviously going to be a bit of let down due to how high the bar has been raised. Once the movie started I quickly realized that it was not a gritty crime epic, which was kind of disappointing. It is, in fact, as super-hero movie. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Of course, there is nothing wrong with super-hero movies - I just happen to love gritty crime epics. On the flip side, this is probably the darkest, grittiest comic book movie to date (yes, even more so than Sin City - easily), and probably won't be surpassed as such for a long time. As the movie swings into gear, we see Batman running around in his clunky Bat-Suit from Batman Begins, which is thankfully shelved for a much better improvement twenty minutes in. Aside form being a bit too fragmented in its design, the new Bat-Suit is great, especially since it allows Batman a wider range of movement, thus allowing him to give thugs a much more severe ass-kickin'. My only problem with Batman, which also happened to be my only real complaint about the movie, was his voice. Obviously Christian Bale had to alter his speech so there'd be some sort of differentiation between Bruce Wayne and Batman, and of course Batman's voice needed to be menacing and darkbut it ended up just sounding kind of silly. It seemed like Batman had a really sore throat and was in desperate need of a lozenge. Fortunately, he didn't have too many lines - most of his character development was seen through physical action. Bruce Wayne ended up carrying most of the weight in terms of dialogue, which is fine since Christian Bale had Wayne's character down perfect. His balance between the facade of the care-free playboy and the burdened hero struggling to find his place in society and among his loved ones was seamless. The highlight of the movie though, without a doubt, was The Joker. If there is any bit of hype you buy into about The Dark Knight, let it be about how powerful Heath Ledger's performance is. His presence on screen was devastatingly intense. Before each entrance he makes into a scene, you can feel the tension bear down on you as you're waiting for the $%^! to hit the fan (which is in part thanks to the one bit of the score that Zimmer and Howard got right: The Joker's theme). Whether slithering around in the shadows or pushing his way on screen by force, Ledger's portrayal of The Joker maybe one of the most dynamic depictions of a movie villain I've ever seen. While most of the Joker's time on screen is drenched in morbid humor, there are a few instances in which his actions are quite unsettling  and even borderline disturbing. I also appreciated the Nolan Brother's subtle nod to Moore's The Killing Joke by establishing the Joker as the unreliable narrator. The supporting cast also did a very good job. The replacement of Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal did wonders for this movie compared with its predecessor. And in another positive step away from Batman Begins, Gordon's role took on a more serious tone, which resulted in a much more solid performance from Gary Oldman. Eckhart fit the part of the Harvey Dent very well - playing equally to his calmer, noble emotions juxtaposed against his vengeance fueled campaign for "justice". I only wish his make-up involved less CGI. Chris Nolan's decision to ditch Goyer as a writer in place of his little brother Jonathan, really stepped up the quality of the film's dialogue and gave us a much more water-tight script. Even at 2 & ½ hours though, I wished the film would have been longer. I felt myself wanting to know more about the smaller characters like Salvatore Maroni, The Chechen, & Detective Ramirez. And while the Scarecrow was by no means a pivotal character in the film, I wish he would have had just a little more screen time  not to mention all of the pseudo-Batmen. I really wanted to know the details of their back-story. Overall, The Dark Knight is a great film. Unfortunately its few flaws keep it from cashing in on its full potential, leaving it just short of phenomenal. Ironically, I think it's the best comic book movie to date. -Wess
10.0~The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted guerillagorilla Sign in Permalink I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel "Star Wars" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for "Dark Knight". Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, "Dark Knight" ably stands on its own with or without "Batman Begins". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City. Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman. Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks? Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the "Batman" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in "Batman Forever", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series. Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside. "The Dark Knight" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.
10.0~The Dark Knight blows away competition DarkWorldJazz451 Sign in Permalink I went to see The Dark Knight with a group of friends on opening day. We knew that we would walk out of the theater happy, but what we didn't know was just how happy, awestruck, excited, and eager to see it again we would be. The Dark Knight was an AMAZING movie from start to finish. Christian Bale is the true Caped Crusader in every way. He made another fine performance as Batman, and should by all means continue to be Batman. He is the greatest one of all. He has inner conflicts, as every hero should, and he also has the greatest nemesis of all time...The Joker. The late Heath Ledger deserves a posthumous Oscar for his role in this movie, for he stole the show, hands-down. I would sign any and EVERY petition for him to get this Oscar. The Joker he portrays is mysterious, psychotic, and a wonderful freak in every way. Though the Joker's past is made unclear in the movie, his present is an outstanding play of murder, robbery, and his twisted ideas of how to have fun. This was the finest performance in acting I have seen in a very long time. I was completely enthralled with his character, and looked forward to his next scene every time he was off camera. This movie would not have been nearly as good without him. Anyone who has not seen this amazing movie needs to see it. Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are excellent. Of course, I need not mention the wonderful acting jobs by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Gary Oldman. Four stars, ten out of ten, two thumbs up....and another movie pass, please?
10.0~Bat-A-Man! himaank Sign in Permalink There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker. A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger! The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost? Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style. The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending! Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!
1.0~The Age of Commercialism beautifulwind-1 Sign in Permalink There is not really any reasonable explanation why there are so many junk movies with ratings over 8 in IMDb except the fact that unfortunately we are living in the age of materialism and total commercialism. Before mentioning anything about The Dark Knight itself I should point out that the movie business started as an experiment and furthermore, it was (and I hope it still is) art. If you are a part of the lucky people that had the chance to watch old movies (starting from the early 1900s) then you probably have noticed that despite the bad quality the technique and the style of directing, cinematography, acting and "special effects" are fascinating. They are modern, sincere, effective, touching. That's where art starts and flourishes. However, if you take all the pointed out and replace them with high quality computer effects, deafening soundtrack, good looking actors, banal plot and the appealing to the masses simple conflict of Good vs Bad; well, here is where commercialism begins its unstoppable brainwashing system. The Dark Knight fits exactly the formula. Nothing more to say. To those who agree: There are still some great new movies coming out. It just takes time to find them. Don't be discouraged by the overwhelming amount of junk films. To those who disagree: Well, consider watching Casablanca, Silence of the Lambs, Amadeus, Star Wars :p, etc? To those who don't take a side: Now is the time to do so. To Heath Ledger: You were just great and sorry to know this was the last time to see you. [17 June 2009] Later ... Here now as I watched the film for a second time so that I would be entirely fair in my judgment I realized that 8/10 is a fair rating BUT and only BUT when The Dark Knight is rated on a different scale such as "Top movies based on a comics". And what is a comics other than a combination of a simple plot, good vs evil, black and white characters, lots of action? The end. When a movie has nothing more to add - no fair character development/acting, no original twists in the chain of events, no unique directing techniques... then one cannot give it more than 5/10. And since the IMDb has a great image the only way users can help keeping it safe and sound is by taking a little more seriously their voting rights. [30 June 2009]
10.0~Batman Continues spgarner Sign in Permalink Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker in the Dark Knight may have been one for the ages and certainly worthy the ensuing Oscar buzz, but I can't shake the feeling that much of the praise surrounding the Joker has been misplaced. While the focus on Ledger is certainly understandable given both his riveting performance and tragic death, not enough is being said about the writing and direction of his character. Writer/Director Christopher Nolan are the main factors behind one of the most menacing villains in movie history, which is no exaggeration. Discarded are the traditional motivations for movie villains, including greed, pride and revenge. The Joker is in it for something much more curious, entertainment. Many of the Joker's scenes of dialogue reminded me of the monologues of the recently deceased George Carlin, who claimed to revel in major catastrophes and saw massive human death as a form of entertainment. The reason Carlin's bits were so funny and the Joker is so fascinating is that both touch on a taboo that is the cause of much guilt in our society, which is that most people have some enthusiasm when other people suffer. It is not a concept most people are comfortable with, but the evidence for this phenomenon is undeniable. Go to cnn.com, and you will see that most of the stories with the most hits have nothing to do with public policy or global warming, but deal with sex and death. NBC's Dateline, once a beacon of investigative journalism has now turned into a role call of young, attractive, murder victims. Not that there is anything wrong with that. NBC is simply serving its audience, and so is the Dark Knight. The Joker is surrounded by a cast of criminals who he is almost bored with. He disparagingly calls them "schemers," "manipulators," and at one point he declares that Gotham City "deserves a better class of criminal, and I'm going to give it to them." It sounds almost altruistic, like he is performing some sort of public service. And it is true, the Joker is a better class of criminal. Next to the Joker, the other vicious thugs in the movie seem like small-time hustlers. Their motivations are boring, their actions are predictable, and they don't even have the type of integrity that binds good criminals together. They will turn on each other just to make a little money. The Joker, on the other hand, is more concerned with issues and behavior. He is like a mad sociologist. He murders an innocent person every night for a short period of time, simply to test the reaction of Gotham City and its vigilante hero, Batman. The Joker detests the criminals as well as law enforcement, because they make futile efforts to control society. He sees society as too fluid and unpredictable to be controlled as both sides would like. The Joker is a criminal genius who makes extensive plans for specific tasks but has no overarching initiative. No goals to build a criminal empire in order to gain wealth. In this sense, the Joker is a more sympathetic villain and certainly more watchable. I mean no slight to the late Ledger, but this is a pretty hard role to screw up. The Joker is just so intrinsically fascinating as are the other major players in the Dark Knight, including Gotham City, which this time, resembles a bloated Chicago. Christian Bale plays billionaire Bruce Wayne and his alter ego Batman, who has grown tired of the police's ineptitude in dealing with organized crime, so he ends it himself. This Batman is a more deep and mysterious Batman than the one I have seen in previous Batman movies (Unfortunately, I have not seen Batman Begins, though I now hope to see it as soon as possible). He believes Batman's main role is to provide a symbol of hope and security to the people of Gotham City. We get the sense Bruce Wayne would trade all of his personal wealth to keep the idea of Batman alive. He is a worthy counterpart to the Joker, because he is not interested in the possible vain rewards of his pursuits. Batman vs. the Joker is a battle of values. Structure vs. Chaos. Preservation vs. Disintegration. Self-righteousness vs. Indifference to human suffering. This is very deep film, indeed. I have not mentioned the other characters performed admirably by the likes of Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, and others, nor will I. I have only so much space, and what I admire above all else in the Dark Knight is its vision and inventiveness. There is just enough realism and just enough exaggeration in all the right places to create both a relatable and mercurially riveting story at the same time. Gotham City is larger than life and the only place complex and nuanced enough to be an appropriate stage for these two villains. It must be noted that while this is a Batman movie it is not a kids film. Many critics and other social commentators have cited the film's violence as the primary reason to deter children from seeing it. However, I would be more concerned with taking children to see a movie longer than two and a half hours with so many dark, complicated issues right on the surface of the film. Compared to the subject matter, the violence is quite tame. I can not give an estimate of what age of child should be permitted. It all has to do with the maturity of the child. If your seven-year-old is sophisticated enough to appreciate many dark elements of this film working in perfect harmony, by all means, take him. He will have seen one of the best fantasies he ever will see.
3.0~this movie contains all the clichés and failures of today's blockbusters martinmyfriend Sign in Permalink a big Joke ! First of all, can someone explain me why the camera is spinning like this all the time ? There is no reason to do that. Rollercoasters are fun but it never last 2 h 30. Christian Bale is not that good in this movie, and each times he uses his "batman's voice", it's impossible to take seriously. But why so serious ? Well...a little wouldn't hurt...and it'll never be as funny as the 1966 batman's version. The scarecrow part is not useful, so why bringing him back ? The part with the cell phone's sonar is lame, so lame you could cry... The end makes no point at all, and Bruce Wayne's sacrifice is just pointless. Well, maybe a tiny bit better than "batman begins", and the music is sometimes not annoying, these are the only good points. Ledger's interpretation is OK, but not well served by the rest, and the character of Twoface is too "cartoonesque". The balance is then pretty bad. I don't think there is any possibility in the near future to propose something comparable with "Batman's return", please stop trying !
2.0~Not what Batman is supposed to be HotToastyRag Sign in Permalink In Christopher Nolan's darker reboot of the Batman franchise, Christian Bale plays the masked hero. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine join the cast as regulars, with guest stars in each installment as villains or temporary females. I watched the previews for these films and never had any desire to watch them. To me, Michael Keaton is Batman, and no remake can ever compare. My brother practically forced me to watch The Dark Knight, after Heath Ledger won his posthumous Oscar, and even though he raved and raved, I remained unimpressed. To me, the Batman films aren't supposed to be that dark and disturbing. Batman originated in a comic book, and should therefore be accessible to children. Nolan's imagination of Gotham City does not keep in view of the original comic or previous adaptations. It has the same feel of the types of films that specialize in serial killers. My brother raved about Christian Bale's American accent. I'd heard him show his talent at accents in other films, so this gravelly-voiced performance didn't terribly impress me. The villains—Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow—were needlessly frightening and relied on gimmicks rather than acting. Heath Ledger's untimely death was extremely tragic, but his performance in this film didn't warrant a nomination, let alone an Oscar win. He had a lot of makeup on, spoke in a different accent, and flicked his tongue in and out so audiences would think he's insane. The tongue flick is as old a trick in the book as it is to chew gum when playing a bimbo. There are extended action sequences that showcase vast special effects, so if you only watch movies based on how impressive the special effects are, you will probably want to rent this one. And, to be honest, younger audiences will probably really enjoy the reboot of the series. They didn't grow up watching it as originally intended, and today's audiences have short attention spans that need to be sensationalized every few minutes. Older folks who liked the Michael Keaton movies should stay far away from these. Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to scary and upsetting images, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.
10.0~This is why we go to the movies thendoking Sign in Permalink When you pay for that movie ticket - you expect to be entertained and just so. The Batman franchise was re-energized by Batman Begins, and a wonderful film it was. But The Dark Knight takes the franchise to another level. It's an epic movie of powerful performances, spectacular cinematography, and breathtaking action all underscored by a well executed screenplay that stays faithful to the original graphic novel. Maybe this is where the real secret lies - staying close to the original novel. Performances from all the cast are strong - but Ledger steals the show with the a sinister portrayal of the infamous joker. In looking back it puts shame to the portrayal of Nicholson. How movie making has evolved. Bale is strong showing through the dilemma he holds as Gotham's dark hero - is it right to be a vigilante? In all -- the strong reviews are well deserved and to come back to the beginning - any movie goer looking for that elusive value for money will not be disappointed.
8.0~Ledger's Joker makes this a lot better than it probably would otherwise be zetes Sign in Permalink The sequel to Christopher Nolan's much ballyhooed Batman Begins, a film which frankly I disliked. It spent way too long on Batman's well-known backstory, brought in two of the worst villains from Batman's gallery of rogues, and edited together so choppily that it gave me a headache. The Dark Knight has won even better reviews and already scored a fanbase so rabid that it's hard to tolerate. No movie deserves that, of course, but we can't hold it against the film itself. No, it's nowhere near good enough to be called the best movie ever made. It's nowhere near the best movie released so far in 2008. It is, however, a marked improvement over Batman Begins, even while having some of the same flaws. Its editing is frequently poor, too. It has improved somewhat, but there were still some action sequences, most notably Batman's first appearance, that were difficult to follow. The biggest hole in the movie, in fact in every Batman movie so far, is Batman himself. I can't offer any advice myself on how to fix the problem, but Batman/Bruce Wayne is the dullest character. They try to inject some substance with Wayne's struggles with his own vigilantism and the way in which he keeps the cycle of criminality in revolution, but, in my opinion, it's rarely interesting. Christian Bale is a mediocre actor, and he brings nothing to the table. And the deep voice he uses as Batman is extremely grating and ridiculous. Add to that that the costume design of the current Batman makes him look like a linebacker. He just doesn't seem streamlined enough to be able to pull off any complicated martial arts moves. Of course, as you've no doubt heard, all eyes watching The Dark Knight are looking at Heath Ledger, who plays the Joker. The Joker is easily the best of Batman's villains, and Ledger has created the definitive Joker in this movie. I hate to say it, but Jack Nicholson's performance in Tim Burton's Batman is bound to be forgotten. The script overall is quite good, despite a clunky scene or two. It creates a fuller view of Gotham City and its strata of criminals and official corruption. And I love how it fits the Joker into this all, an "engine of chaos", as he describes himself, wanting to upset the good guys and the bad guys alike until nothing is left but total anarchy. The Dark Knight veers into the horror genre at times, and does so effectively. As for the rest of the cast, Aaron Eckhart is quite good as Harvey Dent. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are both as good as they were in the first film, in which I thought they gave by far the best performances. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, but unfortunately she doesn't improve this already undercooked role. Nolan's direction is fine, but I still think he's far better suited to the mystery puzzle films he's done besides the Batman flicks. I think any moderately good director could have made it.
8.0~The Dark Knight ---- Best Batman Movie Ever. big_poppa_hnoudis Sign in Permalink I have just come out of the "Dark Curtain" Screening for The Dark Knight in Adelaide, and I'm blown away. Nolan's directing is sublime, the pacing of the movie was so well kept, managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. There were several shots in the film that had me saying "Now how in the hell did they do that?!", Brilliant scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines, no one person steals the film. I don't want to say much about it, because whatever is said cannot do it justice, there is enough hype surrounding it's release, but it's there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves. 9/10.
10.0~The best batman film yet? Danpitbullk8 Sign in Permalink Firstly, I would like to declare that the Dark Knight should have had a 15 rating; the sadism in it and the vigorous violence wasn't met disappointingly by the British Board Of Film Classification. But hell, I loved it. A lot of hype has surrounded TDK after certain events which 'cursed' the set. But I can honestly say that every moment was tense eerie and unbelievably mind-blowing. Heath Ledger steals the show in his last cinema outing with the hideously sadomasochistic Joker; every moment that he's not on makes you impatient, because you know that his dark sardonic turns will be better and better. I can't say that the rest of the cast weren't brilliant though - the legendary celluloid giant Morgan Freeman, the witty cockney musings of Michael Caine, and of course Christian Bale as the husky protagonist, Batman himself. Every twist and turn is flawlessly delivered by director Christopher Nolan, and the sinister cynicism portrayed in the Joker's witty one liners will be repeatedly performed by many. Watch out for subtle nods to popular culture as well. All in all, I couldn't heap more praise on this unforgettable big budget blockbuster which is acquiring not only the contents of our wallets, but our hearts. Gripping stuff.
2.0~sorry, i couldn't take it seriously silvone Sign in Permalink You'll like this movie... if you're between 8 and 15 year old. In USA the age bracket can probably be extended to 18. I need to post minimum 10 lines of text here to be accepted as a review, but I'm not sure I have that many words about it. It had the same puerile plot as all super hero movies with an attempt of Shakespearean twist. The hero going to the deep voice when behind the mask (so people won't recognize him?! how about the crocked teeth?) wanted to be theatrical but to me it seemed ridiculous. I think the effort to make it a somewhat sophisticated cartoon produced a move too dark for kids yet too childish for grownups... but of course I am wrong based on the number of votes here that put it on the top 10 all time :)
10.0~An Oscar-worthy Masterpiece ka7 Sign in Permalink Stunning, amazing, brilliant, fantastic and perfect, even with knowing about all the hype going into the film it still blew me away from the very start to the final scene. I don't think I've had a film experience such as this before, where right from the opening scene which literally grabs you and pulls you into the screen, to about half way through you're completely submerged in the movie, with scene after scene just escalating the tension and delivering so much brilliance  what do I mean by brilliance? Well, everything from the story, the performances, the cinematography, the music, the direction  with no one thing overbearing another, just a perfect balance  how the hell did Christopher Nolan do it? Give the guy an Oscar, and while you're there make sure Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and Christian Bale are all nominated. The film settles down about half-way through or so and lets you take a breath but that only works to the film's benefit as it starts to build the tension again and heads for an ending that leaves you wanting more. The Joker was the perfect psychotic mysterious villain  R.I.P. Heath, who with this performance and his performance in Brokeback Mountain has convinced me that he was one of the outstanding talents of his generation and I wouldn't have been surprised if he had gone on to win multiple Oscars  it sounds like I'm just eulogising because he's gone, but I genuinely believe he had the ability to become the character in such a way that all you saw was the character and not the high-profile actor underneath it  that's difficult to achieve because all actors have quirks they carry with them from one film to the next, he seemed to be a blank palette who could metamorphose himself into whatever he wanted. In my opinion Heath and Daniel Day-Lewis are on a different level to their peers. If LOTR: Return of the King can sweep the Oscars, which it deserved to do, I feel the The Dark Knight should do the same. It's done what no other comic book film I've seen has done before and delivered characters with so much depth to them working evenly together in a story packed with plot and balanced with exciting action sequences. It's funny because I really didn't enjoy Batman Begins when I first watched it. I had in my mind the Batman films I'd seen before and Begins was such a departure, I was really disappointed with the film and also with Christian Bale as Batman, even though he's an actor I really like. After all the hype with The Dark Knight and with the excellent trailers I re-watched Begins and because this time I knew what I was going into I enjoyed the film and Christian Bale's performance more. I changed my rating from 5/10 to 6/10  maybe on further viewing it will go up to 7/10, but that's it. It's a film that deserves a lot of credit for trying something new, but it's flawed. The Dark Knight, on the other hand, is a masterpiece. Chritopher Nolan is a genius, not just for this, but when you include his previous films, I think it's hard to argue that he isn't the greatest director working today. There has to be a third Batman film, sadly it will have to be without the Joker, as any replacement would feel like an imitation of Heath and detract from the film, but despite that, it's still going to be a great film, you just know it. Chritopher Nolan can't do anything average.
5.0~The worst of them all valadas Sign in Permalink This is indeed the worst of Batman's movies just because they have tried to make of it the best of them all and failed. This time besides the lots of action and explosions and computer made effects all of excellent quality, they have tried to inject also lots of philosophy and morals in the movie. The former turned out very cheap and the latter rather manichean in the sense of drawing a straight line between good and evil like if it was black and white and tried to pass a message on that. These action movies have everything to gain if they stay just in the aesthetic area where they belong: to amuse and entertain and don't try to bite off more than one can chew, mainly their usual fans. We don't expect of these movies a deep story but only the usual cheap one so it's better they don't try to sell us something more than good action and excellent images and visual sequences. Furthermore the story in this movie is full of unexplained flaws and loose ends. It has so many loose ends indeed that when they try to tie them up in the end to make a plausible finale (happy or unhappy end that wouldn't matter) they are unable to do it and the movie ends abruptly in the middle of the story in a poor way (like if they think of making a further episode but that's what you do when you don't know what to do to end it properly). Let's hope that the next episode of this saga is more modest in its pretensions and is then able to be classified as a good movie.
2.0~The Joke(r) is on Us! ldavis-2 Sign in Permalink The Batsuit can deflect bullets, but it can't withstand a dog attack? Holy Wardrobe Malfunction! If I were Bruce Wayne, I would have kicked Morgan Freeman's backside back to The Electric Company, and sued the crap out of the firm that made the material that was supposed to protect my richer-than-God self from the likes of Cujo! But then, that would make way too much sense, and "sense" is something that the Batman franchise has never been accused of having! Say what you will about Tim Burton's and Joel Schumacher's Batman movies: at least they never pretended to be anything other than silly popcorn flicks. Christopher Nolan, on the other hand, wants to be Ingmar Bergman when he grows up -- which is why he rips off Burton! Don't tell me that ridiculous standoff was a happy accident, Ledger grunting "Come on, come on, hit me" à la Jack? Batman doesn't turn The Joker into roadkill because he has a moral code? Give me a break! And, for a self-proclaimed "agent of chaos", every one of The Joker's actions are oddly well-planned and executed. Memo to Nolan: look up "chaos" in the dictionary! Which leads me to Ledger. Since when does twitching like a coked-up Mexican jumping bean constitute acting? No disrespect, but let's be real: if he hadn't died, that truly morbid Oscar campaign wouldn't have sprung up, and he wouldn't have been nominated, much less, won. As I could never understand Ledger half the time because none of his directors had the balls to tell him to enunciate like a normal human being, he had to have been dubbed, because I actually understood every word he said! And it's "close to the vest", NOT "close to the chest"! Idiots!
7.0~Nolan's peak - as astonishing as people say. EijnarAmadeus Sign in Permalink I've just re-watched 'The Dark Knight' on Blu-Ray at home, and before pressing play I was curious if whether I would find it as brilliant as back in the cinemas. Chris Nolan's masterpiece didn't need 10 seconds before I remembered all the stuff I loved about it. The opening Batman-logo sets the atmosphere to a dark, twisted and ghoulish film that's got more character-complexity and emotional depth than any other superhero-movie before it - then again, 'The Dark Knight' isn't really a superhero-movie, it doesn't deserve being compared to the likes of Fantastic Four, Iron Man or that "incredible" hulk. This is a crime-epic that shows both sides of right and wrong, it's an action-paced story featuring plot-twists that gives that twirled experience of Nolan's earlier movies, like Memento or the Prestige - always capable of doing the unexpected. The performances is an ensemble of great actors, and off course, I have to give Heath Ledger all the glory he deserves for turning the Joker character into something so frightening, compelling and dark that it's instantly one of the all-time-high villains in cinema history. 'The Dark Knight' is simply a great, great crime-movie that showcases Nolan as truly one of the most brilliant directors around; this is his masterpiece as Soderbergh's 'Traffic', or P.T. Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood'. Hopefully, the Academy Awards will see just how great a movie this is - it's not just a knock-out punch in cinema entertainment, but it's as muscular and arty as any action movie made to date.
4.0~Boring olivercabo Sign in Permalink I am really astonished reading all the commentaries and the incredible average mark of the film. This movie is simply deceiving. When I first saw Batman Begins, I really loved it. From then I began to investigate more about Christohper Nolan and his films. I discovered also that Memento was directed by him, as well as Insomnia with Al Pacino and Robin Williams, highly interesting thriller placed in Alaska. Back to "Knight", I found it firstly too long. I went with 3 friends and all of them slept the whole last hour. Secondly, and probably the most important from my point of view, the plot is not surprising and of a quality you wouldn't expect from such an expensive movie. More, Christian Bale is not the same. In that film Batman as well as Bruce Wayne are poor, somehow sad, definitely not inspiring. Nothing comparable to his performance in Psycho. All the action scenes are the same, batman knocking and slamming with its legs, arms and fists. Where is the intelligence and slyness? The highly praised Heath Ledger is not bad, but the character, this new Jocker is deceiving again. Not fun, not subtle nor ironic, simply violent. To finish with, this film is too long, unnecessarily complicated, and if you see the images of the trailer, you have seen it all.
1.0~2.5 hours I'll never get back rsignal Sign in Permalink I'll keep this short. I rarely go to the theater, but with the hype I had to go see this. Batman and the Joker are invincible characters. You know they won't die. Plot hole: the police have the Joker in an interrogation room, with 30 officers on the other side of a 1-way mirror, and the Joker just killed the Mayor the day before. What do the police do? Any logical person in that situation would kill the Joker. Period. Just shoot him. I nearly walked out of the theater when the Joker escaped (imagine that!) Here's the thing. The Joker isn't a serial villain here. He's a terrorist. He's Osama bin Laden. Normal rules of police interrogation shouldn't apply here. And where's the military? the FBI? This story made no sense to me. Well I tried to keep this short. I want my 2.5 hours of my life back.
10.0~Yes folks. This is the best Batman movie ever. freaky_dave Sign in Permalink I don't believe that The Dark Knight is the top movie of all time on IMDb's top 250 list, but the movie should be there and pretty high. The acting was incredible by all. Even the smaller performances were great. THe storyline is one of the best in years for a comic book adaption. It's convoluted and makes us all think about the world around us and how things have changed since 9-11. The direction by Nolan is precise on getting these points across. I saw the movie two nights ago, and find myself still thinking about it. That's the sign of a top movie folks, and yes I think this movie deserves a 10 rating. Batman (Christian Bale) is back and still cleaning up crime in Gotham City with the help of Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman). Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the new district attorney, and he believes in what Batman is doing and is serious about cleaning up the streets as well. Of course when you start pushing criminals who have been in charge for so long, there is bound to be someone who will step up to try and bring Gotham back down. This would be the Joker (Heath Ledger). In an Oscar worthy performance that steals the show, Ledger's joker is totally deranged and extremely convincing in the role. Some have compared it to Anthony Hopkins performance in Silence Of THe Lambs, and that is not too far of a stretch. He believes in total anarchy, and a lot of what he says in The Dark Knight has a ring of truth to it. That makes him even scarier, and made me think a lot about our world and how it has become a much darker place. Christopher Nolan who directed and co-wrote the movie with his brother Jonathan, has to be given a lot of credit for The Dark Knight. He has created a sequel that is superior to Batman Begins and blows all the other Batman movies out of the water. You can't find too many sequels that are better than the first film, but The Dark Knight definitely is one of them. With Batman Begins, Nolan created a dark universe of corruption where good isn't always easy to find, but with The Dark Knight he goes even deeper into this strange fictional world that almost mirrors our own. He has a lot to say, and it isn't always pretty folks. Both Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles as Alfred and Lucius Fox, and are just as good as ever. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Rachael Dawes, and does fine in the part. In fact I found her portrayal of Rachael to be even better. The Dark Knight is full of surprises and twists. There is even the death of a main character, but I won't spoil it for anyone. Everything about The Dark Knight is top-notch. THere were many great films over the years, as I said above, so I wouldn't put The Dark Knight at the top of IMDb's 250 list, but it belongs on that list. Maybe not #1 or even top 10, but top 50 may not be too far off. And it is definitely one of the top 5 comic book adaption's ever. Highly recommended.
3.0~Too dark, too long and far too violent preppy-3 Sign in Permalink OK--this review will be FULL OF SPOILERS so please read it at your own risk. Batman (Christian Bale) is trying to clean up Gotham City with Police Chief Gordon (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman) and crusading D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). However a psychotic madman named the Joker (Heath Ledger) wants to take over Gotham (for no discernible reason) and kill the Batman. His plans get increasingly more diabolical, many people die and Batman starts to wonder if he can stop the Joker...and if he's responsible for him. OK--I realize the Batman movies are supposed to be dark--but THIS dark??? This movie is chock full of violence--people are casually shot to death left and right(but there's no blood so I guess that makes it OK). There are some spectacular stunts here but all the violence and dark tone rob them of any of the wonder they might have had. There's next to no light moments and the movie gets increasingly depressing as it goes on. And the Joker casually hurts or kills people with no warning. There's also a thoroughly despicable scene where a little child is threatened with a gun. This deserved an R--NOT a PG-13. The needlessly convoluted story doesn't help. The movie goes on far too long (lots of people in my theatre were checking the time during the last hour) and gets confusing. Characters appear and disappear with alarming infrequency and one character (the guy who was going to reveal Batman's secret identity) disappears completely with no resolution to his story! The Joker here is rightly played as a psychotic madman but Ledger is NOT good in the role. His speeches sound stilted and he's not really acting at all. His character isn't frightening--just incredibly annoying. I found it hard to believe that all these characters were stupid enough to buy his "explanations". Also he plans some explosions and plots that are just impossible--even in a comic book movie. Acting does help. Bale is just excellent--he's not getting enough praise for his acting. He manages to show Batman's anger and pain even in that padded suit and mask! Eckhart is just superb as Harvey Dent--and Two-Face later on. Maggie Gyllenhaal (taking over for Katie Holmes) and Michael Caine (as Alfred) were also good. Surprisingly Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman aren't that good. They seem to be phoning in their performances. Ledger--what can I say? He's WAY over praised. He was OK but all this talk of an Academy Award is just ridiculous! He wasn't that good. His death was tragic and I can't imagine what his family is going through--but a tragic death does not automatically make you a great actor. I basically found this movie too dark, too violent and even dull! Some of the acting and fantastic special effects can only work a little. This gets a 3 from me.
9.0~Terror in the Knight WriterDave Sign in Permalink Director Christopher Nolan has tapped into a cultural zeitgeist with his soaring "Dark Knight." No other director has shown so much ambition while working within the context of such an iconic name brand belonging to popular culture. By building upon the excellent framework he set with "Batman Begins" and adding in the chaos of the Joker (Heath Ledger, legendary) and the tragedy of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, admirable), Nolan, like Hitchcock before him, utilizes a B-level genre flick to tap into our shared cultural fears. Along with his co-writer brother, Jonathan Nolan, the director crafts a tightly wound tapestry that explores our archetypal fears of losing our identity and becoming that which we hate, while tuning into post 9/11 fears of terrorism, cowboy diplomacy, wire-tapping, and vigilante justice run amok. The cast assembled falls right into place with Nolan's epic and relentlessly dark vision of our current superhero mythology. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are again perfect in their supporting roles of wisdom and gadget providers, while Gary Oldman receives a surprising amount of screen time and delivers a sterling Oscar-worthy performance as the tormented Commissioner James Gordon. Replacing the dreadful Katie Holmes, Maggie Gyllenhaal is spry and feisty as assistant DA Rachel Dawes, but still seems out of place in her role. Bale is again brooding and effective as Bruce Wayne, though he gets overshadowed by the sly trickster that is Heath Ledger's Joker. Ledger is everything he's been hyped up to be. He's scary good and his insanely nuanced and subversively humorous performance haunts the film while his character terrorizes Gotham with a feverish intensity that is divinely married to Nolan's amped up tempo of thrills. The opening moments of the film fall victim to the typical trappings of a sequel as it tries to reintroduce us to the cast regulars while setting the stage for new conflicts. However, once the Joker starts playing his games, Nolan ratchets up the tension to a nightmarish effect that will leave your pulse pounding for two hours. With each terrorist act of the Joker and ensuing catastrophe, Nolan ups the ante, resulting in a film that is enormously entertaining while also making the obvious bloated runtime seem oppressive and nerve-wracking...almost as if the film is a terrorist attack against the audience... ...and maybe that's the point. With the opening camera swoop between skyscrapers zeroing in on a single window taken straight from Hitchcock's opening shot from "Psycho", Nolan tells the audience what they are in store for. Two more images, along with Ledger's ghastly scarred and make-up covered visage, seep into the viewer's subconscious. The first is after a building is exploded we see an image of firefighters spraying water over the scalding steel left behind that is eerily reminiscent of scenes from Ground Zero. The second is after a hospital is demolished, an image of the building's carcass on the television seems taken straight from the Oklahoma City Bombing. As we watch the harrowing Joker-less climax involving Batman, Dent, and Gordon, and knowing in the back of our minds what became of Ledger in real life, we realize that terrorism can not only come from without, but from within. Sometimes we are our own worst victims.
10.0~Why So Serious? When You Can Smile Because The Dark Knight Is Here And Because It Is Fantastic RainDogJr Sign in Permalink When I was a kid I taped the first Tim Burton's Batman from TV and I have truly great memories with that film (and with that tape), a 1989 film that I haven't watch since long time ago. I felt and I still feel an enormous admiration for Jack Nicholson and I think his joker was great but since I saw for the very first time Heath Ledger with the joker makeup and suit, I just loved the new joker. Yesterday I read again (now in a newspaper) the declarations of Jack Nicholson about the "new" joker and his words are even kind of ridiculous, maybe he was joking when he said that he should have been playing this joker since he can be easily the father or even the grandfather of Bruce Wayne. Today I saw The Dark Knight, on a midnight "special" screening just for the record, and even I still have those great memories of Nicholson's joker, I really don't remember feeling in the same way that when I saw Ledger's joker on the screen; he is absolutely fantastic just like this second take on Christopher Nolan's Batman, the second take and definitely my favourite of all the Batman films. Ledger's joker is the kind of villain, or better, the kind of character that you are just waiting for his next appearance, just to enjoy his presence on the screen and to enjoy the great character that is the joker. Of course as the joker becomes a character that itself makes a film worthwhile, he becomes the puppeteer of Gotham City, playing with the mob as if they were little kids and making a brilliant movement after a brilliant movement (the opening sequence is more than fantastic). This time Batman is not the protagonist but he is for sure the only one in who the joker feels respect or at least some excitement and the joker knows that Batman changed forever Gotham City but at the same time he knows how to play with him by making that Gotham City itself put the pressure on the hero and in this way Harvey Dent (a terrific performance of Aaron Eckhart and for me it was a surprise to see him on this film since I only remember him from Thank You for Smoking) will play a very important role since he is the real and new hero of Gotham City but he will live a situation that will mark him forever and that makes the film works in another level. And the joker likes to play on that level and is intelligence is simply amazing. The are some situations that are memorable in the film; I loved that the joker's origin is never explain and it seems that he arrives just to pull the strings and maybe it was because of his father or maybe because of his wife (I loved at both dialogs), who knows and actually it is not very relevant. But all of this comes back when the joker tries to put on his level "regular" persons and he succeeded for example with a cop who is full of anger when the joker ask him how many of his friends have died because of his acts but his most important success is on Dent who will try to put James Gordon in his same previous situation. On this level The Dark Knight is great with a story involving the classic corruption, the hopeless madness, the honesty and the meaning of the word hero yet the action is also great and exciting, starting with a memorable sequence, as I write before, just to grab your attention and it takes Batman, in a strange move, even to Hong Kong! But as I write before too, the joker's movements are just to follow and even we you don't expect anything he puts to the civilians the clown masks, tied guns in their hands and leaves everything for a civilian massacre. To talk about Ledger himself is kind of unnecessary since just after his suicide his joker became a cult character and also because we can resume all the performances in this film with only one word: great (I didn't missed Holmes and I'm glad that Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman and, specially, Gary Oldman are here again). The hype was huge and actually this is the first and probably the unique summer film that has that mentioned special midnight screening, you know to start watching The Dark Knight in the first minute of the day of its release (for the record, this is the first time that I went to one of this midnight screenings and I found some curiosities like that people likes them, the cinema was full which was really awaited, and that there are no trailers, you know to start exactly at 00:00), and that was my strongest card for this 2008 summer. I'm more than glad to say that I really loved The Dark Knight and on a personal level, this is my favourite Batman film ever. Tim Burton gave us two great films but now, well actually back in 2005 Nolan re- bird Batman and that was truly fantastic but The Dark Knight is even more fantastic. Don't miss the chance to see this one on the big screen!
6.0~Bombastic and explosive outing... but its corkscrew plot additions work against its complete success... ozjeppe Sign in Permalink Gotham City gets a new, bold D.A. (Eckhart) who is ready to stand up and stop its mob & criminal spread, plus a formidable, loose cannon of a villain (you know who!) for the caped hero to tackle. Bombastic, explosive outing in the new Batman-franchise, steered by Nolan's head-on serious approach and cutting-edge production values. Look-wise, this is what the comic book creation wanted all along! But its relentless pace and corkscrew plot additions (it's either just me getting old... or isn't it REALLY hard to grasp all its threads?) work against its complete success. In "Batman begins" - which I hold better - at least we got a chance to get a little more emotionally involved and contemplative before getting yanked right-left-right and blown away! Rousing ending and crackling dialog though, plus the appropriate mean streak, personified by the flamboyant, Oscar-winning performance by Ledger as the most disturbed Joker we're most likely to see on screen! 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.
7.0~Don't Believe The Hype! mamcglinn Sign in Permalink Somebody please tell me why does Christian Bale talks like hes taking a dump when hes batman.... i spent the whole movie waiting for the sigh of relief.. The writers were very unimaginative when it came to the jokers made up stories of how he got his scars.. Hes meant to be a Psychotic super villain...the jokers magic trick at the beginning was the highlight totally awesome but thats about it.. more things like that where needed in this movie. ledgers performance was OK he has a great laugh that suits the joker to a t.. but i wouldn't say best performance ever..and only think its getting so much hype because he passed away but the most ridiculous thing about this movie is the special effects on 2 faces face hahaha.. it looks so fake and i thought they were trying to make a realistic type of batman movie who ever designed Batman's motor bike needs to be fired out of a cannon i did love how the movie was filmed very dark like it should be it was OK just not awesome like everyone makes out
10.0~Surpasses "Begins" in every aspect!!! johnnymacbest Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy "The Dark Knight" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the "damsel-in-distress" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than "Begins" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than "Begins." The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.
6.0~The film that seems to have fooled everyone! rich-kemp Sign in Permalink OK, lets get it out of the way, I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?
1.0~Seriously? SPOILER voss76 Sign in Permalink OK I waited a really long time to actually see this movie.. mostly because of the hype.. I wanted to see if after all the long drawn out hype of Heath Ledger's death... its #1 spot on the IMDb boards.. and all the back and forth conversations on whether it or not it was the greatest film of all time... it could actually live up to that standing. The simple answer is no. 1. Writing 6/10 There are a lot of points in this film where the dialogue feels really rushed and just awkward. I don't understand why batman begins (which in my opinion far exceeds this film) could do everything right with the screenplay and this one fail so badly. The standard plot devices are there good/evil good as evil.. downfall of the hero.. redemption .. blah blah blah... its all been done before.. and I might add done much better. One quick film which comes to mind.. "There will be blood" used a very similar thesis of the antihero but did in a much more intelligent and beautiful way. 2. Visuals 7/10 Yes there are a lot of very impressive effects in this movie.. the tractor flipping being one.. and the whole opening sequence.. but again where have we not seen any of this before in a michael bay project or hell even the die hard movies? There is no signature to the cinematography and nothing which sets it apart from any other big budget Hollywood movie. Id say the most stand out moment of the entire thing was seeing harvey dent's face after the accident. 3. Characters 2/10 OK if hear a Batman talk like that again I swear im going to walk out of the theatre, What a horrible horrible disaster . Christian Bale sounded like he had one of his batarangs stuck in his throat. I don't know who decided on this plot device but it was a mistake. I don't remember any of this in Batman Begins and imo it really brought the project as a whole down. Heath Ledger was OK. Whenever an actor passes away prior to the release of his film of course there will be a strong tendency to have a biased opinion to how great he was. It really felt like he was overdoing it. If he took his acting down a notch I think his vision of the joker would have been much more believable. And possibly shooed him in for an Oscar nod. About the only really believable character in the film was Gary Oldman's "Jim Gordon" But than again anything he does his great. 4. Overall 5/10 A good action movie... But seriously overrated. 007 in a Bat Costume. PS #4 currently on the IMDb top100? Someone's getting paid.
10.0~The Best ... Hoseini_AmirH Sign in Permalink I think few movies can change people life. In different situation people get different affect of films so I suggest you to do not watch this If you : -Afraid of change -Afraid of mad living -Afraid of new life view And If you afraid of being me or new guys Thanks :)
9.0~The Joker is Real Andy4444 Sign in Permalink Watching the various Batman incarnations over the years, from the Adam West era, through the Superfriends, Tim Burton and Friends, and the very excellent Bruce Timm Batman: The Animated Series of the 1990s, we are faced with various versions of the Joker. The Animated Series Joker was voiced by Mark Hamill, and is considered by many fans to be the best Joker up to now. He certainly is creepy, and in the film spin-offs he does actually murder people explicitly on occasion, but though he is good it's hard to imagine him existing outside of the art deco alternate universe of Bruce Timm. He's just not unpredictable enough. He has steady henchmen who trust him enough to turn their backs on him. Jack Nicholson's Joker was well-received at the time, but he too suffered from a believability gap, in addition to being over the top and, while crazy, not quite creepy. Enter the Dark Knight's Heath Ledger: the freak make-up, the crazy, but disturbingly lucid philosophy, the complete lack of empathy for other people, and the scary practice of killing people for fun and without warning, his fondness for knives. I can actually imagine running into a character like this in a city somewhere. Certainly, not quite as complete, the real-life version wouldn't have the smarts to pull off so many grand schemes along with all the pure evil traits (you hope), but there are a small number of people out there who share some of the Joker's characteristics, and that's what makes Ledger's character so creepy, so scary. Every scene he is in, accompanied by music that would feel at home in any Hitchcock or horror film, is filled with a sense of tension and dread. What horror will he next bring upon the people standing before him? Who's next? Without a doubt the best Joker ever, Ledger's performance did not feel at all like a comic book superhero movie bad guy. I was thinking more like Hannibal Lechtur. Intelligent, lucid, menacing, and, I'm convinced, not really insane, but horribly sane, with a tendency to view life as pointless and thus amusing. Oh, yeah, the rest of the movie? That was good, too. Eckhart's Harvey Dent was also very satisfying, with no campiness to bring it down. His trajectory from ace prosecutor to criminal Two-Face is very well-done. Bale, Caine, Oldman, Freeman, and Gyllenhall are all well-cast. The action is better than Batman Begins, with the fistfight scenes in particular being easier on the eyes, with less spastic camera motion. The writing and direction is more along the lines of a crime drama or an action film than a comic book adaptation, and the story starts off with action and keeps you going for the whole 2.5 hours. Very dark, violent, and very well-done film all around.
6.0~The Very True Comment Lies Here; Read and See! kadirgorn Sign in Permalink I think the movie is over-rated.I see, it is probably the best action movie of Batman series but while watching did any of you get a clear idea of emotional background of the characters?!Did you see the true identity of Bruce Wayne?Did you get why Joker became a Joker.I accept that all the actors made a fantastic job but my criticism goes to Nolan brothers.They couldn't shape the characters well; I couldn't see any dramatic scene or dramatic view.Action scenes were really confusing and diffucult to follow.Burton's Bruce Wayne and Batman characters are the best ones so far.In short, no emotional sign from characters and full of action scenes.That's all this movie has.
8.0~A Knight is Rising tubby1 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a big and bold production. The great special-effects, sharp editing and affecting score sweep the film into a high-entertainment package. It is a vast improvement on Batman Begins reaching a higher level of storytelling. Although there are self-evident inadequacies in the script this is a breakthrough film. The Dark Knight is a long film, and in this respect it surprisingly fails somewhat to provide enough depth. Instead we do get scenes where the obvious ineptitude of the police enable the plot to continue as it wishes. For example, why is a police officer in the same cell as The Joker when it was entirely unnecessary? It therefore sometimes falls more into a comic book experience conflicting unfortunately with the superior film elements. However,if this can be forgiven (as I have) Nolan has produced a successful cross-over from his somewhat comic book feature of Batman Begins. Heath Ledger is stunning as The Joker providing the emotional context and thrills. The set-pieces are as grand as they are gripping. A minor point, which I could not get away from was a particular moment when Bale is discussing gadgets with Freeman, was this just me or did anyone else feel like we were watching a James Bond and Q moment? The Dark Knight is a breakthrough film it is more majestic and gripping than any of its Batman predecessors. It is a superior film of entertainment only hampered by its over long-running time but ultimately it is a triumph.
3.0~Dear Mister Nolan, and co, kubpink Sign in Permalink Man, what the f**k was that ! There was a time when you knew how to deliver real thrills, set like swiss f***ing watches. That was 8 or 10 years ago. I'd have followed you anywhere, memorized every bit of your films, man ! Now, you're trapped in the Hollywood prestige. That's a bummer, man! Though, I dig your style, man: the ideas you put in the story, with the help of your bro. The way you shoot. The actors (hail to Heath), the production too. I even like you trying to make this man fighting creeps disguised as a bat as real as possible, even though I don't like that treatment for such a story and I think that a film based upon a comic should feel as a comic. But, fair enough, transposing Batman's mythlogy to today's reality is pretty cool. But, Man, what a waste ! Where's your point ? Where's the point ? Why don't you push your logic to the end of it ? Why so many gaps, holes, ellipses in you're story ? Why so many useless plots ? I mean, I was really keen on seeing a REAL Batman, man, but why do you use real locations like that for instance : everybody who's at least seen Chicago once on a picture should figure that it's not Gotham here, it's Batman in Chicago. Every Londoner should figure that it's not an abandoned warehouse here where Rachel is trapped, but it's Battersea Power Station. Now you could have at least shown a chimney, damn it. And that bit in Hong Kong... lame. Looked like a f***ing Roger Moore's James Bond s**t. And why so paradoxical, incoherent: Batman hanging up the mask and then 5 minutes later he is after the smiling freak again. Did you really think we would eat that kind of script tricks ? Explain that to me, Man ! And I'm afraid, Mister Nolan, that you can't direct action sequences (and can't rip other landmark movies properly either). That score at the beginning, was an insult to such a brilliant movie that is Heat. And this truck flipping over, now, come on, tell me, you had just watch Terminator 3 when it came to your mind, didn't you ? All in all, you f***ed it up, man ! But the Dude abides, he will wait for the next one. Suggest though you do a J before. You know, take it easy, man ! Stop brain wanking a little bit.
10.0~Perfect in almost every way ReelsOfTape Sign in Permalink There are no flaws in TDK. The acting, the story, the characters, everything was absolutely amazing. The highlight of this movie is obviously Heath Ledger. His brutal, haunting and somehow charming performance perfected this movie. Christian Bale did great as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Though the character didn't emote as much as I thought he shouldve but its not CB's fault its the writers. Aaron Eckhart did great in the transformation of 'the hero' to 'the villain' Great great performance and cool effects on his face. All in all its a pretty amazing movie and i recommend it to anyone and everyone
10.0~152 minutes of excitement... it was about damn time!!! nagy-m-bear Sign in Permalink It was a while back since I ever felt anything watching a film. Some scenes are really creepy. And I am not talking about images of dead people suddenly appearing on the screen. Ohhh no... You know just about what's going to happen, and it still kicks... you know what. Great story with twists, and fantastic performances. The Joker is brilliant, the best villain ever!!! I don't think I saw anything better on film from an actor (not since Godfather). After the movie one of my friends said to me "I thought we will be bored with a 2&1/2 hour movie...". It doesn't feel like a long movie at all. The movie is creepy, exciting, thrilling... the best movie I saw since a few years back. Go and watch it, I certainly will watch it again myself. nagy.m.bear
10.0~Way better than Batman Begins burck_q Sign in Permalink The Dark Night is amazing. I have seen it three times already and I am going to see it again. I didn't like Batman Begins. I thought that the action was to fast and it cut away to much. This film still does that but it is easier to tell what is going on. The acting is great. Christian Bale is the best batman yet.Every time I think of Alfred I now see Micheal Caine. The real star of the show is Heath Ledger as the Joker. He is creepy, psychotic, and funny in a very twisted way. 2 1/2 hours may seem long but it flies by. This is the best film I have seen so far this year.
10.0~Praise for The Dark Knight douglasmisquita Sign in Permalink Hi, Just back from watching the Dark Knight and I must say it's so good that on it's own it could spawn the Batman comics rather than the other way round. The movie brings out the morbid relation between the Joker and the Batman very very well and how it should be! A must see for all Batman fans and I'm sure the others too will not be disappointed. Just one thing: I was longing for more of Batman v/s more than one goon at a time (like how Batman takes on Marconi's gang in the warehouse in Batman Begins). -- Douglas
1.0~Takes itself way too seriously leonardfranks Sign in Permalink Indulge me for a second here. Imagine that you're a studio executive, and someone is pitching the movie to you. And here's what he says: "All right. My movie's based on old comic books and is set in a fictional city. In it, there's going to be a rich guy who goes around fighting crime while dressed like a bat because his parents died. And then there's going to be this other guy who, for no given reason, dresses up like a clown, acts creepy, and goes around killing people. The bat dressing person is going to go around trying to defeat him by beating people up with his bare hands. Meanwhile, there's this other guy who's a perfectly nice lawyer, but then his face gets burned, so he decides to kill people based on this random coin that he has." It sounds kind of funny and interesting to you, but just as you're accepting it, the person suddenly coughs under his breath, "Oh yeah. And I'm going to take it seriously like it was Shakespeare and make it so depressing that it actively hurts the audience." I'm not sure if that's exactly how the meeting proposing this movie went, but it seems to be a reasonable guess. Let's face it. The whole story of this movie is patently ridiculous. It could not be more unrealistic if there were space aliens involved. And yet, it's still treated here as if we should be taking it as a serious parable of modern life, and that it should be used as a way to push really depressing messages across. How does a guy who beats people up while in a bat suit teach us about what kind of justice is realistic and effective? What does a weirdo in a clown suit teach us about the nature of evil? Why would anyone be proud that they kept campiness out of this despite the fact that it is a campy movie? Give me the days of Adam West. At least his show made me happy rather than depressed.
6.0~Bold without ever being especially great, and which progressively gets less-interesting; the film is a wild concoction of ideas that just about treads water. johnnyboyz Sign in Permalink Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: "you're not The Devil, you're practise" he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon. That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience. In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's "white knight", suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's "dark" but is just different in technique and characteristics. Joker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen. Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down.
1.0~Way overrated, Batman Returns allot better pp78855 Sign in Permalink I'm giving the Dark Knight a 1 to lower its overall rating. This movie was good but it wasn't great. When I think of great movies I've seen this one would definitely not pop into my head. First off Christian Bale is not that great as batman he seems corny and a little to cocky and is nerdy to me, actually made the movie worse . And what was with the nasally voice, what like everybody seeing half of the guys face doesn't give it away, but he has to hide his voice. Second Yes Heath Ledger passed away right after the movie and had the best performance in the movie and is a great actor besides the point, But to be honest lets not discredit Danny Devito what an amazing performance he did as the penguin in batman returns and one of the most underrated actors ever. Speaking of Batman Returns I actually love the movie and thought it was allot better than the Dark Night and I think michael keaton is a much better actor than Christian bale and was allot cooler batman. The worst performance in the movie was Maggie gyllenhaal what a boring, dull acting job she put on, I don't know if its just her personality but she was not very good and didn't seem like the effort was there, And again I thought Michele Feifer did a much better acting job and was awesome as catwomen. All in all this movie was at best a tiny bit above average.
7.0~Great fun, but woefully overrated Otto_Partz_973 Sign in Permalink I'm going to make this short, since all the praise has been heaped and the naysayers have also had their say. 'The Dark Knight' was fun, but good lord, folks...#1 of all time? Better than 'The Godfather?' More amazing than 'Star Wars'? Gimme a break. Heath Ledger earns his props. A wonderful interpretation. But really, if the poor guy hadn't died would his performance be arousing all this adulation? Batman, Two-Face...great fun, but right out of the comics, both emotionally and believably. As it should be. I didn't mind that poor Harvey is laying in bed with half his face burned off and is otherwise okay; it's a comic book. But I imagine that Bale & Eckhart are kinda scratching their heads over this one...they've both been better in more emotionally resonant movies. A bit long, a bit obvious (the creepy, white 'everyman' and the noble black criminal in the final act). A great time at the movies, yes, but this isn't 'Sunset Boulevard', it isn't "the Godfather, I or II. It isn't even the best superhero movie...I'd have to give that one to 'X-Men II' or 'Spidey II'. It isn't even the best Christopher Nolan film; 'The Prestige' gets better with every viewing; I don't know if the three hour 'Batman' is going rate a second look. Widen your horizons...rent a few of the 'Top 250' that you haven't seen, especially the vintage ones, and see if there's something more to cinema than you expect.
9.0~Worthy of its title..... Camnev Sign in Permalink It appears that Nolan has done it again. One of the most consistent, top quality directors, he continues his unblemished record with another stunning entry into his cannon. The Dark Knight follows on and, in many ways, betters his first outing Batman Begins. With his first batman film, it was clear that Nolan has emphasis on character development, so much so, that it takes a full hour before batman even dons his cape and rides the bat mobile. Naturally with the character already developed, he appears relatively quickly in The Dark Knight, but this only allows Nolan greater scope to delve further into the Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche. If the first film was about defining batman, this one is about his conflict. And this is what i believe is the best part about the dark knight. There have been some complaints that the whist the film is 2 1/2 long, there is little by way of actual plot - true, but what really drives this film is how all the events play on Bruce Wayne's mind. Nolans choices of villains are also clever in the way define batman. In his fist film Ras Ah Gul (?) helped create him, in this film the joker(a masterstroke of Nolans to cast Heath Ledger in his Oscar winning role - who would have thought?)is to test him. The ultimate question for Batman is - at what price does he have to pay to be batman?? But this being a batman film, there is no shortage of action and tension, right from the opening heist, no doubt a nod to Michael Mann's heat (even with the casting of William Fitchner) to the stunning chase through the underpass of Gotham. The film is so technically flawless, edited and shot with as little use of CGI as possible, a positive in my book as "real" stunts always give and immediate and more heart pounding result than any CGI can do. All performances are pretty much spot on, with Maggie Gyllehall a marked improvement on the light-weigh Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman - a contender for best on ground as Gordon, and Bale - solid as always. Caine and Freeman are more or less on autopilot. But this is Nolans film. He knows what works and few directors can put all the ingredients together the way he does. His commitment to story and chaster as well as the visuals is what sets him, and his movies apart. I can only hope that "the Dark Knight Rises" can complete what he set out to achieve with the batman mythology. If this is movie is anything to go by, then we are in good hands.
9.0~dark, daring, and dynamic didi-5 Sign in Permalink The hype has been OTT, but for once it is justified. 'The Dark Knight' is all you've been led to believe, and more. Christian Bale returns as the caped crusader, the vigilante looking after the streets of Gotham by night, and this time he has a new and dangerous foe, The Joker (played by Heath Ledger, of more later). This nemesis takes the Batman series into chilling territory, far beyond the bam! bang! of the old 60s series with Adam West. It's never been quite this dark before. Is this a film for under-twelves, as the British certification suggests? Absolutely not. For a start, it is wordy, with an intelligent script and involving characters, which might get little ones fidgeting. Then there is the violence - mostly implied, but unpleasant and set to give shivers down the spine nonetheless. You see some gore and through jarring music, sound effects and shaky video footage you can imagine a lot more. The worst thing in marketing this film to a young audience is glorifying knife killing, if you view a psychopath as a hero. Bale is OK, a little dry as Bruce Wayne, but more than adequate. Michael Caine reprises his role as Alfred and is not bad at all, although someone prepared to do another accent might have been interesting. Maggie Gyllenhaal is slightly annoying as Rachel, but since her character isn't there to do much, it doesn't really matter. And Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman are solid in support as Harvey and Gordon. Back to Heath Ledger. The publicity surrounding his performance in this has reached ridiculous heights due to his early death at the beginning of the year, but he really does steal the film and pull off an amazing performance as a truly nasty villain who manages to be comic in the blackest of ways as well. Whether walking away from a blazing hospital in a nurse's uniform with a detonator that keeps jamming, or taunting police officers from the floor of a jail, or standing in the path of a motorbike bellowing 'Hit me' his performance is absolutely electric and by far the best thing about this film. Could another actor have made the same impact? I doubt it. And that's what gives 'The Dark Knight', for me, the edge over other blockbusters this year. Seen on IMAX screens, it is also mind-blowing in its effects and scope.

10.0~great niellesdaniel Sign in Permalink Starts like breaking point continues as streets of San Francisco. Heath Ledger joker's role is absolutely brilliant and how Nolan's give him the best joker ever seen in the movies. Aaron Eckhart is the another ash great interpretation changing character as movie is going on. they broke my mind limit when joker is transforming Harvey two faces in the very one dark knight. Joker's Blowing hospital scene is amazing just preceded by the conversation with Harvey. This is the very first time comics movie have been realistically brilliant credible and spectacularly combined many genres. Thankyou Nolan's brothers and actors to have a great time in the cinema with you guys.
10.0~Bale = garbage, Ledger = the entire movie malik324 Sign in Permalink Even from Batman Begins, Christian Bale has made Batman significantly less cool. The phony voice he puts on makes him incoherent most of the time, and takes from the intimidation that Batman is supposed to have on the criminals he deals with. Ledger on the other hand, completely outdid himself as the Joker. I used to think that Jack Nicholson couldn't be topped, but Heath brought this true psychopathic quality to the character that made him seem less like a comic book character and more like a twisted terrorist, doing it all just for kicks. I can't even describe how well he transformed himself into the perfect psychotic mass murderer, with no regard for anything, just the fact that he had the power to manipulate fear and leave no one out of its reach. The Nolans did an incredible job with the script, making me forget totally that I was watching a superhero movie, as no one character was safe from the madness that overtook Gotham so completely.
7.0~Overrated ozumasirim Sign in Permalink I wonder why this film received that much positive reviews , compared to batman begins , this film is a much weaker one , The action is not that much as i expected, and it was not in good quality also , the plot was also weak , the origin of the joker is not shown in the film , however in such kinds of superhero films , describing the origin of the villain makes the story more interesting , at least a background of the villain could have been described to make joker more interesting . A joker without an origin or background is nothing but a psychopath,sadistic and an empty characther that creates meaningless violence ,an exciting violence that impresses the audience must be a meaningful one however , and this requires an origin of the villain.(remember the origin of jack nicholson's joker in batman 1989 , the background was fully described) At the fifth minute of the film , poof here comes the joker , what's wrong with him?,what happened to him? , we don't know , all we do know about joker in this film is his face, his laugh and his sadistic characther , which are simply not enough for one of the most famous evil characthers of all times. In addition , if we consider the amount and quality of the action films in the previous decade , the action in this movie was poor.Forget the previous decade , The terminator 2 for example is from 1991 and it was made as if it has much more technology than this poor dark knight. How about the other mob bosses , they are also very important and supposed to move with joker , they are completely ignored in this film , Salvatore maroni is an important characther in batman , however he is not even an interest in the film.He must have been. The ending was disastrous , terrible by all means , couldn't they think about a more creative ending? And how the hell this joker guy in dark knight manages to beat the whole city, it's police force and other mob bosses , with nothing in hand but a few punks? He has no army , no money , no guns nothing . 8.9 are you kidding?
7.0~Nolan's Genius! ashman-8 Sign in Permalink Amazing! Spectacular! IMDb no. 1! These words constitute only a part of most movie-related conversations over the past 3 weeks. The Dark Knight has beaten all expectations, broken all box-office records, earned critical acclaim and most importantly, has brought a huge smile to Batman fans everywhere. But, under all the hype, stripped off all the media attention and the huge spotlight placed on it by Heath Ledger's sad demise, how good IS The Dark Knight? The darkest version of Batman yet starts off with Joker robbing a bank. At the end of the scene, the Joker is probably established as THE person to watch through the movie. The 'new' Joker is definitely refreshing to see, as unlike past versions, Nolan's Joker doesn't play any campy, cheesy pranks. Neither does he waste his time with silly props. The Joker in The Dark Knight is as much a villain as Jack the Ripper was a serial killer. The story then slows down a bit, with action packed sequences popping in just at the right moments to make sure you don't get too lost just listening to the Mob drab on. Scarecrow is quickly (and quite rudely) pushed aside and within the hour, Harvey Dent is introduced as Rachel's new hubby (Beats Spideman 3 where Venom was introduced minutes before he died). Morgan Freeman gets a larger and much more prominent role as Lucius Fox and as is the case with Morgan Freeman, when he shoots a scene, the attention is going to be on him! That is, Lucius Fox ends up stealing Bruce Wayne's thunder quite a few times. The 'real' story starts when Joker decides to dedicate himself towards one mission - Batman's death. Like an alarm bell to wake those who managed to fall asleep during the slow bits, a corpse thuds onto the screen. Thus, begins the 'new' Joker's "jokes". Heath has brought a "REAL" element to the Joker that was missing in previous editions. Amazingly, Heath and Nolan have catapulted The Joker into Top 10 Villain lists while leaving The Joker as vague as possible. The various emotions he went through - smiling one second, anger the next, lust for pain and then expressionless - left most of the audience not knowing what to make of the Joker. The joker's mysteriousness, coupled with his insane (also meaning awesome) methods of 'serial-killing' left most of the audience on the edge of their seats. Oscar worthy? Win? Probably not, but a role that breathes life into a fading character should stand a good chance. Nomination? Definitely. However, for me, the real star of the movie was Aaron Eckhart. His portrayal of Harvey Dent was so real, picturing him as anything but a District Attorney seems almost impossible. He seemed to add something real to each scene he was in, whether he was battling Wayne, or supporting Batman, or just being your friendly neighbourhood DA, Harvey Dent seemed to be much more than a 'supporting' actor. However, his turn as Two Face towards the end of the movie slightly 'Dented' his performance. He seemed a little 'awkward' as Two Face, unsure whether to play him full of emotion or leave him as a stoic character. The coin toss though added yet another element to an already wonderful film. The rest of the cast - Bale played a good Batman, but was clearly outshone by his supporting cast (Dent & Joker). Rachel Dawes - Oh my God! Her topsy-turvy love life left possibly the only blemish on an otherwise perfect film. Excellent acting, horrible storyline for poor Rachel. Lucius Fox - Would definitely prefer him in a smaller role, as he kinds of takes 'away' spotlight from the others, even when he doesn't need it. Michael Caine played an impeccable Alfred! The Mob also played their roles well with the exception of a few and didn't take anything away from the film. Nolan's genius, last but definitely not least, has to be appreciated most of all. To take a movie franchise that had been beaten into oblivion by probably the most awfully made movie (Batman & Robin), with horrible direction and even worse costumes, Nolan has managed to turn Batman back into a real 'superhero'. Starting with Batman Begins, Nolan has perfected every scene till it couldn't be perfected anymore. And the absence of CGI, not only provides a 'real' look to the film, but makes it tons more amazing. So for me the cast would be rated: Nolan (Director)>Dent>Joker>Batman/Bruce Wayne>Alfred>Fox>Dawes Lastly, lots of people believe undue credit may have gone Batman's way thanks to Ledger's death. Sure, it may have exaggerated some views, but The Dark Knight altogether is really not that bad a movie at all. Really, not bad at all! All in all, an amazing film, definitely one of the top 20 I have ever seen and possibly the only one to leave ALL the characters engraved in the viewer's mind. Kudos to Nolan and crew!
10.0~incredible b_asm_1982 Sign in Permalink wow i have just returned from a advanced screening of dark knight,all i can say is wow, the entire cast is incredible with a stand out by heath ledger the joker was the best character acting i have ever seen so scary so sad and darkly funny. the action is outstanding the plot moves fast and there is never a dull moment simply put this movie is an instant classic. Christian bale performance as batman is the best i have seen while he is in ledgers shadow this cant subtract from a truly dark batman character.Aaron Eckhart's version of two face is great a real change from the batman forever version again it keeps with the overall dark angry feel to this movie. the big question is heath ledger performance is it Oscar worthy i believe so i just hope his sad death does't subtract from this great movie.
10.0~"The Dark Knight" delivers in every way... steadygliss Sign in Permalink Director Christopher Nolan continues his brilliantly redefined depiction of Batman and the world of Gotham with "The Dark Knight", the crushingly powerful sequel to 2005's excellent "Batman Begins". Everything about this movie is right on the mark, its elements fusing masterfully to create a work that far surpasses what might be expected of the typical comic book hero film. The movie wastes no time grabbing our attention with every kind of method that works, from intense action sequences to intelligent, necessary character development. Nolan once again selects an all star cast to create compelling characters that we can care about. Although the plot is basically a traditional good guys vs. bad guys routine, the movie is chock-full of character quirks and situational complexities that lend themselves toward the unfolding of not a typical action-thriller, but rather a comprehensive work of art. There are so many reasons to go see "The Dark Knight". The writing, the performances, the direction, the effects and the movie's setting...they're all top-notch. I found nothing about this movie disappointing, and I'm usually a pretty critical guy. Go see it. It's a juggernaut of talent right across the board. 9.95/10
10.0~If you only see one movie this summer yada yada yada... IamtheRegalTreatment Sign in Permalink Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: "If you only see one movie this summer, this is it". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period. I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle. Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely. So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again.
10.0~The Dark Knight cultfilmfan Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight is based upon the Batman characters created by Bob Kane and is a follow up to 2005's Batman Begins. I remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that I stated that I didn't even know if I would end up going to see The Dark Knight. After giving Batman Begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why I wouldn't want to see a sequel to a film I enjoyed so much. Well, when I saw Batman Begins in the theatres I thought it had a lot of style, action and kept me compelled and entertained and I found it a really good time at the movies. Hence the perfect review I gave it three years ago. Then, I saw it again on DVD and I did not like it at all. The thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things I enjoyed about it on my first viewing, instead on my second viewing I found parts of it boring and I started to have a few problems with the acting performances. I still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film, but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year I really couldn't have cared less if I saw The Dark Knight at all. Then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and I kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and I even heard of one critic who couldn't recommend the film because of how dark it was. This intrigued me because I have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that I would really like it ended up in me seeing it. And to my surprise I thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and I would most certainly call it a masterpiece. The acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late Heath Ledger who played the role of the Joker. I have seen Heath Ledger in other films such as Brokeback Mountain, or I'm Not There and to play this role he isn't more or less playing himself, but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the Joker says, does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. All of this is perfected by Heath Ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and I would compare his performance as the Joker to last year's best performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Day Lewis won an Oscar this year, so I see no reason why Heath Ledger couldn't get nominated, or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. His performance was one of the best parts of the film. What was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting, direction and cinematography was it's story. Instead of being filled by non stop explosions, high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects, this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including Batman himself. The character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldn't help, but be interested. The story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and I liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which I found all the more interesting and I liked how this film did not use formulas, or clichés and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. The Dark Knight really hit me and made an impression on me. Even days after leaving the theatre I 'am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. This is what I call a powerful, thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this. The Dark Knight is a brilliant achievement and I will go as far to say that it is the best superhero film I have ever seen simply because it is not like other superhero movies and this is also the best mainstream film of the year so far and I hope it is not shunned come Oscar time.
3.0~Rather predictable big-budget action flick that goes on too long. coldwaterpdh Sign in Permalink The excellent score, big money actors, impressive computer generated graphics and the death of Heath Ledger have obviously landed this film into a spot where, frankly in today's trendy, hype-loving, Hollywood-idealizing society, it squarely belongs. The fact that this film is number FIVE on the IMDb top 250...now that says a lot about who uses this website nowadays. Christian Bale's performance is unmemorable. His 'Batman' voice is over-produced and doubled-up to sound more superhero-ish. Maggie Gyllenhal is hardly acceptable as the film's 'belle' whom Aaron Eckhart and Mr. Bale both adore and long for. She isn't that great. (sorry Maggie!!!) Michael Caine seems bored with the whole project. The best actors are Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman who don't need a big budget mess like "The Dark Knight" to validate them as actors. Michael Keaton made a better Batman than Christian Bale. And now, I, The Lone Biker of the Apocalypse will spill the beans and skate on a sacrilegious razor blade: Jack Nicholson made a better Joker than Heath Ledger. By about an hour and a half in, I was looking at the clock, wondering when it would end. There are more twists and turns than a full season of "General Hospital," so many it hurts your neck to watch it. It comes across as being a jumbled mess in the end. Harvey Dent's fall from grace is so predictable you'd have to be a middle school student not to see it coming. And why the hell did they keep referring to Batman as 'The Batman?' That was just annoying. After all, I guess it was middle schoolers who have been on here giving this movie TEN stars. To say it was bad would be silly, but let me be frank: I am taking away 4 points just because I'm irritated at how overrated this movie is! To all you guys who told me 'you have to see this in the theater, it's the greatest movie ever made!' be thankful I was too busy last summer because I'd be coming after you for my ten bucks. 3 out of 10, kids.
3.0~A Movie for Superhero Fan Wannabes and Sheep King_of_Five Sign in Permalink Bleh. I thought 'Batman Begins' was all right. Not particularly good, but a nice way to waste a few hours. This one just outright sucks. After being hyped to death (pun not intended) between everything such as Heath Ledger's death and whatnot, I begrudgingly went to see this film. What a mess. Heath Ledger was a good actor. He did good with what he had. Unfortunately, he didn't have much here. The Joker looks absolutely horrible. The premise of creating a "realistic" superhero flick is outright idiotic. Superheroes were never made to be realistic. They were created for young comic book readers to escape the hardships of the real world and delve into a world of fantasy and mystique. Removing that fantasy and mystique turns it into a soap opera with masks. Basically, all we've got here are politically-fueled undertones. Yadda, yadda, yadda, Joker is represented as the terrorist threat to America, throw in some scenes of the destruction looking like 9/11 and have Batman confiscate the security of the people like President Bush and his Patriot Act. How juvenile and disgusting. So, if you life watching Heath Ledger look like a hobo wearing clown make-up, seeing Christian Bale talk like he's faking a cold, hearing Gary Oldman scream with a British accent as an American lieutenant/commissioner, and seeing Aaron Eckhart with a half-CGI head then this is the film for you! Unfortunately, millions have already flocked to it and claimed it is the greatest piece of celluloid to be projected on a screen since the concept of the movie. Shame on them. Also, Heath Ledger for a posthumous Academy Award for playing the Joker? Give me a break. You'd have better luck of Disaster Movie winning best comedy.
5.0~Disappointing sequel to Batman Begins mirjameulen Sign in Permalink After re-watching Batman Begins only recently, I was very excited about seeing The Dark Knight. Unfortunately, the sequel was nowhere near as good as the last film. Cillian Murphy, who was excellent as the Scarecrow in the first movie appeared on screen for about two minutes and was then written off - which begs the question "why include him in the sequel in the first place?!". Pretty much the same goes for Two-Face. There was a lot of potential for developing this character and it all started off quite well but once he actually turned into Two-Face, he got the chance to be the baddie for about 10 minutes before getting killed off. Heath Ledger was okay as the Joker, even though I personally thought he over-acted the role at times. Admittedly, there were some good action sequences and special effects but on the whole the story lacked consistency and did not really seem to go anywhere. A good example for this is the bit in Hong Kong which seems to have been put in to give Lucius Fox a bit more screen time. In my opinion there was too much focus on cramming in as many characters as possible rather than on developing a convincing storyline.
8.0~Eh, it was good, but very overrated Magmaheat Sign in Permalink Now don't get me wrong, I did like this movie. but really? Why does everyone think this is the most amazing superhero movie of all time? the movie dragged on for far too long and really wasn't as entertaining as movies like Spider-Man 2, Iron Man, or even the Tim Burton Batman films. In my mind, this movie doesn't hold a candle to those movies. the general plot was boring and way too serious, Bale's acting was horrible (He was much better in Batman Begins), and there was way too much dialogue. On the other hand, Ledger was amazing as the Joker, and the overall acting from the rest of the cast was good (With the exception of Bale and Aaron Eckhart. they were pretty bad in this one.) The action was great, although, at some points in the movie, I felt like I've seen it all before. over all, the movie was good, and I would've even considered it a classic at one point. but the overall hype of this movie seems to extinguish that notion from my mind. as I said before, it's a good movie, but not as amazing as people put it out to be.
5.0~Dark Knight shot in daylight truthseekers Sign in Permalink This movie was a complete turn around from Movie 1. Movie 1 has darkness, grace and sense of awe. The second movie was choppily edited, bad continuity errors such as bike driving into mall scene where it approaches window to smash through then cuts to scene where it hasn't even got near glass. Im thinking who edited this! The worst thing of all was the choice of daylight scenes all the time as opposed to the dark look of the first movie. Gotham might as well be Chicago, we saw no CGI strange skyscrapers and no monorail system. It looked too normal and helicopter shots of buildings looking sunny. Wheres the dirty gritty feel? No new weapons, no secret weapons that could kill everyone. The main character just uses standard guns, rockets and TNT, oh yes and some dogs. Wow. Real imagination being used here, not! No flashback scenes to show Batman in training years, no references to his youth and wrestling with his past... no references to the Jokers past or flashbacks to how he became who he really is now with his cut mouth. All just skipped past. I was left thinking Mr Nolan, is this really you directing this. It could easily looked like any other movie out there. I did enjoy the movie but its a pale 5 out of 10 compared to the first movie. A lot of catching up to do in the next one. Its a bit like the matrix, how do you top it. Well at least you try... not relax and start to get lazy.
9.0~wow!!! georgetobias88 Sign in Permalink Watching batman begins was really interesting and now after watching the dark knight on blue ray something struck me. I had to express my opinion on this film and yes here i am finally on IMDb writing my first review. The dark knight is a masterpiece and quality creative film making all bundled together with amazing performances and life like subtlety that makes the batman universe adapt itself beautifully onto the big screen. Director Christopher Nolan really knows what to do and maturity in film making is vividly described in this movie from the way the scenes progress to the tension in dialogs. The movie is just what other superhero movie directors need to portray whilst making a superhero action movie. Well I am not saying that other superhero movies are bad but when compared to the creativity portrayed in the Dark knight, wow other movies better stand back as the Gotham knight nails every other movie made ever. If you haven't watched it before well its time to dig up a hole in the ground and rather stay there buried as you always have but if you have watched it I am sure people will agree with me when I say roll on 2011 and bring out the sequel to this masterpiece.
10.0~Why So Serious? nymovielover1961 Sign in Permalink I read one review on here that says that they couldn't stand the movie because of the way that everyone moves their lips. Others say that it was "painful to watch," and that the script was "cringe-worthy." However, I say that this movie deserves all the hype that it it stirring up. It is, at it's core, just an action movie. But somehow, it manages to come across as a much better Batman than it's predecessors. Maybe this is due to it's all-star cast (which includes the much missed but praise-deserving Heath Ledger for his role as the Joker), but I don't think that the fact that such good actors are in the film is the only crutch the movie can stand on. It contains a message that some people, perhaps the people who gave this film bad reviews, are to distracted by something shiny to notice. There are different kinds of villains, and just as there are different villains, there are different heroes. They come in all different shapes and sizes, and yet we need them all for a society to really function. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the White Knight of Gotham. He is the best kind of hero because he doesn't wear spandex, yet he saves the day, he's a part of society, but he's not afraid to get his hands dirty. It's been three days since I've seen this movie, and I still feel a part of me die when I think of the fictional Harvey Dent being covered with acid while he had to hear the woman he loved say her last words. Before this movie, I knew Dent as Two-Face, and nothing more. But this film added depth to his and many other characters, one of the things that made it great. The Joker, who we know from the other films as absolutely cuckoo, also gains a bigger back-story. We begin to really see the madness behind that madman in the Dark Knight. And, with much "sorry"s to Jack Nicholson, I must say that Heath Ledger's Joker was much better than I'd expected, and much better than any other Joker. For once, the bad-guy explains his thinking without monologuing! How they did that is even shock worthy. As I mentioned, this movie doesn't lose all of it's action. The scene where Christian Bale blows up the truck and flips it over had everyone in the theater saying, without shame, "Whoa..." Yet, the action is on a level that no other action movies really are. The bomb triggers given to the passengers on the ferry boats conceal a thinly-veiled message to the viewers. "Are you willing to kill to save?" Of course, I believe that the triggers were really to their own boats. All in all, the martyr that Batman had to become and the film that enveloped that message, will always deserve the praise that it claims.
1.0~A Total and Complete Disappointment yarborough Sign in Permalink ****WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE*** This movie is a monumental disappointment. I had seen all five of the previous Batman movies on the big screen, and I watched as they kept getting worse and worse and worse. I hoped that this one would break the trend (and with all the raves surrounding Heath Ledger's "great" performance, I really thought it would), but it did not. This movie is so trite and so absurd, and what is most reprehensible is that it suggests that there is no Good vs. Evil anymoreas a matter of fact the movie closes with Batman himself being chased by the Gotham Police(!). And constantly throughout the movie Batman (now suddenly called "The Batman") is seen as being the reason behind all the murders, robberies, and destruction the Joker is perpetrating in Gotham City. By the way, Gotham City here does NOT at all look like the Gotham City that we know; it is Chicago pretending to be Gotham City, which is very boring. What happened to the stunning production design that Gotham City is supposed to have?!! As for Heath Ledger, he makes a great impact in one of his first scenes in the movie (when his sudden killing of a gang member serves as the punch line to a joke), but after that scene the Joker's energy totally dwindles away and he becomes another smart-aleck, philosophical killerand even downright boring. In an attempt to keep things entertaining with the Joker, the movie resorts to dressing him in a nurse's outfit (a cheap laugh). To make a quick comparison, "The Dark Knight" is very much like "Live Free or Die Hard" (and a million other movies) in that everything is on the verge of complete destruction and chaos at the hands of a villain, and like Die Hard 4 (When are needless sequels going to stop?!!!!) it tries to replicate the feel of 9-11a real-life tragedy that should not be incorporated into comic-book stories like Batman. Batman himself makes a pathetic showing in this film, as he is much clumsier and more ineffective against the villains than ever before. But then again, why should he even try when everyone is calling him a "vigilante killer"? When I was eight years old and saw the first Batman movie at the theater in 1989, seeing my favorite comic book character brought to life in such a stunning way was a dream-come-true. Had "The Dark Knight" been the movie that was released instead in 1989 (especially seeing Batman getting chased by the cops at the end), I would have been devastated. Now as an adult, I can honestly say I am disappointed.
10.0~Legacy left behind! Jerique Sign in Permalink A sequel to the uninteresting Batman Begins start of the reboot franchise is not only exceptionally better than the first, but may just be the best film in the last few decades and could be the best one of the next few. As an avid fan of the original series, minus Batman & Robin for obvious reasons, and an avid fan of Jack Nicholson's work, I was reluctant to let someone like Heath step into the spotlight and try and change the character and make everyone remember that character as Heath playing it. I was dragged to the film by a group of friends during opening weekend. The film starts out with Joker cleverly robbing a bank and outwitting his associates. A number of the actors from Batman Begins reprise their roles, spare Katie Holmes as lovable Rachel Dawes. In this film, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) has conquered Rachel's (Maggie Gyllenhaal) affections while Bruce (Christian Bale) conquers his future and present villains. The Joker plans to use the mafia as his aid to corrupt and destroy Bruce after attempting to make Batman reveal himself publicly. Harvey goes insane and inevitably becomes Two-Face. As Batman races against time to save the innocent, he battles two foes and his own demons. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine all reprise their roles. Although not initially wanting to see the film, I immediately fell in love with it. Heath beautifully played Joker and made his own interpretation of the character, and I'd say he did a better job than Nicholson. Aaron Eckhart overshadowed Tommy Lee Jones' work as Two-Face in the original series with his role here. Christian Bale grasps the character of Bruce Wayne while making Batman just as unique. Unlike other superhero movies, Batman and Bruce's voice are not at all similar. Overall, I praise Heath for a legendary job well done and hope that this film will be remembered for decades to come and people will still be talking about it 50 years from now. If Titanic and The Dark Knight were released at the same time, I am not sure Titanic would win financially. Superb job!
6.0~quite simply overrated da1tru Sign in Permalink good movie? yes. Greatest ever? not even close. Don't get me wrong, Heath Ledger gave an Oscar worthy performance that will be talked about forever, but this movie was extremely lacking in all other departments. First off the movie starts off with the extremely overdone film device where the main bad guy publicly kills off all the other bad guys he's with because he's just that evil and to get the audience to understand "hey this guy is seriously evil." Now this was pretty cool when Darth Vader did this like 3 decades ago, but this has been done hundreds of times in mainstream movies. Quit doing it. On top of that each bad guy is completely surprised when they meet their end. Then new bad guys who should be aware of this keep following him anyway. Despite killing off his own followers his numbers grow and grow. Then Bruce Wayne who is supposed to be this lonely reluctant hero goes back and forth from living the playboy life to trying to do the forbidden love story without any emotion at all. Then he keeps saying how he has brought the Joker upon the people of Gotham and it's his fault while he shows no emotion at all. If you write a story about someone who feels responsible for the deaths of others, show him drinking liquor, breaking stuff, swearing, etc. Don't just have Bruce Wayne walking around in circles saying "it's my fault, the Joker must be stopped" while doing nothing for more then half the movie. Heath Ledger takes this movie from an average comic book movie to a good film on his own, but that's it, this is no where close to the greatest movie of all time.
4.0~I actually didn't enjoy this movie as so many people have Purforlyphe Sign in Permalink To be honest this movie has the same plot-line played over and over again until its done till death, i liked the first new batman film more, although many people liked the pace, i thought it was actually very slow. Heath Ledger plays the Joker OK, but nothing special although the joker clips were a lot more interesting than the batman parts. I think this would have been a great movie if they had shortened it and stopped overusing that climatic building sound over and over again. I feel that the next batman movie will not be so great, and why is everyone making movies about superheros's ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------
2.0~Edited, shredded, scenes too quick. Edmund_Bloxam Sign in Permalink No scene in this film lasts for long enough to be able to appreciate the content, whether that be an action sequence, or the potentially-thoughtful dialogue. The end result is jerky, so much so that at times I even had trouble following the plot. This is a key example of how average scene lengths have shortened in contemporary popular cinema. Even if it just an action flick; and this film had the potential to be so much more, neatly balancing action with moral dilemma and questions of human nature; then it work far better if the audience could be able to see what was actually happening, to revel in all the special effects. And perhaps even the dialogue. It is designed to increase the pace of a film, to make it exciting, but there is no time to be excited or interested.
10.0~A truly unique superhero film jas82 Sign in Permalink Overall: In my opinion The Dark Knight far surpasses all films in this genre. It's truly a dark and sinister take on what has quickly become an over exploited film type, and actually makes the viewer care about what's going on, and gives the desire to see what's going to happen next. While movies like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, Spiderman, etc. will continue to provide decent entertainment during the movie, the Dark Knight (and the same can be said of Batman Begins) are movies that can be watched over and over, and still provoke the emotions you felt the first time you saw it. The Good: This movie is novel in that it split the focus between Batman and Joker. It wasn't your typical superhero movie that follows the protagonist until he/she confronts the antagonist. The Dark Knight is a hunt for the hero, rooting him out and exposing him in front of all, removing any ambiguity and also the "force" that drives Batman's ability to fight injustice. Bale, Ledger, and Eckhart play their roles flawlessly. They create an intricate plot that at some point makes each character consider who is really doing the right thing. Is the Joker actually to blame for what's happening in Gotham? Is Harvey Dent just as corruptible as the rest of Gotham? And what of Batman's tactics, are they ethical? Everything in this picture was pretty much flawless, the atmospheres and environments are rich and range from high tech bat cave, to dark dingy alley. The props are fantastic (again the same goes to Batman Begins), and the use of CGI is really not noticeable except a bit with Two-Face. The Bad: I didn't really care for Gyllenhaal in this movie. She was a rather bland Rachel Dawes, and while at points the emotion really flowed out of her well, I would have liked to see Katie Holmes again. I assume they picked Gyllenhaal because she looks similar to Holmes (especially at a distance), but I think that her cynicism in the movie towards Batman came off flat at times, and maybe I think part of it was that I was disappointed in her role at times. In the end, what happens to her is not what I saw coming, and I'm curious to see how they will fill the void in future films. Conclusion: See the movie! Even if you're not a Batman fan! I'm far from a comic person so I just like this series for what it is - great movies. While I wouldn't recommend bringing your small children (someone brought a baby to this movie and I was appalled) because of the pretty intense scenes and plot, most older people will greatly enjoy this movie. It deserves it's spot amongst the top of the 250, and this will prove to be a classic for many many years.
1.0~Epic Suck Bevan - #4 Sign in Permalink I don't know if this is the most overrated film ever, but it's the worst one I've seen in a long, long time. Almost as long as this steaming waste of three hours of my life. Let's review: * Suspension of disbelief is part and parcel of the superhero world, but c'mon. You're telling me this psychopath has recruited dozens of henchman, purchased mountains of equipment and rigged several hundred barrels of explosives in locations all over the city, and the world's greatest detective can't find a SINGLE BLEEDING CLUE without some Mr. Wizard cell phone stunt? Yeah, sure, half the cops are on the take, but are all of them blind, in this post-9/11 world? The Joker's band is comprised of escapees from an asylum, but they're all lean, mean, disciplined and competent? * This may be the widest ratio of screen time:plotfree of the decade. Too many characters. Too many side scenes. Too many random encounters. Too much exposition that doesn't actually expose anything. What do we leave this movie knowing? Anything? * The sheer quality was poor. Much of the film was too dark to see, and the sound was terribly spotty, yoyoing between blaringly loud and inaudible. * Yeah, Ledger did a good job, so stipulated. He still wouldn't have cadged an Oscar for it without the posthumous sympathy vote. * Finally ... this just blew a hole through the genre. Aren't the good guys supposed to WIN? They spend the movie losing ... dozens of people getting murdered, hundreds wounded and terrorized, chaos, mayhem, death and destruction and violence, and they pretty much lose at the end too. There's very little hopeful or uplifting here. 2/10, barely.
1.0~Most overrated Movie of all Time xea-00824 Sign in Permalink Hello Fanboys First of all, I'm sorry if my English is bad and I do mistakes, it is not my first language, I do my best. When I first watched the Dark Knight, people already called this movie the best movie of all time even before it was in the cinema. The hype was amazing, completely unreal. So I went to the premiere with my GF and some friends to see this "Masterpiece" Well, after 2,5 hours I can honestly say that I was never ever so disappointed and bored by a movie in my hole life. I even fell almost asleep. 1. The movie is completely illogical and irrational. I say that, because the movie don't want to be a comic book adaptation, it want to be more, and it is simply not working. It is way to serious to be a comic book adaption but way to ridiculous for a serious movie. For example the Dent into 2-Face Transformation. 2. There is no real plot in the movie! Absolutely none, nothing, not existing. I could have name every scene after 5 seconds watching how the "plot" will be. For example the beginning. After the first kill, you knew exactly how this will end. Or the boat scene, I mean is there really anybody out there who was impressed by this "twist"? If you have seen 1 movie before in your life, that scene cant be a surprise for you. I have limited room for this review but I could name hundreds of these not working mini plots and so called twist's. 3. The dialogues where extremely bad. Most of them where monologues and really pointless. I always had the feeling that the movie wanted to be "cool" by any means but had no idea how to achieve that properly. 4. The acting was sub-par. I would even say, Bale was horrible. I don't get why people say Ledger was such a good Joker. Okay, he died, we get that, and all the fans want to honor him, but please stay realistic. His acting was okay, nothing special. 5. The voice of Batman... Seriously, who finds that cool? It was simply hilarious and I felt ashamed for the director. 6. The movie looked awful. I really enjoy when I movies deliver nice screenplay and an awesome soundtrack, but that was not the case. Gotham looks like any other boring town, the trip to china was absolutely meaningless and just a waste of time. The batman costume looks bad and the joker is not freighting or funny or disturbing or whatever. 7. No emotion. The movie had no breath, no life. No drama, no good action, no good characters, no humor, just nothing. The movie simply had no soul. There is simply nobody I would really miss if they die in the movie. I have to admit that I forgot most of the characters names after watching it and that never happen to me when I watch a good, compelling movie. The only good thing about The Dark Knight was the soundtrack, but that wont safe the day. What should a good soundtrack do, when the rest is garbage? For me TDK is the most overrated movie of all time. I am amazed how easy it is to impress an audience just with some hype, a dead actor and tons of explosion. R.I.P Hollywood
2.0~piece of crap patmanaz Sign in Permalink 2 and a half hours!!!!! are you kidding? that time is reserved for great movies, not crap like this. oh yeah, movies must have a lot of "action", flashing lights and special effects along with gadgets. Of course batman always had the gadgets, but the fight scenes were pathetic, and the special effects made for 14 year old. "dude did you see that.....! no sense of where batman comes from, and the joker, why not show some of his childhood instead of him just telling it. noisy and juvenile. lousy effects and stunts. 2 and a half hours!!!!! are you kidding? that time is reserved for great movies, not crap like this. oh yeah, movies must have a lot of "action", flashing lights and special effects along with gadgets.

1.0~Dark, yes- but muddled story editing and choppy back-forth scenes sink this would-be classic. Akzidenz_Grotesk Sign in Permalink I give it one star because of the headache-inducing over-storyboarded and dull midsection. A botched directorial effort by Nolan. 1. Mid-point scenes of Harvey Dent character w/ Maggie Gyllenhall, scenes of Commissioner Gordon & cops etc. slowed movie down drudgingly with boring back-story- needed 20 minutes shaved off. 2. Batman fight scenes had elbow jabs galore and looked like a blur. 3. Choppy story editing in first half of movie swung from action scenes to modern high-rise scenes back and forth like a yo-yo. Felt like I was going up and down an express elevator- gave me a headache. 4. Not enough Joker in first half. (see first aspect) 5. Two-face should've lived, but the special FX on him were overkill. 6. The mayor, played by a too-young and effeminate looking actor with obvious mascara, looked ridiculous.
7.0~A 10 for Heath Ledger, a 5 for everything else bayou_hannibal Sign in Permalink Heath Ledger's Joker is the main reason why the first 90 minutes or so of this movie is so great. However, after an explosive action scene at that mark, the movie hits its climax, and then stumbles badly after that. Dark Knight is a movie that is about an hour too long. It has too many side plots, too many characters that we only marginally care about, and way too many outlandish and impossible Joker schemes. When I read all of the glowing reviews for this movie from both critics and fans alike, I am baffled by how these big problems have been overlooked. Maybe it was just the hype of Heath Ledger's performance and his tragic death. Whatever the reason, I think that in another 10-20 years, when people reflect on Christopher Nolan's career, this movie won't be thought of as highly as it is now. As The Joker, Heath Ledger gives a performance for the ages. He kills and causes chaos, but you can tell that he's having fun doing it. He seems to be immune to fear, and even when his schemes are foiled, you can never tell whether it's because he has actually failed, or because he has something else up his sleeve. I can't believe that people even compare Jack Nicholson's performance in the original Tim Burton movie to what Heath Ledger does in this one. Jack Nicholson was just Jack Nicholson with some makeup, stupid dialog, and bad jokes. In "Dark Knight", Heath Ledger creates an entirely new take on the sociopathic criminal mastermind that fits in perfectly with Nolan's more realistic take on this series. Unlike Nicholson and all of the other criminals from the '80s and '90s Batman movies, you would never guess who this actor is without his name in the credits. The Dark Knight opens up with one of the greatest crime scenes that I have ever seen. The Joker robs a bank with a gang of thugs, and brilliantly concocts a scheme whereby he gets away cleanly as the only survivor. The scene is suspenseful, with a streak of dark comedy. This is what I was hoping the entire movie would be like. Unfortunately, The Dark Knight is a slog when The Joker isn't on the screen. Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is that it introduces numerous side plots and characters that should have been left on the cutting room floor. There is an utterly worthless and mostly unresolved side story of an unscrupulous accountant who threatens to reveal Batman's true identity. The movie leads you into thinking that it's going to be significant, but instead, it's just a waste of time. Batman kidnaps a mafia accountant, which provides some cool spectacle, but then goes nowhere. Worst of all though, is the introduction of a second villain at the 2/3 mark of the movie. It does nothing but unnecessarily complicate things and take away screen time from the two characters that we want to see the most. I haven't seen much of Aaron Eckhart before, but if this movie is any indication, he's a terrible actor. As Harvey Dent, his "angry and emotional" act was so bad, I thought that it was part of an act within the movie, and that a plot twist later would have him working with the Joker. I was wrong. It was just legitimately bad acting. Some scenes drag on badly, as if Christopher Nolan doesn't trust you to understand what's going on without you getting beaten over the head with it. It's the same problem that he has with Inception. I can't give you much more detail than that without spoiling the movie, but I can tell you that I found myself looking at my watch at least a few times. Especially during the agonizingly long "explosives on the boats" scene. In addition to a meandering plot and a script that should have gone through a couple more revisions, The Dark Knight features Joker schemes that grow increasingly implausible by the minute. The bank robbery scene at the beginning comes across as genius, but as the movie goes along, the crimes get more and more far-fetched. The movie goes out of its way to point out to you how The Joker works with mental patients and other crazy people, but he still pulls off some of the most ingeniously executed schemes of all time. By the time that this movie ended, I no longer thought of The Joker as a genius, but as a beneficiary of lazy script writing. The Joker's absurd schemes are a Deus Ex machine that Nolan uses to keep The Joker out of prison while endangering innocent civilians. I realize that it is a comic book movie, but this is supposed to be a gritty, "realistic" take on the genre. If you are going to have a monologue in which The Joker recalls a traumatic incident that he experienced as a child, don't turn around and enable him to rig up thousands of pounds of explosives at a hospital without anybody noticing. After I saw this movie a second time, I watched "Batman Begins" for about the tenth time, and it is striking how much Nolan's work has deteriorated since then. Batman Begins has a much better script, with a much tighter story and a lot fewer scenes that should have been five minutes shorter. The Dark Knight is widely regarded as the better movie right now, but as time passes, I think that people will view it differently. With that said, I did enjoy a lot of it, but this movie is mediocre, at best, aside from Heath Ledger's performance.
9.0~A Superhero Masterpiece... fearfulofspiders Sign in Permalink I don't think there has ever been a more powerful superhero film made to date that equals the greatness of The Dark Knight. Simply put, one must see this film. Even had someone not heard of the amazing portrayal of the Joker by the late Heath Ledger from the numerous high praise, they would still be flabbergasted at his incredible performance. Besting the choice of Christian Bale as Batman, Ledger is quite possibly the soul of this film, as each time his character makes an appearance, the room will go quiet and your heart will sink, pondering what he will do next. The story is basically Batman fighting the advancement at what seems to be an inevitable anarchy brought on by the Joker's ever-evolving mind. Harvey Dent -- the soon-to-be Two-Face -- James Gordon, and Batman each resemble a point on the morality spectrum, and as the plot continues to unfold, one must question what will happen to our heroes. Making this fantasy grounded to reality. There's hardly any CGI in this film, where it would be used is sometimes hard to be seen. The vast majority of the action and scenes are filmed with live everything. A brazen but ingenious choice by Christopher Nolan. Well done... well done. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard provide a similar sound from Batman Begins, in that a lot of the themes used in that film have been incorporated here. There's a few new bits of music in here, such as the Joker's theme and a rousing battle cue. Overall, The Dark Knight is everything one could hope for in a superhero film. This is a dark film, probably not viewable for a child under 10 for the wicked left side of Dent's face once he has become transformed. With the ending, one can only pray to the heavens that Nolan will do a third, and pick up where we left off.
7.0~Ledger is fantastic; the rest is boring and forgettable at rest EvilLost Sign in Permalink EVERYONE said this was good, and I mean everyone. So I went and saw it (luckily with a free ticket). Needless to say, I was so disappointed I had to write this review. Firstly, Ledger is amazing. Every time he spoke the screen captured my attention. I completely underestimated his ability throughout the film. Secondly, the plot has many MANY **MANY** (read that: MANY) plot holes. Its like swiss cheese. I don't wish to write any spoilers, but suffice to say that nearly every scene, while they do contain transitions, is just barely connected to the previous. Dent's makeup was a bit over the top as well I felt. ------------- The REAL problem with Dark Knight is the film itself. The plot, for how grainy it is, is still connected and very dark; yet the film is always BRIGHT. In most scenes everything is well lit, whites are shining, etc. This is easier to see while watching the film, but it felt as if no manner of actual camera-work was done to set the mood. A simple filter over the shots, or the lighting moved to the background would have gone a long way...but nothing in any shot showed any real emotion - colors are just all very bland, and often inappropriate.
10.0~TDK review liranb9 Sign in Permalink Bravo! finally, this truly was a quality film, the acting, directing and writing, this film is like something you've never seen from a superhero / comic book adaptation films. Let me start with the acting, Heath ledger... everything has already been said about this performance, yet he still managed to surprise me, what a performance, hat's off, he really does get under your skin, created (togather with writers of course) the perfect joker, or at least the one i wanted to see, dark, psychotic and a maniac. Aaron Arkhat (or however you spell his name) also gave a strong performance as Hearvy Dent, and the other cast was pretty solid. The script is just great... this is truly one of the best films if not the best that portrait the battle between good and evil, between what right and wrong, and about making the right choices. Now, retrospectively, i am really disappointed with the trailers for this movie, they composed different sentences to give it a more intense feeling and gave a lot of the action in the movie... sure they were great, but also gives you high expectations for this movie... and i hate coming to a movie with high expectations, so a little let down in that aspect. and yes 2 hours and a half did feel a bit long. That been said, TDK is a fantastic movie (sure it has some flaws, but what movie doesn't) its well written, directed and acted, action packed and even epic in a way only time will make it. Overall this is a MUST SEE movie for anyone that has a little sympathy for movies. 9.7/10
8.0~Heathe Ledger's "Joker" is a must watch! Marc_Israel_365 Sign in Permalink Heathe Ledger's "Joker" is a must watch! The film is based on finding out why he creates such havoc on Gotham City and the rest of the cast of characters allow the mystery to develop and reveal itself. Not a comic book fan, but Batman on film seems to be an apt cinema comic-book translation. The straight forward emotions are not conflicted with todays' complications leaving the actors to walk a fine line over stereotypes. The pace is fast and the plot a bit satiated, but it delivers everything it promises. Who cares what happens to Batman as when the Joker goes out of business, the movie has little intrigue. No worries, however, as Christopher Nolan sends us all off with thoughts of sequels!
10.0~Darkest "Knight" dee.reid Sign in Permalink "The Dark Knight" may or may not get the title for the greatest superhero film of all time (questionable, but I still hold that 2004's "Spider-Man 2" is the greatest), but unquestionably what will forever make it memorable is that it features the much-talked-about final performance of Heath Ledger, who passed away tragically from an accidental drug overdose earlier this year, thus making "The Dark Knight" a must-see at the movies this summer. His performance here is the film's shining achievement, although strangely enough he doesn't get that much screen time in a movie that runs 152 minutes and he's only on screen maybe half that time. (In what is) Probably the most beloved adaptation of the DC Comics character created by Bob Kane and who first appeared in "Detective Comics #27," Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is again battling the forces of evil as the Dark Knight of grim Gotham City, aided in his endeavors by several loyal confidants including faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine), Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), and inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Things get underway when a bank robbery (a la 1995's "Heat") involving clown-faced goons yields a new and terrifying menace to law & order in Gotham City: The Joker (Ledger), a disfigured criminal mastermind looking to spread chaos and destruction and bring about the downfall of the Dark Knight. Meanwhile, Bruce (forever brooding) is vying for the affections of ADA Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes from 2005's "Batman Begins") against Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's on his own personal crusade to rid Gotham City of crime and corruption. At a hefty 2 1/2-hour running time, director Christopher Nolan seemed to throw everything into "The Dark Knight," even in one interview I read calling this film this series' "The Empire Strikes Back." Perhaps an accurate assertion, since a lot does happen here but occasionally this oft-brilliant and mesmerizing film is prone to stalling in its quieter moments (and believe me, there are some). I do find it quite odd that since we're talking about Gotham City, one of the darkest places in comic books, there is an amazing amount of light, since many of the action scenes take place in broad daylight rather than under a menacing cover of darkness. The sheer brilliance of "The Dark Knight" is the belated Heath Ledger. Like Brandon Lee in "The Crow" (1994), this film is a testament, it is the last great work of a truly great actor and he will be missed. As the Joker, Ledger is cold and calculating, and truly menacing. He's evil and madness incarnate, and who could forget his now-classic "Why so serious?" "The Dark Knight" is far from perfect, I already mentioned the overly long running time and the seeming tacked-on rise of a deadly new villain, but the performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker and some stellar acting from the leads definitely makes this Dark Knight, the Darkest Knight for comic book superhero movies. 10/10
9.0~A paradigmatic movie! viharg Sign in Permalink I am less thrilled by the special effects or acting excellence. What captivated my attention was the multilayer plot of the film. What is violence? Is it funny? What is justified repentance? How do we distinguish the heroic from the humane? The Dark Knight is the first film in many years that has succeeded in sending a universal message, or rather, in asking universal questions. Hollywood has rarely been so sophisticated and yet quite clear in its message: it is a complicated world out there, and crossing the bridge is sometimes final. The Dark Knight is indeed an entertainment movie. Yet it has the essence and the depth of a modern classic.
1.0~A good movie, just not what it was hyped to be. someguy_84 Sign in Permalink As far as cinematographic masterpieces, this is not one. This movie is not in a the same league as movies such as "The Shawshank Redemption" or Schindler's List." It is enjoyable, but only the last half. The first half plays to be predictable and foolish. When I go see a Batman movie, I want to see an entertaining flick, not one trying desperately to be deep. Heath Ledger's 'Joker' is a joke. He will not win an Oscar for this, and he shouldn't be nominated. Any one who has read the comic books knows the Joker is not scared because of a knife wound. He does NOT try to mask his appearance with makeup. Nolan's idea of a distraught application is myopic. The reason The Joker has a more colorful appearance is due to an accident involving acid, which bleached his face and colored his hair and lips. "Batman Begins" is much better and a more entertaining way to spend your time.
1.0~Horrible davidtkrauklis Sign in Permalink This is one of the worst movies ever made. If you think that it will be as good a the original I urge you to never watch this. Heaths over the top ridiculous performance as the joker was not Oscar worthy, but they gave it to him because he died and robbed him in Brokeback Mountain. The use of the Harvey character was pathetic and Christian Bale is one of the wost actors to ever play Batman. His Bruce Wayne is the only redeeming quality of the movie, other than Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordan. The whole movie is trying to be more epic than it is and this leads to a terrible storyline and pathetic use of special effects. I would recommend watching the original batman with Michael Keaton any day. Don't waste your time with this crap written by Nolan, he is a hack. Unless you like Batman sounding like he is Satan... don't watch this film
6.0~So Much Potential... jpriest75 Sign in Permalink I will admit, when I first saw The Dark Knight, I was blown away. However, after repeated viewings at parties, I noticed things that were corny or unnecessary, and some things that didn't make sense at all. I will explain exactly why this film deserves almost none of the ridiculous amounts of acclaim it has received since it's release. I will start off by saying that Heath Ledger gave a career-making performance in The Dark Knight. Though he was an incredible actor, I sincerely think that he never would have been able to top the Joker. This role stands out to me along with my other personal favorites, such as Hannibal Lecter (The Silence of the Lambs), Andy Dufresne (The Shawshank Redemption), Annie Wilkes (Misery), etc. The opening bank heist scene was the last real interesting moment of The Dark Knight. Seeing goons with clown masks robbing a massive New York bank definitely grabbed my attention. When the Joker was revealed, with his face-paint and devious smile, I was drawn in. But, after that moment, the film mugged me and left me standing in the rain. The Dark Knight was an involving, but not an overtly moving film. The story was nothing more than an amalgam of action/superhero film clichés, bland supporting characters, and weird technology, snowballed into one, giant of a Hollywood blockbuster, fueled by one great performance and a few cool fight scenes. Harvey Dent has earned himself a full paragraph in this comment. I... Hate... Aaron Eckhart. This mediocre actor does not look like, sound like, or act like a person that could be associated with a film such as The Dark Knight. He simply lacked the morally twisted personality of the Harvey Dent that the film depicts. Also, what they did with "Two-Face" as far as character origin really irked me. I realize that Chris Nolan wanted to stray from the original batman films, but leaving the scarred by acid concept untouched wouldn't have hurt the film any. Harvey's resulting injuries were unrealistic and ultimately unbelievable. (His eyes and teeth were not discolored or mutilated in any way, which is impossible for the amount of flesh missing from his face, and he would have succumbed to crippling infection within an hour of leaving the hospital.) The line at the end of the film, spoken by the Joker, really hit me on a physiological level. He said, "This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object." This is a reference to Gotham's blaming of Batman for murders and accusing him of being a menacing vigilante, and also their turning to him for help when the Joker overruns the film. This message is a deep one indeed, though I think that Mr. Nolan had wasted it, along with his superb directing talent, on an utterly stolid film. In summation, The Dark Knight was not a terrible film, it is just vastly over-hyped. In the technical aspects, such as cinematography and sound, it excels tremendously. However, to say that it is a masterpiece of American cinema is highly inaccurate, and to place at number SEVEN on the top 250 list is both ignorant and disrespectful to all of the great films that it outranked. I recommend you watch The Dark Knight, as you will probably like it much more than I did, but, if you are like me, you will walk away remembering nothing but the Joker's demented laugh and a plethora of explosions.
7.0~Not deserving of top 250 duncanp-1 Sign in Permalink Dark Night is not a great movie. It is good yes but does not live long in the memory banks. I stumbled across this title being in the top 10 tonight to my disgust. The good the bad and the ugly is in the Top 5 40 years on, Ask yourself will anyone even remember the Dark night in 10 years?? Ledger gave a stellar performance and Bale was strong. The editing and script left a lot to be desired. Patchy with a lot of holes in the story. Where did the joker go during Harvey Dents party? Did he just walk out? I am highly critical of this movie due to its high standing on the top 250. For the Dark night to be truly appreciated you must watch Batman Begins first. 7/10 and that is being kind
6.0~Too long...I just wanted it to end fallyhag Sign in Permalink Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman. But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking "but that wouldn't happen".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it. The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on.... I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end. Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into. Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website. Would I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum.
1.0~Sadly we need to keep giving this 1 star till it lands at 8.? jplatten Sign in Permalink Until it drops below the Godfather, the Good, The Bad and Ugly and any number of other films that are just that bit better in an historical context. This does upset me slightly as it is in itself a very good film as the other reviews say. The Ledger is Dead / Batman Fans just went a bit overboard with the 10/10 scores at the start leaving us poor schmucks at the back of the queue to mark it down to where it should be. What do I think? Honestly? Well 7's on IMDb are usually a good watchable evening's entertainment 8's are things you would make a point of staying in for, tipping or buying the DVD and anything 9+ is one of the best movies ever made. Yes, this one is an 8.something for sure as I would go out of my way to watch it again. ...But the scoring correction continues so 1 star it is :)
1.0~People Come Back to Reality!!!!!! MFDrummer Sign in Permalink Im giving this movie a number one not so much thats it awful but that its completely over rated. You people on here need to get a grip with reality. It makes me sick to see how out of hand everyone here has become with the death of Heath Ledger. I come across many "fans" of Heath Ledger who tell me how great he is this movie and how he was so talented and how they were huge fans. Oddly not anyone can tell me that they have seen Candy or much less even heard of it. Candy is I feel Heath Ledgers best role. So for all you "fans" of Heath Ledger I recommend you take a look see at that one. Look The Dark Knight is a good movie but better than the Godfather it will never be no matter how many 10's you give this movie.
3.0~Great start, but then it gets ruined csarter-2 Sign in Permalink It starts with a pretty good story line, and good characters, Batman, the mob, the joker, and the attorney are all OK. There are great actions scenes, the kidnapping "over the air" in Hong Kong is really cool. But after the half of the movie, it turns down: the attorney's girl friend gets killed, OK, and he gets crazy, after 20 years fighting crime, he doesn'st know about casualties? in front of the gangster, he shoots his driver: non-sense! he kidnappes the most honest cop's family: non-sense! voting for survival in the boats : total non-sense! and what do excellent actors like Oldman, Caine, Freeman in such a waste ? Sorry, i'd like my money back..
3.0~A Matter of Perspective anthony_retford Sign in Permalink I sat down with this movie after knowing that most people loved and seemed to venerate it. But I have a lot of perspective. I was reading Batman comics back in 1957, and I have seen all of the greatest movies ever made. This just isn't one of them. I did not care about anyone. The action was remorseless and unnecessary, one could even say gratuitous. I even turned it off by the 2-hour mark because it got so maudlin and disjointed. I did read something about people voting this into fifth position of the greatest 250 movies ever made, and clearly this shows the weight of current voters who have little experience with good movies. Why, they should be asked, does Citizen Kane, a 1941 movie always rank as the best movie ever? Because it had story, wonderful acting, human nature, and on and on, all things missing from Dark Knight. Movies today are thrown together with lots of action, preposterous stories, and computer effects. Characters survive falls and bangs that would put anyone, including a linebacker for the NFL, in hospital for a week or more. As with another reviewer, I am now finding it hard to remember to much about this movie, but I can remember every scene in a great movie, like The Maltese Falcon, etc.
3.0~Dark Knight is a bully anand-27 Sign in Permalink A long time ago there was this movie, The Cook, The Thief, The Wife and Her Lover by Peter Greenaway which made itself a painfully obvious 'arty' movie i.e. you'd be a pariah to 'not get it' and worse, not like it. The Dark Knight suffers the same malady. Bloated with self-important preachings of 'we get the superhero we need', 'you either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain' and 'unstoppable force meets immovable object' yadayada. It dares anyone to NOT like it. NOT be kind to Heath Ledger in his final role. Oh please. Gimme the layers of Batman Returns any day. It was dark, deep and even had its tongue firmly in the cheek...Batman: 'What do you want? Penguin: Ahh, the direct approach from a man who hides behind a mask' Dark Knight is big with loud bangs and at best ONE character we can root for. Christian Bale, a good Batman, barely engages in the two and half hours. Gyllenhaal is wasted. As is Freeman. Eckhart's slide...too quick and convenient. And Ledger...like I said, how can anyone DARE say a dead man did a bad job? The only person who does his role great justice is Oldman. He is the only person you look forward to seeing on the screen. The rest...well... I'm sure the comic book fans will prop up Dark Knight's ratings but I'm hoping true blue movie buffs can set the record straight.
9.0~A Towering Achievement Buddy-51 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" reminds us that even a product of mass-market pop-culture can, if done correctly, be a work of art. This thrilling, densely plotted and beautifully crafted sequel to 2005's "Batman Begins" is, quite possibly, the finest comic book superhero movie ever made. In addition, it boasts, in the performance of Heath Ledger, one of the definitive screen villains of all time. As the movie begins, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) - with the unofficial aid of the "vigilante crime fighter" known as Batman (Christian Bale) - is getting ready to indict most of Gotham City's most notorious criminals and gangsters on racketeering and money-laundering charges. The fly in the ointment is the psychotic, face-painted super villain, self identified as The Joker, who's joined forces with the seedy criminal elements of the city to bring both Batman and the terrorized inhabitants to their knees. Meanwhile, billionaire Bruce Wayne is trying to find a way to render his Batman alter ego unnecessary by finding an incorruptible civic leader who will be able to rid the city of its criminal elements through wholly legal means and, thus, become the heroic figure for the city that Batman himself can never be. He alights on Dent as the man for that job. As writers, the Nolan brothers, Jonathan and Christopher, have created a work that is so dark and despairing in its probing of the evil that infests our world that it makes the 1989 Tim Burton version look like an episode from the campy TV series in comparison. The forces of good in this movie are entirely at the mercy of the forces of evil, so terrifyingly embodied in the Joker figure. With his face painted into a ghoulish grin, Ledger's Joker strikes terror not merely into the characters in the movie but the audience as well. Not since Anthony Hopkins did his turn as Hannibal Lecter (a character Ledger himself cited as a primary source of inspiration for this role) has one actor imparted such a quality of dread and menace to the character he was playing. It is, indeed, a tribute to Ledger's greatness as an actor that, even after all the myriad screen villains we have encountered over the years, he has the power to makes us cringe every time he appears on screen. Indeed, so convincing is Ledger in the part that we sometimes wonder if even Batman himself will have what it takes to defeat him (and isn't that the measure of a truly effective bad guy?). For this Joker's true strategic advantage lies not in all the weapons of destruction he has at his disposal, but, rather, in his astute understanding of human psychology, particularly in his knowledge of how to make terror and fear work to get him what he wants. His delight in mind games, his devotion to torture, and his love of violence for its own sweet sake make him a figure fit to haunt one's dreams. There are other fine performances as well in the movie, including Eckhart as the honest D.A., Maggie Gyllenhaal as Bruce's former (and the D.A.'s current) flame, Gary Oldman as the ever reliable Lieutenant Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Wayne Industries' most erstwhile employee, and Michael Caine as Wayne's devoted and down-to-earth butler. It's inevitable, perhaps, that Bale, as the good guy of the piece, would fall under the shadow of Ledger's towering achievement, but he provides the strength and solidity the picture needs to keep it from going out of whack. Using what would appear to be a minimum of CGI effects, Nolan has mounted his film with a fine eye for detail and a great deal of jaw-dropping visual artistry. The cityscapes alone are enough to take the audience's breath away. Moreover, the screenplay weaves seamlessly between full-throttle, pull-out-all-the-stops action sequences and intense, highly intimate exchanges between characters. Like all movies that run a little longer than they should, "The Dark Knight" does hit a point of diminishing turns long about its last half hour, as the story loses its way a bit and the thematic point-making threatens to run it into the ground. Heck, even Ledger's performance loses some of its edge towards the end, as the novelty begins to wear off due to overexposure (he is probably in one or two scenes too many in the final analysis). Still, these are minor quibbles about a movie and a performance that will go down as classics in their respective categories.
9.0~Amazing non-stop action and eye-popping skyscraper scenes! MartinHafer Sign in Permalink I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10. As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it. The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional. Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense. As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip.
10.0~'Number two of all-time' for a reason. buzznzipp1995 Sign in Permalink It all started with the entrance of 1989's BATMAN directed by Tim Burton. I was an instant fan and lover of the story of the night city dweller, Batman. And justice for all that he fought for. I read the 'USA Today' newspaper box back then with the headlines popping Nicholson's 'Joker' steals the show! It made something like 240 million in the theater, domestic! I saw it on a huge screen, it was phenomenal. Saw bumper stickers and tee-shirts and everything Batman in 89, that's how you knew it was great. When the fourth installment of Batman had surfaced with the 1997 "Batman & Robin" I had lost all hope in the enjoyment of another episode on the big screen for a returning Batman. So did a lot of other fans from what I had heard, even from a friend who had been an 'extra' in Batman & Robin. The beginning of The Dark Knight was perfect, simply put... perfect. The overall good news is that the film continues to sore. From the onset the Joker sets foot inside the Gotham arena and all Hell breaks loose. This gives new meaning to the word 'bank job'. There is a battle between the crusader for justice and the lunatic fringe. I was or should I say we collectively, my wife and I were both not only shocked at the performances but mesmerized. Let's face it, it would be hard not to be very impressed at the hard work put into this comic hero piece. The audio score seems to go from pulse pounding good background music to a spine tingling hissing scream. It was one of those additional characters (the music) that drove you to the edge of your seat and propelled the scenes farther, from curiosity to an utterly enthralled state of being. It is intense. Hans Zimmer,is again right in place for this big and sometimes scary story of Gothic proportions. From the change of the make-up style and attitude, Nicholson's joker was a lot of fun, and crazed, but Heath's was played to a menacing height. He was Jack's joker-in high definition, on 'Crack'. POW!! He just hits with a G-force that doesn't stop! Heath Ledger, I did not realize was so versatile. He powered through and just when you think he's down and ready to go out, he is back out on the street again in full array. Bale's Batman was strong as ever and gritty when on the prowl. He was growlingly low-voiced and driven, with a more serious performance than others that had preceded, but with fun lines here and there too. Not campy however, but kick-ass! Batman has grown up and should be taken seriously. The cast including Gary Oldman as 'commissioner Gordon' and Arron Eckhart as 'Harvey Dent' the roundly known 'White Knight'of Gotham city are a perfect match and brilliant performances. They shined in this follow up to the 'Begins' chapter and I am so thankful that Christopher Nolan had brought the dark knight to the serious forefront again. This needed to happened for the series to 'survive'. I was or rather 'we' were blown away by the rock solid job of casting, shooting, acting, directing and the writing that made this a real epic film, not just another Batman movie. I look forward to buying this one on DVD and the next adventure beginning in the (hopefully) not too distant future for the Batman dynasty. These last two films in the series make it all worth while to any discriminating action /adventure comic book fanatic and or the regular film buffs looking for a film to get some real satisfaction. The Dark Knight delivers powerful performances from all aspects...even my wife who doesn't have a tendency to reminisce about pop film and cult films was amazed at how much she enjoyed as did I this scorcher. The grand entrance at the mob meeting was superb! Then, his pencil 'trick' set the stage for the rest of the story. - The Dark Knight is a highly recommended watch it again and again super hero epic, that shines like gold! **** Enjoy T H X >>> IMDb.COM
10.0~Amazing... no... intelligent... no... Darth-Furious Sign in Permalink Brilliance... I know everyone uses that word. I know what you're thinking. Yes, it is that good. Someone will find something they didn't like but The Dark Knight is... simply... brilliant. I don't know how to review this film. There's too much to talk about without a spoiler. The screenplay is haunting and malevolent without Bale and Ledger even tasting a word. The score wowed me unawares. But, I'm not going into specifics or tech stuff. I'm not a fan-boy or a screenwriter right now. No way. I'm soothing in the uncomfortably sexy, priming charge of Nolan's work. It takes a day to settle. Watching this film had me in a soft and surreal, pleasurable state of excitement and anticipation for an outcome I already know but, in a way, can't predict. I squirmed for two and a half hours. There's your normal story plot and structure but no rules or limits. Anything could happen. You know what's coming but you don't know how. Like trying to get to home plate on a first date with a model. Yes, it can happen. The Dark Knight is a sprawling epic. However, it's not complicated or cliché at all. The premise is as pedestrian as can be. Bad guy destroys and kills and plunders until good guy stops him. This is no comic book movie. This a crime story. A detective story. This is LA Confidential with a cowled hero... Heat with two freaks in the lead... Seven without the blood. The world that this film lays out is intricate and layered and everyone crosses paths in some way or another that completes the tragedy of their own individual tales. Gotham feels alive, real and visceral. This could easily be any real city in the US. The chaos and murder that envelopes here, feels sincere with it's choices and consequences that are, surprisingly, even beyond Batman's grasp. That's where fantasy hits the wall and reminds you reality is steering the ship. People die. A lot. Some are important to the plot and Gotham itself. Others for no reason at all. This is terrorism at it's best. This is psycho-babble struggling to analyze itself. It doesn't apologize either. No one seen this coming. It's just a comic book movie. Yet another one. It's for kids. It's dumbed down for the masses. Jack is The Joker anyway. Heath Ledger is just a wannabe. No I'm not. No... I'm not. THE JOKER has at least ten relevant quotes in the first hour alone. In their context, they are impossibly evil - and yet funny. Somehow, somewhere, someone is making a T Shirt with every fantastical one liner Ledger spat as The Joker. He spits and slobbers through his lines with such quirk and filth you feel nasty watching him. There are evil, little sadistic moments that tinge and stain this film, dramatically stirring discord, melancholy, and angst inside of you until the credits roll. Yes, Ledger is that good. HARVEY DENT is the hero here, not Batman. Batman is still, very much an outlaw. He is a conflict crash of doubts and hopes, struggling to endure the constant pressure of justice vs revenge. Batman is human, he makes mistakes, has bad choices - a work in progress. Dent is already there. Dent is as selfless, noble and heroic as can be. Eckart's playing his Wyatt Earp/ John Wayne card but Dent is so much more than that. He's a symbol of faith and hope and change. Almost beyond a man. The story pushes the lust of anger, fear, and weakness to whomever who might succumb to it, so much in fact, that even the fearless DA - THE WHITE KNIGHT fights to resist. BATMAN is the star of the show. He can stand in the background, not utter a single word and still own the scene. To describe Bale's performance is a waste of time. You already know how good he is. If you don't, the world pities you. Batman grows into another type of hero here. The kind we don't really know, or like as much or see as often. He does what is needed for the greater good, effortlessly sliding into the antithesis of everything bright and just that Dent represents. He is now THE DARK KNIGHT. Gordon, Fox, Rachel and of course Alfred are all so fitting and well balanced that you forget their real names. Alfred is really Michael Caine? You don't say. Who is Morgan Freeman? I dunno, but I can tell you how brilliant Mr Fox is. I can't even reference their latest work in effect to what I've just seen here. The Dark Knight is (in a lot of ways) similar to The Prestige. It's asking you to look. But not too close to miss the heft of this thing. It's giving you the magic trick and you spend two hours trying to figure it out as The Joker spits all logical reason back in your face. The trick is to ask someone to describe The Dark Knight in one word. That becomes a ten minute game in figuring terms from eviscerating to riveting to anti whatever - a suspense of diction, inducing fits and chills and lapses in thinking so you can determine what exactly you are processing. To note anti whatever ain't applying here but you don't know that until the end of the game. That is exactly what The Dark Knight gives us. All these plots and spins and what ifs and then erases it all with a question... wait. Wait. What exactly did I just see? Brilliance...
10.0~Why so serious? Because this is the best superhero film ever. rothnoff Sign in Permalink This is the best superhero film to date. Heath Ledger has one of the best performances of all time and the entire story is so captivating. The Joker is horrifying and he's a great challenge for Batman. If you haven't seen the Dark Knight and you are a superhero fan, you better rethink whether you are actually a superhero fan.
10.0~The best film of all-time!!!! scott-harvie1982 Sign in Permalink I'm guessing that if you have not seen The Dark Knight you have been living under a rock for the best part of 2 years. For me The Dark Knight gives a movie-goer everything they could ask for and features arguably the best acting performance by any villain ever created. From the opening scenes you know your going to be in for one hell of a ride as the action explodes onto your screen and keeps up this pace throughout the entire film. The action sequences are 2nd to none. However it is not just the action that makes this a must see but also the drama and emotional sense of what the characters go through and also some of the decisions which have to be made are on a very human level. This is also without mentioning the score which is amazing as it builds up the tension even more than it seems possible, from full blown orchestral symphony's to just one tone that builds it up so much you can't wait for the next scene. All in all this is, for me, the best film of all time. Watch it and I promise you will not be disappointed.
1.0~Somewhere in America, we have lost the sense of what a good movie is.... finewoman Sign in Permalink C'mon, folks. If Heath Ledger wins an Oscar for his performance, then the Academy has lost all sense of judgment. What film full of that kind of horror gets a PG 13 rating??? I have read most of the comments on this side of the balance and must concur with all that I have read. I just saw the movie ....just to see it for myself. And I wish that I had my money and time back. Too long...too gory...too much of everything negative. Did DC Comics intend for Batman to be portrayed in such a manner??? I think not. I really think something in wrong here in America.....when films like this get 9/10 stars.
5.0~OK movie, but Top 100 movies? Ch_8 Sign in Permalink Are U all kidding me? Should this be considered to be one of the top 100 movies of all times? Personally I regret seeing this crap in the theater. It would have been more suitable as a decent "sunday-hangover-movie". I must however confess that Heath Ledger is stunning in his interpretation of "The Joker", probably one of the best movie-screen villains so far, but then he is the only good thing in this movie. Let me break it down for y'all: The fights sucks big time: I've seen better fight scenes on baywatch (when Mitch Buchannon takes up shootfighting). They are to short, to "blurred" and there are only like five of 'em in the entire 2.5 hour long movie. The acting is mediocre: Apart from Ledger the entire cast is totally underachieving. Christian Bale just reminds me of Keanu Reeves (2 facial expressions throughout the entire movie) and the great Michael Cain is in my opinion starting to get tiresome to watch as the kind, tired and concerned butler. As far as the storyline goes it might as well have been created out of a predefined Hollywood mold (which it is for sure). The dark troubled antihero who is starting to doubt his purpose, the love triangle that "shakes the foundation" of our heroes believes (Spiderman anybody?) and the creation and renewal of new gear and gadgets to satisfy all the "techno/scifi-freaks" out there. So gdm simple and uncreative its truly laughable but then what can one expect from a simple superhero movie? The only reason this movie gets a 5 out of 10 from me is its potential as a enjoyable "hangovermovie" the good cinematography and Ledgers performance. Ps. Would be fun to count the number of times "terrorist" or "terrorism" is mentioned in the movie? Or perhaps the number of times Ledger emphasizes how much "havoc you can create with just a couple of barrels of gas and some dynamite". Feels a lot like propaganda in my book.
10.0~Wow - Mind Blowing Action marimbadaddy Sign in Permalink The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career. The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much "face time" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone. Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.
10.0~This Black Knight Is Indubitably A Great Film ... jmarinko-1 Sign in Permalink Dark as night and nearly as long, Christopher Nolan's new Batman movie feels like a beginning and something of an end. Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind  including "Batman Begins," Mr. Nolan's 2005 pleasurably moody resurrection of the series  largely by embracing an ambivalence that at first glance might be mistaken for pessimism. But no work filled with such thrilling moments of pure cinema can be rightly branded pessimistic, even a post-heroic superhero movie like "The Dark Knight." So conclusion: It is a film of a crazy ambition because behind the myth of Batman and the power of a scenario of action movie hides a moral message rarely reached in cinema, a message of philosophic sublimation which sends back almost to the superman...
10.0~Superb miro_on_the_top Sign in Permalink I don't usually comment on movies i see even if they were really good. however, Dark Knight reached a whole new level from various aspects. first, there is the story which is more than excellent full of drama, action, thriller and suspense as it attracts u until the very end of the movie. second, there is the performance which CAN NOT be ignored in this movie. the performance of the cast was one of the best in the history of Hollywood esepcially Heath ledger, Charistian bale, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan freeman and all the others. finally, what made this movie really special was the message it sends by showing sacrifices, how good turns into evil and what it means to be more than just a hero..... MY recommendation is go and see it even more than once...
1.0~fanboy cacca Brawl_666 Sign in Permalink A touch of reality is much-needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon-mots like "masterpiece" and "crime-epic". Perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying. For lying it must be, since I refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this. It is just not possible. I feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre-release fanboy blitzkrieg, rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers. This is the only explanation I can conceive of as to why TDK has seemingly scored so well with the critics. I don't blame the critics, though. The blame lies in the fanboys' hysteria : their myopic refusal to see the obvious. I feel that Chris Nolan tried really really hard to make a good film, but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre. If viewers truly want "more realism" as they say they do, then why turn to comics in the first place ?? Its just amazing how comic-book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated, when in fact (and there cannot be two opinions on this) reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour. And before you shove it in my face that it is ME who is taking it too seriously, let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence : grim, sadistic violence. Once again, the so-called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action-movie gang-banging, i.e. violence and special effects. And its not even just because of the genre : Batman Begins rose above those limitations, right ? One could empathize with the young Bruce Wayne, tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents' murder, and struggling with his anger and loneliness. Not so in TDK : here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of, and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify. The acting, apart from one notable performance, is mediocre. To be fair, the film does take certain risks which I cant imagine the likes of, say, a Sam Raimi ever taking ; it isn't a McDonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the Spiderman films and the rest of the comic-book parade are. The problem is that those risks don't pay off : instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo, what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what. I wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth, even only to oneself. Apparently it is indeed SO difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months, sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about TDK, have all amounted to a huge nothing. TDK is the prime example of how the advertising business works today, hyping up a product during pre-release to uncalled-for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement. The marketing behind this film is very much THE phenomenal success story of this decade, and should serve as a de-facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works. EDIT : A more appropriate rating for this film is 4/10. But I so deeply despise Warner Bros. & the people lauding this film (i.e. everyone except me) that I must give it 1/10, just to balance things.
10.0~Awesome orangesan83 Sign in Permalink I don't quite know what all the "Hater" were expecting out of this movie, but facts are facts and it delivered just what it intended. The way some of the reviews read it seems like this movie deserves to be on the bottom 100 list rather than the top 250, I think these people need to examine that list and realize The Dark Knight given any circumstances and any director could've been billion times shittier than you'd ever hope to imagine. So just considering that i'd have to say the majority of you people who dislike this movie either hate it because hating something has always been the easy ticket to being that classic "Passe Cool". Or because you've lived in a basement your entire life and the Dark Knight was the first movie you've seen and you have nothing to compare it to. Well take your pick, regardless this movie rocked.
1.0~This is the most overrated movie of the year LupinsGal2004 Sign in Permalink I'm not sure why people think it's so great. A lot of people talk about this being Heath Ledger's last movie. People... not only was he working on another movie... THAT Movie had decided to use his footage, so when it comes out THAT will be his last movie. Do people think it is "dark" because it is mistakenly believed Heath Died because of this movie? (Even though it has already been proved to not be true.) Cause I've seen cartoons that are "darker" theme wise. Last night I saw an anime on Scifi that was more twisted than this movie. This movie really wasn't as dark and twisted as they made it out to be... and considering most of the violence is suggested rather than seen, People can't say this is the most violent movie out there. Also, why did the guy who played batman feel he had to talk as if he had Laryngitis or Bronchitis or something? Every time he talked when he was in "Batman" costume, people started giggling. Another problem was that it went on FOREVER. It went on and on and on and on. I walked out. I'm not sure how much longer there was to the movie. But once the Joker was caught by Batman, and you thought it was coming to an end... in comes "two Face" with Commissioner Gordon's kidnapped family. I had had enough by then. The plus sides: I like Michael Caine. Glad to see him in the movie. I have always had a crush on Gary Oldman The makeup they did on Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) after he became 2-face was brilliant. And I liked what they did with the joker, to a point. But for what it was, Heath did a good job. However, I have to give this movie an over all D. It was too long, Too boring, Too long, Too hyped, and Give Batman a cough drop for pete's sake!!
3.0~Very disappointing and a step backward for Batman myviews Sign in Permalink I was not expecting this film to live up to the hype, but it didn't even come close to living up to my lowered expectations. I give it 3 stars only for Heath Ledger's performance, which was very original and nicely done, but still not deserving of the rave reviews it has been receiving. Even his excellent performance was brought down by the horrible script he had to work with. It's all been said before, but: The acting of every cast member except for Heith Ledger was wooden and utterly boring. The Batman character was unsympathetic and had none of the appeal that was built up in "Batman Begins" of a tormented soul nonetheless trying to do good. In this film he is both boring, nasty, and indecisive. Every fight scene was mechanical, unoriginal, shot in dim lighting, and used none of the stealth that Batman is supposed to use. Batman's voice was laughable and got worse as the film dragged on. Way too many convoluted and disconnected subplots to keep track of. I had no idea where the story was going at any point in time, and didn't care. I watched this on DVD and started fast-forwarding through large chunks about 2 hours into the movie; should have done this sooner. Every character spouted sophomoric monologues about good and evil that were unconvincing. A good script gets these messages across using the plot and actions of the characters, not through monologues. The Joker's various schemes and escapes were impossible to believe even in the context of a comic good movie. How could the Joker walk into a hospital, with full makeup on, and walk right up to Harvey Dent, who is unguarded, *after* the Joker has already kidnapped and disfigured Dent once, *and* the Joker has announced he is going to attack a hospital? This kind of thing happened countless times. I love comic book movies (e.g., Xmen 1 & 2, Iron Man), but in the good ones you can believe that the events would actually happen within the context of the fantasy world of the story. The love triangle story felt tacked-on. What in the story showed you that Bruce Wayne and Rachel, or Harvey Dent and Rachel, had any affection for each other? You are just supposed to accept all of this without any effort by the scriptwriters or actors. The Joker has an endless crew of henchmen, but why would any criminal agree to work for the Joker after he assassinates his entire crew in the first scene? Why would any criminal agree to work for him if his goal is just to cause chaos and not to earn money, and he burns all the money he earns? Don't criminals normally want to get money out of risking their lives to commit crimes? Two and a half hours is way too long. An hour could have been cut without missing it. Compare this to any truly great movie (Gandhi, Godfather 1 & 2), where several hours just fly by. The scriptwriters couldn't decide whether to make this a "realistic" drama or a comic book for the screen. So they flip-flopped back and forth. Case in point: a witness on the stand pulls out a gun, Harvey Dent disarms him, and then wants to continue examining the witness. This is slapstick and is impossible to swallow if we are supposed to believe this is the "real world," but it could work if the whole movie set a "comic book" tone in which ridiculous things like this happen. But it didn't, so the inconsistencies are just jarring. At least the Tim Burton films -- and even the campy 1960s Batman TV show! -- created an internally consistent world. I was ready for the movie to be over, when in comes a whole separate story about Two Face. It was completely out of place with whatever plot arc still existed at that point. Plus, the transformation of Harvey Dent's character into Two Face made no sense, as did his ability to survive a car-flipping accident. Then we witness him shoot Batman, who we have already seen surviving hundreds of bullets without a scratch, and we are supposed to be surprised when Batman leaps up again, unharmed? I could write another whole review just listing more plot holes. Again, I am a big fan of comic book movies and even enjoyed Batman Begins, but this was a real loser.
9.0~Ledger Is 'The Best Villain Ever'. ... randawg72 Sign in Permalink This is an incredible movie with great performances throughout. The plot is unpredictable and keeps the audience guessing. In every scene, just when you think you know what will happen next, ....you don't. (you can't say that about most movies can you ?). I like all the Batman films, but 'Begins' and 'Dark knight' are much more 'possible' in the real world than previous versions. I was asked after I saw this film if I thought Heath Ledger was the best Joker. My reply was that he is not only the best Joker ever, but in my opinion, the best villain ever in any superhero movie. The thought of a super intelligent psycho killer, that always knows the outcome of every situation. And with seemingly ESP like powers that let him stay a step ahead of his pursuers is very frightening. Also, this psycho is not even interested in money, or power or world domination. His only desire is to inflict pain and suffering on innocent people. While watching Ledger's performance, I kept thinking 'wow, this guy's dead', which only deepens the creepy-ness of this evil and twisted Joker. I envision Nicholson accepting the Oscar for Ledger in February. In summary, this is a very entertaining and well made movie. One of the best. You will kick yourself if you don't see this one on the big screen. ~Randawg.
1.0~What a stupid, annoying load of rubbish xorys Sign in Permalink How could this movie possibly have received so much acclaim? OK, it's competently executed, both in terms of acting and production values - but then with the money spent on it, hopefully that should be taken for granted. And certainly it has some fine actors in it, and they give every impression of fully believing in their work. But what the heck is the point of it supposed to be? I'm sorry, but I just absolutely hated it. It reminds me of a local case in the press here in Toronto a while ago where some 'art student' made a movie of a cat being tortured to death. Since he actually tortured a cat to death to make it, he was charged and prosecuted, and his defence was that it was 'art'. Well... at least all the people tortured and killed in this movie presumably were only faking it and weren't actually hurt. But I still don't think it has any more claim to be worthwhile or to be art. It's obnoxious rubbish... and I strongly suggest that if you haven't seen it and are considering doing so, you think of some better use for your time (which would be pretty much anything not actually harmful to your health or anybody else's).
7.0~Dark and compelling, but left me cold namenotnecessary Sign in Permalink Okay, I came out the cinema literally ten minutes ago. Yes the movie was tremendous, yes Heath Ledger gave a fine performance; but it is far from a work of originality in the art of film-making. The Story... Put very briefly: Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) has hopes of becoming obsolete; not least to reunite with darling Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). A man named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) takes charge of bringing justice to the streets, eager to prove to society that they don't need the help of Batman. Enter the Joker (Heath Ledger), an unrelenting villain who just "wants to watch the world burn"; a man who wallows in anarchy. Batman reluctantly assumes personal responsibility for his elimination. The snag is that the Joker generates a conflict between our repentant desire for his disposal and our abhorrence in his retention. Conversely, said friction is nevertheless ambiguous as this is principally a product of Ledger's well-integrated alluring, dark humour. The Review... Nothing about Christopher Nolan's film is candidly provocative: it is doubtless far in merit from the present cinematic cultural phenomenon it seems to be stirring; the death of its star has unquestionably fuelled the effect it is having on audiences. When Ledger's face first appears on screen, it is impossible to distract oneself from his recent passing; so this morally justified praise is surely transient. The biggest displeasure was that the emotional impact lasted only for the film's duration: as I left the theatre, the automatic doors opened for me onto a busy street and everything that had just affected me on the other side of them, dissipated into the noise of the traffic. I wasn't disturbed or introspective; I wasn't concerned or upset: in fact, I felt pretty good. But I don't think I should have. Films should induce a lasting response. So whilst making an attempt to inject a syringe-full of emotive contemporary issues and examining the current state of this planet, the liquid sentiment that fell from the needle was only enough to drug me for the two-and-a-half-hours that is lasted: in consequence, feelings are left sullied and detached. And movie nostalgia should incontestably recall more than just the action  which, on the other hand was positively impressive. Arguably, reality through fantasy only truly works when one can fully connect with the vision's subject. Nolan has done great wonders with the comic book adaptations and to criticize his creativity would be unjust and excessive. Batman appears real enough but the inflexible artificiality of his being is sufficient for our imagination to keep him from fruition, and is instead rather a constant reminder that Gotham really is another world: Batman is the Verfremdungseffekt. Some films bring you inside the world they encompass, whereas to its own disappointment, The Dark Knight predominantly holds you afar: a bystander's view of a distressed planet; I didn't have an intimate enough connection to believe that this could be our own. I was indeed so close, but that is always just too far. Nonetheless, there were moments when its scrutiny of human relationships and societal conduct did besiege me  and well at that. Thankfully too, the CGI and stunts were primarily kept to an appropriate, watchable, sensible level; consequently they were more intense and convincing. Along with the fantastic pulsating score, the acting is what keeps the film alive. Ledger is especially brilliant and he markedly surpasses the other cast members, who in contrast give engaging yet run of the mill performances. Is Heath's performance Oscar-worthy? Debatably so but I remain hesitant. To conclude, I certainly give out a recommendation to see this movie but, like most others, it is rich with content appealing purely to a mindset that whilst common, is still particular and genre-associated.
10.0~Just Incredible afcicco132 Sign in Permalink Just got back from the midnight showing, and this movie exceeded my expectations in every way. The Joker has quickly become my favorite villain of all time. Just wait for his 'magic trick' scene. A classic. I'm not gonna go through and say what everyone else has already said, but I will say this: POSSIBLE SPOILER: How about recasting Johnny Depp as the Joker in the next one? Him and Ledger look a lot alike, and there was only one other time (besides Ledger's performance) where I said 'this is some of the best acting i've ever seen', and that was Depp in the first Pirates of the Caribbean. I think he would do a great job, and I DON'T want to see the Joker disappear. He's far too entertaining.
9.0~A Dark Masterpiece deadman71 Sign in Permalink I am in a minority. I didn't like Jack Nicolson's Joker in Tim Burton's version of Batman. This will not make me popular. In fact I have had many arguments about this opinion. After watching Heath Ledger I am of the opinion that He was absolutely spot on with his take on role. It harks back to my favourite Batman stories, there has been talk about an Oscar nomination which to be honest, I think he should get and win. In my eyes there is only one true Joker and that is the one played by Heath. Christian Bale is Fantastic as Bruce Wayne and also pulls off the Batman which is something no other actor has managed. The support cast is phenomenal. There are no weak links in this film. This deserves to be one of the greatest films of our time. Christopher Nolan should be proud to have taken a dead franchise and completely resurrect it with two classic films. Both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight are classics. If he does not make any more then his legacy is secure. The Ultimate Batman against the Ultimate Joker. I was exhilarated upon leaving the cinema, something that I have not experienced in a long time.
5.0~Not nearly as good as Batman Returns richard-1967 Sign in Permalink It's hard to believe that this film rates in the Top 10 of all IMDb-rated movies. Sure, it deserves more than 5 stars on Heath Ledger's performance alone. But let's face it: This movie doesn't hold a candle to Nolan's first Batman effort. There is very little plot. There is a whole heckuva lot of brooding. There is dark aplenty, but to what purpose? I got so tired of it, I was ready to just have Heath get rid of Batman for once and all. The Nolan/Christian Bale combo is dynamite, but this screenplay and plot is anything but. Still, there is Heath Ledger, and he is really superb. What a loss for us all. And, as always, the movie LOOKS great, filled with the typical Nolan touches. I've recovered and I'm ready for a third Nolan/Bale effort, just with a bit more thought to story and at least some measure of action.
10.0~The Best Super Hero MOVIE EVER!!!!! The BEST movie of the year 2008!! avinashbhan Sign in Permalink The Best Super Hero MOVIE EVER!!!!! The BEST movie of the year 2008!! Before I talk about the movie let me tell you about my perception of Batman till the time I saw Dark Knight I thought it would be the same old kid movie (the BOOM!!! BAM!!! PUFF!!! Like effects that we used to see earlier), but then some of my friends who had seen Batman Begins said that Dark Knight it should be good. So I saw the movie apart from the fact that it is a master piece the other thing that struck me was it was not that old style Batman that we were used to see when we were kids, but it was a Dark, serious and intense movie and secondly for the first time I wanted to see the prequel to a movie (which mind you never happened to me till date and I guess it rarely happens to any one) with such eagerness. And even Batman Begins was at par with its sequel. As far as the movie goes it a master piece and every one has done a fantastic job (even the support cast) , although the Batman is the hero but here Joker is real hero for the movie(You might realize that after you see the movie) I mean he is has outdone every one in terms of acting, character and dialog delivery!!!(WHY SO SERIOUS!!!!). I just realized today that Heath Ledger had passes away in Jan. of 2008 which makes me very sad, we have lost a good actor.... RIP Heath Ledger FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN BATMAN BEGINS JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK IT WAS NOT WORTH IT. I SAY IT IS WORTH EVERY MINUTE YOU SIT AND WATCH THE MOVIE. AND AFTER YOU SEE BATMAN BEGINS I BET YOU CANT RESIST YOUR SELF FROM WATCHING DARK KNIGHT!!!!
10.0~The Greatest movie ever made (Hands Down) seb-161 Sign in Permalink I am not going to lie this is probably the greatest movie I have ever seen. The Joker was played to perfection and it will be an injustice if Heath ledger does not get an Oscar nomination(RIP). Lets not forget the performances by Aaron Eckheart and Christian Bale also spectacular. The plot was also a highlight of the movie as it was a superhero movie that actually had one and was not just a bunch of random action scenes (although it did have a lot). I would just like to say that all you people that have not seen it and wont give it a chance because it is a superhero movie and can't see how it will be good. Get off you a$$es and watch the movie because you know you're going to enjoy it.
10.0~Got a 10 from me mfmoore-1 Sign in Permalink It got a 10 from me. Is it the #1 movie of all time? Hard to say but I think people are approaching the question all wrong. Folks are really sensitive to whether or not The Dark Knight should replace The Godfather as #1 on IMDb. It reminds me of a scene from the Simpsons where the barflies at Moe's are arguing non-sensibly. "Mohammad Ali in his prime was way better than anti-lock breaks. OK, but what about Johnny Mathis versus Diet Pepsi?" The Dark Knight and Godfather are almost incomparable films but both achieved exactly what they were striving for. -Immortalized very different characters and actors. -Tremendously enjoyable, on very different levels. -Beautifully crafted, in very different ways. -Will come to define their genres, very different genres. BOTTOM LINE: YOU CAN RANK BOTH MOVIES 10 AND YOU ARE NOT INSULTING THE OTHER. Thoughts I had after seeing this movie: -I was prepared for how great a performance Heath Ledger was going to give but I was really blindsided Aaron Eckhart. The character of Harvey Dent will stick with you after the film as much as the Joker. -Acting and script across the board was noticeably better. -As much as Batman Begins attempts to bring the series into the scope of believability and realism, this one takes it another step further. No element of this film felt cartoonish or campy. -I was pleased that the previews did not spoil the story (as I saw them probably 30 times). I don't think we were shown an image from the final third of the film. -I was pleased that the filmmakers went the extra mile to tell the complete story. I was waiting for them to cut us off and finish with a "wait for the sequel" ending. THIS IS A STAND ALONE FILM, WHICH IF ANYTHING, MAKES ME THE MOST COMFORTABLE GIVEING IT A 10.
3.0~Contrived aimless plot full of philosophizing worthy of a grade-schooler tomdearie Sign in Permalink This is a great movie to watch when you're completely drunk and likely to miss the following things: 1) An aimless doddering plot full of obvious contrivances. 2) Numerous and massive implausibilities, (even given the comic-book setting). 3) Endless philosophical blather that is about as deep as a sidewalk puddle  typical of the superficial drivel flowing out of Hollywood these days. I believe it was written by Paris Hilton. 4) A 3+ hour movie that should have been edited to an hour and a half. Ledger put in a decent performance, and Morgan Freeman is always professional. But even the action, which can be a saving grace for a fun "brain-off" adventure flick, was full of visual flaws. Yawwwwn.
10.0~A Masterpiece of Tragedy blakey96 Sign in Permalink Admittedly everybody walks out of a cinema, and the endorphins in your brain will be telling you 'That was the coolest flipping movie I ever saw!'The Dark Knight is simply a masterpiece. It builds itself up so many times, only to turn around and take you in another direction. Heath Ledger's much hyped performance lived up to all expectations, being both chilling, yet horrifyingly captivating. Where I live in Australia was lucky enough to be one of the first showings in the world, and I feel that many of the patrons in our cinema were there solely to see our lost son in his final performance, and it is a great lasting memory for us to be left with. The only minor qualm that I may have with this film is that the final cut is more about Heath Ledger than it is about the film's star. Christian Bale had noticeably less screen time than Ledger, why this is, I am not sure. The performance of the cast is, as you would expect from the stunning ensemble cast is remarkable. Old hands Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman bring the prestige and grace to the screen, while the new kids on the block (Gyllenhaal, Bale, and the outstanding Aaron Eckhart) truly knock it out of the park. If you miss out on this film, you truly are missing out, it is a modern classic. Believe the hype.
1.0~Horrible ! california11 Sign in Permalink A nihilistic style piece, where all the exceptional creative and artistic talents are wasted in enhancing humanities most negative emotions. The movie may be well made, but as a piece of fiction it fails to justify its existence. It identifies and taps humanities' core emotions, but does not understand how they operate, and thus cannot raise their level. Scaring people is easy. But understanding the purpose of fear and how it transforms into courage and clarity is to understand the true nature of heroism and what really inspires humans. This film lacks any understanding of how good people have actually been able to defeat tyranny, by turning the fear around. There is an exceptional opportunity for creating genuine hope from the story's premise, but it is lost, in part because I don't believe the director knows how to find it. Finally, the actor playing The Joker appeared to show at least two of the strongest indicators of a vulnerability to develop mental illness. It may not have been wise to have such an individual play this kind of character. I honestly would not recommend this movie to anyone.
10.0~I was disappointed by Batman Begins, was expecting the worst, and i got the best. Chiyonosake23 Sign in Permalink First of all things i should say i am a comic-book fan. From Eastern Europe. Why is this important? Because here its something really different then in the USA. In the USA comic-books are part of the everyday life. Here it is not. Here it is an underrated genre, and most of the people still think it is something sissy for small children and contains only fighting and dialogue no higher level then Kapow and Boom-Boom. And it was even worse when i was little. It was always a little treasure hunt to get some. And most of them was bad rip-off, cheap junk from the above mentioned category, and it was only Batman, who continually represented quality and was available for a kid like me too. And i was amused and loved it. Not Batman in the first place, but the amazing villains. And especially Joker. He was the best of the best. Maybe the most complex, interesting and remarkable character ever created. And to tell the truth, i wasn't entirely satisfied with either one of the Batman films made up to the Dark Knight. Especially considering that there was an absolutely brilliant animated series: Batman the Animated Series, check it out if you like Batman, well worth it. They first 3 movies were okay, but the Batman and Robin and Batman Begins both sucked big time, but for different reasons. I lost hope i will ever see a really good and faithful adaptation of this comic. Then along came this one. Yes it has some overdone parts, some flaws here and there, a bit rushed and corny ending, but its good, meaningful, and Heath Ledger (who i disliked before i saw this) is the absolutely perfect Joker. When i saw the casting, i thought it is a disgrace. After i saw the movie i thought he was unearthly good. The film has suspense, great acting, emotions, and a very interesting and coherent plot which is very rare in Hollywood blockbusters. Well worth watching for anyone and everyone. Especially for people, who think comic-books are sissy things for little children...
1.0~I didn't like it! Oh! Heaven for offend!!! ddfcmp8 Sign in Permalink There is nothing special about this movie. Period. Nothiing special. It tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie, and in financial terms, it was, but you know what? It's still not good, no matter how many fans it has, no matter how much money it pulls in. Those are just figures and numbers, and they're quite boring in the long run. Let's go over a few reasons why it was not good. First off, the story bites off way more than is necessary. We have Bruce Wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman he'll never have the chance to be with. The woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl, and really has no business being in the story to begin with. She is just there to make both Batman and Harvey Dent rival each other. I'm so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that. Then, there's the Joker...the most ridiculous part of the story. Ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain. It's not entertaining, it's not disturbing, it's just sick. This movie was not fun. It was not entertaining. It was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway, and especially because of the death of Heath edger. Let's talk a little about that. This film had success that rode the curtail of Ledgers death. The studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition. That's really sad, and you know what else? It's all this film will ever be...the last film of Heath Ledger, and America went to see it because he died before it's release. sad. Really sad. I didn't like it, and I bet others will not like me for that very reason. Even more sad still.
10.0~A Modern Masterpiece tjgoalie13 Sign in Permalink A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience.
6.0~not so sublime as you say d-erginer Sign in Permalink I must say this movie was far behind my expectations. I mean I read the comments on IMDb about it before and I watched it but no;it seems I got the wrong impression. Christopher Nolan is a great skilled director and together with Christian Bale and Michael Caine I thought it would be a masterpiece. I saw The Prestige and it was absolutely fantastic, one of the best films ever made. Heath Ledger also made me believe that Dark Knight was going to be a feast just for my taste. However it is another Hollywood blockbuster and that is all there is about it. I still recommend it because Heath Ledger's Joker was worth seeing, but Bale's Batman-Bruce Wayne- was the worst performance of him. He had no impression on his face, I thought he had no feelings whatsoever. As for the rest of the cast, it was awful. Nothing fancy. They did not contribute to anything. The effects were just like the ones we see everywhere. Nothing fancy again. The was very little action, so little that I fell asleep in the middle of the film. I give 6 only because I respect Christopher Nolan and I think Heath Ledger did his best. If you haven't watched it yet, do not hurry to see it. It is a waste of time.
