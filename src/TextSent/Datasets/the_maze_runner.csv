2.0~Poor amazon-91183 Sign in Permalink Watched it only because my daughter had read the book and we had a "film night". Slow - really almost nothing happens. Badly filmed, confusing action scenes. That damn shaky-cam. Again. When will people grow out of it? No suspense. Puerile script. No interesting characters. Very contrived. Continues a trend that I find rather distasteful and disturbing that was started by Hunger Games. I do not find the spectacle of children and teenagers being violently killed remotely entertaining. Left me completely cold.
7.0~Entertaining Sci Fi Thriller tabuno Sign in Permalink 19 October 2014. The Maze Runner combines The Hunger Games (2012), Cube (1997), with Lord of the Flies (1990) into a rather fascinating mystery thriller for boys. For most of the movie, the consistency of theme and plot holds up well. The tension, the ever presence ominous sounds of the maze offers up a dread that is pervasively creepy. The stereotypical characters aren't usually overplayed and the over the top performances or plot points are mostly held back using instead more empathetic and humanistic portrayals. The ending seems like a cop out for a hoped for sequel unfortunately. And there a few moments that really do fall back into the stereotypical plot design. The humor however makes their appearances with to great effect though. This is more enjoyable movie than expected. It just misses out though being really innovative and can't quite break out of the mold of most of the other sci fi thrillers.
5.0~They should rename it "The Maze Ender" hochi801 Sign in Permalink That's gotta be the least interesting maze ever! I was expecting a Harry Potter or Labyrinth-like kind of maze, but this one has no "mystic" in it. It felt mechanical, just like the whole movie. The only enemies were the grievers and falling/crushing walls. I would have given this movie an 8-9 if Minho was the main protagonist, not the bland, stereotype white male character like Thomas. Seriously, Minho is the true "Maze Runner", not a hack like Thomas. Minho memorized the maze, is on par with Thomas when it comes to running and very smart, so why is Thomas the one mentioned as the most accomplished in the end but not Minho? Why are there no females in the experiment (Theresa did not count since she is a researcher)? Are they only going to make a super powered males? Good luck repopulating then. Speaking of Theresa, I disliked her the moment she stated crying when she found out that she was a researcher. How the heck did Gally got to the control room with no problem? Like, seriously, there was a safe shortcut the whole time? This movie felt like a rip off of Lord of the Flies, Catching Fire, Dangan Ronpa and Cabin in the Woods. Honestly, this movie has a potential but I'm not interested in the sequel. Instead, I wanna see the prequel and hope that it focuses on Minho's exploration of the maze, how Gally and Alby set up the rules and the mystic of the maze itself.
9.0~As Excellent an Adaptation of a Stupendous Novel as it is a Stand-Alone, Post-Apocalyptic Sci-Fi Film DareDevilKid Sign in Permalink Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4/5 stars Boasting a solid premise and a refreshingly dark approach to its dystopian setting, "The Maze Runner" stands out from the crowded field of young-adult sci-fi adventures. It generally has ambitious production values, is well-edited, briskly paced, decently acted, action packed, and features a thumping score. More importantly, it's a fairly faithful adaptation of James Dashner's brilliantly conceived, grim novel (the first in a trilogy if you exclude the prequel that was penned later), succinctly weaved together to satiate ardent fans of the series while being coherent enough to entertain viewers with no prior knowledge of Dashner's post- apocalyptic books. The minor deviations from the source material, taken in the name of creative liberty and with a commitment to manage cinematic time constraints do not detract from the story, and instead churn a refreshing spin on proceedings for those already familiar with the story. Ultimately, "The Maze Runner" turns out to be a thrilling sci-fi adventure with great energy and considerable style.
10.0~Excellent action packed with a story worth watching matfav Sign in Permalink The film keeps a strong pace and the storyline and acting is excellent. Edge of your seat stuff. Worth watching more than once. Cannot fault the film anywhere. The maze was stunning and nothing looked out of place. The story captures you from the start and does not let go. Absolutely no boring parts. The special effects did not detract from the storyline and the story itself is substantial enough to keep you guessing. Just wanted to watch more. Where it differs from other films in the genre is simply good story writing that is not one dimensional as most films tend to be dumbed down. Not simplistic but not complicated either. Everyone got it right with this one and it was a joy to watch.
7.0~The Maze Runner Review Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd Sign in Permalink My Thoughts: I had no expectations going into this screening. I had never read the books nor had I heard really much about this latest edition of young adult novels turned into movies. So let us begin on what I thought of this movie. We are shown the glade through Thomas's eyes (Dylan O'Brien) as the latest teenager to be transported up the elevator, to the glade and the maze. None of the kids know why they were chosen, they just know they are being tested for some purpose. Some of these teenage kids have been living in the glade for years while they send out runners every day into the maze to try to find the way out, but it isn't looking good. With the addition of Thomas, though, things seem to be changing. The Maze is doing things it didn't do before he arrived, and this scares some of the other teenagers who start thinking that maybe Thomas shouldn't be allowed to stay with them in the glade. Thomas, on the other hand, is curious and is pushing the boundaries, trying to get the rest of the Gladers to see that what they are currently doing is not working and that they need to change it up and figure a way to get out of the Maze. I think for a Young Adult book-turned-movie, it was put together really well. Yes, there are certain scenes that before they played out, I had already guessed what was going to happen, but that did not take away from the fact that the movie was very entertaining; and when the credits started to roll, I was thinking that I needed to get the books so I could find out what happened next. I also have to hand it to most of these young actors; I think that they gave us a great performance in this movie. Sometimes, without veteran, older actors, movies like these can fall apart due to the inexperience of the younger actors, but they held it together and made the experience better in my opinion. My Recommendation: I already know that the fans of the book will be flocking to this movie, but I think those that do not know anything about the book will enjoy seeing this movie on the big screen.
2.0~Boring, Bland, and the Ending is a Confusing Mess LeonLouisRicci Sign in Permalink There is Nothing more Disappointing in a Movie that sets up a Mysterious, Where Are We?, Why Are We Here?, Premise and then Delivers a Confusing, Open-Ended, Non-Answer to it all and has the Conceit to ask You to Sign Up for the Sequel. No Thanks. It is such a Letdown and a Cheat it Doesn't Deserve a Return, except maybe on Your Ticket Price for this Unoriginal, Bland, Sterile, Non-Frightening Film. The Characters are Uninteresting and there are a Lot of them. But most are Indistinguishable, except for Skin Color and Accents. The Maze itself and its Mysterious Creatures are a Colorless Bore and there is No Cheese at the End When You Finally Complete the Maze. Speaking of Cheese... This is a Non Entity in the Young Adult Fantasy Fad, Based on Best Selling Books Popularly Purchased by You guessed it, Young Adults. Well, at Least some of Them are Reading. Hope the Books are Better than this Almost Awful, Anemic, Non-Adventure.
7.0~This is a short review of The Maze Runner but....SPOILER ALERT!!! raunakoirala Sign in Permalink "The Maze Runner" is an a-maze-ing movie The maze runner is a 114-minute film that is directed by Wes Ball. The main characters in the movie are Daniel O'Brien as Thomas, Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt, Ki Hong Lee as Minho, Kaya Scodelario as Teresa, Will Poulter as Gally, Aml Ameen as Alby and Blake Cooper as Chuck Wes Ball has released this movie The Maze Runner as an adaptation of the novel by James Dashner written in 2009. The movie is about a teenage boy named Thomas. He awakens in an elevator, clueless about how he ended up here he is put into a world with around 35 – 40 teenage boys that also have no memories of their past. They are trapped in world surrounded by a maze. Thomas is forced to follow a set of rules and learn how to survive in this enclosed world. With a new boy being sent every thirty days with new supplies the group of people in "the glade" had been there for three years, searching for a way out through the maze. The maze is surrounded by cyborg creatures known as Grievers. The entrance would close and the maze would reshape every night, blocking some passages and creating new ones. When the boys had finally started giving up trying to find a way out of the maze a very surprising incident occurs dividing the group into two factions, those willing to risk their lives and fight their way through the maze and those who aren't willing to lose what they have already and just survive as they had been doing over three years. At the start of the movie Thomas is in disbelief and refuses to build friendship with the other Gladers. As we went through the movie Thomas became more attached to the environment and the other Gladers. Chuck was the only one he could call his friend and share his thoughts with. Further through the movie, Thomas had become the most heroic figure in The Glade. He had survived a whole night inside the maze itself which was never done before. Near the end of the movie, Thomas had led a group of Gladers out of the maze and known as a brave leader. Thomas gotten braver and courageous as he went through his journey to finally escape the maze. The Maze Runner is a young adult post-apocalyptic science fiction movie that contains violence, sci-fi and thrill making it a PG13 movie aimed at teenagers and young adults. The director did a terrible job of copying the book since about half of the information and scenes from the book were left out in the movie. For example, in the book Thomas could talk to Teresa telepathically, this is a major part of the story in the book but in the movie, this trait is not included or mentioned. The film didn't give the audience who are unfamiliar with the other characters, enough information about them. The actors in the movie are chosen or customized based on the characters from the book. The actors are excellent for their roles since each of them show the same characteristics as the characters from the book. The costumes that the actors wear in the movie are briefly based from the book. The costumes stay the same for each character throughout the whole movie. The costumes can tell us more about what's going on in the story if we pay close attention to it. For example, the first scene of the movie shows Thomas inside a dark, metal elevator rising to enter the Glade. When the elevator comes to a halt, Gally opens the elevator, exposing Thomas to the bright light and exposing the Gladers and the audience to Thomas. In this scene, his shirt is soaking wet and his hair is drenched with sweat giving us the idea that he had been in the elevator for a very long time. The Gladers all wear long sleeve shirts and long pants suggesting that the Glade is a cold place. The lighting used in The Maze Runner is carefully placed by the filmmakers to tell us more about the story without using dialogues. Lighting can set the mood and draw attention to certain people or things. A red light starts flashing on top of Thomas when he is in the elevator suggesting danger or telling him that he has finally reached the end of the lift. This leaves a slight suspense to the audience who start wondering where Thomas will end up. When he is released into the community there is a wide shot of the Glade with Thomas standing exactly in the middle. The camera is angled so Thomas looks like a minor ant in front of the walls that surround him. The beautiful greenery and blue sky of the Glade is revealed to the audience. On the other hand, the filmmakers had made the walls of the maze surrounding the Glade dark and dull clearly pointing out that it's a much different place compared to the Glade. Sound was used throughout the movie for mood. An example of this in The Maze Runner is when Thomas is in the elevator. When Thomas sees the flashing red light the music starts increasing and doesn't stop till the elevator crashes into the trapdoor. Another example is when Thomas is being chased by the Grievers in the maze. The mechanical sound effects given to the Grievers gives it more thrill. The screams and crashes that the Grievers make the audience go on the edge of their seats. Although, there are some significant differences between the movie to the book, the book has more detail and is easy to understand, but for some, the movie might be astonishing due to its terrific visuals, great acting and amazing use of sound and lighting. For these reasons I give this movie: By – Raunak Koirala
9.0~Sweet. Eric_Cubed Sign in Permalink There is a miracle brewing here, and I hope there are sequels. In purgatory, there are two things present: the Kardashians and the movie Divergent. These insults to humanity exist on the bottom, most furthest realm regarding American cultural worth. Much higher on the spectrum we have Harry Potter and The Hobbit, which bored me to death due to banality and contrivance; though I appreciated the skill and casting that went into them They just weren't on the same plateau of The Lord of the Rings. And then there is the Hunger Games, a bit beneath Lord of the Rings, but nonetheless engaging, well made and most of all creative. Welcome to the genre known as the teenage Sci-Fi/Fantasy novel turned into existential film. On the one hand, teenage themes are endemic to the import of it all, and must be included in these kinds of films: First Loves, Bullies, Angst etc.—but the awesome films of the genre acknowledge the teen element while prioritizing the basic heart of the story, which is the mythological themes that are timeless among all cultures and time periods. They know the story is a backdrop for the unconscious energies at the guts of all human experience: death, isolation, meaninglessness and freedom. Percy Jackson, The Maze Runner isn't. The Maze Runner is on the level of Serenity, The Matrix and Firefly. You heard me right. This is the miracle I speak of. I fully expected Divergent (clearly, the worst movie ever made), but what I got was the diet cola of Raiders of the Lost Ark—s o don't get me wrong, I'm not saying The Maze is as good as Raiders, Firefly or Lord of the Rings. It isn't. I'm just saying it's at least in the same ballpark. Again, the miracle being the creative forces behind a book turned movie about teenagers satisfying all systems involved without succumbing to total CHEEZE: The producers who think only of marketing, the director who only thinks of his/her creative license, the cast who only think of their performance, all working together to understand and express the satisfaction of the perceived audience. In this light, within the constraints of money and profit, this is an awesome, awesome movie. Bravo. 9 stars. Except.why didn't the kids just build a wooden structure to get them to the top of the maze? They could have just ran to the edge.
5.0~Authors with no more original ideas.... guidoguanz-160-250014 Sign in Permalink What is going on with the authors nowadays? No more original ideas, they are just copying stories that have worked well at the box office before, make them into a book, wishing that a producer will buy the rights to make them into a film (trilogy at least). I found this film quite similar to The Hunger Games. Very similar, actually. Bunch of kids, trapped in a a maze/arena, the maze with different sections/districts, adults manipulating them from outside, the teenage hero, just too much. Not idea who wrote this book, not planning to read it either, just watched the film because it was on TV. But the author needs to start thinking of delivering good stories and stop thinking about how to make money. 5/10
10.0~Maze runner kortney-30949 Sign in Permalink This movie was extraordinary! Thomas is a complex character who follows his instincts and emotions. He does not listen to the negativity of those around him. He remains positive and hopeful throughout every situation. He is a hero to be looked upon and admired! I suggest seeing this movie no matter what genre you are in the mood for. It is heartfelt, thrilling, and will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time! You will not regret picking this movie for one of your movie nights. The whole family will love the intensity and mystery of the whole film. This will be one of the movies you will want to see over and over again just so you can completely understand how very thing unravels and the mystery it reveals. Ten out of ten one of the best and most well done movies I have seen in a long time!
2.0~The Maze Runner dysokunmonineath Sign in Permalink Hearing it from others, those who reads the book saying it's awesome i really expect it to be good, and i didn't just watch in it 3D but A VIP 4dx. Damn it. The story was stupid, nothing really make sense, nothing interest me, people trapping in those walls for years??? Really? They could have build some ladders or something??? They totally stayed there wasted for so long. Moreover, in the love part,it is again,stupid and lame. The ending was lame too. And those actors aren't that handsome either, except for Minho who ain't even the main character. Totally not worth my money and time, and now i am wasting it again to warn you guys. Thank you.
4.0~It Wasn't As Impressive As The Rating Shows irwanjuanda_ndson Sign in Permalink Well, how should I put it. First of all, I don't read the book so this is my review solely based on the movie. I think it's good, but that's all... it's not impressive. Still with all respect, I don't find any of the characters have an attractive or interesting personality... I can't feel sympathy for them, the best character still... is Chuck, even him... I feel has weak character in the movie (they are just so typical, and typical in movie is boring in my opinion). And then, the story is actually interesting in the end, but that's all and it's because I want to know why they are there in the first place. After finding out, I was like... "Okay, so that's why." And like I said, that's all... I don't really want to know anymore. Well, if there's the sequel there are like 30-40% chance I'd go watch it. That's my opinion.
7.0~almost like a two hour twilight zone episode jcallows Sign in Permalink Dystopian. What is that? The word of the decade? I'd never even heard of this word before a few years ago and I'm not sure what it really means and I doubt most people who use it do either. Now I see it at least once a week. I'm still trying to figure out what 'post-apocalyptic' means. That was the popular word in the 80s and 90s for low-budget sci-fi flicks. Anyway, with the title and concept like 'The Maze Runner', the movie 'Logan's Run' quickly comes to mind. There are some similarities. Both movies are about a bunch of young people, stuck in a man-made environment, running to escape death. And in both films, there are people called runners. But this film reminds me more of the Twilight Zone episode where a group of people trapped in a large round room escapes only to find out they were just dolls thrown into a toy bin. Too bad this film is not quite as interesting. Sorry for the spoiler, but, in the end, the kids are indeed human, not action figures. You have to hand it to the filmmakers. They saw an over-crowded marketplace filled with trilogies based on popular teen books and had the nerve to say, "Me too!" And still they submitted something that offered few original ideas and resembled many of the films of this type that came before it recently. That took a lot of guts. This film isn't that bad. It just feels like it belongs on a Saturday morning along with the cartoons. I still think the Twilight Zone ending would've been better.
7.0~It was all done for a reason..... FlashCallahan Sign in Permalink A boy wakes up in an elevator with no recollection of his name, where he comes from, or where he is. As he emerges from the earth, he finds himself in a community of boys, living in a glade. As the boy slowly starts unearthing memories, such as his name, Thomas, he also finds out more sinister things from the other boys about the place he's calling home. The boys are held prisoners within the centre of a gigantic maze, and for three years they've been looking for a way out. And now it's up to Thomas to find that way. But the road isn't going to be easy, as any who dares enter the maze finds himself hunted by the Grievers..... Remember that film from 1994 called No Escape, starring Ray Liotta? This is the young adult version of that film, with an added maze. Apart from the Maze, the narrative structure of the film has many similarities with that film. Imprisoned people have learnt to live off the land and have become a peaceful community. Stranger lands on their laps, and he causes a kerfuffle, which grieves some, but gives others hope. That is the main structure of both movies. I haven't read the source material, and to be perfectly honest, have no intention to, but as a first episode to a potential franchise, it's not bad at all, even if it appears that every other month there is a young adult novel being turned into a film (thanks Twilight). But this is a more successful one, the characters are interesting enough, and there is enough chemistry and angst between the group to keep the film exciting enough. The maze scenes are creepy and suspenseful, and again, if you haven't read the books, the final act is really quite the surprise. My only complaint is how violent the film is, so for younger viewers, the final third of the film could be quite distressing in some scenes. But all in all, its a solid movie, and sets up the next movie leaving the viewer with much curiosity..
8.0~The Maze Runner succeeds as the next big franchise with an engaging story, intense action sequences, and a solid cast of actors gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297 Sign in Permalink The previews for this movie interested me and after seeing that it was from another book series, I decided to read all of them, particularly the first one. It was gripping and kept me hooked. So, when the film finally came out last month, I was expecting this film to live up to my expectations and to my surprise, it turned out to be an intense and well-acted film. It isn't one of the best book-to-film adaptations like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Hunger Games, but considering that it avoided the tired trend of young-adult romance movies, this is one of the better films of the year. The story, for the most part, is interesting and kept the spirit and tone of the book intact while keeping some of the minimal changes which were acceptable. It also has some smart dialog and explains the details of how the people are trapped in a maze and their attempts to find a way out very well. The pacing is mostly decent and gives its time to develop not only the main protagonist, but the other characters as well. The music score is pretty good and it fitted the tone of the film perfectly; the direction from Wes Ball (who worked on a CGI animated short named Ruin that inspired the idea of the film) is nice. Also, the CGI visual effects on the Maze and the scenery are beyond fantastic it gives the film a big scale to it despite it's lower budget, but the best part would have to go to the acting. It had some very strong performances and portrayed the characters perfectly. Dylan O'Brien did a perfect job as Thomas, who develops from a confused teenager with no memory of who he is to a brave leader. The other characters are also good. Alby, the leader of the group of people called the Gladers in the Glade, Newt, the second in command and friend to Thomas, Gally, the arch-nemesis of Thomas, and Teresa all support the film with flawless effort. Mostly Teresa who doesn't come across as a love interest, but instead sharing a connection to Thomas. Then, there's Patricia Clarkson as a scientist who explains how the Gladers were brought to the Maze in the first place because of an experiment she and other scientists tested. Before I end this review, there are two problems that I do have with this film. Aside from the nice direction from Wes Ball, the camera angles on the action scenes felt kind of shaky much like the ones from The Hunger Games. Also, the flashbacks in Thomas's mind throughout the film felt poorly placed and could've been handled better. That's all I have to say. Overall, The Maze Runner isn't one of the best young-adult adaptations, but with an engaging story, intense action sequences, and a solid cast of actors, it succeeds as the next big franchise and due to it's sequel hook, I will anticipate for the sequel, The Scorch Trials, in 2015.
9.0~The maze runner is an excellent movie. 9thgraders Sign in Permalink It's the story in which there are teenagers who have lost they memories, they wake up, trapped in a maze with dangerous creatures in the future after a virus has exterminated a part of the population. They have to survive and find the way out. It is directed by Wes Ball and the genres of the movie are sci-fi, action and adventure. I find the cast great because there are actors as Dylan O'Brien, Thomas Brodie Sangster, Ki hong lee and Kaya Scodelario. To me, Dylan O'Brien is the most talented actor because he is the funniest and he is sad and happy when he wants. The maze runner is an American movie released in 2014. It is written by Noah Oppenheim and James Dashner. The production company is 20th century fox. The fights between the creatures and the characters are extremely real, the special effects are really amazing I have never seen anything like it. I haven't a favourite moment because it's impossible to choose a scene. When the main character, Thomas, discovers the maze, there is a stressful and very adventurous music, it's my favourite music in the movie. The maze runner is the movie I have seen the most and it's my favourite movie because there is action and it's an original and strange story. .
10.0~favourite movie!! elizoualouca Sign in Permalink My all time favourite movie! literally the best movie i've ever seen. i just cant explain how good this movie is, all scenes are perfectly made to attract your interest. i've watched all of them till the third part/movie dont know if a fourth one will come out but im hoping so! all of the 3 movies made me cry! i definitely recommend this movie to anyone especially if you like action! because this movies always keeps you entertain and interested on what is about to happen!
6.0~Entertaining but lacks substance ysellahusk Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner should have been an exciting and dramatic story of survival, however it ended up being a story packed with formulaic characters and little substance. Initially the story seemed intriguing, dark and clever, a group of boys forced to thrive inside a community known as the glade with no memories of their previous life. The glade is encircled by a deadly maze where man eating creatures, known as Grievers, dwell. The film began well as we were immediately plunged with Thomas into the ambiguity of the glade, tension between boys immediately started to rise, the unknown was exciting and the potential for the rest of the film seemed high. The overall cinematography throughout I thought was a real highlight to the film, after reading the books the maze was captured perfectly as the enormity of it portrayed it as a threat in itself even without the grievers. I also thought the design of the Grievers were effectively scary and very different. However the plot slowly unravels and becomes extremely vague leaving you very unsatisfied as many of the big questions aren't addressed until the end and are somewhat rushed and not particularly compelling. The lack of character development also annoyed me hugely, compared to similar recent films in this genre such as The Hunger Games or Divergent where the characters were complex, you loved some, hated others and felt empathy for them, I found myself lacking any emotional connection to any of the characters within The Maze Runner. The hero, Thomas, is your traditional good looking Hollywood teen hero who's actions were boring and predictable much like many of the others. The introduction of Teresa was very unnecessary, the typical arbitrary female who maintained perfect hair and makeup throughout and seemingly offered nothing to the plot. Although the film was action packed I felt the pace was all wrong for character development and key concepts from the book were missed out.
5.0~In comparison to the book kenshin101010 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is just another book adapted movie that failed to do it right. It changes (and leaves out) enough to where you could almost watch the movie and not spoil the book outside of a few plot points and character deaths; which opens up some plot holes that those who haven't read the books probably won't get. Why is Gally so against Thomas? Why don't they just climb the maze? etc. The solution for the maze and the escape from the facility are completely different and don't do a proper job at setting up the sequel or the world outside of the maze. On the brighter side of things, it does do well visually. The action sequences are well shot and suspenseful. The acting isn't spectacular, but it's not terrible either. It was a good enough movie to kill some time, but it's just a shame that it suffers from a poorly adapted and written script and doesn't live up to its potential.
5.0~Teen dystopia #473 temp-544-612798 Sign in Permalink Insert synopsis (which you can get from all the other reviews) here. The biggest obstacle is the characters refusing to commit to simple, direct and completely normal exposition. There's little backstory and a "don't ask questions!" mentality among the preexisting captives which is antithetical to a viable, workable society. Unanswered questions is a literary device meant to create tension along the way, but it only works when the characters are in situations in which answers are denied by events--such as being interrupted by The Bad Thing before one can get the answer. These characters are sitting, bored, in a restricted area with lots of opportunities for exposition but refusing to provide it. It distracts considerably from the story's appeal and credibility. There's also the cosmetic factor. It's VERY hard to believe that a society entirely composed of boys living rough in the woods would have such cleanly cropped hair and perfect skin all around. Even Boy Scouts are not this well-kept after one *week* camping. Still, I can see why the story appeals to its target audience of teenagers (or emotionally and intellectually arrested post-teens) wanting to see themselves as individuals standing out in an undifferentiated mass of conformists. It's really no different from Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Divergent, I Am Number Four, Ender's Game, and all those other "miracle child" story lines. Plus with this one you have the high school metaphor: trapped in a controlled environment, a specific caste system in place, the navigable "maze" only available to the best within them, being unaccountably provided with the basic sustenance for survival and constantly being frightened by outside forces claiming that a failure to conform will mean certain doom. The semi-reveal of the "experimental environment" is silly. It appears to be tacked-on and irrational, possibly as an invitation to see the next book in the series. But in reality it just feels like much ado about nothing. Overall, entertaining as long as you don't invest too much into the consistency or credibility.
10.0~Movie review lumuykeang Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is a story that talks about a boy name Thomas who wake up in the lift with his memory erased. The only thing he can remember was his name. After he tried to adapt in the new place that only have a group of boys, he learned that they have been trapped in the giant maze but within the center called the Glade. The group of boys called themselves the Glader, they have build their own society in the Glade and they divided their group of people into the group of Runner,builder, gardener and doctor...Every morning the 'Runner' will run into the maze in hope they can find a way out of the maze and Thomas decided to join the 'Runner' to figure a way out. My favorite character is Thomas, Newt and Minho because of their team work,their loyalty and many more things about them impressed me. The good thing about this movie is that the maze design is super cool. There is a scene that i really enjoyed.It's the part where Thomas and Minho found the area called Blade, where there is like the swing doors that swing as they're running passed them. It's very well designed that get the audience like me bewitched. Through this movie, I broke down into tears at the part where Thomas's best friend, Chuck die. I got so emotional at that time. when the movie end, I was like 'Nooooo I want more !!'. At the end of the story, I really wish Chuck didn't die because he is a funny guy, all in all i have nothing I dislike about this story. I would recommend this movie to all teenager who love watching action movie. The story line of The Maze Runner could be compared to the Hunger Game for various reasons. They both focus on teenagers fighting for survival in a painfully twisted world, with the protagonist having a tenacious spirit and a drive that pushes them through any obstacles. Moreover, they are targeted at the same audience. I would love to rate this story 10 out of 10!!
3.0~The Maze Runner-Review larsgoff Sign in Permalink Unfortunately there is not a lot of positive things I can say about this film. My wife and I saw it together and both came away equally disappointed. The film opens with absolutely no character or plot development. I guess the viewer is meant to share in the feelings of helplessness and confusion that the main character experiences as he is thrust out of the dark into his new setting without even any memory of who he is. From there the viewer is confronted with one stretch of the imagination after another. Like a bunch of boys trapped together in an enigmatic and hostile environment living in complete harmony and orderliness. My wife thought this movie had a lot of the same feel and appeal as "The Hunger Games." I have to concur on the basis that both seem equally preposterous. I went to this movie off a recommendation from a relative. I had not read any of the books or even a detailed plot summary. If I had known it was a post apocalyptic scenario that might have helped me accept the bizarre nature of it. We might have overlooked all the bad and unbelievable elements if it had not been for the blatant and offensive message that "Wicked is good,"delivered at the end. Following that we both agreed we would not recommend this movie to anyone.
6.0~Am I getting older or what? Sleepin_Dragon Sign in Permalink OK, so dude (Thomas) wakes up in a box, he becomes part of a community of other young guys, surrounded by walls. Nobody is allowed to leave, or cross the walls. One slip up from someone let's him know that they are in a maze, wild roaring is heard from beyond the walls. There are 'Maze runners' within the community that have spent three years trying to find a way out. Thomas has disturbing flashbacks, some kind of medical procedure. He gets trapped in the maze and begins to discover what's going on. I'm assuming that writer Noah Openheim was a bit of a fan of Lost, it feels a little like it, crossed with Lord of the Flies. It's quite an interesting concept I guess, it just doesn't feel very original or extraordinary. There is one serious amount of running around. A couple of jumps I suppose, not scary in the least, but there is a bit of action. The grievers are quite an interesting creation, like Spidery Aliens i guess. The arrival of Teresa was quite horrendous (bit of a stretch from Skins!!) Her accent did veer from Amercianish to English. I find these types of film quite formulaic, there's the guy he doesn't get on with, there's the death of the guy he'll replace, there's the annoying kid, there's the brit (with the overly English accent!) let's have someone from Hull for a change!! I quite liked the ending, it was an interesting conclusion, obviously there will be a few of these, but the finale has left me wanting to see the next one. I've read some reviews that have utterly savaged this film, it's not that bad, it's far from a great movie, but it's worth a look. 6/10
5.0~Nothing to rave about Drew_Gardiner Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is based off the young adult fiction novel, and the first of a three part series. If you enjoyed the hunger games, this will have a familiar feel to it. Something about young adult fiction that you can just tell. The Maze Runner is competent for what it set out to do, which is mirror the simplistic story line of the book. Its not per say a BAD movie, however, its not something that you would run to tell your friend about. Also, if you read the book- the story seemed rushed in the film. Thomas arrives at the green and everything seems to pour out almost simultaneously. i enjoyed the book, i really did, but the movie just didn't pace it out well enough. I wasn't connected to the characters or the story line, more just mindlessly observing.
9.0~The Maze Runner lihour Sign in Permalink I don't really appreciate the movie with thrilling and mysterious scene. But I must give this a thumb up. It went beyond my expectation. This movie was pretty much better than divergent and insurgent. A great performance, which felt so real to me, remarkable conclusion and cliff-hanger ending, and appealing characters, Minho for example, were the points that I like this movie. In my view, the most challenging part was when they were trying to run the maze finding the exit. They faced many obstacles, they had to protect themselves as well as some of the Gladers from Grievers. I was sitting at the edge of my chair because it caught so much of my attention. Even though the storyline was a bit of illogical, but it was interesting and I enjoyed it. I couldn't wait to watch the next series. And I strongly recommend this movie, don't miss it out. It's a blessing in disguise.
1.0~seriously? stvrla-dona Sign in Permalink my English is really poor but I need to do this. I have no problem whatsoever watching bad action-sci-fi or blah movies. I watched divergent, it was enjoyable despite being dumb and I would maybe watch it again and laugh at it with friends or sth. But this was an outrage. of course there are gonna be spoilers in the'review' cause i wanna highlight the most beautiful moments of pure what? in the film. I won't mention plot-holes cause an essay wouldn't be enough,so here are just some interesting character reactions When Ben gets stung by the what was it called yeah griever he was simply thrown in the labyrinth. WHY? We've lived three years with the guy, but hey let's give him an agonizing death. You wanna use him as an offering? then for god's shake, kill him first and then throw him to the grievers. Then Andy and minho show up late 'cause minho is carrying the stung Andy and Thomas runs in just in time to be trapped with them. If he had hopped in a moment earlier and tried helping minho they all would ve gotten out but, OK. Then, minho decides to leave Andy, the guy for whom he got trapped, get eaten by grievers. nice one minho. If you wanted to 'live and let die' you should've run out before the doors closed. And then comes the genius hiding part, but English is too much effort, so i'll just skip that. When they come back Andy is kept alive for what?sentimental value? he was stung people. You killed stung Ben the other day, remember? The girl. Surely, we all thought of the same thing. Twenty dudes alone for three years and a woman just shows up. Nothing happens. Nothing. In the end the we're the millers kid, who was too afraid to walk in the maze till now, shows up stung just to kill chunk from the goonies.He wasn't a runner, right? So, he studied the miniature maze to get there (if it was not destroyed the day before), left the other farmer boys behind, entered the maze, fought a griever to take the key, found the password and showed up just in time for revenge. And that was the guy who valued his life and a peaceful living. And in the end of the end we learn about some antidote research, which involved sending healthy kids to a fancy high budget survivor maze because that's how we study brains here in the who-cares-about- efficiency research facilities of dr evil. Observation of some immune to brain-melting-disease kids will lead to HEHE THEY GOT THE BAIT. what bait? As if they care if she's alive or dead. They don't even remember who you are!oh, you so wicked Patricia clarkson. Or is it that none of these facts is true and they were just using the kids for sth else entirely? I spent almost two hours of my life watching this well, I just hope evil corp is doing all this for fun because anything else just won't do anymore Reviews Cheaper than therapy I hope no one was offended
4.0~hated. rmw8339 Sign in Permalink Alright, this movie was great. Unless you have read the book. I was a GIGANTIC fan of the book. I became very invested when I found out there was going to be a movie because I thought it would be amazing. Wrong. If you have read the book, you know one of the main parts is how Teresa and Thomas can chat with their minds and how it plays out even further into the rest of the books, right? THEY Don't HAVE THIS IN THE MOVIE. I was very disappointed. I was honestly heart broken. I usually look past this kind of stuff but I just couldn't this time. Dylan O'Brien is a great actor. But he looks WAY too old for this movie. He is suppose to be like 16 and he looks 25. They should have has someone else play the lead role.
7.0~The craze of this maze will amaze oceanic_osprey Sign in Permalink Greetings all, Upon hearing that another trilogy of books were to turned into movies I approached this film with trepidation. What I expected was another formulaic, open ended movie designed only for making money. I can gladly say this hypothesis was wrong. We're delivered a tense thriller, most impressively, through a fairly young and unknown cast. This is a character driven film for sure, and one of the main characters is the four giant walls surrounding the trapped group of individuals. I jest, but they really do add an ominous feel to the intrigue of their entrapment. Let me voice my pleasure with the few issues I had. The so called forest that lies within the 'glade' however, which seemed to be displayed with varying degrees of size depending if one was inside or outside of it. Although not to it's detriment, there was a large number of the cast there for the sole purpose of numbers. To me, the unnamed characters that don't receive much of a part in this sort of film generally come across as the fodder, and this case it is fair to say they were nothing but. I did not care for the hierarchy of the group and find some of the behaviour (apart from the lead character) and adherence to simple rules a little unbelievable when all the while we must remember they are trapped. The premise chugs along nicely, although I must say the end suffered heavily from being the first of a potential franchise, with the finale as predictable as ever. These aspects are not to deter you from watching this film however, as they are relatively minor negatives. Overall I was very pleased with the end product. I think one of the highlights of this film working is the camera direction, never venturing beyond the maze walls for the majority of the film's duration, a master stroke surely. Boasting some great visuals, the monsters are little more than a plot device but they serve their purpose well enough. With a quality direction and a well-rounded young cast who maintain the viewer's belief in their peril this could be an exciting taste of things to come.
5.0~Decent Action, Poor Premise comradequestions Sign in Permalink At my wife's behest, I finally gave in and watched The Maze Runner. She had read the books (well, listened on audiobook) and really enjoyed it, and I figured it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility that a young-adult novel would stretch reality a bit, but the Maze Runner requires an unfortunate suspension of logic and practicality. The acting is surprisingly well done on most accounts; the characters themselves are of course walking clichés at times, but overall, not bad for young actors. Of course, they had to pick a girl who happens to look almost exactly like Kristen Stewart, and unfortunately seemed to share quite a bit in common with her character and style of acting. I am marking this as containing spoilers, but to be honest, I'm not sure how much there is to spoil. The plot-line is just, well, basically asinine. There are plot-holes you could drive a truck through. Not only are we left without any clue as to how the 'maze challenge' is supposed to be helpful to pretty much anyone, it seems pretty ridiculous to assume one of the last crowning achievements before the fall of civilization would be to build a several trillion dollar state of the art, near impossible to construct maze with bio-engineered bug android things, rather then, say, a laboratory with centrifuges and whatnot, you know, how most diseases are cured. Unfortunately, it seems the writer of the Maze Runner (novel) went the way of Lost, and even though he may be pretty decent with character dynamics, he seemed to have written himself into a hole with complete nonsense following. Speaking to my wife, the movie only made things muddier, as countless changes were made, and unfortunately they were lateral changes at best, no actual improvements. Overall, a decent rent, the action is pretty decent, the character dynamics and the acting from some young adults is surprisingly well done, but just check your brain at the door.
8.0~A "real" teen novel movie;with actual teens and awesome story leaving me hungry for more. ashwinnair99 Sign in Permalink Finally a proper teen novel movie that is of a good theme and a more believable story(although sci-fi).It has no boring romance like Twilight or a weak plot like Hunger Games(although I am a fan).The story is about a group/community of teenage boys captured by someone and erased or their memory except of their name ,common sense and linguistic skills. They don't know what this movie is about and neither do we. We finally find out in the climax and it is satisfying. Although it is not what I predicted , it was(for the first time) awesome.Dylan O Brein's acting is terrific and so is the others. There is nothing wrong with the movie. Only problem I could find was they lacked the ability to now that it would be a hit and should have begun the sequel immediately as we feel starved and incomplete without the sequel coming soon. I believe it has great potential and is at war with The Hunger Games.
10.0~The actors and actresses did a grateful job sommerash Sign in Permalink When I went to the cinema to see the movie, I was only interested in Dylan O'Briens job, but after I saw how everybody did their character job great, I fell in love with the movie! One of the best movies I've seen. If they wasn't there, I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10! The actors and actresses took care of the movie plot perfectly. Of course the movie plot was fantastic too! I'm an actor too. Right now i only acts in theaters, but I still know a lot about movie acting. . . .
8.0~Nice reflection about natural selection process and authority. ramonblanquer Sign in Permalink I might agree with some users which said the plot is not great and that there are a lot of clichés, but further than that I think it tackles two ideas which really invites the user to think over and take a position on these. And that made the movie amazing! The first one is presence of Darwin's natural selection process and the meaning of evolution towards a better specie contrasted with the ethics of death. Is it worth accepting death for a better generation? Would you agree with the scientists or would you protest against the experiment? The second topic is the role of authority in a surviving group versus curiosity and progress. What would you prefer, to stick to that place or to find a way out? It's not really a bad life in the end! They are all friends in there, they socialize, they party... Authority (Gally) makes things work good, it organizes a society, but at the same time rules are set up. Philosopher John Stuart Mill talked about it, for the people of a society to contribute to live together with harmony and rights, they have to sacrifice a small part of their freedom. In this movie the small part of freedom is messing up the maze system. But at the same time, why not looking further ahead? It could be more and better! That's the philosophy, that's the curiosity that makes the world progress and step forward, but that implies accepting risks and unexpected situations. It's a nice contrast over there! I really enjoyed how the roles of the authority and the rule-breaker are distributed.
9.0~Delivers Potential from the Intricate Path of the YA Genre valen060 Sign in Permalink When it comes to young adult (or YA) books-turned-films, I usually tend to ignore such when they release into movie theaters and try to rent it on DVD when it's available. However, upon reading several positive reviews from a few notable top movie critics regarding the genre's latest movie adaptation 'The Maze Runner,' I decided to give it a shot to see if their reviews live up to what they had seen on screen. By the time I walked out of the theater I remained puzzled, yet my expectations were met and I was growing eager on what lies ahead for the main characters. The story about an amnesiac youth named Thomas is sent into a giant maze surrounded by other trapped boys calling themselves the Glade. Although he tries to regain his lost memories as well as figuring out why he and his fellow captives are there to begin with, he finds out that for the past three years, the Glade routinely sends out Runners to find a way out of the difficult labyrinth. To solve this mystery, they must work together (along with a girl who seems to have ties with Thomas) and escape the perilous, constantly-shifting path waiting before them, or be forever trapped like rats in a maze. Unlike the previous abundance of YA (female dominated) book-turned-films that proved unappealing and leaning mostly towards predictability (with the exception of 'Harry Potter' and 'The Hunger Games'), I best describe this movie adaptation of James Dashner's famed book series as an intricately dark premise, yet engaging in content. It's one of those YA rarities that actually turn up as successful to both critics and audiences, but seems to now have its aim toward the male half among the large abundance of female audiences. Lead star Dylan O'Brien (of MTV's Teen Wolf) delivered such a believable and interesting performance as memory-impaired Thomas as he tries to discover his true purpose by stepping up and proving his worth among his fellow captives. Actor Will Poulter also created quite a game changer in this role compared to his previous films ('Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader,' 'We're the Millers') as tough guy Gally. While the only female lead Kaya Scodelario balanced out the seriousness and the sensitivity among the Glade members as Teresa. As a whole, it seems to have the dystopian, thrilling elements of 'The Hunger Games' crossed with the male-driven survival themes of 'Lord of the Flies' with ominous tones of NBC's 'Revolution.' Since it's basically composed of an almost entirely male cast of characters (save for the only female lead), there are moments I've noticed where some scenes still remain unclear and need to be re-watched to understand it carefully. The tension and adrenaline just kept building up as more uncertainties within the bewildering labyrinth are explored, from encountering ferocious creatures called Grievers to the frequently-shifting walls that form new pathways to different sections, and a mysterious organization called W.C.K.D. With all these elements, including a strong cast and story, it has the potential to reach the ranks of the few significant others in the pool of YA film adaptations. Can't wait to see what the movie's sequel has to offer. It definitely follows the trail left behind by 'The Hunger Games.' Needless to say, the trials have barely just begun.
8.0~Fascinating Necroambulant Sign in Permalink I almost feel ashamed of myself for watching The Maze Runner without having first read the books upon which the movie series is based. I was fully intending to do just that, but just didn't get around to it, and I didn't want to put off watching the movie any longer. I've read articles and reviews where others have commented on the deviations from the novel, both positively and negatively...but I want to read the books even more now that I have had the chance to watch the movie. It was quite interesting and intense at points, overall very well done. On the surface it bears more than a passing resemblance to stories like Lord of the Flies and The Most Dangerous Game cobbled together with the now commponplace (but not overwhelming) dose of dystopian, post apocalyptic coming of age drama. I'm certainly looking forward to the next installment in the series being released later this year, and by that time I hope to have gotten around to reading the series of novels if I can squeeze them in with all of the other things I have in my ever growing to-be-read collection.
10.0~Minho is love Minho is life erinbates-64441 Sign in Permalink Tbh Thomas was not my favourite....... as you can guess from the title it was Minho😁 this movie gripped me from the beginning and I loved the scorch trials also ( Brenda was one of my favourites from that one. The death cure was long and I was kinda bored but I'm glad they rescued Minho! When newt died I tried not to cry ( I was in the cinema with some other people) and also when winston died in the second i did cry a bit ( that was a really sad part especially when you hear the gun going off)
8.0~Really good start for a new trilogy rudolfravbar Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner, a cool sci-fi movie based on a novel by James Dashner, really kicks ass. I'm not going to compare the book and movie, just to be clear. So, everything started after Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) woke up in some old, dark elevator. He was brought to glade which was surrounded by a maze. Then, Thomas joined "runners" that are exploring maze and trying to find an exit, but, the maze is changing it's structure every night. Walls are rotating and making different maze. After a few days, a super hot chick, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) , was brought in glade as well. All dudes and one chick... Not going to end well. What I really like in this movie is fear of grievers, creepy mechanic monsters that are living in a maze. I like animation of grievers and their sounds as well. Also, i like their assurance that they will never find an exit of a maze, but they are still running through it, they are not giving up. No humor, which is telling us to take a movie more serious. Things that I don't really like is acting. It's OK, but not perfect. Also, I don't like ending. I know, there are two more parts, but the explanation of the maze is not enough explained. That's the only reason why do you have to read a book. So, The Maze Runner is a movie that will entertain you and make you read a whole book trilogy. I am definitely looking forward to the next two or three movies that are going to release in next few years.
6.0~The maze runner is a challenging movie and make you feel so challenged when you watch it! najwadalilah Sign in Permalink The maze runner is an American science fiction dystopian action thriller movie directed by Wes Ball, based on the novel with the same name. The story follows sixteen-year-old Thomas, portrayed by dylan O'Brien, who awaked in a rusty elevator with no memory of who he is, only to learn he's been delivered to the middle of an intricate maze, along with a large number of other boys, who have been trying to find their way out of the ever-changing labyrinth and they should escape from the labyrinth no matter the condition is- all while establishing a functioning society in what they call the Glade. Scorch trials is the second series and the death cure is the third series of the maze runner. The sound effects are not bad and are not disappoint at all. I feel so challenging when i watched this movie!
6.0~Not the best young adult film adaptation, but could have been worse. joshuadrake-39480 Sign in Permalink I had to say, my expectations for THE MAZE RUNNER were very low before the film's release. I read the book and I did not know how the movie was going to do at the box office or with the fans of the book and critics. The first film in the series is based on a series of books by James Dashner and it is an entertaining film, but it's not flawless. The story follows Thomas, a boy who wakes up in a moving elevator going up called The Box. Once he arrives, he discovers a grassy area called The Glade and the people that live there called Gladers. Not being able to remember anything, Thomas discovers an opening in the wall near the glade and is warned not to enter it as it leads to a massive maze. After Thomas learns about the monsters that wander the maze at night, he realizes that the maze may hold the key to getting out. When a young girl, Teresa arrives in the box, Thomas's memory starts to come back and he realizes what is really going on and sets out to try and find a way out. I wasn't totally against the movie, I was very interested to see how this movie would turn out, so my sister went out one night and bought a couple of movies from RedBox and she bought this movie. My sisters, Ricardo and my mother Tiffany actually saw this film. I literally did not see this movie until long after I read the book and until it came out on DVD. This movie is OK. But it is not without it's flaws. This is a throwback to teenage thriller movies as it features an entire young cast of teens who present themselves well on the large movie screen. The idea with the film is fun and it is designed to give us an adrenaline pumping story. That is a major flaw, it is supposed to be a film based on an young adult novel. The creatures in the maze are called "Grievers", they look really cool and amazing, but they also look like cyborg-like scorpions that bare a striking resemblance to the bugs in "Starship Troopers" and that is just crazy. Another problem is the Grievers, we don't see much of them until one of them is killed in the second act of the film. This sequence becomes the drive to finish the story and that's all we get because we don't know a lot about and they attempt to play an important role in the film and this creates a major plot hole. The one major problem that these young adult movies keep having is that in every teenage movie, there has to be an antagonist and this goes to Will Poulter as Gally and he plays the role like an idiot and he does not make me feel sympathy for him at all. Why you put a stupid-ass character in the movie? That's just bad writing, but this is THE MAZE RUNNER , so, no hard feelings. There are some cool scenes in the film. When Thomas goes into the maze after dark and is chased by the "Grievers", it's a cat and mouse sequence that keeps you going. The last sequence is when they try to get out of the maze and they attack in numbers and that is kinda cool. The third act in the film is just stupid and typical, but also good. You can see what the ending is going to be and it is no exception. The sequence at the end makes no sense and you should see this to know what I am talking about and it involves one of the characters. The ending is when they get out of the maze and they go into another maze. That is bullcrap! Is that supposed to set up a sequel because if it is, I'm paying to see it on DVD! The acting is good and bad, the supporting cast is out there and makes a lot of effort to put on good performances, but the only two that really shines out is Dylan O'Brien and Kaya Scodelario and they have great chemistry. Overall, I enjoy THE MAZE RUNNER. I don't think it's a perfect film by far and it is not as good as Hunger Games, Twilight or Divergent, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse and I DO MEAN WORSE. The film tells us a story that we already know, but it is amazingly well-directed and really fresh. Sure, it has it's major flaws, a stupid character and a very confusing ending setting up a sequel, titled "THE SCORCH TRIALS", for a September release this year and I can't wait, it is still watchable. I give THE MAZE RUNNER a 6.5/10.
7.0~Enjoyable but not brilliant shawbags Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner story isn't one of the brilliants I have seen, it is interesting enough to satisfy my interest. Opening scene is intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such movies as Cube and TV- Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days.
6.0~A fun movie if you lower your expectations NitroBGA Sign in Permalink I liked it. A poorly scripted, but well executed sci-fi dystopian action movie. Nothing too fancy, nothing too bad. I completely agree with the reviewers pointing out the shortcomings, I just don't know what you'd expect. If you told me this thing got a few Oscars I'd be stunned but knowing this is a mediocre sci-fi that attempts to create an somewhat original reality - I'm fine with it. Sure, highly dosed suspencion of disbelief is needed and the acting isn't amazing either. So I guess my final verdict is this: If you have to pay more than 1-2$ to see it it's probably not worth your money. But if you get a cheap deal or just wanna have fun - it won't kill you.
10.0~Amazing movie! maria-work-georgiou Sign in Permalink I don't understand why viewers were expecting so much more out of the movie... Throughout the whole movie I was so focused and sat up the whole time. The movie is amazing, the storyline makes sense, it doesn't go off track and start with stupid things, suspense continues throughout the whole movie. I really enjoyed it, I bought the DVD. If you're into like Harry Potter, Twilight, Hunger Games type thing - then the Maze Runner is something which falls into that category for you. All the negative criticism seems to be because too much was expected. Overall really good movie, worth watching if you're into suspense and action.
7.0~Did they even read the book? What is wrong with one of the main characters? khalil-afaneh7 Sign in Permalink They did little if not nothing in order to develop the characters, I felt like the only development that happened was Gally turning from angry to half insane. Where do I start about Teresa?.... I felt as if she wasn't even there the majority of the time. In the book Thomas cries over chuck because they were friends, in the movie it didn't even look like Thomas liked chuck. It was just too fast paced. This movie would of done better if they split the first book into two parts, they needed to focus on character development. In the book they went threw meetings where Thomas was the become the Keeper of the runners, not just a runner. Why were so many of the important parts cut out. I enjoyed the second book a lot more then the first, but even if that is the case here I still can't see the second movie being a big hit. Major spoilers here but without Teresa and Thomas feeling connected and having character development the second movie can't even try to compare to the book as it is a major factor in the second trial. The acting, the actors themselves didn't do a terrible job as whoever wrote their script did. I see many people talking of how there was no sense of sexual desire between any of the boys and Teresa, the reason why is because there doesn't need too. There wasn't any in the books and there doesn't need to be in the movie. TL:DR No Character Development, Bad Lines (Highschool student who sucks at writing, but loves reading, I couldn't wait for the movie, then I saw it)
10.0~Fine movie, would watch again n-87719 Sign in Permalink I would give it a 10/10. It was fine. Didn't think it was good or bad. It was pretty much whatever. I'd probably go watch it again though. 10/10 I would maybe, probably go watch it again so long as it's free. The movie wasn't good or bad it was just fine. >Spelunking anime
5.0~Another forgettable and quite vexing adaptation. Incendid Sign in Permalink Jacob's Review: I did not have high hopes or any real sense of anticipation, in fact I saw this movie on a spontaneous whim. The premise of this movie is similar to a lot of common young adult novels were teenagers are thrown into a perilous situation, need to work their way out, the special or reluctant hero and being observed and monitored by an oppressive of suspicious cooperation or government. Such premises have been tackled in films and their novel counterparts such as The Hunger Games and Divergent. This movie does have unbelievable and contrived reasons for its central Maze setting which is reluctantly passable at first but becomes more frustrating as the film explains itself. There are good performances and you do fear for our heroes in some very well executed maze chase sequences. Essentially an amnesia ridden teenager is delivered monthly to the maze via an underground elevator and the characters have to survive with no idea about their surroundings and restricted monthly resources. Interesting take on the young adult survivalist premise but as stated it really makes little to no sense. There are cyborg creatures that are treated with much fear and dread (hence their name grievers) but off course they are only great at diminishing the expendables and are clumsy around our heroes. The end has a severe case sequel bait and it only makes the ending more and more infuriating. See it if you want to, but you won't get anything terrific. 5/10
6.0~To me this really felt like an updated Lord of the Flies. A movie that teens who like Hunger Games and Divergent will like. cosmo_tiger Sign in Permalink "No one survives a night in the maze." Thomas (O' Brian) has just woken up in the middle of a field. He finds a group of kids his age and wonders about the large wall surrounding him. When he is told of the place he is at he begins to wonder why no one has thought of escape. After his first venture into the maze he begins to think there is a real chance of escape, but not everyone wants out. I was not all that excited about this. My son loved the books and was very excited about this, but as for me I just am not a fan of this new genre. The new "teens save the world" genre like the Hunger Games and Divergent just haven't really appealed to me. That may have been the reason I wasn't all the impressed with this movie. On the other hand though when any series is planned in advance the first one is mostly introductions and set up so it is usually the weakest of the bunch. As for my son who said this was his favorite book series ever...he wasn't all that impressed either. Take from that what you will. To me this really felt like an updated Lord of the Flies. Overall, a movie that teens who like Hunger Games and Divergent will like. I give this a B.
1.0~Contains spoiler! What the hXXX is this?!?! duquesa-794-55421 Sign in Permalink I wasn't sure whether to watch "Annabelle" or "The Maze Runner" and the only reason I chose this one was because it got higher rating than the other. Didn't expect much of it and assumed it would be a little childish just by looking at the poster, ie, my expectations were not high to begin with. But seriously, how can such a crappy movie like this get a rating above 7 ?? The beginning of the film went okey (not good, just okey). The first 20~30 minutes, I watched expecting to see what would come next. But then gradually, my impression of the movie was; "Seriously?" "What the heck!!" "They've got to be kidding!" "Is it just going to get worse?" "Can it get anymore tedious and stupid?" "Oh, gosh it's just ridiculous!" "What kind of moron made this??" (by two thirds of the movie, I started looking around to see if I could find the exit just to walk out) The story was so~~ poorly plotted that nothing really made sense. Except for the first 20~30 minutes, it just got worse and worse. I wonder whether this movie was made just to reuse or recycle the left- over props of the movie "Alien" and some other crappy movies(not that Alien was bad) because there was absolutely nothing new or original about the grievers or whatever stupid looking monsters they were. The person whoever made this movie must have an intellectual quotient below two digits! Total waste of time and money.
5.0~Watchable adventure with some intense moments! 5/10 leonblackwood Sign in Permalink Review: I really am in two minds about this movie because the concept wasn't bad and it does have the potential to make a good franchise but I did find the actors quite annoying and none of the characters were that interesting. It's about a boy who wakes up surrounded by a colony of teenagers who have built a world for themselves in the middle of nowhere. The only thing that they can see is this massive maze which no one dares to enter because it shuts after a while. The only people who do go inside the maze are the maze runners who are trying to find a way out. I understood the movie up to that point but when they started to explain why these teenagers were put there, I got lost. I'm sure that it will all come to light when they bring out the sequel, which is obviously bound to happen because of the ending but I hope that they will introduce some interesting characters which will make the movie much better. Apart from that, there are some decent elements to the movie like the big spiders and the fact that Thomas put them all there in the first place and I liked some of the intense moments like when they were trying to go through the maze the first time but it wasn't anything that aMAZING. Watchable! Round-Up: There's obviously a deep story behind this movie which will explain why they shipped these kids to the middle of nowhere, but were yet to see it. The director touched the matter near the end of the film but it still didn't explain why these spiders were killing people and what the girl and Thomas were actually doing before they got to this mysterious island. There are a few familiar faces in the movie like Will Poulter from Son Of Ranbow and We're The Millers and Thomas Brodick-Sangstar from the Game Of Thrones and Love Actually but it wasn't there best performance. I also recognised the guy who played Alby (Aml Ameen) from the Bill, which used to be a cop drama in the UK but I haven't seen the guy who played the lead (Dylan O'Brien) in anything else. The mysterious girl (Kaya Scodelario) is also from the UK and she had a brief role in Moon and also starred in Clash Of The Titans but I doubt that her part in this movie has really been revealed yet. Anyway, it's a watchable movie that has some intense moments and a good concept but I honestly don't think that we have seen the best from this franchise yet. Budget: $34milion Worldwide Gross: $341million I recommend this movie to people who are into their mysterious/adventures about a colony of teenagers who have been put in the middle of nowhere with a maze as there only escape. 5/10
1.0~It was so bad I was compelled to make an IMDb account just to say so here daytonadriver5 Sign in Permalink I don't need to rehash what all the other reviewers are saying. It really is that bad and how this has a 7/10 rating on IMDb is beyond my understanding. You might get a sliver of value out of this if you turn your brain off before you start watching. It's not worth the time it takes to watch it. This is really all I want or need to say about this turd of a movie, but IMDb wants me to say more so I can post my review. Seriously, you shouldn't read any further because you are wasting time and brain cells if you are still considering watching this movie! If you really want the rest of the review, read on: The movie tries to be a combination of many popular movies and just ends up with a incoherent mash up of unrealistic yet predictable characters, innumerable plot holes, and overused tropes. The production value was surprisingly good, although wasted on this dud of a film. Special effects and camera-work were good. The sound effects and surround mixing were exceptional. Even the actors were not horrible despite the comically bad script and plot. If and when they make the sequel to this, count me out.
9.0~Great Movie Great Actin mstng50 Sign in Permalink Having not read the books I was not overly excited to see this film. The trailer had looked interesting. I asked my brother if he wanted to see it and he said, "I am boycotting all young adult movies and books." And you know I kind of feel the same way. It seems as though it has been all vampire, zombies, and romance. And to be perfectly honest the Hungers Games movies have not really drawn me. So when when my wife and I decided to go see Maze Runner it was with a certain amount of hesitation. My hope was that it would be at least as good as Ender's Game (which was not a great movie but okay). I was not disappointed. This movie is far better than Ender's Game. Actually, I would say it is the best movie I have seen all year. The story itself was gripping in that during the entire time we know only as much as the main character, Thomas. The special effects were great, but not overpowering. And the acting, this is perhaps the best acting I have seen all year! All of these teenagers played their parts well. If you are looking for a gripping movie, then go see the Maze Runner. I would only warn you that there is a lot of violence, but it is not gory. It is rather like the violence presented in the Dark Knight. The imagination does most of the work. I would definitely see this one in theaters again.
5.0~Read neck4592-690-365026 Sign in Permalink A movie based off a book is always a bit worse than the book IMO. But the maze runner movie was absolutely completely terribly worse than the book. Almost completely different plot, no emotion at all compared to the movie, and just plain bad. It'd be a badass movie for those who haven't read the book. But if you have and are expecting it just to be a live action version of the book, the movie isn't near worth the watch.
10.0~The Maze Runner tinsocheata Sign in Permalink The maze runner It was the best movie i've ever seen it before. Not only the great cast but also great movie. Honestly I haven't read the book yet but most people.said it a little different from the book. But it good to be different like that. I like it a lot. It seem to be boring at the first part but after Thomas become the runner they start to find door to.leave it start getting interest. I hate it when Gally and his man always thought Thomas was the spy that WCKD send to them. Actually the truth is Thomas was once man of the WCKD but he is good person. He cant dare to watch his suffer from death like this he just send himself to the maze. He help the Glader a lot. This movie can compare to Hunger Game because it like they want to test people IQ how long can they remember something. I recommend you guys to watch Hunger Game. For the bad part or negative thinking i think i don't have at all. I just cant wait to watch Death Cure the third movie of the maze.
8.0~The Best and More Relatable Out of The Young Adult Novel Film Genre! KalKenobi83 Sign in Permalink Watched The Maze Runner Featuring Featuring Dylan O'Brien(The Internship) as Thomas, Thomas Brodie-Sangster(Nanny McPhee) as Newt , Will Poulter(The Chronicles Of Narnia) as Gally, Ki Hong Lee (Blue Bloods) as Minho .Aml Ameen(Lee Daniels The Butler) as Alby , Blake Cooper(Necessary Roughness) as Chuck, the lovely Kaya Scodelario(Moon) as Teresa and Patricia Clarkson(Miracle) as Ava Paige . This is very different take on the Young Adult Novels Films they usually have a female innovator who changes everything like Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games Series and Shailene Woodley's Tris Prior in The Divergent But This time they had a male innovator that i could finally relate what also enjoyed is that is was focused on the males and the situation, no romantic subplot it was all about find answers and getting out of the maze it was somewhat predictable but to me thats good also all the characters were likable and you did care when they died amazing Screenplay by Grant Pierce Meyers(Across The Universe), Costume Design By Simonetta Mariano(Riddick) ,Musical Score By John Paesano(Superman/Batman: Apocalypse ) and Direction By Newcomer Wes Ball , The Best and More Relatable Out of The Young Adult Novel Film Genre 8/10
7.0~A good movie for quite a rubbish title jeffreyhillen-364-945381 Sign in Permalink Since the Harry Potter films a lot of YA based story's came out in books and movies. So the first thought when another YA story comes up is :" another of all the same ?" and you will think very easily that the maze runner is a spin off or a copy of the Hunger Games. Both seem to have a lot of things in common. But when you see the movie you will soon think otherwise. When I read books, write books or watch movies I love to see that character develop throughout a series, at least to see them having a character. And to see the difference between them all the characters. For the audience that is the most wonderful thing to see because how better the story and the characters are developed the better they can relate to that world and characters. And get that special connection. When I saw this film I saw some characters really had a background story and developed but some could be developed more. And I hope when I am going to read the book, I will read about that. So the characters in this film were really great you could really feel that how it must have been for them between those walls. The storyline I think worked really well but I think the suspense could be higher. The grievers were beaten quite easily, but seeing the story as a whole it was a really interesting plot. It was not only a YA story, but there were also big emotional moments which I loved seeing, In a cinematic way. I rate this film 7/10 the world of THE MAZE RUNNER was created beautifully and the plot worked really well. Let #2 come. Go Minho!
8.0~Interesting boozie79 Sign in Permalink I actually found this movie to be very interesting. I thought it was going to be crappy but it kept my attention throughout the entire thing. The Actors, especially the guy who played Thomas, did a good job making all the "wrong decisions" which is probably what made this movie so adventurous. The story was well put together, there's s non scene that could have been done different. If only the ending wasn't so abrupt, but other than that this movie is a winner. They did a good job choosing characters, I feel like they fit very well. The fact that is was mainly teens in the movie contributed to the awesomeness, I liked that a lot. I liked this movie a lot to the point that I just want to go see it again. I am looking forward to the part 2 of this.
9.0~A different kind of race for life.. film316-125-427677 Sign in Permalink It seems all too common place now that every 6 months or so a film that is aimed at the "Teen" audience will be brought out, always part of a series, always the same kind of tone, this trend started with Twilight. So I suppose the reel question is will The Maze Runner catch fire or just diverge(nt)? I feel like it's almost unfair to compare The Maze Runner to any of the other movies that are around this genre because it is so wildly different to them, it's true they have similarities but it has similarities to The Hangover in the respect that it has 3 men in central roles, that doesn't mean they should be categorised together, no. That would be a travesty to a film that tries hard to be separate. What we should compare the film to is Lord Of The Flies or even Stand By Me, because that's what the tone matches, it is morose and brooding. Unlike the other movies around it The Maze Runner is set up so there is no reason to box up emotions or feelings, the characters are free to express themselves however they see fit. Frequently this means spats of violence, but that isn't a bad thing. The entire tone of the film underpins its deepening reasoning for story. From the very opening we are presented with a simple set up, there is a society that consists of only males, living in a large open field and wooded area who have formed a society for themselves. For me the best parts of The Maze Runner was while they are still in the Glade, that feeling of unending imprisonment was one that fascinated me, and how the boys interacted really worked strongly. That they have a leader and a higherarcy was something I personally wanted to explore more, but I understand the film has to move itself forward into more prosperous places to set up the future movies. The movie plays its tension well and when the final moment of the final act arrives, it has power and weight to it. It is a sequence that both upsets and astounds us, this is how I know that The Maze Runner had won. That I felt an emotion at the end of the film meant that it's magic had worked on me and I ultimately cared about what happened to these people. The Maze Runner feels like it should do, as if it has a perpetual swing constantly building momentum until it reaches it's crescendo and we receive the pay off. This is clever film making at it's best. It's also nice to see a film that isn't scared to kill of main characters in the first outing, and isn't frightened to show us some truly horrific monsters and sequences. To say that the cast are impressive in The Maze Runner is a great understatement, this entire film is carried on two actors shoulders; Thomas Brodie-Sangster, who gets more impressive every time I see him and the incredibly talented Will Poulter, who is starting to show such strong promise I'm beginning to watch movies just because he is featured. Mr Poulter is one of the most talented and underrated actors in the world. The Maze Runner is a film that took a gamble and made a more adult themed movie for a younger audience crowd. The gamble pays off, The Maze Runner is a movie that dares to be different in a world full of the same.
6.0~Good Looking Guys and a Weak Story ingridcoram Sign in Permalink Take your seat in the cinema and prepare to watch yet another young adult, Dystopian future successful book based film in which a group of innocent, unknowing teenagers must rebel against a government of older people with terrible morals and awful ideas about keeping the world running. In my opinion, the Hunger Games started the trend. Its phenomenal success inspired many writers (particularly Veronica Roth - who decided by changing Katniss' name to Tris and giving her a brother instead of a sister, she'd make tons of money. And she did!) and many trilogies (always a trilogy). The Maze Runner is no exception. I went in thinking there was only one book, but when the last sentence in the film is 'It's time to begin Phase 2' I sort of realised there was at least a sequel. Yay...? It was an entertaining mess of CGI, intense scenes with weird robotic chickens, a girl (Kaya Scodelario) with absolutely no personality and the main character, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), being constantly confused about something and asking the others questions. Curiosity killed the cat, bro! There were many flaws. However, the main flaw, the biggest flaw, was the ending. Throughout the film, I had so many questions. Why are they in the maze? Who put them there? Will they get out? How will they get out? What are the grievers? What is the point of this whole thing? Why did the girl come? Why is Thomas different? The list goes on. In most films, they either answer all of your questions, or don't create so many with a confusing and over-complicated plot. I was expecting, when the menacing Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) came on screen, to have all my questions answered and to walk out able to write a kind review. No chance. I'm afraid I have to spoil it in order to fully express my disappointment, so if you haven't seen the film or read the book, I suggest you skip this paragraph. Ava Paige goes on...and on...and on about how the sun burned the Earth, then everyone got this disgusting brain disease, then new people were born who could resist it, then they decided to put teenagers in the maze to test them to see if they could...uh...I don't really know, actually. Now that I think about it. And that's how, and why, they were in the maze. Then Ava supposedly shoots herself and behind her everyone in her office is being shot (that makes sense because the laboratory that the guys from the maze have arrived at has all the bodies. It's the same place the video was filmed in. But why they were being shot and who did it...well, that's a good question!) by random people. The escapees from the maze are then ushered by armed people into a helicopter and they see that the whole world is desert. Oh, and before that, Gally (Will Poulter), a not so nice guy who argues with Thomas a lot and somehow made it out of the maze alone, goes crazy after being stung by a poison that's never really explained (yet claims the lives of several characters), and shoots the adorable Chuck (Blake Cooper), who is a lot younger than all the others for whatever reason. Minho (Ki Hong Lee), a fast runner, throws a spear that kills Gally. Unfortunately, Chuck has already been shot and dies - quite tragically, may I add - in Thomas' arms. Sob, sob...pass me that tissue, would you? Yeah. Finally, at the very end, Ava Paige - who is miraculously alive - walks into a boardroom, sits down, and talks about how 'they've taken the bait' and it's time 'to begin phase 2'. BOOM! End of film. A sequel, huh? You don't say...? Best thing I can say about this film - decent acting and hot guys. Damn; Thomas, Gally, Minho and even Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) are all pretty good-looking! Go see it if you've read the book (I haven't, actually) but other than that, just go if your friends are going. It's not a huge loss. The ending really sucks.
8.0~The Maze Runner deepwanti Sign in Permalink I recently watched this movie called "The Maze Runner", a scientific thriller film directed by Wes Ball. The main character Thomas wakes up in a rusty elevator and has no memory. He is in a community full of strangers in a place known as "The Glade". The place is enclosed by a massive maze and there is no escape. Thomas and his crew face a lot of challenges but they learn the ins and outs of the maze and finally find an escape route. The movie is filled with great suspense and kept me entertained at all times. The story opens with Thomas who wakes up in an elevator which was filled with water for a couple of hours. He is rescued by a gang of unfamiliar teenagers in a place called "The Glade". Thomas is unable to remember anything about himself. Alby, the leader of the group tells Thomas the condition is normal and he should remember his name soon. Alby shows Thomas around and how the Glade works. Thomas wonders whats beyond the maze and whether there is a way to escape. But he is warned by Alby not to go in the maze. While learning about The Glade, he meets Chuck and they both become friends. In the night there is a celebration to welcome Thomas. Every month a new person arrives and supplies come. Newt, a second in command and gardener tells Thomas the maze keeps changing and the only way to escape is to go through the maze. The Runners are the only one that are allowed to enter the maze. They plan for an escape route in the day and return back before nightfall. One of the boys end up with a fight with another boy named Gally, during which Thomas remembers his name. The next morning when Thomas is gathering supplies in the woods he is attacked by Ben, who has been stung by grievers; deadly monsters that roam around the maze in the night. The boys decide to banish Ben and leave him in the maze to die. On the other hand, one of the boys Alby is stung and unconscious. Minho, drags Alby to the entrance gate of the maze but is unable to make it through. Seeing this Thomas runs inside the maze and helps. The three boys survive at night with Thomas successfully killing the griever, and they return the next day with Alby which kept the other boys astonished. A few days later a new girl arrives Teresa, with a note in her hand "She is the final one". On the other hand Thomas accompanies Minho to the maze and discovers an escape route. After finding an escape route, all the boys follow Thomas inside the maze.With lots of twists and turns towards in the end, the boys finally made it through and they find an escape route. They discover that they were living in the world with a fatal disease known as The Flare. I really liked the photography of the film. The best part of The Maze Runner is the maze itself. The way the maze is built in a 3D form with creepy noises and monsters living inside it. Another aspect which I really enjoyed was the action pack sequence. The action pack sequence shown in the film is great. Most of the times there are fighting scenes with Thomas defeating the griever which is very entertaining to watch. Most of the action scenes were amazing and it seemed the grievers were real. One of my favorite actors is Thomas; the main protagonist of the film did a great job. Although, he faced many obstacles on the way but he acted bravely and went through fear. He also put himself in danger to help his friend. I also really liked the suspense and action of the movie. The one thing I learned from this movie was how courage and bravery were shown. With an unfamiliar place with strangers, and the will to escape this prison with challenges. I learned that don't lose hope and be prepared to face any challenges that come across. This movie is mainly to the teenagers as of today many teens like to watch movies of suspense and action. I would not recommend this movie for children because there is a lot of fear and violence. A lot of dead bodies as most boys while were crushed and killed by the griever. In my opinion, I think this is a great and interesting movie filled with a lot of action and suspense. I would rate this movie a 5/5 because it kept be entertained from the beginning to the end. The photography and the visual effects were spectacular and eye-catching.
5.0~An expensive to make ho hum movie. lois-lane33 Sign in Permalink I had a time slot to fill and this film was available to watch so I saw the film. I had seen the trailers and I knew what to expect. The movie was no revelation on any level. I fell asleep in the film-twice. I thought the set work was worthy of an adult science fiction movie but an adult science fiction movie this was not-it was made by young people for young people.I think that younger persons don't deserve to be in charge of such a large project. The story line was kiddish and was not up to the level of the sets it took place on. Kind of like seeing a sixteen year old driving around in a Rolls Royce or a Ferrari. It just comes off wrong. The film would have been a lot better if they hadn't relied on heavy handed creature special effects that were in scenes that were so loud I thought my eardrums were going to burst. The creature special effects were definitely not subtle and appeared to be a combination of creature special effects borrowed from the newer Riddick film & the Resident Evil film series. Pretty boring fair-even for teens, I think. And it was loud. Way loud. Loud does't make uninspired & dull sequences work better.
5.0~Disappointed ty_lattimore2007 Sign in Permalink While I did not read the book that the film is based, this movie was not what I hoped for. Part of it reminded me of an updated "Lord of the Flies." The movie just never really took off nor really went anywhere. It just did not capture my interest. I also expected more time spent in the actually maze. I will give the actors praise for trying, but something was off in the story/script. After seeing "The Giver" and "Ender's Game" recently, they all seem like basically the same movie. I have yet to see any of the Divergent or Hunger Game's movies, but I would bet again this same kind of film seems to be all over the box office. I am sure a sequel is in the works, but I will not be seeing it.
7.0~I know... Laakbaar Sign in Permalink I know, let's have a movie where a group of young men ends up on an island. They don't know why and they can't remember anything. They figure out how to survive and they have this society. Yes, like that book I read in high school. What was it called? But they're there for years and there's no way out. They are all fit, hot young guys, and they fight with each other and hang out together. Like they're on a Survivor show or something. What? Yeah, just guys. They try to get off the island but there are these sharks out there. - - - Really? OK, not an island surrounded by water, but an island surrounded by this huge stone walls. It's like a big box. It's like that island in — what was it? — that movie with Di Caprio. They're in the middle of this enormous jungle. No, wait, let's make it a maze. Yes, that's it. The island, or village, or glade, or whatever you want to call it, is in the centre of this huge frigging maze. The maze is behind these enormous walls. Nobody knows who built it all. But it can't be a normal maze. That's too boring. Oh, I know. The maze is constantly changing. The walls can crush you. And the maze has these, um, borg scorpions. Yes, that's perfect. Borg scorpions. Huge, fast, and with stingers. The stingers don't kill you though. They sort of change you. A village surrounded by monsters, like that movie -- what was it called again? By the guy who did Sixth Sense. So we get this new kid, he's sort of like Katniss from Hunger Story, or whatever it was called. He's like there to rescue everyone. He figures it all out. Can we get that guy from Teen Wolf? He's sort of hot. And he's a pretty good actor too. Make sure he gets some gym time though. He's like that hot guy from Divergent, what was his name? Divergent was sort of cool, wasn't it? This kid is like a Divergent. Yeah, that's it. He doesn't want to be a Builder, or Artist, or whatever it was. He wants to be a Runner and fight the borg spiders. He's different, and is going to rescue them. The weird thing is that some of them have grown to like the village, yeah, even though there are no girls. So they don't want to leave. So they have to oppose this kid. They don't trust him. And we need a fat kid, like that island book, and like Stand by Me. Everyone likes him, and it'll be really sad when he gets it. And make sure there's an Asian guy, an Indian guy, and the whole thing is run by this supercool black guy. OK, now we have to figure out who built all this and why. Or should we make it all a big dream sequence? Or keep it a mystery, like in Lost. And how do we make this a sequel? They can't just stay in the village, right? They have to get out, like in that other village movie. What happens then?
8.0~Awesome Movie. Awesome Lead. anyarugtved Sign in Permalink I remember seeing Dylan O'Brien in Teen Wolf, and thought he was a good actor, and loved the role he played there. When i saw this movie come out, i was so thrilled. Dylan O'Brien as a lead in a movie, and i was not disappointed, when i saw the movie, as he does an amazing job. This movie is so exciting and it catches me well. I puzzled a bit over the fact that only one girl comes to the middle of the maze, but other then that, i think it is a well made movie, and i really enjoyed the lead, and the fact that many of the other actors are fairly unknown. It makes the movie fresh and different. There are a few things with the maze, that i didn't quite like, the "part" mechanical bugs for one, and much stone look it has, but other than that, i think it is interesting and very catching. There is a bit of the time line in the end, that does not quite make sense to me, as an example why those half mechanical bugs can destroy some of their "buildings" but not all of them, since they are made of the same materials, but it is not a huge issue. Also i think that the variation of personalities in the characters is great, and it makes it easier to relate to a character in the movie, except for the severe lack of girls. I look forward to the second one.
8.0~Not bad at all bbickley13-921-58664 Sign in Permalink Belongs in the same category as Hunger Games but instead of a bad ass young girl, it's a dude who leads an all boys club, which may explain the large amount of violence the movie had, and may also explain why I liked it. There was a lot of action and aggression in the movie. A boy who only knows his name is Thomas is toss into a lord of the flies situation were the answer to his and his fellow young warriors unknown past is to unlock the mystery of the Maze. So they must run it. What's cool about the adventurous journey is that they were able to do it in under two hours. A feet in its own these days. Worth the 113mins
10.0~Movie of the year! roonayk Sign in Permalink I was just saying the other day that this has been a generally poor year for good movies. Luckily today I just watched the movie of the year. It kind of reminded me of a cross between Hunger games and The cube, which are both excellent movies. I loved everything about this movie. Before the ending it was a 8 out of 10 and it could go either way but the ending was brilliant and it left we wanting more but it also satisfied my need for a good ending. When they shipped in the girl I was thinking oh, here comes the romance part but it didn't and I am so thankful for it! I do not got one bad word to say about it and I can't wait for the next in the series!
8.0~The Maze Runner jboothmillard Sign in Permalink I saw the title of this film in the cinema schedules, then I read the descriptions, it sounded like something that might be interesting, but I was perhaps sceptical as well, but it had positive reviews, so I chanced it. Basically a teenage boy (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up in an upwards travelling elevator, the doors open and he is greeted by unfamiliar boys in a grassy clearing called "the Glade", surrounded by tall stone walls, the boy has no memory of anything about himself, the community leader Alby (Kidulthood's Aml Ameen) says this is normal, he will remember his name. Second in command Newt (Love Actually's Thomas Brodie-Sangster) shows the boy is shown around the Glade, the boy also meets and makes friends with Chuck (Blake Cooper), he is warned never to go beyond the opening of the walls; there is a large maze. That night, while the community party to welcome the new arrival, Newt explains that every month a new arrival and supplies in boxes labelled "WCKD" (WICKED - World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department) come up in the elevator, the Maze is the only way out, but the walls constantly change in a repeating sequence of sections, the only ones allowed in are the most able boys, called Runners, they search for a way out during the day, returning at night when the opening closes, no-one has survived a night behind the walls at night, because of unseen creatures called Grievers. During a fight in the night the boy recalls his name: Thomas, the next day he is collecting wood, when he is attacked by runner Ben (Chris Sheffield), he was stung by a Griever, the boys "banish" him, leaving him in the maze at night to die, Alby and runner Minho (Ki Hong Lee) retrace Ben's steps in the maze, but Alby is stung by a Griever and goes unconscious, he is dragged by Minho and the opening is about to close, seeing this Thomas runs in and tries to help, all three of them are trapped. However all three survive the night in the maze, with Thomas killing a Griever, a deadly slug-like monster with metal legs, the other boys are astonished by their return, Gally (Son of Rambow's Will Poulter) is upset that they may all be in jeopardy following Thomas's actions, but Newt overrules him and makes Thomas a Runner, he and Minho enter the maze in the day, removing a beeping mechanical device from the corpse of the Griever, it is numbered to correspond with one of the eight sections of the maze. The first ever girl (Skins' Kaya Scodelario) arrives in the elevator, she recognises Thomas, a note indicates that she is the final person that will be sent, she remembers her name: Teresa, she also carries two syringes filled with a mysterious substance, the Gladers use one on Alby, he recovers from his sting and regains memories. Thomas and Minho venture into the maze, to the numbered section that the Griever came from, using its device they discover an escape route, they are forced to retreat when recognised as intruders they are chased away by the collapsing walls, but they make it out and tell the others. That night, a horde of Grievers come out from the opening of the walls and attack the Gladers, Alby is killed among some others, but the majority of the community survive the attack, with Thomas being stung and curing himself with the other syringe, in doing so he regains memory that he and Teresa were part of the organisation that created the maze, it is all a test. Gally blames them for everything they have gone through and tries to kill them, but he is stopped, he and a small number of others refuse to leave, while most of the others follow Thomas to the found escape route, they end up in a scientific laboratory, with dead bodies of scientists everywhere, a recorded video from a woman, Dr. Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson), shows her explaining that increased solar activity and a pandemic has devastated the planet, the youths in the Glade were all part of an experiment to research their resistance to the pandemic, in the video the lab is being attacked and it ends with the woman shooting herself in the head. Gally appears, having been stung he is delirious and seeks revenge on Thomas, he fires a gun, Minho stabs Gally with a spear, and Chuck is killed by the gunshot, then masked men rush in to take the group away to safety, in a helicopter above, the maze was located in a vast desert, but the scientists are not dead, Ava Paige states that the experiment was a success, and the survivors will now enter Phase Two. Also starring Dexter Darden as Frypan and Joe Adler as Zart. O'Brien does well in his leading star-making role as the brave newcomer, Brodie-Sangster is great as the wise second leader of the tribe, Poulter is splendid as the constantly negative group member, Scodelario gets her moments as the solo female, and Clarkson is terrific as the head of the scientists. I can see the comparison and combination of The Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies, there was just enough feeling of claustrophobia, conspiracy and politics come into play as well, and of course the mystery element keeps you going throughout, the special effects to create the monsters and explosive moments are great, this is the first in the moody teen series, the next is definitely something to look forward to, this is a surprisingly entertaining science-fiction dystopian action thriller. Very good!
4.0~disappointed binyaminsnyder-03664 Sign in Permalink When i first watched the movie, i had not read the books, but with the second Movie coming out, The Scorch Trials, i read the books and reviewed the movies. The first time i watched The Maze Runner i thought it was okay, but after reading the books i am really disappointed in the movie. Honestly, i put this movie in the same category as Eragon, or The Percy Jackson Series. The books were amazing, but the movies left so much out i almost couldn't finish watching it again. I honestly didn't think that any of the characters acted as they were portrayed in the book. For one, Gally was actually nice to Thomas in the beginning, and they dropped the whole Thomas-Teresa telepathic abilities. And they changed the whole way the maze moves, and in the movie they only used one door, and in the book they used all four. And the tracking device??????? And Ben being the first one stung???? And what about Alby being the first one in the maze???(In the book there was a original group of thirty people) I think that this movie could have been made so much better, and am upset how they messed up the book
7.0~Keep running gianlucamarzano16 Sign in Permalink Let me first say that the maze runner has a much darker tone than the hunger games and those other movies. The movie starts with Tomas(Dylan o'brien)waking up in a box which leads up to the glade.The glade is surrounded by huge stone walls.The walls open every morning and closes at sundown.There are runners who goes in the maze and try to find a way out. when Tomas shows up everything begins to change.The cast is great,if you have read the book,than you would know that it's pretty accurate.The acting is another plus.But the movie seem to drag for a little and the last 10 minutes seem to be weak.To much setup for the next one. overall it's a fun,good movie to watch. It may be a little too much for little kids. 7/10
7.0~Overall ziggyzebra06 Sign in Permalink While the movie was well done and the characters were portrayed alright, I still find it a bit irritating that the movie doesn't exactly go with the book. I understand the maybe they had trouble with the budget, but I still would've liked to have seen Gally taken back to WICKED by a griever. And for Chuck to be stabbed instead of shot. Along with the Gladers seeing Ava Paige and Gally at WICKED walk in and then have the Rescuers come in and start shooting. I understand that maybe the director had other ideas, but I would have preferred the movie to go by the book. Also, that fact that the grievers weren't slugs bugged me. And that the griever whole was just sort of a door instead of a cliff with an invisible hole bugged me. Overall, the movie was alright, but again, I would've preferred it to go by the book.
10.0~I loved this movie asiastar-97644 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie its about humans future how it will be
6.0~The Book was better Pandamonium360 Sign in Permalink Now this is a movie that I was hoping as really good like Harry Potter 8 good but know it as good as the first Hunger Games movie and that is being generous. Now this review will be me venting about what I liked and didn't like so lets start this. First of all lets start off with the positive for a first I have to say my favourite character was Gally who was portrayed really well by Will Poulter and it was perfect casting and I also have to say the Grievers were really creepy and that was what they needed to be. Now the fun part the bad parts, I am a huge fan of the books and I was hoping that this movie was awesome but it was like the director, writer and actors didn't even know that this was based on a book because they completely butcher the lore. First of all the most exciting part of the book I when the doors don't close for the night and the Grievers attack, but they got it wrong it s supposed to be that the Grievers took one kid a night and that's that, but nooooo they had to make so that the Grievers went on a killing spree and also Alby wasn't supposed to die at that moment he was supposed to sacrifice him self to the Grievers at the end but nope he was picked up and dragged away so goodbye wish you had died correctly. Another problem was that my favourite character in the book Minho was played wrong, in the book he was supposed to be a smart mouth that didn't know how to shut up but nope the actor played him wrong because he was probably the quietest character in the whole movie what the f@&k is that and also no they do leave on a helicopter they leave on bus was that so hard to do seriously? Well good to get this review and rant out of me so I say if you haven't read the book go see it but if you have don't unless you want to question what they were thinking for the whole directing process.
5.0~'The maze runner' or Divergent meets Lord of the flies and Resident Evil grindleguts Sign in Permalink There's little new about 'The maze runner', and if the above summary rings a bell you get an understanding about this movie's plot. While a decently entertaining summer movie, with plenty of eye candy and good pacing, the movie unfortunately suffers from a number of faults. First, there's a major lack of explanations. I personally feel quite bothered when seemingly logical questions are posed or implied, but discarded right away for no obvious reason. Second, the characters are among the most one-dimensional to grace the big screen in recent years. None are seemingly more important to the plot than others, save through chance (plot devices, if you so will). All in all, your decent action/adventure/chosen young one movie, with all the regular flaws that come with them nowadays. 5/10
1.0~What did I just watch? sunchick116-872-583383 Sign in Permalink I don't even like 'the hunger games' ('divergent' is the best dystopian series) but even that movie is easier to follow Than this crap. What the hell did i just watch? I can't even give a proper review because I am so confused, I don't even know the right questions to ask. I never read the books so I'm not sure if there was a book to screen translation problem but wtf? It was like 'lord of the flies' meets I don't know what. I won't even ask what kind of Sadist does this to children cause all the dystopian book seem to think that's the way to treat them, but still. Really great concept in theory but really confusing in practicality.
5.0~Progress! paulodido Sign in Permalink I expecting worst movie but some aspect are surprise me. Some scenario idea are very good like some good scenario for Cube. Better then many other movie for 'young' watcher. We all need real movie and this film offer little. Main actor was very good instead he have only few film on 'pocket'. There is many space to make this movie better but they need better director or some director with more match in archive. In other hand we have very good Will Poulter and he rise this film for one star. Some idea plus Will plus some effect will brings this movie half scale price. I spend time and watch the movie to the end. I think that they will bring us next part of this film.
6.0~I've got the Conch now Piggy! Drive-in_Zeppelin Sign in Permalink I had heard a lot of hype about The Maze Runner (2014), which is the latest young adult series to be adapted for the big screen, so naturally I was expecting the worst. The worst being something similar to Twilight or Divergent and more than likely including gratuitous amounts of scenes where the predominantly twenty- something-year-old male cast would be shirtless. I will not say that The Maze Runner was a landmark science fiction film or even in the top echelon of action-suspense films, but it was thoroughly entertaining. There is obviously a lot that was borrowed and clichéd about the film, but it didn't disappoint. To dumb the premise down to a young adult level, basically a group of 'teenage' boys wake up with no memory in a Central-Park-like grove that is surrounded by a giant maze. Naturally this Lord of the Flies-esque society wants to find a way out, but have managed in the meantime to create a harmonious society without killing their own version of Piggy. Long story short, the 'Neo' character of the story arrives to throw things into disarray because he wants to go run the maze and speed up their exit from the grove. Like I said, it's not the best plot in the world, but the inclusion of giant metal spider-like things definitely increases the tension. Directed by Wes ball, the movie stars mostly people you've probably never heard of and that kid from Love Actually, Thomas Brodie- Sangster. The film's protagonist who I was actually pleasantly surprised with is Mr. Dylan O'Brien, apparently known for taking his shirt off and being 'eye candy' for tweenage girls. Sorry ladies, there are no washboard abs featured in this movie, better stick with Magic Mike. Either way, I thought he actually did a pretty good job as Thomas. Though having never read the book, I can't speak one way or the other about what that should entail. All I can say is that, as the protagonist, I probably would have followed him to my almost certain death. In fact I couldn't help but thinking throughout the entire movie that if he hulked up a bit, he would make an excellent Commander Shepard if a Mass Effect adaptation were ever possible. At any rate that's essentially the movie. Some kids run around a maze trying to avoid spiders and find a way out. I was initially worried, though also intrigued, by how the story began to develop, as it paralleled the basic premise of Dark City (1998), what with the waking up with no memory and trying to figure things out in a place that's constantly changing gimmick. I actually read a number of reviews heralding The Maze Runner as a beautiful crossover between Dark City and Lord of the Flies. That gave me a good chuckle, but I have to dash your hopes at such a crossover as this story isn't remotely as engaging as watching John Murdoch elude the Strangers. The Bottom Line: It's on the good side of the Hunger Games – Divergent spectrum though it's an outlandishly silly premise. The visuals and acting are decent, the action engrossing, and you'll feel fairly entertained until the obligatory cliffhanger since its a series. Then if you're over the age of 16 you'll be faced with the dilemma of either buying a young adult book, or simply waiting at least a year to find out what happens next. My prediction would be to not get your hopes up and simply forget about the series until the next movie comes out. Repeat as needed for additional sequels.

7.0~Intriguing Fantasy Tale larrys3 Sign in Permalink I can see I am in the minority here, but, to be honest, I found the film to be quite intriguing and exciting. I went into the movie "cold", not having read the novel by James Dashner or knowing very much about the plot. For me, this was the type of film that I knew if I just went with the flow and didn't try and look for all the holes in the story and script that I'd be better off. The way the film was presented by first time director Wes Ball was top notch, as I felt I was right there in the maze with the main characters. The obvious set-up for a sequel at the end of the movie didn't bother me too much as it seems like every movie of this type "has to" have at least one. In summary, I found this movie to be very absorbing and kept my interest throughout.
1.0~Most disappointing movie ever (possible spoilers) stevewburke Sign in Permalink This was a total waste of a decent movie premise. You will be severely disappointed. There are several plot holes and a huge buildup with no payoff. I was so let down that I signed up just to leave this review in the hopes that someone else might be saved. The ending to this movie was the worst I've ever seen. This was clearly a money grab targeted at the Hunger Games audience. And a successful one considering it's already earned $300 million for a $30 million budget. However, I was inspired by this movie / book to begin writing. If this waste of paper and SD storage can be successful, anything can.
6.0~They Could Have Escaped Through The Plot Holes Theo Robertson Sign in Permalink A teenage boy called Thomas finds himself coming to in a lift . The lift ascends in the open air where he is met by a group of boys his own age and they tell him he is in "The Glade" a fertile strip of land surrounded by a walled maze from which escape is impossible I came in to THE MAZE RUNNER knowing absolutely nothing about it . Within a very short period of time I didn't have to do any research because I felt this was a film being marketed for a similar demographic to that of TWILIGHT and THE HUNGER GAMES . Just to confirm my suspicions I logged in to this page and yes my spidey senses had been right all along and this was indeed the opening chapter of a series of books aimed at teenagers and like so many films aimed at teenagers it's not enough to condense several volumes of an ongoing story in to one film but to film every separate book as a film in itself . No doubt this means the narrative becomes drawn out with large segments being utterly disposable . Not only that but layer of mystery will give way to another layer of mystery and so in order to get any answers you have to watch each and every film in chronological order to understand what is happening and way it is happening . In other words the studio execs are saying "Let's fleece the audience" while sipping champagne and I'm proud to report not a single penny of my income was spent on champagne breakfasts at 20th Century Fox Studios . All I wasted was two hours of my life watching a movie that I was certain to hate !!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!! To be honest I actually found myself enjoying THE MAZE RUNNER in parts , especially the vaguely scary bits and unlike the rather similar THE HUNGER GAMES there are moments that are cruel and nasty . However there's a massive amount wrong with it on a logical level . The Glade itself is supposedly capable of supporting life within its borders for as many as three dozen inhabitants until the camera cuts to a long shot and the continuity between this and a place containing large fields and woodlands seems absent . Other lapses in continuity and logic involve the fact that everyone has carefully manicured hair and is clean shaven , so have the Gladers been receiving shampoo , scissors and razors from the outside world ? There's even a chubby kid so I'm guessing he's been rewarded with lots of pies and chocolate cakes . Either that or he's been included because an audience are supposed to feel sorry for fat kids if not totally empathise with because the rest of the cast are too much like pretty boy band members to elicit any empathy . There's also other plot holes such as someone managing to build a miniature model of the maze then telling Thomas that the maze constantly changes so why build a model when it won't match the constantly changing real maze ? Things like this indicate the audience aren't supposed to think too much about what is happening and just go along with what is happening As I did expect the film ends on a cliff hanger and yet another plot turn where things aren't what they seem . I won't rush out to the cinema to buy a ticket when the second one opens but will watch it for free when I get the chance . I've no idea how the story develops but I do hope the logic of the scenario isn't ignored and my abiding memory of this film is if the world has been destroyed in a catastrophe then how come the scientific/governmental community are able to terraform and maintain a fertile place like The Glade when the rest of the world seems ruined beyond all repair ?
5.0~Read The Book Instead! You Won't Regret It! hennnerz Sign in Permalink Seriously, the book is good, but compared to the film it is awesome! You can read the book very quickly and the story and characters are built from a much better base than the lightweight characters portrayed in the film. The story is modified, to it's detriment, and leaves the viewer feeling lost and nowhere near as involved and committed to the characters. The whole film is rushed and hugely disappointing. Personally I feel like the casting of Alby and Newt was poor, with that said the vast majority of the rest of cast were a great fit despite some rather questionable hairstyles... In comparison, The Hunger Games movies are incredible and rival the books, unfortunately the same cannot be said for The Maze Runner.
7.0~Fun and entertaining, but I might be biased... mbarnard-smini Sign in Permalink I was super excited when I first saw the trailer and I really enjoyed the film when I finally got to watch it. I read some user reviews on IMDb and realized that a lot of people did not enjoy it as much as I did - this made me step back and rethink things...I don't want to be one of those people that have a knack for enjoying bad movies (e.g. my parents). Fortunately I found the problem... I read all the Maze Runner books long before a movie was even in the pipeline - I LOVED the books, I found them in my search for more dystopian type novels. Yes, I am also one of those sucked into the dystopian/post-apocalyptic craze... Anyhow, my theory is this - because I already knew the story I was able to understand and make sense of the movie without realizing that it actually leaves a lot of plot holes and unanswered questions for viewers who never read the books. As a fan of the books I loved the movie as it brought the maze and characters to life. Long story short - if you read the books then this movie should be fun and leave you hoping for a sequel. If you did not read the books then it is likely that this movie might be a bit of a disappointment for you. Because of all I just mentioned I changed my score from a 8 to a 7 as I would want more people to read the books because of the movie and I don't think the movie pushes people to the books like the Hunger Games and Twilight might have...
8.0~A movie filled with suspense & thrills that will keep you engaged right till the end. Anurag-Shetty Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is a story that revolves around Thomas(Dylan O'Brien). Thomas wakes up in an elevator with a few supplies and no memory of how he got there. He gets deposited in a field where there are a group of boys consisting of, Alby(Aml Ameen), Minho(Ki Hong Lee), Chuck(Blake Cooper), Newt(Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Gally(Will Poulter) & several others. Soon, Thomas realizes that the boys are surrounded by a maze, that has dangerous things lurking within. He develops a sense of curiosity as to who put the boys there and tries to find a way to escape from the maze. He seeks the help of a maze runner named Minho. Together, Thomas & Minho look for a way out of the maze before it's too late. The Maze Runner is a brilliant film. Right from the first scene the mystery surrounding the main character & what the point of the maze is, has the viewer intrigued. The maze is ominous & creepy. The action & running scenes in the maze are exciting. The only flaw in the movie is the creatures in the maze, known as Grievers. The makers of the movie should have made them a lot scarier. Dylan O'Brien is outstanding as Thomas. Aml Ameen is effective as Alby. Ki Hong Lee is great as Minho. Blake Cooper is brilliant as Chuck. Thomas Brodie-Sangster is excellent as Newt. Will Poulter is amazing as Gally. Dexter Darden is impressive as Frypan. Kaya Scodelario is awesome as Teresa. The supporting characters are brilliant as well. The Maze Runner is a must watch. Go for it.
4.0~Not terrible, but exactly what it looks like: a pretty 'meh' and uninspired 'Hunger Games' wannabe... colleenpryoritize Sign in Permalink This movie isn't shocking or terrifyingly bad. The premise is kind of interesting and the young cast does a pretty good job of selling the whole thing. The problem with this movie is that we'll never know how good it might have been because it exists purely as a desperate attempt to play catch up with the wildly successful 'Hunger Games' franchise and therefore lacks even the hint of any genuine creative spark, vision, or passion behind it. By playing follow-the-leader and clinging so desperately to the whole 'Hunger Games' template/play book, 'The Maze Runner' is dead on arrival and never even seems to be trying to carve out an identity or vision of its' own. After the first few minutes, your eyes just kind of glaze over as you realize with dread that you're getting a pale imitation of a movie that wasn't very good to begin with. (NOTE: I haven't read either 'The Hunger Games' or 'Maze Runner' books, so I can't comment on either as adaptations, just going by the films here). And please keep in mind, 'The Hunger Games' is pretty much a rip-off of the much better Japanese cult gem, 'Battle Royale,' but at least Hunger Games took that idea and did its own thing with it, giving the property a distinctive feel and vibe by successfully aiming it at the young adult 'Twilight' crowd. Even though I'm not a fan of the movies, I can appreciate that and give 'Hunger Games' at least some credit for pulling it off. 'The Maze Runner' isn't even ambitious or interesting enough to try to do that in any way, shape, or form. It's just very obviously going through the motions and I really believe that a viewer would find the movie totally bland and uninspired because of this, even if they had never seen or heard of 'The Hunger Games.' They just wouldn't know why. The studio executives and creative teams behind movies like "The Maze Runner," "Divergent," and God-only-knows whatever other 'Hunger Games' facsimiles are coming down the pipe line really need to read up on their Ralph Waldo Emerson, because he said it best: "Imitation is suicide."
6.0~Pleasantly surprised, but not totally impressed. kaylaholman Sign in Permalink When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I had no interest whatsoever in seeing it. So I waited for it to come out on DVD and give it a try, since it focuses on the themes of the popular movies like The Hunger Games and Divergent. I was instantly drawn into the movie with a thousand questions already in my head. By the end of the movie, some were answered while others lead to even more questions. To my understanding, the boys were put in The Glade, so that their brains could be studied in order to find a cure for a virus that seems to be wiping out the Earth. Doesn't it seem a little extreme to essentially banish them in the woods with their memories completely gone? Regarding Thomas and Theresa, if they were a part of WICKED, then why were they sent to The Glade? I'm hoping that these questions will be answered as the series continues. There are some plot holes also that I won't get into, but even with these plot wholes, the movie wasn't ruined for me. As a huge Hunger Games fan, all these movies that come out with similar plots don't even compare. Yes The Maze Runner had a male antagonist, but the same theme prevails - society is controlled by a higher power, while one person rebels and defies all odds to defeat that power. If you like an entertaining movie with decent acting, and intense action, this movie is recommended. I was entertained and on the edge of my seat, rooting for the main characters, and crying when little Chuck sacrificed himself. But, if your'e looking for something better than the Hunger Games, don't waste your time.
8.0~"One BIG Puzzle" sgholbrook Sign in Permalink Didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.... I went into it thinking of something similar to "The hunger games" considering it's based off of some books, and it's about some kids stuck in a world they don't know about. And to be honest, it is kind of the hunger games, apart from you know a lot less about why they are there/who they are etc.... And they don't HAVE to fight each other ! I think I prefer this over the hunger games due to all of the questions in it. The film addresses so many that it keeps you guessing all the time, and really gets you intrigued, it really is all ONE BIG PUZZLE. By the end of the film you are amazed at the answers to some of the questions and others are left unanswered. I can't wait to find out what the next film has to offer as I haven't read the books, it's a huge mystery of a story and they do it very well. This film is full of suspense, thrill and emotions. Well worth a watch, to get yourself right into the series !
5.0~Don't Judge A Book By Its Movie georgiewinchester67 Sign in Permalink Having read "The Maze Runner" by James Dashner, I can say that this movie heavily disappointed me. The storyline was barely stuck to at all, and so many important details were altered, and I don't doubt that they are going to have huge consequences for them in making "The Scorch Trials" and so on. But please do not let this movie keep you from reading the book. The book explained so much more that needed to be explained than the movie did. They were so different it's not even funny. So please don't judge this book by its movie. I cant even begin to point out how much of this was wrong--no telepathy between Thomas and Teresa, no real emotional attachments between Thomas & Teresa and Thomas & Chuck, the Grievers were portrayed completely wrong, as well as the Griever hole; they never saw the Maze from the air, the Maze was square not round, and the Maze was enclosed in a dome with artificial weather (no rain) and was definitely not in the Scorch. I could go on, but you get my point. Again, please do not judge the book by its movie. There's so much more explaining that happens in the book and not in the movie, so that it actually makes sense.
10.0~Excelentt lara-ndrade Sign in Permalink I watched the movie and was like OO ... had never been so nervous and full of expectations as I was! what about the chuck ??? too cute, those roses cheeks, give willingness to tighten and focused enough in their relationship! I was rather disappointed with the rapidity of information to the viewer moves that may seem very confusing, especially for those who have not read the book. Had many scenes that will only understand if you read the book ... so did not discourage me and that final left a wanting more !!! especially with the next race will be in the desert and more overwhelming. Hyper, mega excited about the next movie ... I found little time to explain everything, but you certainly will not leave disappointed cinema. It's good fun for the family. READ the book and you shall put away all doubt;)
6.0~Intriguing set-up, weak payoff Fluke_Skywalker Sign in Permalink Great, just what we *don't* need. Another movie based on a dystopic young adult novel. But this one is actually pretty good... for a while. But then it has to make good on its initial promise and instead delivers a head-scratching ending that's just a set up for a string of $equels. Still, 'The Maze Runner' is well made and features a strong cast of young actors who are light years ahead of the typical mannequins who make up these sorts of movies. Perhaps this ending--which is not really an ending--will play better once the entire saga is complete. In the meantime, it just feels frustratingly incomplete and unsatisfying.
10.0~The Maze Runner, AWESOME MOVIE. joshua-pokemon-quinlan Sign in Permalink Loved this movie, i thought it was going to be scary because of the monsters but it isn't scary at all which is good because i hate scary movies. Anyway loved this movie looking forward to seeing the second one if there will be a second one. The maze itself was awesome it was so large and very mysterious and i like mystery movies. Great movie overall, 10 stars for you. :) :) If there is a second one which i think there will be because of the ending of this movie, i can't wait to see the second one when it comes out. :) :)
6.0~Could have been better vargakellyfamily04 Sign in Permalink I was very disappointed by this movie. I read the book which was fantastic. It had depth and feeling with great themes. I think this movie will probably be better for those who have not read the book. The movie is a simple concept with very typical action and suspense scenes. The movie took a lot out of the book but it just came up empty. I found myself not caring about the characters at all. Its kind of Lord of the Flies take didn't really do it for me either . The characters were not what I was expecting either. The movie felt like it was more of a set up for the next one in the franchise. There were some nice moments but it just wasn't great. It definitely lost on the sci-fi side of things
8.0~Good title anto-mc Sign in Permalink It ' a good title , very compelling charming, despite the cast is not among the most famous. The story begins not understand very well what happened to the protagonist , this gives a lot of suspense . The mind begins to imagine what is beneath , but you can not understand the end, because of all the possible conclusions, the real one is not banal. The set is spectacular. Not even imagine how much work there is another graph and state. But it looks really real , and most importantly huge ! Perhaps one of the titles that should be watched in the cinema, without distractions. It's worth the money spent and the time used to watch it. It said to me that I'm not a big fan of this genre. To see !
9.0~A-Maze-Ing. alcworrall1 Sign in Permalink Took my 12 year old to see this. I knew the basic premise and thought it'd just be entertaining enough for myself too. I'd underestimated it. We both came out of the cinema buzzing! The pacing of the story has you waiting for what happens next constantly and the performances from the young cast were spot on, particularly from Dylan O' Brien and Will Poulter. There are some moments where I was genuinely on the edge of my seat too. It has elements of 'Lord Of The Flies', 'Lost' and 'The Cabin In The Woods'. Will definitely be using The Boy as an excuse to watch the next one when it comes out.
4.0~Into The Maze michaelradny Sign in Permalink The multiple problems that plague The Maze Runner are unfortunately not counteracted by what's good with it. The overly cheesy dynamics of the films, including the dialogue, characterization and clichéd storyline, somehow make you wish it was better, but still compels you enough to want to watch it. However, the obvious use of forcefully taking the violence, language and themes down a thousand notches doesn't help, making what could be an epic sci-fi classic into an obvious money grabber for people to fall victim to. Nothing is worse about this film than the overly clichéd nature that you must endure. It's like watching a boring, toned-down version of The Hunger Games. If this added more Battle Royal than teen spirit, this film could have really come to life more than it did.
8.0~The amazing runner! jasperjfcs Sign in Permalink When my girlfriend and I bought this movie on DVD. I was only interested in seeing Dylan O'Brien's performance because he has been rumoured to play the new Spider-Man. But when we watched it, god did we love it! I must admit I loved this movie more than the Hunger Games. It was a simple, exciting, well directed movie! The acting from most people was great, I'm just not so impressed with the acting for Teresa but I don't hate the performance she gave. I thought the suspense, the action, the effects and the story was done perfectly. The only problems I had was the night scenes were a bit too dark to tell what was going on at times and the acting of Teresa. Other than that, I love this movie. If you're thinking of seeing this movie but you're not so sure about it, let me just tell you that the people who hate this movie are either people who just don't enjoy this kind of movie (but they don't rant about how much they hate it, they just let it go) people who hate this movie cos it's not the Hunger Games and people who hate this movie cos they are little cry babies that have to have the movie answer all of their questions and they can't think of their own theories. Seriously, there are people out there who say they hate this movie cos it's not Hunger Games and it's ridiculous! I like the Hunger Games movies but people have turned it into an unnecessary god and now any movie like Maze Runner, Ender's Game and Divergent that in any way is similar to the Hunger Games, gets crapped on even if it's actually a good movie. Seriously people! Stop worshiping Hunger Games like it is a god cos it's not! And for those people who hate this movie cos they don't answer every question, this is going to be a whole trilogy! We have 3 maybe 4 movies and maybe a prequel to explain everything! Why are you complaining about this when Harry Potter and Hunger Games do this? (Oh yeah, cos Hunger Games is a god and can do whatever they want(!) Pfft! Ridiculous! Teresa was not pointless in the movie cos if she wasn't put in the Glade, Alby would be dead sooner and Thomas would never have gotten his memory back. Teresa had the test cure for them with her and she also could be the last one immune to the Flare which is why they put her in the Glade! Use your imagination people! Dr. Paige faked her death which could have been another test for them, in fact she might have been lying about the reason they are testing them! There are so many theories and lots of questions to be answered over time. And for those tiny little questions that you ask of the movie, make up a theory instead of being a little baby who needs everything done for them. Stop hating this movie for those stupid reasons! It's not Hunger Games and it's a fantastic movie! I highly recommend it if you like book movies and you're not complaining fan who whines to get attention. I loved this movie and I cannot wait for the Scorch trials!
10.0~Absolutely brilliant! lizzie_1991 Sign in Permalink I haven't read the book(s?) but after watching this movie I absolutely will. I didn't know what to expect when I sat down at the cinema, waiting for the movie to begin, but it captured me from the very first scene. The mystery surrounding the place where most of the action happens, and the suspense and ominous feeling always hanging in the air made me unable to tear my eyes away from the screen for the entire film. The ending WAS a bit confusing and unsatisfying, but the rest of the movie was absolutely amazing and I will definitely watch it again. This is without a doubt one of the best films I have seen in 2014. Well done!
1.0~Cmoon Man! sie_aris Sign in Permalink My English is so bad, I don't speak English, but i'm trying hard to write this review! so you knew my disappointment Don't waste your time and money watching this. I keep on cursing during the movie. They been there for 3 years, why not build a ladder, so when the runner late coming, they can climb back to the glade. The wall is still reachable, they have plenty of trees, knifes, axe, rope etc.. Even kids will build a ladder.. even you can make a HOLE on the wall very easy!! its shown when Galby make people name on wall very easy. Newt said, "trust me. we have tried everything" while gardening. You put a group of young man with no supervision and they they will become a farmer??? OMG this is insulting. No violence? c'mon... After 3 years they send Thomas to the glade. why? never explain clearly.. because all the guys were doing nothing but gardening? Even Thomas had to sting his self and got cured so he can remember things, but when he remember things, so what ? it doesn't solve anything nor have any connection to any plot. He already found the way out before. They have build a complete miniature of the maze while the maze always sifting. And why the... Alby is going with Minho on checking the maze? the story never explain why.. If the sting bring people back memories, why should cast Ben when he got sting? Just keep him in the hole, ask things to him and let him died. while when Alby go sting. they keep it!!! why people whyyyy????? Even Minho risk their live to carry and bring Alby back to glade, and put Thomas life in danger because he think Alby is wounded or something. And after they all locked up Minho said to Thomas.. "congrats, you just kill your self, Alby got sting" what the..... Minho knew Alby got sting, stinged people should be abandon inside the maze right? just leave him!! he is the leader of the runner he should knew more! They all good looking, well hair cut and fashion group of man in the middle of nowhere. If you already knew the schedule of the maze to shift, have the maps, you don't have to be a runner, you can just walk. But then again there is a monster in the maze, why are you keep on coming back with just small knife? And when a girls show at least some guys should have a joke saying something about it. I was kind of expecting it. Especially when you are a group of young men that lived in the jungle for 3 years! I just don't understand the story of this movie.. to put all the people in to the maze surrounded by monster to study their brain? cmooooonnnnn!! I would just make a survival contest rather that build a super complex million dollar maze with AI droid monster just to see people survive. That is insulting the future man! No bodies after the slay? OK now the monster eat people, while in the first part it only sting. Runner sign off because Alby got stinged? while actually there has been a lot of people died before Alby. Thomas and Minho suddenly have a long rope from the woods and its already hooked up at the top to drag Alby body to the top. The monster fight was horrible.. you fighting a gigantic robotic monster with a stick?? They gave 2 cure serum to the girl what for? that's not studying people mind. Just like giving an answer on your examp. They live among a monster they should have create a defense system like a weapon or something. I would build a catapult, Arrows, Traps. I'm expecting to see hardcore life in that glade. Alby said the 3 rules, "Work hard, never hurt anybody, and never go trough that big wall.." I mean you locked in jungle with a giant big DOOR open? any sane people want to know. Why cant you say, it's a freakin sifting maze and has big scary spider monster inside! THERE IS SO MUCH WRONG in this movie.. I can FEEL that the glade citizen is a peaceful society, peaceful life, enjoy farming, gardening.. While actually they shouldn't. you live in a box among monster!! its really beyond expectation! At the end.. the gun from the dead body. Which I should take it!!! to protect my self and friends, not kick it! so Galby, that show from nowhere can have it! __________ Final word. The end of the movie really make me want to pour my pop corn to someone face! And the exit door was a joke!! ___________________ Movie effect on me. I really can't sleep thinking.. why would someone make such a horrible insulting people intelligent movie like that, I rather watch spongebob guys. really! ___________ Suggestion. I think its better if the creator was a maniac and love to see people suffer! and when they finally got out, they capture the creator and kill him or put him on the maze with the monster, and they can see again the beautiful world with their families. It's shitty end i know! but it far better ending than this confusing (trying to make a good unpredicted mystery ending). PS I haven't read the book.
8.0~A lot more better, but still not flawless. joshuadrake-91275 Sign in Permalink I had to say, my expectations for THE MAZE RUNNER were very low before the film's release. I read the book and I did not know how the movie was going to do at the box office or with the fans of the book and critics. The first film in the series is based on a series of books by James Dashner and it is an entertaining film, but it's not flawless. The story follows Thomas, a boy who wakes up in a moving elevator going up called The Box. Once he arrives, he discovers a grassy area called The Glade and the people that live there called Gladers. Not being able to remember anything, Thomas discovers an opening in the wall near the glade and is warned not to enter it as it leads to a massive maze. After Thomas learns about the monsters that wander the maze at night, he realizes that the maze may hold the key to getting out. When a young girl, Teresa arrives in the box, Thomas's memory starts to come back and he realizes what is really going on and sets out to try and find a way out. I wasn't totally against the movie, I was very interested to see how this movie would turn out, so my sister went out one night and bought a couple of movies from RedBox and she bought this movie. My sisters, Ricardo and my mother Tiffany actually saw this film. I literally did not see this movie until long after I read the book and until it came out on DVD. This movie is OK. But it is not without it's flaws. This is a throwback to teenage thriller movies as it features an entire young cast of teens who present themselves well on the large movie screen. The idea with the film is fun and it is designed to give us an adrenaline pumping story. That is a major flaw, it is supposed to be a film based on an young adult novel. The creatures in the maze are called "Grievers", they look really cool and amazing, but they also look like cyborg-like scorpions that bare a striking resemblance to the bugs in "Starship Troopers" and that is just crazy. Another problem is the Grievers, we don't see much of them until one of them is killed in the second act of the film. This sequence becomes the drive to finish the story and that's all we get because we don't know a lot about and they attempt to play an important role in the film and this creates a major plot hole. The one major problem that these young adult movies keep having is that in every teenage movie, there has to be an antagonist and this goes to Will Poulter as Gally and he plays the role like an idiot and he does not make me feel sympathy for him at all. Why you put a stupid-ass character in the movie? That's just bad writing, but this is THE MAZE RUNNER , so, no hard feelings. There are some cool scenes in the film. When Thomas goes into the maze after dark and is chased by the "Grievers", it's a cat and mouse sequence that keeps you going. The last sequence is when they try to get out of the maze and they attack in numbers and that is kinda cool. The third act in the film is just stupid and typical, but also good. You can see what the ending is going to be and it is no exception. The sequence at the end makes no sense and you should see this to know what I am talking about and it involves one of the characters. The ending is when they get out of the maze and they go into another maze. That is bullcrap! Is that supposed to set up a sequel because if it is, I'm paying to see it on DVD! The acting is good and bad, the supporting cast is out there and makes a lot of effort to put on good performances, but the only two that really shines out is Dylan O'Brien and Kaya Scodelario and they have great chemistry. Overall, I enjoy THE MAZE RUNNER. I don't think it's a perfect film by far and it is not as good as Hunger Games, Twilight or Divergent, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse and I DO MEAN WORSE. The film tells us a story that we already know, but it is amazingly well-directed and really fresh. Sure, it has it's major flaws, a stupid character and a very confusing ending setting up a sequel, titled "THE SCORCH TRIALS", for a September release this year and I can't wait, it is still watchable. I give THE MAZE RUNNER a 8.5/10.
7.0~Entertaining and intense sci-fi movie jpkwolf Sign in Permalink I'm not too interested about Hunger Games. It's like Battle Royal for teens. Don't care about the Divergent series either. So I was surprised Maze Runner was so good. Maze Runner felt often like a proper sci-fi movie. It was intense and interesting. The movie is another one of those new teenage sci-fi dystopia series but I'll give it credit for being a good one. I would give it even higher score but I believe there was one annoying plot hole or at least it would have required some explanation. Anyway, I recommend this movie and want to see the sequel. Bring on the scorch trials!
7.0~Fast-paced and gripping teenage dystopian film with an interesting premise evancyl Sign in Permalink This was a fast-paced, gripping film with an interesting premise. Based on the popular dystopian book of the same name, The Maze Runner tells of a boy named Thomas who wakes up one day with all his memories gone, save his name. Together with a group of other teenage boys, he has been placed in the Glade, at the centre of a maze filled with dangerous creatures known as Grievers. The boys have organised themselves with Alby as leader, and everyone having designated roles and following a set of rules. The Runners among them have been mapping out the maze for the past two years, but are nowhere near finding an escape. Soon after Thomas' arrival, the chief runner Minho struggles to bring an injured Alby back into the Glade before the doors close at sunset and they are stuck outside to face almost certain death. Thomas rushes out to help, but winds up stuck in the maze with them. With Minho fighting alongside Thomas manages to kill a Griever by trapping it. The next day, they retrieve something of importance and find a way out. For the first time, a girl is delivered to the Glade, accompanied by a note saying "She's the last one ever". Another boy, Gally, assumes leadership. Wanting to maintain the status quo, Gally opposes Thomas and his plans for escape. Although I only read the Wiki synopsis of the book, I suspect that the film is a better - tighter but with all the essential elements of the story intact. The action scenes were great - suspenseful and convincing - and the maze was just how I imagined it. The Maze Runner ended on a promising note of deeper mysteries to be uncovered, but how this film is judged will ultimately depend on what happens in the sequels.
6.0~Despite clear flaws, this is great entertainment kerryperichicken Sign in Permalink I was quite skeptical at first about this movie, but when I saw it, it was pretty good. I'll get down to the pros first: -This is certainly an entertaining film. The chases and fights are desperately thrilling and exciting, and there's also quite a bit of mystery in the film. Cons: -Incredibly average writing and acting. -A ridiculous amount of cliché's, so much so that during a death scene I almost laughed because of how cliché'd it was. -Some of the fights were so shaky and frantically edited that I could't see or make sense of what was going on. -This movie feels insignificant nowadays, because so many movies follow this premise: A group of teenagers or young adults are living in a futuristic, dystopian world, controlled by a higher, richer power/company. One person comes along who is different or who can somehow save everyone. The movie is always based on a bestselling teenage novel. In today's age, this just feels like a Hunger Games clone. Despite these many flaws, this is pretty good entertainment.
1.0~Load of unimaginative tripe using Clichés by the number. peterbreis Sign in Permalink Sad that this rates well with todays youth. I can understand why, it unsubtly hits all the marketing buttons. So here is how the focus group wrote this pile of drivel. First you "research" teenagers. What are their interests and very limited knowledge? 1. Computer games where you dress up, wander around and slash/hit/shoot things 2. Zombie/apocalypses 3. "Reality" TV shows like Survivor 4. Speaking in a grab bag selection of clichés Then you crudely fashion the outsider (but special) thrown into a group of strangers who ultimately recognise that you are special and then follow you through (pathetic) adversity aka schmutzed dress- ups. Being too lazy or incompetent to craft story and dialogue you toss dice to sequence the most appallingly grating clichés. Throw in a girl (let's not go overboard), some CGI to make it "interesting" using slightly adapted monsters from other equally unimaginative efforts that made money. Then spend a pointless hour and a half to reach a lame conclusion which is a set-up for more drivel. Same time, same place, next year... but I won't be there next time.
7.0~Decent movie, may be confusing Anyar42 Sign in Permalink This film adaptation follows the novel of the same name. There are some deviations that, in my opinion, were unnecessary and raised unanswered questions (especially the Griever Hole scene). The lighting was a bit dark at times, and the plot as well as characters could be confusing even if you read the book. Still, those aside, the movie is alright. The visuals of the Glade and the maze are fantastic, and the acting is decent too. Just try to suspend your disbelief until the film's over.
3.0~Another "youth competing/surviving for their life" theme movie tommoboy Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner (2014) Another "youth competing/surviving for their life" theme movie 30 November 2014 Just another praise of youth. Or how can you put it...Hollywood is again using very young actors, and the plot or theme is,sigh,again about a group of people competing in order to survive. And the sub- theme about society is dividing people into a few class. Just mention The "Harry Potter","Hunger Games" series, plus "Divergent","Ender's Game",TV-series "The 100","The Giver" etc. etc. Of course there are differences of those movies/series. But the overall big picture is quite easy to see that Hollywood is into the "youth competing for their life"-kind of genre these years. Plus the placement is very often a society who put the citizen into a few classes right from birth or given when they are teens. I was close to give this movie only 2 stars because I'm getting tired of seeing the same theme repeating over and over again from different movies. But I gave it a 3 star because of the good special effects. And the kids gave an okay performance despite an mediocre manuscript. I know the story should be a big thing as a book. I don't know about that, but I can't just give my review of the movie. Don't give me wrong. I don't mind young actors. But they should be giving characters that seems plausible to the story. Plus in most cases, the older actors with more experience, will, In my mind, just act better than preteen/teen/tweens etc. Fx I like "Lord of the flies" because the actors where very good. But besides that, the movie had a good story and manuscript. Plus at that time the movies plot was original. Making a movie like that one or two times a year, and the originality quickly fades out. To go into the detail of "The Maze runner" it was quickly to me, it had some things that could make it a better movie. From the start of the movie, there's a lot of secrecy about why the main character (Thomas) can't get out of the area they are put and go into the maze. Thats quite obvious that's just put in there in the movie, to give the audience some mystery. But for me, that already broke down my "4th wall" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall), or the realism of the movie got broken there. For me, if it should be more realistic, it would be more realistic if the people who was put there in the maze, to right away give warnings to newcomers about how dangerous it would be to step into. The "greenies" or newcomers to the maze, are quickly told, they have to work for the community. That also seemed a bit odd to me. They get the food served on (metal)plate each month, so what is there to be done more really? But I guess that was another odd thing that was placed there just to give a bit of false drama. Despite all those things, the rest of the movie was okay because you got curious what the maze had to offer. But it was rather predictable. Okay. No spoilers from me. But you can watch it one Sunday if you feel bored. But I would recommend "Rollerball" (1975),"The running Man" (1987) and "The lord of the flies" (1990) instead if you want a bit similar themes. Tommo Boy
3.0~Harder to understand than women kgroneman-250-698012 Sign in Permalink This movie just kept introducing more mystery and more unanswered questions as it went along. As they left the maze and the movie got near the end it just kept piling on the unexplained....then it just ended. Without explaining any of it. I would probably have given this movie about a 7 if it weren't for the fact that that the entire premise of the movie was the maze being unexplained...and it never explained it. Sure...we found out it was a test. A test for what? What happened in the real world? Why did the director pretend to shoot herself? Why were people dead? What made them send Thomas? What exactly did he do before? What caused the city in the last scene to be destroyed? Who were the paramilitary guys? As the end credits started rolling I was sitting in disbelief that a movie could end like that and that people would actually give it a good rating.
5.0~Sometimes Exciting but Usually Annoying eddiez61 Sign in Permalink There's a lot of visually interesting action sequences that are quite effective even for being completely CGI created, and some of the acting is above average, especially the three lead boys, but the dialog is often corny and even boring. More importantly, the story makes little to no sense--why couldn't the adults running the "experiment" just put the boys in computer simulated tests?! There's absolutely no good reason for the boys--and one girl--to have to actually endure all the terrifying nightmare violence and horrific deaths of their fellow captives. The explanation by the Director for why the boys were in the Glade and Maze is just so completely illogical and silly and stupid. Some kids will love this movie if they're the sort that doesn't question movies--or things--too deeply or if they're easily entertained by shallow, visually stimulating spectacles. Personally, I prefer a more intelligent, better thought out story, and I think a lot of kids do, too.
9.0~This movie and the book series is my life, Literally nattyscott-murphy-41502 Sign in Permalink OK this movie is my life, I remembering it coming out at the cinema and I was so excited because I was already reading the books. I was currently reading The Maze Runner so even though me and my family were both desperate to see this movie. I made them wait till I had finished the book! I Wasn't GOING TO HAVE THE END OF THE BOOK SPOILT. But then by the time I had finished the book, of course it was no longer at the cinema. SO I THINK I SPENT THREE TORTOURUS MONTHS WAITING FOR IT TOO COME OUT ON DVD. When of course it finally did I made sure we straight away watched it, I was literally on the edge of my seat the whole time, even though I knew what was going to happen I still couldn't help feel like I had no idea what was suddenly going to appear on screen and happen. I just love that feeling! This movie is still one of my favourites of all time I love it, I then couldn't wait for the scorch trials to come out at the cinema.... This movie I think has a great cast, great acting, great affects and finally is a great adaptation of the book. If you have read the books i definitely recommend checking out this DVD! If you haven't watched this movie I would still recommend watching this movie....
3.0~Rather nasty... MartinHafer Sign in Permalink It seems that Hollywood is always looking for the next franchise film series aimed mostly at young adults. Following in the wake of the "Harry Potter" films, other series were quickly put into production to see if they could be the next billion dollar franchises. Some, such as the "Golden Compass" simply fizzled whereas "Twilight" and "The Hunger Games" hit pay dirt. In light of these big bucks, it's not surprising that "Maze Runner" would make it to the screen, since it's just the first of three books--three books which seem strongly inspired by "The Hunger Games"...only a bit gloomier. And, given that it's already earned about three times its cost just here in the States, it's not surprising that the sequel is due to be released next September. So is the film any good? Well, it looks nice. Other than that, no. It's violent and nihilistic without the interesting social commentary or originality that you get from the "Hunger Games" films. Instead, it's just ultra-violent and nasty--with scores of teens being killed for our entertainment. Plus, in the "The Hunger Games" films you have plucky and likable characters with some depth, but in "The Maze Runner" they seem much more flat and ill-defined. In other words, they're mostly just there to be killed or survive but little else. Overall, it's a film with little depth, lots of nasty mayhem and a cast of cute boys meant to appeal to the same folks who love "Twilight".
8.0~An Exciting, Dark and Surprisingly Good Blockbuster slayerjmk95 Sign in Permalink I can see how people are turned away by this film by either its similarities to "Lord of the Flies" or to other young adult books- to-film movies like "The Hunger Games" and "Divergent," but let me say, this is better than most of these young adult-themed movies, including the first Hunger Games movie. I won't write-up the plot, since it's been written elsewhere and on other reviews; straight into the review we go. "The Maze Runner" is a surprisingly fantastic sci-fi thriller that succeeds by having superb acting, fantastic visual effects with a stellar production design, a pulse-pounding musical score, focused direction and a well-written script that, while does have clichés, works with them in a very good and fresh way. I personally was impressed with the acting a great deal, especially Dylan O'Brien and Aml Ameen. The visual effects were awesome and never looked cheesy or under-valued, which is even cooler since the film is fairly low- budgeted compared to most blockbusters, taking the "District 9"- route. Wes Ball's direction was outstanding, the way he captured the dark, haunting atmosphere, that sense of a looming evil and how the unknown was the biggest enemy, not just the terrifying Grievers (which were actually creepy). The script, too, was outstanding, but seemed to lack the full force the film required to be an absolute SF classic. It's here one can draw many comparisons, but even so, it was still well-written and didn't slip up once, playing into its clichés by placing them in spots you don't see coming until they happen, leaving you with the "Ah, i should have seen that coming!"- moment. "The Maze Runner" is a great beginning to a new series of films that will probably extend outside a trilogy, with a prequel having been written and another on the way next year. Hopefully "The Scorch Trials" step up the atmosphere and writing, and with original cast members attached and Wes Ball directing still, i have high hopes.
3.0~I had such high hopes after being blown away by the books. Boy, was I wrong. falynsoul Sign in Permalink This film is not the Maze Runner. It has the same title, but it is not the same story. Major plot lines and devices are completely changed/and/or missing completely. Entire sections of the story are taken out of context and mutated to fit into the film's limited run-time. Its a shame because the book (trilogy) is one of the most intense and engrossing experiences I've had in the dystopian genre. I listened to the audiobooks at work over the course of a week-- the hours just flew by and I nearly forgot I was working! I couldn't believe the amount of cheap CGI sellout here. They could have at least kept some of the defining details about the maze, Thomas, and Teresa faithful to the books. But no, it was absolutely pathetic. If you don't care to read the books this is probably a 6.5-7 for you.
3.0~Hungergames + lost = Terrible movie mack_89 Sign in Permalink This Movie was a complete waste of time. The story is really terrible. I don't wanna give away the whole story, so I'm just gonna say that the reason they are stuck in the maze makes no sense at all. They could have just been trapped in some lab, in their one rooms but hey, lets make a giant maze with half robots, half monsters who wanna kill Everything. Makes no sense at all! Forget this Movie, its just a waste of time! I will not Watch this Movie again thats for sure. The actors are OK i guess. But i for one, wonder why they did not just make some ladders, they have been in the maze for 3 years and still not found the end of it. Just make some ladders and then they would see the whole maze and don't have to fight monsters to learn more. Simple and easy. But no, nobody there is smart enough to Think of that idea. Jesus Christ. Well i give the Movie 3 Points and hope somebody out there will enjoy it. But if you have a brain, there is a good chance you will find the story terrible like me and my friends did. Over and out
8.0~Disappointing DubstepIsMyReligionX Sign in Permalink The movie is pretty good but there are a lot of differences and important parts in the book that were changed or completely discarded in the movie. For example in the book Thomas and Theresa can talk telepathically but in the movie they can't :(. \ Another difference between the book and movie is that when the grievers come into the glade in the movie it's a full on massacre instead of just taking one per night. Great movie, I would still recommend seeing it but a bit disappointing. I think if the producers had given more detail in the small simple things that were in the book it would've gained a lot more praise. I am still looking forward to the second movie although I hope they don't change too many more things in the sequel.
9.0~A respectful YA Adaptation that matches up with the Divergent and Hunger Games series omaraguirre11 Sign in Permalink Me being someone that has read the series, I had high expectations for this film. I thought this film would be a big let down like the Giver, but I was proved very wrong! The Maze runner starts off intense and will get anyone hooked in the first five minutes. The film has much mystery and suspense; that even I was curious on how it was going to go. The performances by the cast were okay. None stood out, but none were bad. The Action/ running sequences are very intense with the help of the decent soundtrack. The Visuals were pretty good but the one thing that stood out for me in this film was the sound effects. The sounds of the Grievers were terrifying and so well made that I still think of the roars at night. The Ending to this film will surely disappoint those that have not read the book, But I do believe they will explain everything in the sequel (That I hope comes out)The ending will be irrelevant at first, but it is explained in the possible sequel. As a reader, I enjoyed this adaptation greatly. There are new and left out scenes from the book (None that are important. Things are changed, but as a big fan of the book I still enjoyed the changed scenes.) Go see this film. it surely has brought the box office alive, along with pleasing me with a respectful YA Adaptation from the novel. Fans of the book will like it, and want more. People that haven't read it, should be pleased well enough to go see the sequel.
2.0~shame , lame , stupid movie clara_mouawad Sign in Permalink THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL. I've read the book in 2 days and i can say it's amazing! then i decided to watch the movie. I was expecting something totally different. i was shocked when i watched it and here are the differences between book and movie: 1- the Gladers have been 2 years in the maze not 3 years. 2- when first this whole maze thing began, a group was send to the maze not only Alby who the movie says he was sent alone at first. 3- Teresa and Thomas speaks telepathy, and it's very important in the book. instead the movie didn't say anything about it. 4- before Teresa wake from her coma she speaks telepathically to Tomas telling him her last memories before fading. 5- what was this stuff in the movie which has the number 7 written on it? nothing like that in the book 6- in the book, when the runners come back from their runs they draw the map of the day. 7- when Thomas and Minho were stuck in the maze the night, Minho didn't help Thomas with Alby instead he ran away 8- the movie says nothing about the cliff neither about the hole that Thomas and Minho found when they were stuck the night out chasing the Grievers. this hole is the exit of the maze, were the Gladers in the book left the maze. 9- the maps that the runners have drew were the key to the code to open the door inside the hole. in the movie Thomas just remembered the code which was a set of numbers (in the book it was words) 10- when the door didn't close at night Gally was being controlled by WICKED and told the Gladers that the grievers will kill one person a night (not all the Gladers in the same night!!) 11- when they succeeded to pass the door out of the glade, there wasn't any video tape!!instead people came and rescued them from WICKED and took them away. 12- when Gally killed Chuck, it wasn't Minho who killed him! instead it was Thomas who punched him hard in the face but he sure as hell didn't die! 13- nothing in the book about Chuck having a rock from his mom! 14- Alby died in the night when they were leaving the glade, trying to be helpful he gave himself to the grievers thinking that they may leave the others alone since the message was that the grievers takes a person a night. 15- Thomas went to a griever to get stung on purpose to remember. (in the movie he just stung himself) If i want i can find THOUSAND more mistakes in the movie! i can say that the movie was all a mistake. Instead of spending your money and wasting your time watching this movie , i advise you to buy the book and read it because it's amazing. nothing like the movie. THE MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.
4.0~Never written a review because I was too lazy to sign on. john_bazyk Sign in Permalink I love this book, the author took the time to fill the book with detail to help you get to know each character and understand how much they cared and/or hated each other. The movie barley touched Tom and Teresa's relationship, didn't talk at all about the telepathy they shared and totally cut out how much Gally hated Tom and how much Chuck and Tom got along. I was expecting a good setup for the rest of the series. The movie was terrible, what a waste of time. I want the two hours of my life back that were wasted watching this. Go read the book, you will enjoy it, DO NOT watch this movie.
8.0~Puts Hunger Games to shame Nicknielsen99 Sign in Permalink Movie... was great. The Maze Runner to me puts the Hunger Games to shame. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat literally the entire time. There was tons of action scenes, humorous moments, characters you grow to love, and fun moments. This movie was suspenseful, and left me wanting more. Luckily there are 2 more movies coming out. Dylan O'brien breaks out of his somewhat small acting career, and is the male version of Shailene Woodley, who I love personally. This is comparable to Divergent more than anything, and also reminds me of The Lord of the Flies. Books were better, but this was great. OVERALL: I would give this movie a solid 8, and the plot a solid 7. The acting was there, and as was the directing. I would recommend this movie to children of all ages.
9.0~One and I do mean only one ding taken off amandac3276 Sign in Permalink Oh It was absolutely great but the only thing I think should have been addressed a different way is them climbing the sides of the maze. In the movie Thomas had mentioned about climbing the something (referring to the walls of the maze I think)... and I do believe it was established by another character pertaining the audiences same thought. Just not addressed to make the audience believe they couldn't indeed do that. Though, convincing the audience by I don't know having one say... "yeah if you climb the night crawler things will find you and knock you over to you're death". You know the whole dying thing, something! Something small yes, but its so small that when it was mentioned so vaguely in the movie it became frustrating. Remember what I put in the parentheses up there? See I don't even know because it was so vague. I mean come on the excuse for someone listening to a critic "its just a movie" can't be used here. Think about it, if I was a English writer I too would have my lazy moments in using common phrases to hide the itty bitty. *Note: This is completely debatable, just about anything is debatable. Ugh, the little things like that frustrate me though. As far as the movie, actors and director. Absolutely nailed it! Its just that tiny thing. I mean I know you couldn't have put a dome over it, I mean that would be just like hunger games. Just need a reasonable valid reason why they couldn't climb the walls...
7.0~It's like a consolidation of The Hunger Games and The Truman Show, definitely warranting of a view. carrotbastard Sign in Permalink I wasn't entirely sure what to expect of this film when I'd agreed to accompany my younger sibling in viewing it, though, I was pleasantly surprised by its engrossing story and visceral ways of elucidating it through plot events as the film went along. The acting was mostly exceptional and the CGI was incorporated resourcefully enough to avoid encroaching upon the vicarious experience the film tries to convey. My only veritable beef with the film resides with the gaping plot holes and scenes that struck me as though they were hastily thrown in by the writers out of obligation (most notably a scene preceding the ending, which was an absolutely flagrant attempt at implementing a regurgitated Hollywood cliché rivaling the intrusiveness of the Wilhelm Scream), everything else sufficed by my standards. If you're interested in viewing a dystopian thriller, I'd opine The Mazer Runner to be a fantastic candidate.
9.0~"Film of the year" ashleyferox Sign in Permalink Refreshingly different form other movies I've recently seen, brilliant graphics and very fast paced. I disliked the fact its frequently compared with hunger games as I personally felt it stood out more so. I particularly loved the idea of questioning what a group of "strangers" would do or react if thrown into unfamiliar settings and faced with challenges, with no memory of themselves or how they go into the maze in the first place. The film really questions the abilities of the human mind, particularly with the "maze runners" and the mapping of the maze. I liked the fact they cast fairly new, unfamiliar actors, they really connected well with the roles. Definitely looking forward to the sequel
6.0~Rating: B- msbreviews Sign in Permalink Wes Ball directs the movie-adaptation of the famous novel written by James Dashner, The Maze Runner. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up to find out he is stuck inside a huge maze with other young males, who have built a community on a "field" surrounded by massive walls in the center of the said maze. With his memory erased, he has to figure out who he really is, what a mysterious organization named W.C.K.D. has to do what all of that and, of course, a way to escape. This film is full of surprises, some are great, some are horrible. The cast is the first good surprise with some amazing performances from pretty much everyone. Dylan O'Brien leads this movie surprisingly well, I did not expect such a high-level display from him since I was also not expecting such a fantastic start to the film. I just thought it was another book-to-movie adaptation to grab some undeserved money. O'Brien really embodies his character and makes his major share of the screentime worthwhile with some emotional scenes adding substance to the action sequences. Thomas is the type of character that instantly connects with the viewers because he is also in the dark regarding his situation and what the future holds for him and the other guys. Will Poulter (Gally) also achieves an outstanding performance by interpreting a more aggressive character who actually has pretty good reasons to act like he does. Kaya Scodelario is quite good as Teresa, but her character serves more as a plot device to develop Thomas and to advance the story than a real girl who ends up in the maze. Thomas Sangster (Newt), Aml Ameen (Alby) and Black Cooper (Chuck) also deliver some great performances, being Cooper the standout of the three. The Maze Runner is very well-directed by Wes Ball. The action scenes through the maze are suspenseful and tense, even though the scorpion-like creatures are too CGI on some occasions. The editing is clean and the isolated setting provides a claustrophobic vibe that elevates the overall beautiful cinematography. It certainly is a good-looking film, with some well-balanced tone and pacing, despite some unnecessary scenes. This movie offers an unconventional journey: for the first hour and a half, I was genuinely stunned with how captivated I was with the intriguing story. The film's premise is massively engaging due to the mystery in regards to the existence of the maze and to why are the kids there. The exposition scenes throughout the first two acts are incredibly well-executed and besides some nonsense lines here and there from any character, I thought this movie was going to be truly astonishing, but then the third act arrived. The ending completely shatters all of the film's logic. I mean, it is got to be one of the senseless endings to a movie I've seen in a long, long time. Being this the first installment of a trilogy, I knew I was not going to have all of the answers and that the screenplay was not going to have a definite end. However, I did not expect that a horrible exposition scene would finish the film by creating several plot holes that I do not think the next movies are going to address. The screenplay starts as a truly interesting and mysterious story and ends with Patricia Clarkson (Ava Paige) destroying any logic the film possessed. I am so disappointed that I am still trying to decide whether I give this movie a positive review or not. Honestly, even knowing a big part of the movie just does not fit correctly with its ending (which, by the way, is very predictable), I was entertained throughout almost all of the runtime and I don't think such a talented cast deserves to go down with the story. All in all, The Maze Runner self-destructs with the only horrible exposition scene of the whole film by throwing away all of its screenplay's logic. Some characters' script contains nonsense lines, but overall they are all well-developed through really well-directed dialogue scenes. Wes Ball uses the beautiful cinematography to elevate the claustrophobic setting and also achieves some cool chasing sequences with some sharp editing. The first two acts are worth watching and the movie's premise is super intriguing, but the last act, unfortunately, brings the whole thing down.

6.0~Good start pennyelenabooks Sign in Permalink The movie is about a boy, Thomas, who ends up in a place called the Glade, a field surrounded by a maze. The Glade is inhabited by several other boys, who, like Thomas, have no memory before the Glade. Thomas soon finds out that they have created a small community and they are trying to find an exit by searching the maze before its gates close for the night, as no one has survived a night in the maze. But when Thomas is trapped in the maze for a night and survives, the boys soon realize that he is not like the others. As I haven't read the book, but having heard about it, I can't review it based on how much close to the book was the film adaption. However, the film that I watched was a really nice action-fantasy film, even though some parts of it were easy to predict. The pros of the film are the performances, the costumes, the special effects, the music and the settings. The bad are the stops and starts of the story. Plus, at some point of the film, like the action scenes, it failed to be original. Other than that, I liked it and I am giving it a 6 out of 10, hoping that the next one will be better.
6.0~Cannot recommend this movie solveig-seibitz Sign in Permalink Having read the book I had high expectations and as any book reader would, I knew that some things would probably bother me because they were left out. However, this movie truly missed all the key events that made the book great! The movie was illogical, weirdly organized and nothing really happens even though it is 2 hours long. The acting was decent and special effects were good, it was good entertainment but it certainly was not a quality movie to watch. It had little suspension and it lost my attention after a short time. Overall it was quite a disappointment which is very sad because I did really enjoy the book when I read it. Cannot recommend this movie unfortunately but I can recommend the book.
7.0~The Vidiot Reviews... capone666 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner The key to running a maze without getting lost is to leave a trail of Gatorade behind. However, sports drinks are hard to come by in this sci-fi movie. Waking in an agrestic setting surrounded by teenage boys, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) struggles to remember who he is. Initially bullied by the leader's (Aml Ameen) muscle (Will Poulter), Thomas aligns himself with Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), second in command, and starts piecing things together. He also begins training as a runner in hopes of entering the monolithic maze in which Thomas believes their freedom lays. But the first female (Kaya Scodelario) introduced into their boys club could doom them all. Conceptually dark, as well as thematically, this adaptation of the popular dystopian YA novel offers up an intriguing and perplexing premise, supplemented by strong talent and creature design. Incidentally, at the heart of every all-male society is a mountain of unwashed underwear. Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca
7.0~The Maze Runner is Great but Lacking in the Story Department ryanmark-57919 Sign in Permalink With the second Maze Runner movie coming out I thought it would be a good time to go ahead and give my opinion about the first film. I wasn't really sure what to expect with this film other than some action and teenage angst. I've watched enough adaptations of young adult novels to know that we'll be getting that at the very least. The film is directed by Wes Ball and this was actually his first major motion picture that he directed. I'm actually impressed that the movie turned out as well as it did for a first timer. There are definitely a few flaws in the film but overall it's a pretty good movie and I would recommend giving it a watch. Let's talk about the story. Our protagonist is a young man named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien). Thomas has just woken up in an elevator that has delivered him to a place called the Glade, which happens to be exactly what it sounds. There are other young males around and Thomas finds out that everyone that comes to the Glade has no memory of their life before entering the Glade. The Glade is surrounded by giant walls that form a humongous maze around them. A group of young men called runners go out each day to travel the maze and try to find a way out. They can't go out at night because of these creatures called Grievers that like to kill people that are in their maze. Sound complicated yet? It's not that bad since the movie spends plenty of time world building so I'll go ahead and get to the point. Thomas's arrival coincides with a major change in everyone's lives and they need to find a way out of the maze sooner rather than later. I'll try to touch on this briefly but the characters in this film are interesting but many of these actors are quite young so they're not necessarily as experienced as some of our greatest thespians. They get the job done though and it's enjoyable to see what happens to them. O'Brien does an excellent job as the motivated and curious Thomas. He manages to convey the right amount of surprise and confusion but that's only natural seeing as how he has no memory and is thrown into a confusing situation like navigating giant mazes. Ami Ameen, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, and Ki Hong Lee are impressive in their leadership roles of the group and all bring something unique to the table. Will Poulter plays Gally, the obvious antagonist that acts like a douche for no discernible reason. He's not complicated but he does a good job with the role. Kaya Scodelario plays a young woman named Teresa that I honestly felt was forgettable. She's not a bad actress per say but her role didn't really have any purpose. We do have quite a few sequels to go through though so I'm sure we'll see more from her. There's a lot to like about this movie. The action scenes are phenomenal and shot surprisingly well. There's no confusion about what's going on even when there's so much happening. It's nice to see a new director that knows how to keep the action in focus. The characters are also likable and it's hard not to root for them. The maze and the Glade are both great to look at and it's fun to experience this world. The movie looks great but there are a few flaws when you start to think about the story. There will be a few spoilers here so read at your own risk. I'll try to keep them to a minimum though. What is the purpose of Teresa's character in this movie? She's not unlikable or anything but she shows up and it seems like she's important but then we find out that she was just kind of thrown in. We do have more sequels so she may become more important later on. We're also given an explanation for why the teenagers are inside the maze but it's honestly a very poor explanation. Once again, sequels coming and all that but a movie needs to be able to stand on it's own without help from sequels and this one has a bit of trouble in the story department. There just doesn't seem to be a good explanation for why these people have their memories wiped or why this ridiculous maze was built around them. Fortunately, the characters are interesting enough that it's still fun to see what happens to them. Like I said before, the movie is great and it's fun to watch but the story is a bit too similar to something I came up with for a ninth grade English class. Who knows, they may end up unleashing this mind-blowing revelation on us in future films but this one just left me wanting more. I still have to recommend everyone give it a shot since it's actually a decent film.
6.0~Fun movie, good mystery, though a weak payoff thebrighteyes Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner opens with an unknown panicked boy, awaking in a dark, steel elevator, ascending into the unknown. The doors open to a grassy plane - The Glade - where he is surrounded by a group of mocking boys. We soon learn that they remember nothing of their past lives, except that they are all trapped here, surrounded by a gigantic labyrinth which they must navigate to (hopefully) find freedom. It's certainly an intriguing plot. Having never read the book, I didn't really know what to expect. And to that end, the mystery kept me interested throughout. However, I can't say that I felt much for any of the characters. Perhaps those who have read the book will feel differently, but there just didn't seem to be much depth to them. Even the lone girl in the movie seemed to be mostly a useless character, adding very little to the plot. I'd heard many compare it to The Hunger Games, which definitely shares many of the same elements. Both are fun movies, but the main fault of The Maze Runner is with the payoff at the end. Why are these boys trapped? By whom? You'll get answers, for sure, but I felt like they didn't make a whole lot of sense.
6.0~A movie that misses the point of the book it is based on sanda_mo-1 Sign in Permalink Reading a book right before watching the movie could be a double-edged sword - and the movie version ended up impaled on it this time around. It's kind of ironic because the trailers for the film got me to pick up the book in the first place. I enjoyed it so much that it took me less than 24h to finish it. Based on the trailer I was already inclined to like the casting choices for the characters and was really excited to finally see the film. And then ended up spending half the film battling with an overwhelming sense of frustration. I've started noticing that the "book adaptation" scripts I often have issues with, are the ones that were not done/written by the book's author. (as is the case with this film) The part that frustrated me the most was the sense that the director was "dumbing down" the story. Part of the appeal of the book is that they feel just like those boys while reading it - clueless, guessing, emotionally invested, with very little to go on in terms of understanding why they are there and what is going on. Trust the movie version to hand it to the audience on a platter way too early. The book did resemble Lord of the Flies in many ways - it is not just about the mystery and adventure, it also takes a closer look at human nature and what lies underneath when you take away societal norms and distractions of "normal" life. Characters were insufficiently developed making it harder for audience to connect to them on an emotional level. I'd recommend this movie only to those who haven't read the book yet, who are usually drawn to this genre and are only looking for a bit of mindless cinematic distraction that will not leave any sort of major impact on their mind or life. Kind of a waste of a great cast in my humble opinion.
8.0~It's Alright - Leaving you wanting to know what happens Next! agblum Sign in Permalink "The Maze Runner" is the latest in a slew of Young Adult Novel Series to come to the big screen – Following "Twilight", "Mortal Instruments", "The Hunger Games" and "Divergent". Outside of "Mortal Instruments", all of them have been hugely successful at the Box Office, with "The Hunger Games" getting the most critical praise, and deservedly so in my opinion. Like "The Hunger Games" and "Divergent", "The Maze Runner" seems to take part in a Dystopian future. I read the first book, on which "The Maze Runner" movie is based, after I saw the first trailer. While not into the book as much as "The Hunger Games" Books and the first "Divergent" Book (Haven't read the others yet), I still liked it. The movie adaption mirrors my feelings for the most part on the book. The movie was not great, but it was alright, and at the end – You want to know what happens next. The movie opens with a teenage boy, played by Dylan O'Brien, ascending upward in a freight elevator. The elevator opens to a bunch of teenage boys. O'Brien's character does not remember his name, nor his past. He is told all of the boys went through this, and he will remember his name in a day or two – and this comes to pass, eventually remembering his name is Thomas. The boys are all living in a community, with a grassy square, they have named "The Glade", surrounded on all sides by giant concrete walls, one of which opens to a Maze. The oldest boy dates back 3 years being there, with a new boy a coming up in the elevator every month, along with supplies. Some of the boys, named "The Runners" explore the Maze during the day, in hopes of finding a way out, but must return to "The Glade" at night, before the doors close, and creatures they call "The Grievers", who they haven't seen, but heard, come out in the Maze. Anyone who has not made it back before the doors closed has been killed by "The Grievers". For those who read the book, there are some changes, but the narrative is generally followed. The young actors all do pretty well. As I said the movie was alright. Sometimes I though additional parts were needed or parts needed to be elongated to make it a great film. But in terms of setting the table for the series (I admit presumably – I will be starting the 2nd book soon), and in wanting to know what happens next – Mission Accomplished. 3 out of 4 Stars.
6.0~Almost bijdevaate_marco Sign in Permalink There it was, finally I could watch Maze Runner. Before I started, research showed that the movie could fit in the same genre as the Hunger Games. As I expected the visuals where as good as I thought. However, the story was slightly disappointing. At the end my opinion was based on the things that annoyed me. The main point of critic was the story with the clichés. Too obvious cheesy trigger points were placed between pretty thrilling moments. But played by almost inspiring actors. ALMOST a good movie.
7.0~An Exhilarating and Convoluted Journey da_zapata Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner begins in pitch-black, and the first thing we hear is a panicked gasp. We then see a young man in a fearful state as he cautiously observes a metal cage he is in, which is being thrust upward. He emerges from the cage onto land, filled with other boys. He is in a complete state of hysteria and is unsure of where he is or what is happening. He cannot even remember his own name. This atmosphere sets the suspense caliber high for the film, right from the start, and this tension is felt prominently as the plot progresses. (Unless you've read the book.) If any of your friends or family members were rushing to see The Maze Runner, it is likely they are devout fans of the young adult novels by James Dashner, who has completed two sequels and one prequel in the Maze Runner Series. As expected, the theaters have been filled with his literary fan base and the intrigued gapers of the film's trailers and TV spots (include me here). Not knowing what to expect is what makes The Maze Runner such a deliriously exciting movie- going experience. For the book-readers, it is a chance to see the book come to life in an entirely vivid way. The film is an agitating mindbender, and it is one that gives clues very rarely. Here is what is known: A large group of boys have been surviving on a circular land, surrounded by immense gray walls. There is no form of escape. The boys call the land The Glade, and there is a mysterious maze that lies in the center of the land. Our protagonist learns the rules and manners of The Glade while inquiring greatly about entering the maze. This eventually escalates to a physical dispute with a boy named Gally, who does not believe he should be promoted to the highly selective team of maze runners who explore the maze. It is then that our protagonist remembers his name as his head hits the floor during the fight—Thomas. His name is Thomas, and all of his memories are gone, as are those of the other boys. The only memory they are allowed to keep is their names. Who is doing this to them? Maze Runner is much more dense than simply "who." It is also a film about hierarchy in an area with what appears to be supernatural behavior. There are numerous plot twists and character backgrounds that eventually come into light, creating a complete piece of intellectually stimulating and action-packed cinema. Yes, the film has its faults. The dialog, at times, is quite atrocious. The lines may be worded horridly or too simple-mindedly, throwing the flow of the film off-balance. But that gets into the script blaming, then book blaming, and that is a literary road leading nowhere—because regardless, it is a fantastic film. The Maze Runner is an enchantingly grim tale of deceit, rebellion, and power. This is largely thanks to the execution of its artistic and profoundly imaginative style, with brilliantly action- packed sequences starring Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, and an eclectic cast of testosterone- pumped young men. There is a sci-fi element in The Maze Runner as well, adding an entire dimension of lunacy and suspense to its already dystopian ambiance. It is a film that must be deciphered in terms of its supernatural aspects, sequential aspects, secretive aspects, and— okay, no more possible spoilers. Regardless of its faults, The Maze Runner is an impressive genre-bender that keeps you hooked from Thomas's first gasp in the dark at the film's beginning to its climactic and perilous finale.

7.0~If only it had more of Dylan's abs nikashvili Sign in Permalink I was lucky enough to get early screening of one of my most anticipated films this year. Well, here it it and I've seen all I needed. The Maze Runner is adaptation of James Dashner's post apocalyptic bestseller about youngsters, who are imprisoned inside the mysterious maze and their struggle of living together, while trying to escape this nightmare. Movie opens with Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) waking up in the cage, that moves pretty fast upwards, right into iron doors. He is confused, he remembers nothing and does not understand how he got in here. When the cage reaches top, it suddenly stops and then he sees a very bright light and some young boys staring at him. Now, he is even more confused. If you are not a book reader, like me, you can be also confused, even though trailer told most of it. But not that much to lose interest how it goes. Because, you know, most of movie in this genre are well predictable stories, just with actors who we are delighted to see on a big screen and some sentiments also. As the plot starts to open up, Thomas starts remembering some small details, it get more interesting. Later, The Maze Runner also suggest whole load of action, chasing and good fantasy. Without going into the deep of story, it has pretty much predictable ending. I've never read the book, but I was absolutely sure where it would go. But here, let me explain things I liked. First of all, it's entertaining. Whatever we say, how stupid and "yeah-I've-seen-this-before" type movie it is, TMR makes us have fun, from Dylan O'Brien's abs (still, too much shirts) to well shot action scenes. There is nothing outrageously illogical, or stupid in this film, it just follows some well known plots of Animal Farm (George Orwell) and Cube. First is similar because it shows how people behave when they are locked up on their own, how they need to have a leader and other psychological. But film does not go too deep into Orwell's issues. It reminded me Cube because of idea, that there are some people out there who lock up absolute strangers in dangerous environment and then "watch" them suffering. Maybe the idea here is a little different, but the 90's classic still kept popping out in my mind. I liked the cast. Leaving alone my favorite Dylan, who I'll talk about later, it was nice to see some recognizable faces like Thomas Brodie-Sangster of Game of Thrones, Will Poulter of We're the Millers and Narnia. Both were definitely good and especially Poulter who played an conservative leader who more focused on staying there alive than going out of the maze. He had some good moments of anger and his eyebrows perfectly coped with it. Technically, movie was well done and paced. It kept motion and action all the time, especially in the second half of film. The Maze scenes were well shot, with some massive production design. Editing worked for me too, it's not masterful, but good enough to enjoy the almost two hour movie. What I did not get is the aliens, these boys were hiding from. In fact, they were robots, but hell looked like intruders from Alien. But in post apocalyptic world, everything is possible. Dylan O'Brien is good in here. He has not done anything other actor of the same appearance would not have done, but he was good. Right in the character. Basically, he was the reason I could not wait for the Maze Runner and as long as I had enough of him, I'm satisfied. All in all, The Maze Runner is good "let's go, see and forget" movie, that fails to deliver something very important or new, but definitely keeps you interested in future installments.
5.0~Read the book if your going to make the movie danshepherd-23373 Sign in Permalink All i ask of people who make movies based off novels to is quite simple, read the book for goodness sake. Greivers did not look anything like what the book depicts. They skipped over a lot of stuff. The ending wasn't even close to the books ending. Yea i understand a movie can only be so long but dang, you could have done a lot better and the scorch trials i have a feeling are going to be just as disappointing. I will still see it, but i am definitely reading the book first! They did not use the telepathy part for Thomas and Teresa except for i guess the beginning part of when it was coming close to when she was coming up. Did not at all look like the Glade that James Dashner had depicted. The jail was suppose to be safe completely from grievers. But instead was a hut of bamboo. Also it rained, i thought it was suppose to be like paradise minus the prison feeling. Teresa got thrown in jail. That didn't happen the right way at all. I know i'm complaining a lot but that's because i read the book and have a good imagination as to what the author puts into his/her detail. I love the books but the movies so far could have been better.
4.0~my notes sstrunks-05245 Sign in Permalink I dunno, I just didn't really like it. hard to describe why. it just didn't do it for me. It kind of dragged at times and the discovery process wasn't anything special in finding out what was really going on (1 viewing)
7.0~Runner in a maze is an amazing idea! laruku2005 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is very entertaining. You will realize that almost all casts are young man. But the shows an acting quality so good. I don't even care either Minho is handsome or not as long as he can show the good acting in line with the story board and blend with another chars. The film is post apocalyptic story drawing..with somehow untrust issues in it. At glance this movie have similar taste with the Hunger Games or Divergence. Honestly I should say this movie is significantly better than Divergence, even can not surpass the Hunger Games though. There was no sex scene or drugs on this movie. I am not a book reader and I can say still this movie is good. Have a good plot. Really great!! Recommended! Score:7.5/10
8.0~Darker and more exciting than I was ready for... RevRonster Sign in Permalink Since I'm in my 30s, tween dystopian films don't speak to me like they do for the younger generation. However, they are big bucks and, until "The Hunger Games" end or they just stop making money, there is no end in sight for them. Too bad too many of them look exactly the same"The Maze Runner" was pleasantly different. I had some reservations about this film but it proved to be more action-packed, more exciting, more dramatic, and a lot darker and grittier than I was prepared for. Not only was this a pleasant surprise that made the film a lot more entertaining, engaging, and intriguing but it also set the film apart from the usual, formulaic tween films that make up this specific subgenre. The only thing I really didn't care for in this film was the casting of Will Poulter. He isn't a bad actor but he just wasn't right for the role he was cast in. I thought "The Maze Runner was going to be a generic, by-the-numbers formula that is too prevalent with the tween dystopian subgenre that is all the rage now but the film really set itself apart and the cliff hanger ending really has me pumped to see the next one.
5.0~I get that there's a sequel, but... grandmastersik Sign in Permalink Wow, what a cheat of an ending. This film all plays up to that one final mystery and... well, I won't ruin it, but be prepared for an enormous let-down. Some young men are trapped/placed inside a glade, surrounded by a shifting maze. The men make the glade their home and seem to be content with simple explorations into the maze, until a new arrival - more curious than the rest - sets about a change that leads them to dare to escape from their trappings. The Maze Runner - albeit, not without some issues of logic - is a decent-enough flick, and I'm sure that teenagers will enjoy it, but the ending just hurts given the almost 2 hours that any viewer will need to invest to get there. And then there's a really stupid, unexplainable bit which anyone will half a brain can only shake their head at. Actually, I was going to rate this film as a 6, but that part was so stupid, I'll give it a 5. Let's hope that the sequel offers up an explanation to justify two films being made... but many will probably feel too burnt by this one to bother with it.
9.0~Very good thrilling movie, even better than the book hugo-lecoq Sign in Permalink After reading the book 2 years ago, I was really excited by the announce of the project. Now I have seen the movie and I was not disappointed. Wes Ball's job has hidden most of the book's faults. Dylan O Brian shows his abilities and proves us that he his a very good actor. The only problem with this film is the last scene... SPOILER*** A character is killed, but in the third book, he's supposed to become a very important character... don't know how they will fixed it However, I keep a very good memory of these 2 hours spent in theater. The music composed by John Paesano was really adapted to each of the scenes. Nothing to blame with the special effects, endowed with a realism impressing in view of the movie's budget. The realization is just perfect. Special mention to Will Poulter who fooled me. Only thing disappointed me: the final speech of Ava Paige, which could be summarized by a simple " Watch out, there will be a second opus ! "
7.0~The Maze Runner has a-mazing race for escape theme. I just wish, they explain it, better. ironhorse_iv Sign in Permalink Despite All Our Rage, We're Still Just Rats in a Cage. The movie does have a lot of twist and turns like a maze. So, it could be a bit confusing and frustrating to watch. You'll feel very lost and disoriented, watching it, trust me! While, I do praise the cast's performances, as well as the film's intriguing premise and refreshingly dark and action tone of Claustrophobia fears with great use of special/ visual effects, but still there was something missing from this film that could made it better. Directed by Wes Ball, the movie is based on author James Dashner's 2009 book of the same name. The film is the first installment in The Maze Runner film series, so sadly, most of the exposition needed for this film is in the sequels books, The Scorch Trials (2010), The Death Cure (2011), The Kill Order (2012) & The Fever Code (2016). The concept is interesting. It's remind me of 1990s Lord of the Flies mixed with the movie, 1997's Cube. It's sound very intelligent, but it was really dumb at parts. The story follows sixteen-year-old Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) who awakens in a rusty elevator with no memory of who he is, only to learn he's been delivered to the middle of an intricate maze, along with other boys, who have been trying to find their way out of the ever-changing labyrinth full of monster scorpions call 'Grievers'. For a PG-13 movie, it's pretty violent. Lots of scary imagery. Felt almost 1979's Alien like. Honestly, the whole concept really doesn't really make any logical sense even if you get to read more of the exposition in the sequels. For a Sci-Fiction young-adult post-apocalyptic science fiction, it borderlines Sci-fiction, and seem more like Sci-fantasy. The science in this film, makes little to no logical sense. When you think, hard on it, it doesn't make any sense on why the creators would build a giant Barnes maze. The world is half destroy by a social flare from the sun and a deadly virus is wiping out the population, yet they have enough man-power and energy to build a giant maze with an eco-system to test human beings mind under pressure. What!? How is that even possible? You have computers to run test like that, while waste limited resources like that. The movie is full of huge plot holes and really bad un-explained sequences like this. Don't bother asking why they have bones forest in the glade, as the movie never talks about it. Don't ask why the 'Gladers', can be immune to the flare disease, if they still suffer the effects without a serum? A big one is why isn't the over-bright sun burning the glade? Or how teenagers with little knowledge of science could be scientists? There are just way too many plot holes! Also, the plot could easily be resolved if they honestly just build a ladder. This movie loaded us up with more unnecessary terminology that it gets really annoying. The whole villain corporation name 'W.I.C.K.E.D' is way too gimmicky. I guess, 'E.V.I.L' was already taken .The harsh downer ending was so out there in left field that it felt like a different movie. It really left the audience with an awful taste in their mouth. The movie and book series differ in a few ways, as the movie cuts away the whole thing about characters being able to communicate via telepathy. They also ruin some of the characters like Gally (Will Poulter); by changing the whole ending, which means he couldn't be in the third movie at all. Another thing that the movie change is the Maze. The Maze would had made more sense, if it was indeed underground, rather than in the middle of a WICKED complex and outside. The Glade was supposed to be a pseudo-idyllic place where it never rains, sleets, or snows, but the film, it wasn't. The whole griever hole is not a void/cliff, but a door. Gees all these changes to the Maze ruins the whole theme of the Box being the womb, the Glade as childhood innocent, Maze as harsh adolescence, and the real world as adulthood from book. The whole allegory of the maze is life. There are sections where you see an opening and follow it, but you inevitably hit a dead-end or an obstacle, and have to retrace your steps or move around it to continue on. The movie has a lot of adult themes like dealing with manipulation in a society full of rules and order. Do you break them, or follow the rules? Do you want to live under safe confinement or anarchy freedoms? It's a big thought that the movie lacks in story-telling. Overall: It's a refreshingly dark approach to the new genre of Young Adult dystopian setting, but it's really doesn't shine well in being a great movie.
5.0~Not another teen movie (no really, it isn't) JakeBrinkman Sign in Permalink I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Don't get me wrong, the teen movie aspects were still not very good. However, the action sequences were unexpectedly exciting, making it worth watching.
6.0~Adventrous in parts! namashi_1 Sign in Permalink Based on James Dashner's 2009 novel of the same name, 'The Maze Runner' boasts an innovative concept along-with some exhilarating action-sequences, but when it comes to overall adventure, this recent box-office hit, offers it in some portions. 'The Maze Runner' Synopsis: Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow "runners" for a shot at escape 'The Maze Runner' has a dull first-hour, where the story builds up slowly. The second-hour is when the true adventure kicks in & you begin you enjoy yourself. Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers & T.S. Nowlin's Adapted Screenplay isn't strong enough, despite tremendous potential. Its got its share of thrills, but a mostly dull first-hour, puts you off. Wes Ball's Direction is credible. Cinematography is sharp. Editing is average. Graphics are outstanding. Art & Costume Design are fair. Performance-Wise: Dylan O'Brien, in the lead role, delivers capably. Kaya Scodelario is okay. Thomas Brodie-Sangster is efficient. Blake Cooper leaves a strong impression. On the whole, 'The Maze Runner' is partly fun. That's about it!
7.0~Enjoyably Mysterious Action Movie ahershaw Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is a captivating movie centred around Thomas, a young man who awakes in a village populated entirely by males and has forgotten who he is. He becomes fascinated by the immoral maze surrounding the village, eventually leading to him entering it against the warnings of the inhabitants of the village. Dylan O'Brien brings the character of Thomas to life and makes him likable. The other actors played their roles well. However, when Teresa appeared, the plot seemed to tumble downhill. Teresa does not contribute a great deal to the story. Plus considering the young men had been trapped together for years with not a single female in sight, they didn't seem to be that shocked when she showed up and I was expecting some of them to be throwing themselves on top of her. Additionally, the plot was predictable at times-everyone knew that Thomas would rebel and stride into the maze soon enough, and everyone knew that Thomas would be the one who "changes the villagers' lives forever." None-the-less, the story is interesting and the action was fast-paced as well as tense.
1.0~God Awful, Terrible acting and very misleading reviews dj_sharkman Sign in Permalink Note: Film is actually closer to a 5 or 6 out of 10. First reviews post were obviously fake. Refer to rotten tomatoes or meta for a closer resemblance of the film. 7.6 currently on IMDb compared to 54% on meta. A film focused on teenage actors (few exceptions)should not give hope of strong acting performances. Very few, if any of the characters gave anything worth discussing. Nothing sunk in the entire movie because of this. I was never afraid or excited when the characters were going through the applicable event. I didn't care at all, the banter was so bad it was comical. The brief encounters heavily borrowed from other movies and clearly showed the targeted child audience. I do not recall seeing any blood despite there being many "attacks". The director is new, the actors are new, therefore no one should be surprised the movie is god awful.
9.0~I would totally recommend it! aimee0422 Sign in Permalink When I saw The Maze Runner back in September, I did not read the books. This was one of my times where I come to the novel-to-film books blind. I was very impressed with the acting and the story. Although I heard that the movie was different than the book, I'm sure the changes were for a good reason (and it was!). By touching on The movie is a modern day Lord of the Flies. I'd totally recommend this movie to anyone. My goal before the sequel is to read the books. I want to see the changes they did from the book and also read the next two books to know what to expect (sort of because I know that the sequel is gonna be slightly altered because of the previous events of the first film)...
9.0~Just a perfect film jaydnramirez Sign in Permalink Even though I have not read the supposed book that has been released, I loved the movie I couldn't get enough of it, Everything from the acting to the story line was just perfect, couldn't do it better myself, I find this is one of the best movies I have seen in years, I hate how in the final 20 seconds of the film, It changed my reaction from being so happy from the film to being all annoyed and irritated, It couldn't let the film have its moment, it just had to let us know there will be a sequel, But overall, Once this movie is released I will be buying it as soon as possible, this movie is not something you will get bored of. I do though, Question some parts of the movie, I loved how ever since Thomas got into the maze he was pursued to just uncover all the deep secrets of it, He had to find a way to get out and it just made the movie amazing. Agreeing with another review posted, This is very grippy and kept you surprised until the very end. Something that most films lack of doing, It isn't a typical movie and that just lights it all up
3.0~The empire of dumb endings just got a new king Jakob-eckstein Sign in Permalink The movie itself is not that bad. Although the plot is quite foreseeable the tension and drama as well as the animations are in some parts pretty decent. Even the acting is fairly done. But when it comes to the ending, it's simply "wow"! I haven't seen such a senseless, far-fetched movie plot outcome in quite some time! So overall I'd give it 4 stars, but considering the end I had to downgrade. If you like to watch this movie, keep one thing in mind: Throughout the whole thing don't ask yourself why stuff happens and what the greater storyline is supposed to lead to. If you follow these guidelines, which are probably applicable for more titles than only this one, you can have an enjoying 1,5 hours. In case you find yourself having trouble doing so, choose another movie or maybe even grab a good book.
1.0~Seriously????? greg-32117 Sign in Permalink Mr Hall, what were you thinking? So, let me get this straight. After a terrible holocaust in which a great number of the world's population perished, some people decided to go to great lengths to create and maintain an secretive, complex, difficult, costly, and GIGANTIC concrete maze with enormous moving walls and populated with gigantic malevolent monsters in order to . . . sorry. In order to test the brains of 2 dozen boys? Seriously? You couldn't think of an easier way to do it? Why not just test them in a lab? And why oh why, and this was never explained at any point . . . why create and then insert a bunch of hostile monsters to kill said boys? What would happen if these monsters killed ALL the boys? Pointless. Illogical. Self-defeating. Paper-thin. A. Complete. Waste. Of. Time. Avoid at all costs.
7.0~A start of a new franchise. bjhomeboy08 Sign in Permalink After following the Maze Runner for several months I was excited to finally have a chance to watch the film, and I have to say that I was pleasantly satisfied. As a fun Summer popcorn flick, The Maze Runner effectively kept me engaged throughout. The main protagonist, Thomas, played by Dylan O'Brien, is easy to root for as he struggles to uncover the secrets of the Maze. O'Brien's performance is compelling yet not over the top; often these post-apocalyptic films can suffer from protagonists that are far too melodramatic. Ki Hong Lee, as Minho, was probably the most refreshing character out of the bunch. It's obvious when you're watching the film that the filmmakers want you to notice Minho, but the film does a very good job with slowly introducing him, balancing out a level of mystique and curiosity in regards to who Minho is and what he already knows about the Maze. In addition to the two main leads, Aml Ameen and Will Poulter, who respectively portrays Alby and Gally, offers interesting personality dichotomies which further enhances the difficult obstacles that Thomas, our main protagonist, must face head-on as he uncovers the awful secrets of the Maze. Lastly one of the most intimidating and menacing characters in this film is the Maze itself. The filmmakers have done a excellent job giving life to this inanimate killing machine, constantly leaving me wondering what new and sadistic traps lied ahead for the seemingly helpless runners. If character development is one of Maze Runners strongest suits than the actual plot is likely the Achilles heel. That being said, the plot isn't a complete mess, however, there were moments that left me scratching my head, releasing me from the world of the Maze, which was disappointing since the world itself was utterly captivating. While I watched the film I couldn't help myself to draw comparisons to the Lord of the Flies and the Hunger Games. The community within the Maze will probably draw heavy comparisons to the characters and dilemmas that were portrayed in the Lord of the Flies novel. As for the Hunger Games comparisons, The Maze Runner affectionately tries to replicate it's bigger brother's tone and mood, and possibly it's success, by shooting the film in a similar style, i.e. film grains, shaky camera, and etc. But overall neither of these comparisons hurt the film at all, actually it perpetuated my fondness for the film since I'm a fan of both source materials. When it comes down to it, the Maze Runner plays it safe, following the typical Hollywood clichés that have succeeded within the genre, at the same time effectively giving me as a viewer something new. This film is far from revolutionary, but expect to see a growing franchise that will hopefully learn from some of it's initial mistakes and expand upon it's own source material, and maybe challenge the likes of the Hunger Games franchise.
8.0~This is a surprisingly great young adult thriller! TheMovieSnob247 Sign in Permalink The Hunger Games meets Lord of the Flies in this surprisingly engrossing young adult thriller. I'm unfamiliar with this series of books, but thought the trailer looked amazing and had an interesting concept; so I decided to take a chance. Trailers often let you down, so I didn't get my hopes up. But I was stunned as to how well made this movie was. It tense from start to finish and thoroughly engaging throughout. I can't recall a single cheesy line or unnecessary moment; every line of dialogue further develops the characters, every scene slows builds the tension and every revelation moves the story forward and piqued my interested. The soundtrack goes a long way in creating a sense of danger at just about every turn and the special effects for the maze (and it's inhabitants) make it very ominous and at times, terrifying. Unlikely Divergent, the performances of this young cast are very convincing and draw you into the film; one of the best youth ensembles I've ever seen. The tension builds and builds to a thrilling climax and a fairly unexpected twist (or two). The ending does leave you with some probing questions about the central premise, but I didn't take away too much from the film overall. I think this sets up nicely for the remaining films and given how good this first film is, I'm definitely going to see them. I think this is a better opening film than The Hunger Games in my opinion and if the sequel is half as good as Catching Fire, we'll have a great series on our hands. The critics haven't given this film it's due, it's one of best movies (and theatre experiences) of the year. Get out and see this, you won't regret it. Was my review not horrible? Great!

7.0~An exciting and successful teen adventure with a few shortcomings. peterp-450-298716 Sign in Permalink Thomas: "We get out now or we die trying." Minho: "You don't get it. We're already dead." "The Maze Runner" is just like its predecessors "Twilight", "Divergent","The Giver" and "The Hunger Games" an adaptation of a book. The same ingredients are present as in the above-mentioned films : a post-apocalyptic world where young people play a key role. A world where society is organized in a new democratic or non-democratic way. In "The Giver" human feelings were suppressed in order to ensure a peaceful existence and people are divided into so-called "factions". In "The Hunger Games" there are districts with the Capitol as an overarching body that organizes the Hunger Games annually. Also in "Snowpiercer" we see an example of a dystopian world with a particular social classification in a speeding train. The second ingredient that can't be missed is a revolution against the established values and laws. Obviously, this is again a youthful person with a charismatic personality who has certain talents and who becomes the savior. Calling this a pubertal display that tries to take advantage of the huge success of "The Hunger Games" for me personally is greatly exaggerated. What the hell is wrong with the fact that a group of young people are trapped in a hopeless situation already for years and established a commune with its own laws and rituals. Isn't it a bit like "Oliver Twist" in Charles Dickens's story, who tries to survive in a miserable orphanage? And the group of young people who end up trying to solve the problem resemble enormously the group of friends from "The Goonies". Everybody loves that movie, not ? The sympathetic chubby Chuck reminded me immediately of Chunk ! Granted, it's not very original, and all they are trying is to taste a bit of the success that has this type of movies has with the young moviegoers. But intuitively "The Maze Runner" was for me a of whole new level. It's a highly entertaining film that captivates from the first minute. What I appreciate the most, is the fact that there isn't too much time wasted on extensive digressions and you are catapulted right into the middle of the story. An elevator takes Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) with high speed up to "The Glade", where he's being welcomed by a group of youngsters who live there already for several years and who can't remember anything except their first name. It's a wooded glade and everyone got assigned a certain task. The glade is surrounded by an immense labyrinth of which the layout changes at certain times and apparently there is no way to escape out of it. Some of the boys got the status of "Runner". They leave at the crack of dawn and explore the maze. They try to chart the maze and seek for a possible escape-route. The final story isn't that impressive and looks quite simple : put some young people at the center of a maze from which they can't escape and after wards you add a rebellious adventurer who couldn't care less about the imposed laws and wants to do everything possible to escape. That's about it in a nutshell. But it's the way in which the maze is shown that deserves an applause. A mechanical maze that adapts itself at certain times and where at night terrifying monsters (called Grievers. A kind of spider-like robots) wander around. The constant threat of the maze, the unknown and the creepy night sounds provide for an atmosphere full of suspense. The rapid pace of the movie makes sure you won't be bored for a second. And the special effects look usually impressive. I was only familiar with Will Poulter (goofy Kenny from "We're the Millers") and Thomas Brodie-Sangster ("The Last Legion"). The rest of the cast are relatively unknown young actors (and one actress). Usually there's always one person that mostly starts to annoy me, but this time I thought they all were acting properly. What surprised me the most was the fact that the introduction of Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) didn't led to yet another teenage love affair as in the other similar movies (But I'm sure this will be a fact in the sequels). In my opinion an exciting and successful teen adventure with a few shortcomings. First, I don't think that those who read the book will think it's so overwhelming. Probably it won't meet the expectations and there will be things that are left out or shown in a different way. And knowing the end of the film will surely ruin the fun. Lucky me though, "again" I didn't read the book. Secondly, I found it pretty idiotic that the group of youngsters were able to build a tower to get an overview of the maze, but not one of them was clever enough to build it next to the wall. And third the ending was quite abruptly. That this is a transition to the logical sequels of this film is obvious. Hopefully they'll be of the same level as this one and not like "The Hunger Games" of which the second part really looked like a duplicate of the first. And fourth, I find it a bit sad for the first-lings who spent three years searching the exit and the newcomer solves the puzzle in a few days. Although I'm not a proponent of sequels or prequels and I hate it that movies tend to inherit the characteristics of a boring and tedious TV series, I'm enormously looking forward to the second part. Jeeeezzzz, I'm amazed about myself ! More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be
9.0~really good movie overall brittneysaid-787-572711 Sign in Permalink I would have given this a ten but it annoyed me the way it ended. It left so many unanswered questions. The movie started right in the middle of the movie so there wasn't to much back story which in this movie worked well for this particular movie. You didn't need to know the back story at the start as they explained it throughout the movie. The first 10 minutes or so were a little boring but after that the rest of the movie was pretty interesting. The suspense slowly built throughout the movie and your always asking the same question... what is the maze. Good actors and great graphics and I cannot wait for them to bring out a 2nd one.... and they better. Would defiantly recommend watching this movie to everyone.
5.0~If you've read the book, don't bother; if you haven't read the book - better read it and don't bother to watch bruziene Sign in Permalink I have seen the trailer of the movie and got hooked up really bad. Distopian novels and movies have found their place among my favorites recently. While waiting for the movie I decided to read the book first. Loved it. All three parts of it. So when the movie came out, me and my husband went to the premiere. Of course, I realize that the script does not always follow the book, some simplifications and omissions are a normal practice. But with the Maze Runner, I was utterly disappointed :( The main drawback of the film (as compared to the book) - is the explanation behind the Maze is not something you are gradually led to, but rather it is something sprung on you at the end of the film, in a "because I said so" kind of way. You may understand that, but you don't empathize with it. In the book, from the very beginning you get those little hints that all of this has to do with the way people think, react to various factors, that this is something to do with the brain, that somebody is watching the Gladers all the time and in introducing new factors and risks and sees how they would react; that there is a higher meaning to that. The telepathy thing between Thomas and Theresa (excluded from the movie) strengthens the idea. The dreams of Thomas (which are very detailed and present a little peak into the subconscious and the memories Thomas lost starting from the childhood - mostly excluded) support the feeling that something bad had happened to the humankind. In the movie - you don't have it. There is a glade, the gladers want to get out because... well because for some reason the gate wouldn't close... Thomas is behind that, but what and why he was doing - he doesn't say... It is a bit chaotic. My husband didn't get that either - he still doesn't understand why I took him to the movie. Maybe I am too prejudiced because I have read the book, but this is the first time I am that disappointed - The Hunger Games, The Divergent (among many others) haven't left me feeling that way. There, I loved the script, I understood why some parts have been omitted and that some things could not be shown. The Maze Runner could have done much better IMHO. So, my advice would be to just read the book and imagine it.
2.0~Nothing like the book. eadms Sign in Permalink I always read the book first and in this case that's all you should do. This movie is so unlike the book they might as well have not written " Based off the best selling novel." Because it isn't. The only way its similar is that it has the names of some of the things in the book. It leaves out HUGE important bits of information like Thomas and Tersa's telepathic ability. I know this was probably just in my mind but I think the actors who played the roles of the characters look nothing like how I not only imagined but also was led up to believe by the author. The author described them very differently then the actors looked. And they changed so much too! Like how Ben is stung after Thomas arrives. Or how the cliff doesn't exist in the movie. In the book there was a invisible hole off the side of the cliff called "The griever hole" in the movie it was just part of the maze they stumbled on. Also there is nothing about the beetle blades And WICKED. I could go on and on forever but one last thing. The ending. It was COMPLETELY different from the book! They didn't have to do anything involving the code WORDS, Everyone at WICKED is dead, Chuck is shoot with a gun instead of being stabbed with a knife, and Gally ends up with a steak in his chest. I don't understand how this movie could be so different. Like I said I could go on and on forever but just do this for me. ONLY READ THE BOOK!
4.0~Take an idea from half a dozen movies and try to blend. llounger Sign in Permalink Contains spoilers. Forewarned that not having read the book would mean some parts wouldn't make sense I watched the movie. I am OK with the beginning as it is like joining a movie half way through. But then we have the high wall keeping out the monsters (King Kong); the lads splitting into two groups (Lord of the FLy's); The supervisors mixing up the scenery (Hunger Games) The escape from erehwon ( Logans Run), The studio (Terminator) etc We are expected to believe an elaborate test includes a maze that would be way beyond budget for any selection process. Some lads escape only to find the one who wants to stay behind is there already. Finally its all in the desert but seems to have a temperate climate. It leaves us as it finds us wondering what is happening, but thats OK I like serials... The script is so predictable and tedious I actually liked having bits that didn't make sense, at least it broke up the tedium. Its for kids not adults.
8.0~Fun, flawed and pulse-pounding. matrixpolaris Sign in Permalink Okay. I read the books, and they were great. They had interesting characters and ideas, and are really fun to read. The film was good, but not as good as the books. To start with the positive stuff, this film is so exciting, so pulse-pounding, and it's epic. The action is just so good, and this film really stands out from all the other YA movies out there. I mean, it doesn't stand out as much as the Hunger Games, but still. Also, the casting was great. Dylan O'Brien's performance is Oscar-worthy. Well, almost. But these teenagers can act. And while the Grievers just look like a robotic spider with a LotR cave troll-like head on it, but the effects are great. Now to the negatives. The film feels really rushed. All those moments in the book, like the daily life in the glade, his Runner training with Minho, them trying to find out a code in the maps, the emotional moments with Chuck, they're all left out. The film deviated from the book a little too much, and while it's OK to cut some stuff out, with lots of important scenes not in the film, all of Teresa's importance is gone, and she's just an obligatory female character. And Thomas getting his memories back should have been the time to explain what happened before the maze. But the film wanted to keep everything a mystery for the next films to resolve. Well, guess what, Scorch Trials didn't explain anything. Also, the final fight outside the Griever hole is reduced to a small skirmish, before they seal the doors. No, you may be thinking, why did I give this a 9-rating? Well, sometimes, the fun factor beats out every technical problem in a film. And while they should have made it more faithful to the book, if all you want is an awesome, action-packed YA film, this is it.
5.0~Did I like it? Well, um, you know, hmmm... MaximusNerdous Sign in Permalink So what do we know after watching this movie? The Earth is in ruins, there is a terrible virus, the survivors think it's OK to torture children in the name of science, and there will be more torture because Hollywood wants to make a sequel. When I walk into a theater or hit the play button, the only thing I ask for is to be entertained. While I was entertained by this movie, I was also equally frustrated. This was a fantastic movie in every regard except for the fact that it had an extremely anorexic plot. Yeah, I know, there is a sequel in the works and they didn't want to give away "too much". That all sounds nice, but you have to have some kind of supporting story for the world that you're expecting the viewer to immerse themselves in, and that's where this movie falls flat on it's face. So whats the thinking here? I will be willing to spend more money to find out the meaning of the money I already spent? That reminds me of an old saying that goes something like, "fool me once"... Well you get the point, right?
6.0~Circle game Lejink Sign in Permalink I normally watch these "Young Adult" adventure movies when child-minding my almost- teenage niece Erin and so, having previously watched the first two "Hunger Games" films with her at my side, she unsurprisingly recommended this film for us to watch on her most recent stay. It undoubtedly helped that I'd thus already been initiated into the whole bleak post- apocalyptic vision-thing as yet again the focus is on a group of youngsters forced to deal with a seemingly no-win scenario imposed on them by adults which sees them out in the wilds confronted this time by a monster-maze which offers their only escape although it comes, naturally with its patrolling nightmarish killer-creatures the Grievers to provide the expected SFX fight sequences. Unlike "The Hunger Games" where the plot exposition is made clear from the start, the twist here is that the viewer is thrown into the middle of the action just like the initially amnesiac kids with the purpose of their task only explained at the very end, just handily in time to trail the inevitable part two (Erin tells me there are four books in the series so I'm guessing quadrilogy here). I understand the movie was pitched by its producers as "Lord Of The Flies" meets "Lost" which neatly sums up the plot. The young actors playing the leads are all unknown to me which I think helps with the credibility of the narrative. To me it seemed as if the delayed entrance of the young girl to the group seemed more like a device to broaden the movie's appeal across the sexes (there were no girls in "Lord Of The Flies") but even after she arrives she doesn't seem to contribute much but maybe she gets her "Catniss" awakening further down the line. I was perhaps most impressed with the maze structure itself, a massive hulking monumental construct full of dark foreboding and the child in me was naturally pleased when the gang finally got to the end, although not before the rather predictable leadership conflict in the group and various scrapes and scares with the marauding Grievers. Relatively unsentimental, action-packed and with just enough depth of character throughout, I again found myself quite happily sitting through another film I'd not normally have opted into. Whether I ever watch any others in the series will probably depend on my future availability as a "baby-sitter", although on the strength of this I might just volunteer my services when the opportunity arises.
4.0~A run into darkness ahegde3149 Sign in Permalink Another typical young-adult book adaptation. Despite me falling into that category this movie failed to amaze me. I have not read the books though. The themes of the movie are similar to our recent hunger games,divergent series where our mighty youngsters need to survive in difficult environment. Here their mental,physical and emotional limits get tested leading to a result which we already now. I would prefer both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent' over this one any time as they had better performances, story and direction. 'The Maze Runner' has many problems, the main one being keeping the audience in the dark till the last second. The ending does no justice to the questions raised in it. All it says is see you next year, where your doubts will be cleared in the sequel. The plot involves a group of youngsters put in an environment surround by a maze. Who put them there? Why they are put there? for getting those answers you will have sit through patiently. To get out of there they need to solve and get out of the maze. Wont go too deep into the premise as its the most interesting thing in the whole movie. In first half an hour we get introduced to their lives with the help forced dialogues and then follows not so unpredictable action in the maze. Thomas played by Dylan O'Brien is actually the lead character put the script fails to do justice with that respect. Also acting front everyone is just average except Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt. Really liked his acting in Game of Thrones. Even if there are some tense running sequence through the maze which are portrayed with neat CGI, the script fails to put forward the objective of the characters properly. Also many concepts in the film are quite illogical even in sci-fi front. All the while the suspense is built on why there is the maze?, why this guys put in there? but the narrative fails to hold onto it consistently that at the end I wasn't quite bothered with assumption that it all is going on in the mind of some character. Adding to it the end reveal was quite lame and the cliffhanger rather than making me excited towards the sequel and franchise it made me realize it wont be worth the time. Still its not terrible, there are some engaging action sequences but the script is weak. I would give it a high 2 out of 5, which will be somewhere between below average and average. RATING: [2/5]
4.0~Don't bother unless you are a teen/pre-teen Psycane Sign in Permalink Though entertaining, this film lost a lot of potential. The film's universe is not explained well as the film draws to a close and that conclusion was bad. The film had some good actors, but sub- par others. The characters were not very well written as was some of the dialog. This movie tries its best to stay close to the source material but ultimately fails. What the film was trying to say and its views have been done before. This was a fairly entertaining movie, though it just falls flat and with unnecessary and some poorly executed sequences, this film could have been a lot better. But it just squanders any originality and takes a possibly fantastic idea and series into just another YA film adaption and series. Not worth your time, though I do suggest reading the excellent novel and its sequels by James Dashner.
8.0~Engrossing, but not for all adityagajbhiye Sign in Permalink The movie starts off with a pretty interesting plot where the protagonist named Thomas(Dylan O'Brien) doesn't remember anything about his past and finds himself in an open field (referred to as glade in the movie) being laughed at by 40 or so teenager boys around his own age.The field is surrounded by massive intricate maze walls, which apparently needs to be crossed to escape from the maze and this is what this movie is all about. None of the teenagers present in the glade have any memory of their past and they have been trying to find the way out of this maze for two years-since the first boy was sent into the maze. Of course, it's easy to predict that Thomas will be the best maze runner ever who finds a way out. Even though the first half is extremely well done and quite engrossing, the movie loses its pace in the second half. There are a few plot holes because of the lazy script-writing done.There are numerous occasions which don't have any resemblance to their description shown in the novel. As difficult as getting out of the maze seems in the beginning, there is absolutely no thrill factor in the climax sequence. The reason as to why they were put in the maze doesn't seem plausible at all, while the reason given in the novel is easily believable. The direction, sound effects and cinematography are top-notch. The scenes were well enacted by casts. The movie is worth watching at least once for its thrilling action sequences and authenticity of the locations(and grievers) as they were described in the book.
5.0~Disappointed lyerrick14 Sign in Permalink I saw that this movie was coming out and I was very excited. I decided to read the book and it's safe to say it is one of the most well written books I have ever read. The movie was extremely disappointing.They took out crucial parts of the book and replaced it with garbage. For instance, the gladers never received the antidote for the griever sting until later on in the movie, in the book it was there all along and the antidote caused the changing. Many other things such as the whole scene with Ben in the homestead then lunging at Thomas or Gally saying he'd seen Thomas in the changing or one major thing, the sky turning gray and the sun disappearing. Speaking of, there was no weather in the glade, there was only blue sky and the sun. In the movie it rained and there were clouds. There is so much I found wrong with this movie. Some of the acting, in my opinion, wasn't that well done. I did find some things to be really well done. I thought the graphics were very well done, it looked very realistic which is one reason i don't hate this movie. I think the actors were picked out really well and they all seemed to portray the character very well. Another thing I did not enjoy about this movie is from the very beginning it started out very wrong. Also the things in the movie happened very fast. I would have rather seen a 3 hour accurate representation of the book then watch this again. I believe this movie would have done much better had the producers went by what the book actually said.
9.0~you should watch it makarovaalena Sign in Permalink The Maze runner is one of my favorite films. It is the best fantastic film I have ever seen. My favorite actors are Dylan O Brien and Tomas Brodie-Sangster .They are wonderful actors. this film is about teenagers,who live in the maze. They don't known that is around them.They have their traditions and customs.And when a new teenager appears,everything is beginning to change. They always play all their part wonderfully.Dylan starred in the following films: the Teen Wolf , The Intership Maze Runner two , and Thomas starred in many films too: Star Wars Force awaking ,Phantom Halo , The Luka State:30 Minute Break , The Ugly Duckling, Orbit Ever After and In Love with Dickens, etc.
4.0~Letdown of a movie Snootz Sign in Permalink This is a sterling example of how to make a very interesting movie with no point whatsoever. As such, it is prime material for how not to make a movie. The acting is good if cliché. The plot is interesting but without resolution or explanation. The climax and end game are senseless and goofy. Don't go into this expecting to learn what's going on. You'll know as much 15 minutes into the show as you will at the end. This is an obvious multi-parter that leaves one with no reason or desire to see further parts. The body count is excessive and without conceptual reason. The "grievers" have no apparent role except to kill and destroy-- and that role makes no sense in context of the story. This will keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat the entire time, then make us wonder why we spent another couple hours of our life involved with such drivel. In the end, the question that will be on everyone's mind is, "What was that nonsense there?" But there will be no answer.
7.0~You won't know any of the actors, you've never heard of the book, but The Maze Runner might just be worth a look... OlieRendch Sign in Permalink So yes, The Maze Runner is the latest in a genre that tries, and sometimes succeeds, to get teenagers to give their cash. I've watched trailers for them over the years but then I learnt about this film and it actually sounded interesting; I haven't read the book so this review is going off just what I saw in the movie. To start off, the storyline, it's about a guy who finds himself in a large field surrounded by a giant maze, and he's not the first to appear there, there is a whole community that has been built by these young adults who have also had their memories wiped and are in this field. This film certainly gave you the feeling of isolation, the CGI was pretty good for the most part so the walls and the maze looked awesome, the plot had few good twists, although maybe some were a little predictable, and for at least the first two acts it was a solid movie, it had tense chase scenes, strong characters and I enjoyed it. Some of the dialogue was a little hard to swallow, nobody could seem to answer questions straight forward, it was always a vague command or statement. Of course there has to be a resolution to all this and that becomes the last 20 minutes or so. Without going into spoilers, I was a little surprised how after the revelation the entire tone of the movie changed; some people are going to hate it, I'm on the fence currently but it just seemed odd; especially the fact that they were almost to the point of looking at the audience and saying "Please let there be a sequel!". Apart from that though I enjoyed The Maze Runner's mystery and thrilling dark moments and the I couldn't really fault the special effects.
1.0~adult viewer here.. Teen dribble terrible. Westeire Sign in Permalink Teen dribble. I would go as far to say Nanny McPhew with a touch of horror. Nothing remarkable at all about the movie. Acting bad. I presume its geared towards the teenage minds, because as an adult I would demand my money back. Its the type of movie that heads quickly to net flex (where I also would not watch it) These movies should have a warn *** beware to over 21's.. This movie may cause you to roll eyes and wish you had stayed at home****. Some teen movies can be pretty good, but this one does not hit any notes. Just because a movie as some well known actors does not mean its a good movie. I struggle with these reviews.. " Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text. "... Well really these bad movies in my adult opinion are just too bad to review.
8.0~worth the watch anthonyesposito75 Sign in Permalink Really enjoyed this film it does grab you from the start.If you didn't know, this is just one of three instalments and its a great start, with great performances from Will Poulter, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Dylan O'brien who gets better and better every time i see him. There is not a lot of action but this film does not really need it there is so much going on that keeps you entertained. It starts with Thomas ( Dylan O'brien ) on the lift which opens up in the glades, he has no memory of who he is, not even his name. After a day or two he remembers his name, but also has flashbacks which he keeps to himself. Some reviews have compared it to lord of the flies, which is a fair reflection. This is a great movie and a fantastic day out for the family, even though it has a 12A certificate, kids under the age of eight/nine will be lost and unable to grab the concept.....enjoy
7.0~Surprisingly good... but sometimes out of proportion pendenquejohn Sign in Permalink When I actually first watched the movie poster, The Maze Runner really caught my attention. I really wanted to watch it and that's what I did the other day. It's actually quite a good action movie and I really like how the story develops through time. It always kept the spectator guessing and it was actually quite difficult to anticipate certain moves like it is often the case. The death of Blake Cooper is really heartbreaking and thoroughly unexpected especially in the way he actually was and this also participated in keeping the spectator guessing. On the negative sides however here's my take. The notion that Dylan O'Brian comes like some sort of superhero and then all of sudden is able to escape and even kill one of these beasts in the Maze is kind of really laughable. I actually know that this is done for the purpose of the film, suspense or whatever you want but this actually doesn't really cut it. Another thing is certain battle scenes with the beasts. I mean if these things are so good, so strong or else, how exactly were they able to resist with sticks and batons against them with only a select few getting killed. That in itself too doesn't really make sense. It's either you portray the teenagers as superhuman and equal to these things or either you actually have them as simple human beings with a better thinking and more astute way of getting rid of them than just standing there defeating them with sticks when these machines are designed as having much prominent advanced weapons. Unfortunately, they were made like equal to these things and the opportunity to show that indeed certain teenagers and children can be very astute wasn't fully attained -; though throughout the film it was mostly the case (ability to set rules, to live in a disciplined society, to work and cooperate in group... especially when you know that most of today's teenagers tend to be quite rebel or unruly) but that was a big letdown for me. The last thing that really bothered me is that scene where they were trying to hide one of their mate because they didn't want to leave him behind. Dylan O'Brian himself then had to hide himself because there was a beast coming for both of them. I mean the contradiction between the fact of making these beasts as advanced robots with great computerized systems and the fact that they can't even detect either of Aml Ameen or Dylan O'Brian is just a ridiculous concept and really throws a doubt on how efficient these machines are really made to be -; considering how the characters of the movie were sanctifying them as ultimate unbeatable gods. Obviously, they would have had some defects but not in the way the characters actually talked about them.
10.0~AMAZING toryaharris Sign in Permalink I would waste every second on this movie. People are saying don't waste your money.... well i'd waste every cent. Not every book's movie has to be perfect. I have never read the book and this movie is amazing. even if i read it it wont lessen my rating for this movie it was great!! i recommend it. I have re watched this movie so many times i love it !!! i just wish thomas held himself back a little and the rest listened a little better.
10.0~An awesome film with a flaw. silvermistvio Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is one of my favourites film series of all time. Although I haven't read the novel yet, but I love the film version very much. In the film, there are some things that they have changed and a bit different from the novel, still, the film makes sense (except for one thing) and I still love it. One thing I don't understand to this day is that when they (Thomas, Newt, Minho and the others) finished the trial, then they found the room and play Ava's message. After that they found Gally. So, my question is how did Gally make it out? I mean he doesn't have a key and the path they used, it already is sealed. And when they passed, there was no sign of Gally. So, Gally's appearance in this room is literally impossible. (Unless Gally is a spy from WICKED to stop the others from getting out of course.) And they didn't explain it. I don't know about the novel. I don't know how it went in the novel. Maybe it might be different. I think I have to read the novel to know about it. Overall is that except for that fact described in above, the film is quite good and enjoyable.
6.0~A bit of this, a slice of that - and no new level BeneCumb Sign in Permalink Well, I realize that I am not among the movie's target audience, but I have seen Lord of the Flies, Divergent, Predator and similar, but it has not crossed my mind that I take more of less interesting parts of them, employ more or less famous actors with different racial background, with the hope that something conceptual will arise... In fact, the outcome is a rather plain story for teens with laying stress on "nice" values, such as need for teamwork, trust, friendship, courage, etc., where the leading character/actor is less interesting than his co-stars, and the ending is confusing and scattered due to the sequel already planned. But as this movie and Hunger Games series have enjoyed enormous popularity and box office, then such creations probably fill some kind of gap in the line of new movies. There are a few thrilling and unexpected moments, but all in all - just another shallow entertainment, but hopefully a stepping stone for young actors who could be more selective in picking roles (at least for Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Will Poultier).
6.0~Out of my expectation, but... greenrayandroid Sign in Permalink I'm not the reader of the novel, I'm not a fan of these kind of movies, The Maze Runner might be not over-hyped like the other typical movie was. But this movie really made me want to go to the cinema after I saw one of the posters. I mean "wow, another adventure thriller movie!" After I watch this movie, my expectation was wrong, this movie is focused to the chosen people that living inside the safe zone of the maze called Glade,and the dangerous side of the maze is guarded with the poisonous monster. Someone who can go to the maze is "The Runner". The main character is Thomas, the teenager that being lifted up to the glade and obviously he didn't know anything because they have been brainwashed before entering the Glade. The presentation of this movie is good and satisfying, my expectation along this movie is some people who trapped on the labyrinth and find the way out. But it's not like that, the 50-50 balance between scene of the glade and the maze is surely a tense for me and it's good. The plot is amazing. Wes Ball made this movie completely end with the title of "The Maze". Even though this movie is a trilogy, this movie is worth to watch for you guys.
1.0~Kids ruining a movie... themaytz Sign in Permalink And they do it flawlessly. Naturals. Anoying. Holy crap. This movie really suck. Casting has failed completely. I'm not even sure what the movieis about. The kids always ends up being in my way.
3.0~A-maze-ingly tedious rooee Sign in Permalink Remember Vincenzo Natali's 1997 film, Cube? Bold. Mysterious. Smartly written. Knowingly silly. Imperfect but unique. Well, The Maze Runner is nothing like that, except for the imperfections. Remember, also, M Night Shyamalan's last (almost) great movie, The Village? Something of that film's central conceit is at work here – albeit emptied of any intelligence or detectable allegory or any semblance of a distinctive style. Teen Wolf's Dylan O'Brien stars as Thomas, who wakes up just as he's being deposited in an enormous prison called the Glade. He can remember nothing of his former life. Nor can the other young male denizens of the Glade, who've been ritually plonked there on a monthly basis, and have been mapping the surrounding maze ever since. Problem is, the maze keeps shifting shape, and after dark it is occupied by menacing Grievers: arachnid guardians made of guts and steel. Thomas wants to find a way to freedom, but Gally (Will Poulter) reckons they should stay put, where it's safe. Shouting ensues, while the Gladers ask endless, unanswered questions about what the Glade is, what the maze is, what the Grievers are, when the film's going to end This is the worst kind of mystery setup. A Lost-esque cloak envelopes everyone and everything, giving all the power to the filmmakers and leaving none of the fun to us. In a TV show this would hold us to the next ad break. Here, it's meant to hold our attention into the next movie (already announced), despite the fact that the first instalment barely crawls to 113 minutes. The whole concept just doesn't hold water. At least The Hunger Games has a flamboyance of design to distract us from its barely credible dystopia. But The Maze Runner is way too serious for that. Spoiler alert (although is it a spoiler when it's this predictable?): We're told that the kids are being put through some sort of Darwinian test to establish their suitability in a post-apocalyptic world. The conspiratorial nature of this boring beast means we can't take this explanation at face-value. But then, I've nothing else to go on, and I'm certainly not compelled to read the books – so let's go with what we've got, which is eye-narrowingly contrived nonsense. The script is deathly dull. It starts with a cavalcade of exposition, setting up the rules etc, and descends into mindless arguing, without ever daring to explore, say, the sexual politics of having a girl thrown into this hyper-masculine teenage mix. The amnesia thing is the oldest cheat in the screen writing book, and causes a crippling lack of character. Our hero is running on some kind of instinct but he's still basically a Nice Young Man. No moral grey areas here. The dearth of character is consistent with the video game level of narrative: Choose your player based solely on appearance (also the casting process here, it seems). Another homogenous hero, then. And sub-par performances abound. The only player to really engage is Game of Thrones' Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt; the only character to imply any kind of internal conflict. I concede that Will Poulter puts in solid work, too. But generally the cast is directed with bland efficiency. The action scenes are all bluster and no invention and the CGI is as weightless as it comes. Who said Hollywood was a world of talented hacks? I'm not sure, but I'm saying it now. It's a pity because John Paesano's score evokes John Williams – he deserved Spielberg for his work. The film drills standard YA anxieties about identity, victimhood, and entitlement; about not being 'special' (or divergent or whatever) and slipping anonymously into the crowd. Worst of all, there's absolutely no chance of getting any phone signal in the Glade. The horror! Against the classy Orwellian operatics of The Hunger Games, here's a wannabe without substance, style, or, ironically, identity.
4.0~A Bad Attempt At A Great Book dibona_d Sign in Permalink For a long time I heard "The Maze Runner" doesn't do the book justice. So, I decided to pick up the book, give it a read, and then watch the movie afterwards. The rumors are true. The movie comes so short of the book that I am surprised James Dashner hasn't ripped his eyes out. I understand the difficulties in taking a best-selling novel and turning it into a great flick. But c'mon with this load of crap. The key differences between the book and movie really take away from the story. In my opinion they ruin the story.
1.0~Terrible movie & a waste of time. (spoilers) elisio8632 Sign in Permalink This movie is terrible. The premise was interesting but executed terribly. The story had very little plot and dialogue was minimal. The characters are very cliché and excitement is non-existent throughout the film. There were also many holes in the almost non-existent plot where nothing was explained, nothing made sense. There were easier ways for the characters to escape that seemed all too obvious. For example, it would not have been hard to build a latter or even for those guys at the end to fly into the middle with the helicopter. How can anyone be so oblivious. Any one with half a brain can find easier ways to escapee. This movie was terrible and a waste of time.
9.0~Hunger Games Meets Lord of the Flies: A Solid SF-Action Film with Interesting Characters classicalsteve Sign in Permalink In most films of the SF-Action variety, there's typically good action sequences and effects at the expense of good character development and convincing acting. "The Matrix", "2012", and "Man of Steel" come to mind. Or, the reverse: the film has good characters via solid acting, but the pace can't keep up with a snail so the action sequences are comprised and the story doesn't move along at a brisk enough pace. "Interstellar", "Prometheus", and "Oblivion" are ones which come to mind in this category. Few films achieve both ends, such as "Star Wars IV and V", the original "Alien", "Blade Runner", and more recently "The Hunger Games". Amazingly (no pun intended), "Maze Runner" has a terrific balance of character and action. In fact, the whole film would have failed miserably if there weren't fine acting inside the skins of compelling and believable characters. And there has to be enough action for the audience to understand the dilemma of the characters. "Maze Runner" equalizes both quite nicely, seemingly effortlessly. Thomas, who doesn't know who he is because his memory has been wiped clean, is transported via a lift into a self-contained village within a small glade surrounded by huge walls on all sides. On one side, the walls have large doors which periodically open and close into a maze. The village-society is comprised of a few dozen males from age 12 to 27 but there are no "adults" over 30 and no females. They have structured their society such that different people engage in different tasks by day and then have ceremonial feasts and games by night. Supplies are also periodically provided through the same lift in which newcomers to the village arrive. However most of them have a sense they need to escape the glade through the maze, but not all the members have signed on to this idea. A selected group of athletic villagers are "maze runners" who explore the maze and report back to the village with their findings before the doors close towards the end of the day. However, there are two challenges to the maze. First, while its doors are closed, the maze shifts every night, and second, there are "grievers", horrid creatures which are a cross between ALIEN and former Vice President Dick Cheney, which stalk humans inside the maze. If the maze is the way out, they have to make their escape before being swallowed and/or stung by the grievers. The villagers also wonder who created the maze and why, and why are the grievers there? As the story progresses, some of the maze runner realize there are hidden clues about escaping the maze. The political structure is led by Alby, an African-American who is the wise leader of the village, and the first to arrive in the glade three years before the events of the story. Gally is a kind of second-in-command determined to take the leadership after Alby is incapacitated in the wake of having been stung by a griever. Newt is the leader of the maze runners, and Minho is one of the best runners. When Thomas, a "greenie" (a.k.a. a newcomer), becomes enthralled with exploring the maze when he's not officially a runner, Gally becomes enraged and desires the society punish Thomas and prohibit him from further running in the maze. What works well is not only the dilemma posed by the maze itself but also the power struggle between Thomas, who represents new hope in conquering the maze, and Gally, who represents the status-quo which may or may not wish to leave the village-glade. Then an unexpected "greenie" arrives to further shake up the delicate structure of the village. Overall a very satisfying and interesting film. The character conflicts and action sequences are juggled well. At every moment, the viewer is pulled into the story without a shred of insight into what will transpire next. A few unexpected twists and turns occur which in retrospect make the story work on all levels. This is the goal of most action-SF films: to keep the viewer wanting to know what will happen next without being certain what will transpire while simultaneously caring about what happens to the characters involved. Weakness on either end can result in a mediocre experience, but luckily "Maze Runner" delivers on both fronts. Well done.
8.0~Finally one to watch. kuashie Sign in Permalink Finally a movie with youngsters with some substance. I saw this movie with little expectation owing to the fact that movies with youngsters as a focus of recent memory has most of the time had dull predictable teeny soapy influences with some crappy action scenes at the end to please a few audiences. This movie doesn't waste time with those staffs, never gets dull, keeps to the thrill through out the entire duration. The effects were top notched making the action scenes fantastic. Characters were interesting to see and the overall shooting of the movie was awesome. Now, I am not saying this movie is perfect. It has its fair share of problems, however this movie really demands recommendation. For once we have a movie that's willing not to follow the clichés laid out by these teeny movies out there. With that said, I was so relieved that no big fuss was made among the boys with the arrival of the girl. Like I said before its only action business. I was asking myself many questions during during the last quarter of the movie. But at the end I realized that it was a trilogy, I think most of the questions would be answered in the subsequent series. I don't understand why some people would criticize the movie in this regard when it has been made clear that there would be a follow up. If you, like me are tired of the cliché ridden dull, soapy, teeny dramas we are being fed to of late, then you should certainly check this out, I am sure you wouldn't be disappointed.
9.0~Wow...Wow........Wow! ilovedavii Sign in Permalink I must admit, I wasn't sure what to expect going into this. I watch Teen Wolf, have seen bits of Skins and Game of Thrones, so I was familiar with a few of the actors. Dylan kills it in Teen Wolf, and showed his dramatic/intense acting abilities in season three. A lot of the actors in this movie have shown a lot of promising abilities, so I was hopeful going into it. I purposefully kept myself from reading the book because I love having surprises and tension when I see a movie for the first time. And man, am I glad I did. This movie is so much better when you learn everything alongside Thomas. There is no bullshit romance, which I appreciate. They stayed focused on what was happening, and did it right. There was a great balance of tension. There would be an incredibly intense and stressful scene, but not too much of it and not too little. And the stressful scenes were done right. They didn't shy away from having characters die, showing some violence and a little gore. The entire situation and many scenes were so shockingly dark, which was also oddly refreshing. They focused on the relationships between the characters, the action/mystery, and not to mention that the affects were great. The maze, the grievers, I loved it all. Considering how small the budget was, and how little time they had to shoot it, it all comes together surprisingly well. Usually I dislike the main character. They are too whiny, too needy, too much focus on them, and other characters don't get the attention they deserve. However, I actually liked Thomas a lot. I tried my best to put my love for Dylan O'Brien aside, but I can't help but be so extremely proud and happy for him. He managed to portray this main character in a way that draws the audience him. Thomas takes a little while to get settled in (understandably) but once he does, he is awesome. He portrayed really great leadership qualities; for once, I actually felt that this character deserved the "leadership" and really earned it. There were quite a few heavy scenes, and he pulled them off with conviction and genuine emotions that made my throat swell and my eyes water. Will Poulter also was amazing. Basically everyone was amazing. There are definitely mixed reviews, and I find it such a shame. Seeing as The Hunger Games was released first, every YA adaptation is now immediately compared to it and seen as a "wannabe." But watching Maze Runner, it is definitely it's own film. Of course there are book fans who may be disappointed in changes that were made, but if they had stuck to the book 100%, there would be even more complaints about the "repeated YA clichés". It must have been so hard to try to create a movie, and balance it between it's YA components and also trying to make it different at the same time. I appreciate the work they did, and while there are plenty of clichés in the book, somehow they are pulled off in a very refreshing way. I would suggest that in order to really enjoy this film, don't go into it thinking "Great, another YA adaptation." Just go into it thinking of it as it's own movie, like any other movie you go see at the theaters. Go into it and just enjoy the ride. Above all else, this movie is an amazing adventure/thrilling story. The pacing, the claustrophobia of it all, the acting, the affects, it's all pulled off in a very surprisingly entertaining way. Go watch it, if you are willing, go see it in IMAX! I definitely wish I had seen it in IMAX the first time because it is one of those films that would be worth it. Overall, there are definitely some weaknesses to the movie that critics will be all over, but the strengths definitely override them and make it a movie worth seeing.
3.0~This is a bad movie, undeservedly marked as a blockbuster. goran-s1492 Sign in Permalink This is my first review on movies, I'm sorry that isn't good review. After watching this movie I needed to write something. The Maze Runner is a very bad movie, poor acting, trying to capture poignant moments fail, logic is for director unknown concept. Please don't make a sequel. You should try spend more money on actors, writers and less on the commercial, but you make your goal, that is you make money, but dishonestly. I'm sorry that i watched this movie. Best regards to all movie fans. Tito
9.0~Brilliant daglish-21-244489 Sign in Permalink I was worried to say the least, after seeing all the bad reviews for the film. So I went into the cinema not expecting a lot if anything as most other reviews are 4's and 3's. Once the film started I was getting into learning about the characters etc. After about 30 minutes the film begins properly and after this point I was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the film. Coming to the end I found it a bit predictable not expecting to be surprised by a sudden plot twist. Overall this is a great movie for all ages and would recommended to anyone.
6.0~Mediocre -- adds worst part of series and leaves out much of book garretsr Sign in Permalink If you read the book, prepare for disappointment. Although more complete that the book, the movie is mediocre. It omits the most interesting elements of the Maze Runner, while adding the worst elements from the sequels (The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure). At the heart of the book is solving the puzzle of getting out of the maze, which that has eluded the runners for years. That should be the heart of the movie. Instead, the audience discovers that the maze could never have been solved, and but for the fortuitous discover and use of a device the maze would not be solved and everybody would die. Deus ex machine is a bad plot solution, but "Machine" ex machine would make ancient Greek theatergoers cringe. The movie also discards any attempt to develop relationships between the kids. In the movie, the entire plot is explicitly and inexplicably compressed to three days. This means that any attempt to portray Thomas as being anything but the new outsider fall flat. It's a movie, we don't have to see every day, just let us know that time has passed.] The grievers and the conflict over Ben's sting are nonsensical in the movie. E.g., in the movie nobody has ever survived a night in the maze, the grievers only come out at night when the maze is closed so nobody has ever seen one, the grievers are what sting people (no beetle- blades) but the surprising thing about Ben's sting was that it was "in broad daylight," not that he's dying something had stung him. The screenplay's attempt to give more of an explanation at the end of the movie is understandable, but horribly executed. While the book version ended with little explanation of "why" the kids were in the maze, a movie that left that out would be doomed. However, when one of the biggest criticisms of the sequels is that the author couldn't come up with a decent explanation, then that's the element you should change or explain in the movie! Not these writers, they make the explanation even less believable and more disappointing than the book. At least with the Matrix, the Coppertop explanation was fun to watch (and generated millions in product placement revenue).
4.0~Recycled Garbage geekster-6 Sign in Permalink Maze Runner borrows all its beats from other films. There's nothing original here. This is an obvious ploy to take us for a ride and this recycled crap is what is wrong with Hollywood. This movie is weak in all areas that make a movie classic, but strong in all areas that churn box office tickets; this is all visual. We were rooting for these characters to die, and hoping for each turn that this would turn into an amazing slasher flick like Cabin in the Woods... but we were disappointed. Harry Potter meets Hunger Games meets The Lord of the Rings meets every other film made with teenagers. They had a Piggy character from the Lord of the Flies novel, but he wasn't picked on. The main character is a cardboard version of Taylor Lautner's Jacob, and the female lead isn't really even in the movie. She does absolutely nothing except give one of the boys a chance to say, "girls are weird". I realized after the movie that the girl in this movie is Kaya Scodelario or Effy from Skins. Kaya can act -- she is insanely good -- and they barely gave her any lines or anything to work with. We don't know who this character is at all by the end. She might as well stayed in the basement. Three years these young men are stuck together. There is no homosexuality, no masturbation or jokes about masturbation (come on man these are teens -- there would be SOMETHING), no attacks on the first girl to show up in a few years. Nobody even hits on her. Nothing at all. We are simply expected to throw human nature out the window. The set for this shitty film is a Hollywood Sandbox surrounded by a death trap. Snoooooze. The death trap is not particularly interesting. The big baddies that patrol the deathtrap never once decide to scale the walls... because they are machines programmed to serve a purpose. What purpose? We do not know because Hollywood prefers not to reveal that. They haven't decided yet. There is no background, no huge reveal as to why these teens are in the situation they were in, and we are left in the dark at the end of the film. But that's not even the biggest issue here. Nobody who made this film really thought very hard about the serious flaws. None of the boys scale the walls to map the maze from the middle? From up there you can see the whole maze. This is just unintelligent mediocrity with some pacing and action but it's not even that good unless you try to watch it as a comedy, which is what we did. You leave wondering what this was even about. Then you realize it was about making money for Hollywood via shitty CGI.
4.0~A promising plot which later becomes forgetful Nitesh_Singh Sign in Permalink This movie seems to have taken some inspiration from The Cabin In the Woods. As the movie ends, it feels as horrible as The Cabin In the Woods, though it is not that gore. As one can remember Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, there is a maze which is made of mechanical parts and machine animals, designed to test the survival fitness of test subjects, which are teen-aged boys. Initially the concept of the movie feels refreshingly new with all the adventure, politics and discoveries inside the maze. The references of various characters towards the protagonist that he is one of the villains opens up the cards early. Yet towards the end the movie gives you yawns and boring stuff revealing the truth about maze. It is watchable but forgetful.
8.0~Don't take it personally. shanitajohn Sign in Permalink Yikes. Some of these reviews make it sound like the movie personally came to each of their homes and assaulted the reviewer themselves. Jeez. Let up people. I'm only reviewing this to help maybe nudge the rating to a solid 7. I found this movie quite enjoyable. Lots of suspense. Confusing at times. And more tense than the Hunger Games, I thought. And the acting wasn't bad. I thought the lead was quite good, though at first I mistook him for Logan Lerman, which may have increased my positive associations. Anyway, give it a watch. I feel like a healthy critique would put it between a 6 and an 9. Sheesh. Breathe, people.
6.0~Wicked is good nogodnomasters Sign in Permalink A boy named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) finds himself in an all boy Lord of the Flies type of camp. They are surrounded by a huge wall that opens into a maze. Two runners, run the maze by day and must leave by night or else the "Grievers", a giant spider like creature will hunt them. Thomas is not satisfied with the status quo and makes waves. Eventually a girl (Kaya Scodelario) shows up. If you are a teen or tween and like all those kids save the world offerings, this one falls in line. The film is done well enough to hold your interest as the Maze creates a mystery for our human lab rats. The ending tells you why it was done, which still didn't make any sense...and why all guys, or why only one girl? It leads to a sequel. The acting was bland. The dialogue needed zip and Gally (Will Poulter) was a boring antagonist. Good enough for the kids who won't know the difference. Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.
10.0~Happened to run into this great movie! stxphaniew Sign in Permalink Your legs carry you through life and they also carry you through the most toughest, most exhilarating moments in your life. The main character, Thomas, of the Maze Runner had to experience just this. Being an American dystopian, science fiction film, it is filled with action and thrilling moments. Directed by Wes Ball, the Maze Runner was his directorial debut. The movie was based on the 2009 novel, the Maze Runner, written by American author James Dashner. Following the storyline, the movie depicts the book on the big screen making it come alive. Released on September 19, 2014, the film topped the box-office with a $32.5 million debut and also earned over $348 million worldwide. For a movie that only had a budget of $34 million, their profit definitely showed it up. While the Maze Runner ended with a victory for (some of) the Gladers, their story did not end there. Continuing from the first film, a sequel called Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials was released one year later to continue the adventures of the teens. Later on after the second film, a third and the final film was released three years after the other sequel. Known as Maze Runner: The Death Cure, this would come to be the final film in the Maze Runner series. Although the Maze Runner is derived from a book, it is a movie that is worth watching because of its compelling visuals, action packed plot, and unexpected twists that keeps the audience on their toes. Starting the movie off, the main character finds himself on this mysterious lift, with it clear that he had no clue what his name was. After arriving, he finds other boys that went through the same thing he had just experienced. He learns that he has been delivered to the middle of a constantly changing, intricate labyrinth. He also finds out a crucial information about how no one has ever survived a night in the Maze. He regains knowledge of his name and also learns about there is a set group of boys named the Runners that search the Maze everyday for an escape route. The following day, Thomas was attacked by a "Runner" which turns out had been stung by a creature from the Maze called a Griever. The Runner that got stung was forced to enter the maze to be left to die as there is no current cure for his condition. Every night the Maze closes and every morning the Maze reopens. The following day, Alby, the group leader, and Minho, the lead Runner, enter the Maze to trace the Runners steps. After spending the whole day inside the maze, the group is worried for the two as the Maze is getting close to closing for the night. The Maze starts closing and at that second Minho reappears dragging a stung Alby. It is shown as the two will not make it in time to get out of the Maze. Thomas springs into action and runs into the Maze to help but with no avail, all three of them are trapped. While it is said that no one survives the maze, Thomas is the one to prove that saying wrong. The trio manages to survive the night and return the next morning, shocking everyone. After being upgraded to a Runner, Thomas strives to find an escape route for everyone. This movie is worth watching due to the fantastic characters that were so well depicted by the actors. My personal favorites are Thomas and Minho, played by Dylan O'Brien and Ki Hong Lee. They acted out the emotions of the characters really well, especially the part I just mentioned of them being trapped in the Maze for a night. Ki Hong Lee had a look of utter hopelessness and panic while Thomas was the one to really make sure that they had the chance to make it out alive, he had a look of determination. Just watching the whole situation get solved out is worth watching in itself. The movie definitely keeps you on your toes making you want to find out what is going to happen next and if they will ever make it out of the labyrinth. Speaking about the labyrinth, while it is supposedly scary, it really exudes a beautifully haunting aura. Not only that but the movie has some very compelling visuals. Especially at the end where they showed us a bird's eye view of the whole labyrinth, the visuals were so detailed and breathtaking. These are just one of the many factors on why you should give the Maze Runner a try. While there are many negative opinions on this film, I believe some of these arguments are not valid. One person argued that the movie was horribly boring. As someone who personally has the urge to skip sections of films, I personally did not have a moment where I wanted to fast forward. While the movie is not always packed with action 24/7, the movie does contain enough suspenseful moments that keeps the audience on their feet. For example, the part where Thomas (the main character) is trying to escape a Griever that was out to kill him. I mean watching someone trying to escape death can't possibly be boring. Another person critiqued the movie not being suitable for anyone over the age of 10. However, this argument definitely contradicts the fact that the movie is PG-13. I mean, I do not think a normal 10 year old kid (or younger) would like to watch violence and something that is classified as a thriller. I would also believe they would not get the plot as it gets pretty complicated towards the end. Now you must be wondering why I am writing a review on a movie that came out years ago. Well while I was on the plane back to Honolulu from my trip, I obviously wanted to take advantage of the free movies available on the flight. With that in mind, I got all settled with my blanket, jacket, and neck pillow to keep me warm and pulled out my cheap earphones I got in from my trip (that worked way better than the complimentary ones the flight gave out to everyone). While flipping through all the movie selections, I just so happened to run into the movie Maze Runner.(Not a pun I swear) After remembering all the hype people gave the film when it first came out, it convinced me to give it a try. My first reaction was, "Wow, this is some hunger game movie" when I saw the main character trapped in a mysterious elevator. Like those dystopian style movies, the movie Maze Runner is very high in action, suspense, and unexpected twists. Luckily for me, I enjoyed those types of movies. As Dylan O'Brien emerged from the light, the look of panic surprised me and quickly got me intrigued to what was to happen next. He struggled to find a way out but quickly gave up after realizing that he had no way to go. When he finally arrived at his destination, the Glade, he would come to be one of the most important boys in that community. This definitely interested me and had me wondering how the newcomer would come to finding the solution to the issue everyone had been trying to solve for years. While there seems to be a lot of critical reviews on this movie, one should definitely give it a try despite these negative critics. You never know unless you try! With the actors' compelling emotions, shocking plot twists, and visuals, this movie definitely is worth a try. Legs are an essential to life, this movie definitely shows how legs carry you the most exhilarating moments of your life. In conclusion, the Maze Runner is definitely a movie that is worth watching because of its compelling visuals, action packed plot, and unexpected twists.
8.0~"Get Ready to feel the Intensity!" T-Dawg210 Sign in Permalink The lights shine down as Thomas (Dylan O' Brien), a teenager arrives into the grassy, pastoral area known as the "Glade." Within the "Glade," there are others waiting for his arrival, yet no one knows where they are, who they are and how they got there. Hence, they join forces with other "runners" for a shot at escape. These days, we see many famous novels being made into a movie. Director Wes Ball did an "a-maz-ing" (pun intended) job of vividly presenting the plot! The movie indeed captivates the audience with numerous exhilarating scenes. Sci- Fi/Thriller fans should not miss their chance to check this movie out! 80.5/100
2.0~Opinion of an-original-story-of "The Maze Runner"-lover anam_rotariu Sign in Permalink I am truly disappointed. Beside the book, the movie is just a continuous, fast-forward dynamic escape from the maze. The story between Thomas and Teresa (especially the telepathic conversations), the friendship between Thomas and Chuck and the conflict between Thomas and Gally are not exploited even at minimum. In other words, the movie seems like it doesn't give you time to fall in love or to truly hate some characters or couples. Without those, you can't visualize the perspective of the author about the life in the maze. Even the exploring was made fast- forward. In the book you get a bigger picture of what the maze was, you travel with Thomas, you understand the maze.. Without those, the movie is just a typical post-apocalyptic experiment made on a selected group of people. I am kind of scared of what the next movie brings; maybe it will destroy even more the original story...
1.0~Not just dumb, super dumb pm_unnikrishnan Sign in Permalink This is terrible. Giant plot holes. This movie was dumbed down to a ridiculous level. They could've easily got out by climbing the walls. Hell, they have a lot of bamboo sticks with them. Build a f****** ladder or something with it. What would a bunch of teenagers do when they see girl after a long time? Don't even think of wooing her or being her friend right? I could go on for ever and ever about how bad this movie is. Go watch honest trailers and everything wrong with maze runner in youtube. That would give you everything wrong with this garbage. God, this movie is such a dumb movie. By the end I was not even caring about how they would be getting out. I don't care about the sequels............
6.0~Cube for kids BA_Harrison Sign in Permalink My immediate thought while watching The Maze Runner was just how close the whole premise was to Vincent Natali's sci-fi horror Cube (1997), both films featuring a group of people who wake to find themselves in a strange environment with no memory of how they got there. The big difference is that, where Cube was a brilliantly executed low-budget thriller with nail-biting tension and a thought provoking ambiguous climax, The Maze Runner is a mega-budget blockbuster that, for much of its running time, moves like molasses, and which ends leaving questions that we know will be answered, just so long as we shell out more cash to see the next couple of instalments. Obviously, at 47 I'm not exactly in the intended demographic for this film, but I do feel that this one missed the opportunity to be a hugely entertaining adventure for all ages. When the characters are in the maze, running for their lives from the grievers (metallic insectoid monsters), or dodging the changing architecture, the film is actually very enjoyable, but far too much time is spent in the relative safety of 'the glade', the idyllic green area at the centre of the maze where the boys first wake up. With my son currently reading the series of books, it's almost certain that I'll have to watch the sequels; I just hope that they make it a little more exciting next time around (and don't cut the film to reduce the UK rating to a 12 certificate. Grrrrrr!). 5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.
9.0~"If you ain't scared ......... you ain't human" annaburlaienko Sign in Permalink The "Maze runner" is a 2014 American science fiction and action film directed by Wes Ball. This film based on James Dashners novel. The plot is incredibly interesting. The film is about a group of teenagers that got stuck in a maze full of different creatures and with the walls that were opening in the morning and closing in the evening. And young people needed to fing the way to exit that dangerous trap. The main idea is never give up and stop trying, in the end you will achive your aim. The actors was good and their characters too. I also think that make-up artists made a good job, bc actors were looking exactly how they needed to look. What's more, special effects and music are not bad at all. Another advantages are little details, they are properly made. So I can absolutely recommend you to watch "Maze runner", hope you will enjoy it.
7.0~Good Scares, Suspense and Performances mb1456 Sign in Permalink I like this movie not for its story but for the brilliant suspense, scare thrills, sound effects and the performances. The horror doesn't go overboard either and takes its time to grow on you and gets relentless only towards the final scenes deep inside the maze. The cast is good too especially few of the boys from the maze like Dylan O'Brien, Aml Ameen, Ki Hong Lee, Blake Cooper, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Will Poulter(very good as Gally the bully :)). Even the end was quite unpredictable. What I don't really get is the story. The people who built the maze intended something(revealed in the end) from it which didn't convince me well - all that complication just to find out a.......(spoilers) - which is why I'm not keen to watch out for any sequel that follow as hinted by a major character in the climax. Yet don't let a bunch of very young actors & a maze make you underestimate this movie. It engages you all the way and is watchable with family too.
8.0~Maze Runner is an action film realized by Wess Ball. marielarouche3 Sign in Permalink This is based on a book. Thomas awakens into an elevator. He cant' remember about anything, even his name. When the lift stops, he discovers the Gladers, a group of young men. They created and organized a new society despite of being trapped into a field surrounded by the walls of the maze. Only runners can go inside but everything will change with Thomas... I think it's a great movie. They did a good cast. The young people can see their favorite actors as Dylan O'Brien who used to play in teen wolf, Thomas Sangster in Nannie McPhee and so on. The special effects are amazing. But according to me, its misses something in the plot. I wanted to know more about their society. And the action in the film comes very fast, Thomas has been there for one day and everything changes... But I can't wait for the Scorch Trials. (for English class)
8.0~Interesting Film Vincentboo Sign in Permalink Had this film for a couple of months before i eventually watched it. I don't know what it was maybe the reviews or just the description led me to believe it was just more dystopian fiction. Don't get me wrong I quite like this genre Hunger games is a big favourite but i just got the impression this would be a bad copy but how wrong i was it was excellent. The start was a little slow but once the Maze became came into play it got exciting. Very brave to start with no main female characters but even that panned out quite well. All the action scenes in and out of the dome were believable and the acting for such a young team was impressive. It had a real feel of 100 about it which was interesting. The ending left you wanting more. Will defo see the sequel
9.0~Quite fun and exciting roadrunnerz45 Sign in Permalink I really did like this movie. Kind of reminded me of Lord of the Flies. Bunch of Young guys stuck between 4 walls with their memory wiped and that is their life as once a month something or someone appears from the underground. To keep them sane there is a maze that opens and shuts once a day in the hope of leading them out. The lead character is curious and starts to make things exciting by not just following the pack. The result is a great ride of young minds who are basically lab rats and at the end you really do feel sorry for them. With this sort of out of this world movie the ending tends to really stuff it up by being just insane or ridiculous. I thought it was good enough to say it was a great movie.
8.0~A-mazing xamtaro Sign in Permalink His name is Thomas. That is all he knows. He has been sent via the mysterious "box" into a contained colony of boys called "the glade". Nobody knows why they are there, only that they cannot leave. Around the glade lies the maze where only the fastest and bravest among them, dubbed "maze runners", get to explore in the hopes of finding a way out. Thomas' arrival causes a schism among the boys and strange incidents start happening one after the other. As the perfect peaceful society of the Glade is slowly torn asunder, Thomas must unravel the secrets of the maze and confront the horrors within. Secrets, half-truths, and a sense that all is not what it seems. I have always loved a good sci if mystery. Our premise of a community of male teens isolated from the world is a premise many would be familiar with. The group rivalries, the competition for alpha male status, the unique lifestyle and forms of punishment; MAZE RUNNER takes advantage of its slow moving first half to build that world of lost boys. All the while, the constant mystery of the maze lingers. And just when things start to wind down, the writers throw more surprises into the mix which give the film a much needed sense of urgency. What are these surprises? No spoilers now. But rest assured, this movie has great pacing. MAZE RUNNER is how I always imagined a gritty blockbuster movie would look based on those printed mazes in activity books we used to trace with crayons when we were kids. The maze itself is marvelously designed, oozing with a sense of dread. The ominous walls combines an ancient monolithic look with pieces of worn out future tech peeking out the corners; just enough to give this uneasy sense of that something is not quite right. Couple all that with some truly spine chilling sound effects and the movie starts to cross into horror territory. It is to mazes kind of like what they did to a simple board game called Battleship. Unlike the battleship movie, MAZE RUNNER gives us some well rounded characters with believable motives and decent development. Yes you have some clichéd stereotypes in the benevolent but status quo upholding leader, the hot headed "warrior chief" alpha male edging for a fight, the conflicted second in command, and an adorable sidekick for the main character. Yet it is this sense of familiarity with the character archetypes and the isolated single gender community setting that let's one ease into the story without being alienated by the already alienating premise. Amazing as the movie is, MAZE RUNNER is not without some flaws. Main character Thomas suffers from the typical designated hero syndrome. He is not a kid who earns his heroism or the respect of the group. From the get go, everything important revolves around him, he is able to do startling things that no one else can. You know he is special and the plot does not hide that or let it develop naturally. Director Wes Ball crafts a decently paced narrative with top notch special effects, but the visuals tend to be marred by his obsession with out of focus shaky cameras in action scenes. Perhaps the biggest misstep is some poorly placed flashbacks that could have completely ruined the mystery element for audiences familiar with certain video games (hint: Portal). I admit to not having read the original book so I would not know how close it is to the source material. On its own, MAZE RUNNER is The grandchild of LORD OF THE FLIES and TV's LOST. It combines tried and true story beats sieved through an intriguing premise and a decent mystery (despite being almost undone by the ill advised flashbacks). It avoids many mistakes other adaptations of young adult novels make, like lingering on romance subplots, and leaves a decent sequel hook that leaves you wanting more.
7.0~Lost meets Hunger Games in this gripping YA adaptation ahassan-12342 Sign in Permalink In the trail of the success of the Hunger Games franchise, here is another screenplay adaptation of a young adult novel set in a dystopian future. Here, our protagonist Thomas finds himself in a pre-industrial community called The Glade with no memory of a time prior to finding himself there. The Glade's population consists of teenage boys just like him who have no idea of their identity or why they have been put there. Escape appears impossible though as the field is surrounded by mazes where huge creepy-crawlies lurk. The esoteric tone of the film- characters not understanding how or why there are there- as well as the obstacles which prevent them from escaping borrow hugely from Lost. Character arcs follow similar trajectories too with some desperate to leave and others less so. Themes similar as Lost's The Dharma Initiative- a mysterious organisation that loves to stick its logo on things- are utilised heavily as well. The film retains viewers' interest throughout as you wait for The Glade to give up some of its secrets. Will Poulter in particular is great playing a character that the closest thing this film has to a villain. It certainly does not have the political depth of the Hunger Games which made that series stand out though this is only the first film. That said, it does an amenable job holding your interest and at least giving its sequel a chance.
4.0~A Slow, Misdirected Sci-Fi That Fails to Emphasize its Strengths drqshadow-reviews Sign in Permalink A tribe of young men seek answers in a mysterious, synthetic environment. I enjoyed the setup, and the blunt ground rules of the world itself (we're surrounded by a giant labyrinth that seals itself and shifts mechanically every sundown - don't get caught inside when it does), but the cast is perilously dry and boring, so naturally we spend way too much time getting to know them. Dylan O'Brien is particularly bad as Thomas, a savior who pushes the complacent society to break out of their strongholds and pursue a method of escape. His is a special kind of anti-charisma, blank and wooden and static... stupid handsome, like an underwear model. Occasional jaunts into the maze itself are the real draw of this film, and clearly the most entertaining bits, but they're bafflingly few and far between. Why revel in the atmosphere when instead you could be setting up sequels with a set of fatally-flawed characters, I guess? Not that the plot is all that competent, either. Think too hard and you'll surely slip into one of the broad holes scattering its landscape. It's a middling effort in every sense of the word. Outside of the maze itself, which is a nice (if brief) breath of clear air, the rest of this film's concepts and ideas have already been done many times before, by more complete rivals. Even the CG-heavy monsters don't trigger a reaction - I think I recognized them from the lower levels of hell in Doom 2, circa 1994
10.0~Transixed!! :D fresh-mn2017 Sign in Permalink O.m.g! Normally, I am a total bitch about movies not staying 100% true to the book, (i.e. The Hunger Games) but The Maze Runner totally pulled it off!!! A few situations were changed from the original context of the book and made less complicated, but it was amazing!!! The changes were subtle but totally made the film more awesome! This was an absolute award- worthy group of actors that blew my mind. "Thomas", "Alby", "Chuck", and "Gally" (not a big fan of "Teresa") made the ideal dream team of actors! Wow, wow, wow! That's all I can say about this movie. A definite must-see!!! TEN STARS! TEN STARS ALL THE WAY!!! !:D!
4.0~Completely Forgettable and Rehashed nboyer17 Sign in Permalink I went into this film with low expectations. Having never read any of James Dashner's books, I cannot tell with any certainty if the screenwriters were true to the novel, or if the book makes a better effort than the film to distinguish itself from the multitude of superior films it meekly attempts to imitate. What I know is that I left the theater laughing. And not in a good way. What should have been an exciting and visceral tale of survival and intrigue ended up stealing two hours of my life by conning me into thinking I would see something original. Instead of suspense and excitement, MAZE RUNNER laid out an entourage of familiar tropes, paper-thin characters, and contrived situations. The 'villainous' antagonist of the film was as one-dimensional and irrationally-plot serving as any character I've ever seen. The character was so silly and unbelievable I actually chuckled at him several times when the film begged me to be serious. The screenplay was a crash-course in heavy-handed exposition. It was jammed with stock lines: bland, insinuating lines that were supposed to put me on the edge of my seat but instead left me thinking, 'Okay, when are we going to get to the POINT of this movie?' We got to see the intimidating-jerk-who-doesn't-listen-to-reason character, the hardened-guy-who-will-later-be-reduced-to-a-weak-state-to-show-us how-shaken-up-the-best-of-us-can-get character, the arbitrary female (although, thankfully, fewer movies today are marginalizing women), the amnesiac/s, and the innocent-character-we-can-get-away-with-killing. The pacing of the film, if not the events, were completely predictable and the ending (which I came to the theater curious for in the first place) came off as stale and forced, like the rest of the ponderous placeholder scenes that served as a plot. If you've seen movies such as HUNGER GAMES, CABIN IN THE WOODS, or PANDORUM, you have already witnessed better characters, better reveals, and more assured examples of plot development. Hollywood has developed a very convenient formula to keep theaters full of impressionable teen audiences. We have an outsider who needs to find a part of the group to cling to. They meet a variety of similar sympathetic characters. They act impulsively, which is usually a good thing. They are almost always rebellious and independent by nature, but they need to avoid arousing the wrath of whatever all-powerful conglomerate is hell-bent on keeping them down. Until, of course, the time comes to overthrow them using the various talents that the group possesses. Along with a healthy dose of courage, resolve... and luck. Buckets of ludicrous, gratuitous, convenient, plot-serving luck. There is no reason that this film should have made the money it has. After six days, it has recouped its budget threefold. Every ticket you buy gives them more ammunition for a brain-numbing cookie-cutter sequel. I'm not saying the film is the worst I've ever seen. But for God's sake, we don't need any more movies like this. Here's to a better future.
6.0~Complete disappointment smbunexpected Sign in Permalink One of the dumbest movies I've seen. Full of clichés and silly crowd-pleaser tricks. Decent trailer somehow intrigued me, so I came to the cinema with high expectations. So please forgive my skepticism, when instead of clever si-fy I've been given a predictable, annoyingly simple "boys will be boys" film. We left in the middle, but according to those who stayed, the part we've missed was equally artless. To be completely fair, I must admit this wide-audience flytrap does include alarming sounds, dozen of stupid questions, fights based on misunderstanding and beautiful Kaya Scodelario. If you're looking for that or want to give your brain a rest - go for it.
4.0~Too contradictory and illogical bestcriteria Sign in Permalink The movie is watchable and perhaps entertaining, but my wife did not like it at all. We both like thrillers, but this one was questionable at best as such. Problems: A large group of teenage boys, on their own with no adult direction or counseling, and they all seem to get along well? Ha! I was in an orphanage where we were over 20 boys about the same age as in the movie, and I can tell you that the movie's portrayal is not realistic. These boys are at the prime age when sex is practically the most important thing in their lives, there are no girls around, and everything is OK? Finally, when a girl shows up, none of the boys has any desire for her? Ha! And in spite of all this, some of the boys in the beginning appear to be fine with the notion of not trying to escape? The filming of the boys fighting with the monster is poorly done and the audience cannot tell what is happening. All the scenes are very up close, short duration, and definitely nothing but confusing. Contradictions (maybe mild spoilers?) The boys have managed to create a detailed model of the maze. Yet, at the beginning of the movie we are told that the maze changes daily, and based on the changes we see happen, there is no way that a model could be made. If the designated boys would be capable of 'mapping' a portion of the maze each day, by the time they mapped another portion the following day, the previous day's rendition would likely already be obsolete. The monster evidently is man-made, and its legs, stingers, and so on appear to be made of steel. Yet, the boys can hurt and even defeat the monsters with crude wooden spears.
7.0~Intense xsophietaylorx Sign in Permalink without trying to write a spoiler this film really was intense and I found myself sitting on my end of the chair in the pictures actually biting my lip in fear. It really did have you on the edge certain bits were so intense I found myself shutting my eyes too scared too see what happened! The film was good & the ending was sort of not what I expected but like a cliffhanger there will definitely be a sequel. I thought the ending would be jaw dropping shocking but it wasn't it was more you need to find out more too get the full off effect. All though the film was really OK I felt it dragged in certain bits. The characters were all likable and believable especially Thomas the main character his acting was so good. Over all I think this film is a good watch and is worth going to see in the cinema (if it's still out) if not buying it on DVD definitely wouldn't be a waste of time.
7.0~Not as many plot holes as you think when you think about it. tamannda Sign in Permalink Some comments on the viewer's comments about the flaws of this video: sie_aris: As to building a ladder on the outside I believe the premise is that if they are late they cannot make it to the door in time anyways before the grievers reach them. So even if they reach the door they will probably have been stung and aren't safe to return. It seems like they only got stuck at the door as it closing was one time. Digging a hole would be very bad because the doors closing were the only thing keeping the grievers inside at night and keeping them safe. About no violence I would say that it is how they were introduced into the maze. They were put in there one by one. They probably lost several people over the first few months to fights and trying to structure their society until they learned to cohabitate and survive. There's no other food and they don't get supplies so farming is the best way to get food. As others joined this already pre-structured society they find a place to fit in or flee into the maze and die. It's that or take on 20 boys who are working together. Would there be fights in the group sure but we were only there for less than a week. They would have their groups of people they are friendly with, that doesn't mean they are all friends. Even in that short time we saw how divided the group could be with Gally and Thomas. Thomas chose to go into the maze because he couldn't stand watching them die anymore. He says this himself during the movie. While he had thought the way out was through the 7th area he wasn't sure. They clearly stated also that they found the griever's home. That was possibly all it was so his memories did provide a bit of support there. Also because of his late introduction to his memories it's clear that they are going to play more of a role in the sequel. The maze has 8 different patterns in three years it wouldn't be impossible to make a map of it when you know which pattern you are on. I'll agree I didn't catch why Alby was going into the maze with Minho. Ben attacked Thomas when he got stung, no one knew it was bringing back memories from before they just thought it was making them delusional. When Alby got stung they saved him because he was their leader, they ran their community based on his choices they didn't exactly have a backup leader in place so yes they were hoping they could save him. As for haircuts who the heck wants to watch a bunch of unattractive actors running around. Realistic haircuts no but better view aesthetics yes. Why no one said anything or did anything toward the girl: These are brainwashed boys. They have been since even before the memory wipe in the maze. They weren't exposed to sexual ideas at all growing up or have any memory of it. While that doesn't mean they don't have hormones they have no one to turn to about what the feelings mean even if they arise. Then the girl is only there for a few days most of which she is either a) unconscious or b) running around fighting, not much time to address hormones responses. I could go on with your comments, but only one last one about the wall and people's curiosity. When shown what happens with people inside the maze and how they die/never come back/suffer immense pain from being stung I think I would chose to take up gardening in the middle as well. Eva Comaroski: The science fiction genre is a dealing with the impact of imagined innovations in science or technology, often in a futuristic setting. Well, it's in the future, and there are human-made monsters, genetic testing, and such so I would say that involves science and technology so yep it fits in the genre. Does it really fit in with big names in that field in other cinematic works, maybe not as much but the categorization is still right. bestcriteria: Some of this was answered above but adding in: Not trying to escape yes this is psychologically documented that those who have been trapped, emotionally or physically may choose to remain inside the cage. Think of relationships where someone is getting abused: You think why don't you just leave? But they won't, and they will give you a 1001 reasons why not. Same principle. Overall is the plot a bit vague and the characters not really flushed out yes: Is there nearly as many plot holes as people are trying to poke in it? Maybe not. This is a story that was written for a 15-year-old audience and then turned into a cinematic performance. Is it going to have insanely deep plot, psychological meaning, and originality no not really. For the audience this was created for, it is a decently well-done work. I would have liked to see deeper character development and a bit more plot line than just trying to set up the stage of where they are at. We do need to understand about their world what's in it and how it works, but when you have a narrator who knows nothing about where he is either there is some explaining that has to happen. I would say while it is not the best done work it did keep me entertained enough to see it through to the end. Would it have been worth going to the movie theater for, maybe not, but I don't regret renting it from red box either for a night in.
5.0~Kids may find it exciting and new. Over-35's will find it worn out and tiresome bopdog Sign in Permalink Didn't read the books. I did read The Hunger Games, and enjoyed books and movies. This one had its great moments, but overall fell a little flat for me - but I think that's an age issue. A generational problem. Not that I am too old to appreciate rebellion and questioning authority, but rather because I've seen all the "Maze" tropes a hundred times before. Recycling old tropes isn't a bad thing, nor am I implying it's some kind of art crime! Rather, I am just noting that anyone over 35 may find it a bit old hat and even tired by now??? I'd have to add books to the list of "The Maze" forerunners - Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," Michael Creighton books, and others I can't recall now. And all the "Mad Max" movies - "Logan's Run," "Lathe of Heaven," and of course "Lord of the Flies." Even 1990's fare such as "Water World" and "The Postman" echo a bit here. And other movies I can't remember. Add the iconoclastic vibe, taking down The Man and The Establishment, and unethical experimentation and manipulation by The-Powers-That-Be, and you might already be wearied of "The Maze" before you even get to the cinema. In some ways "The Maze" has a trick ending, and relies too much of corny plot twists - "Surprise!" wears thin. I could imagine that once someone knew the trick ending, the movie would be unwatchable. It would be way too silly, way too tedious and dull. Virtually unendurable to sit through. That's never a good sign for a movie. Katniss - she still holds interest, together with the whole Panem bunch for me!!! So I am not "anti" anything. I just want a newer, fresher approach is all. If you're young - and this is your first exposure to these themes - go see "The Maze" and go nuts and enjoy yourself! If you're a grown-up - don't expect anything new or fresh, or startling. It just isn't there.
4.0~It's called the Maze Runner for goodness sakes! urthpainter Sign in Permalink Begin with the title - The Maze Runner... There is not enough running, not enough of the maze, and even when it gets there: the maze running isn't that good. What is good? The acting surprisingly! Which means the directing isn't that bad. All characters really sell their respective parts, and the casting could be much worse. But the script is terrible. As interesting as the opening is, and it is only kinda intriguing, the story unfolds in a series of predictable and cliché turns... until the end. The conclusion includes the impossible, as in an actual impossible encounter (anyone else notice?)... then an open ending that (as far as I can tell) is not foreshadowed in any meaningful way. While not overly violent - there is an astonishing amount of death, but almost none of it carries any weight, except when the cliché death must occur... and it is predictably not a very good moment in the film. I only recommend this film to media addicts like myself, who will get something from this movie - fresh faced youngsters giving it their all. With a better pen and typewriter this could have been a solid film, but it is only slightly better than trash - and it's current rating around 7 is not earned - it is stolen by use of pandering to the masses.
3.0~Simply Overrated Movie amit-166-185937 Sign in Permalink well, I can guess it was running quite well however, end of the movie was kind of weird . some questions were left unanswered and logically I find flaws , when grievers were killed , gate were opened who stung jack in the last ? and why did not Thomas picked gun of dead guard , I mean logically If I am fighting with wood sticks and ancient weapon and suddenly I find a 9mm lying on floor, wouldn't I pick it ? common ! who is that stupid who will choose wood sticks to fight with monsters than firearms , have some sense guys. there were other few things did not fit well in the end, I mean something was not really good. I mean if outside world is kind of out of people whats the logic behind keeping children and putting them in a killing competitions ?. this novel based story disappoints me. could have done something better.
7.0~Worth a Watch Figgy66-915-598470 Sign in Permalink 22 October 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Maze Runner. The whole feel of this film was kind of Lord of The Flies meets The Hunger Games. A group of boys have been placed in 'the glade' in the centre of a maze. Their community has been added to gradually over time and they have evolved their own rules and each person has their own job to perform. Some of the boys are runners, tasked with running into the maze every day to find a way out. This film was very intense from the outset and I spent the whole time trying to work out why they were there. Another adaptation from a book, which I haven't read, but a very watchable film. I'm not sure it will be as successful as The Hunger Games but worth seeing in it's own right. Look out for Thomas Brodie-Sangster, you will remember him as the cute kid from Love Actually who learned to play the drums to win the girl........well he's all grown up now!!!!!
2.0~Don't waste your money or time kerryw74 Sign in Permalink Well what can I say, I was forced to see this by my daughter, we wanted to see the new Dracula untold, I thought the idea sounded OK until the movie started that is, it was quite boring to say the least. No one entered the maze until a fare chunk of the movie had already passed, the title should of been called "field talker" because that's what they did for the most part. I can't fault the acting or camera work but I can fault the script, seems like its just another teenage book made into a movie to cash in on the craze of making movies from books, (it's long been suggested that Hollywood has no original ideas left and copy books and movie ideas from foreign movie makers) To add to my disappointment the movie didn't end but pretty much says to be continued, what? I sat through this crap for them to tell me that I'm up for another $8.50 to see what happens next, The guy from "meet the millers" who's also in another great new (English) movie called "plastic" should be ashamed of being involved in this commercial drivel. Average rating of 7.4 what!
7.0~the rhythm and plot are well controlled yoggwork Sign in Permalink Yes, the rhythm and plot are well controlled. Overall sense, in the same type, is significantly better than the divergent, and is equivalent to the hunger game. Of course, small hard injuries are not without them. For example, 8-digit passwords, how the order of each area is determined
8.0~Solid dystopian YA story which reminded me of 'Lord of the Flies' crossed with 'Cube' Tweekums Sign in Permalink As this film opens our protagonist wakes in a large lift that takes him to a green area surrounded by high walls. He has no memory of what happened before, initially he doesn't even know his name although he later recalls that it is Thomas. There are other people there already; all teenage boys and none have any memory of what happened before they got there or knowledge of why they have been put there. Thomas is told that once a month a new person arrives along with vital supplies. He also learns that the area they live in is known as The Glade and the wall contain a giant maze; giant doors into the maze are open during the day and closed at night runners go into the maze during the day hoping to find a way out and if any are trapped in the maze when the doors close they will never be seen again. Apparently creatures known as Grievers come out at night although nobody has seen one and lived to tell the tale. That is until Thomas enters the maze to help two other boys and is caught inside. Not only do they manage to survive the night Thomas actually manages to kill a Griever. Things soon start to change; Thomas and another boy discover that the Grievers are man-made, they think they have found a way out and then the elevator delivers a new person; the first girl to be sent to the glade. Some people think that Thomas will be the one to get them out of the maze but one boy, Gally, is convinced that he has brought danger to them and insists that he is punished for what he has done. Sides are taken and a group make a bid for freedom. When I started watching this I wasn't expecting too much perhaps because of that I found myself pleasantly surprised. The idea of having a group of boys trapped in an enclosed location immediately made me think of 'Lord of the Flies' although the society depicted here isn't quite so fragile even if Gally's actions appear to push it that way. The fact that the maze changed each night and contained dangers reminded me of the Sci-fi film 'Cube'; although with this films young adult demographic it is far less violent. That doesn't mean there is no sense of real danger; it gets pretty intense at times and has moments when it is genuinely scary. A fair number of characters die including some one would expect to survive. The film has a good look with the maze having a real feel to it. The cast, which featured nobody I recognised in major roles, did a solid job making the viewer believe in the characters and their situation. There are some weaknesses, mostly when we are finally told why the boys were selected and why the maze was created in the first place, also the ending felt entirely like a set up for the next film in the series which of course it was. Overall though I found this to be a solid story and will keep an eye open for the sequel.
5.0~How does one define an escape? lee_eisenberg Sign in Permalink I had never heard of "The Maze Runner" when I started watching it. It turned out to be an interesting movie, although I couldn't tell what exactly it was trying to say. The Harry Potter and Hunger Games series are very upfront about what they're saying, but this movie comes across as a softer "Lord of the Rings". I thought that the best part was the end, and I thought that Patricia Clarkson got underused; if you're going to cast her in a movie, she needs to be a major character (and I find it easier to take her seriously in movies like "Far from Heaven", "Good Night and Good Luck" and "The East"). Overall, it's an OK movie, but like "Twilight" and "The Giver" it comes across as kind of flat. I could tell that they were leaving open the possibility of a sequel, though.
10.0~Loved it! Amazing movie, with the exception of a few things. alexgoinggaming Sign in Permalink This movie was amazing. Period. Though it did have a few faults. Things I liked: 1. They didn't hold back on the intensity and suspense. Most books that are made into movies are more mild than the book. Though there are a some intense parts they left out or are milder, it turned out OK. This is an opinion remember. 2. It had me on the edge of my seat. Literally, I was on the edge of the movie theater seat because of the suspense. It was amazing. 3. Acting. The acting was very well done, Dylan O'Brien did an amazing job playing the "Confused yet brave and determined Thomas". Things I didn't like, these things are not a huge deal or anything. The film was amazing. 1. The extremely fast plot. Things excelled pretty quickly. One minute Thomas is arriving the 'The Box' and the next he is running through the maze, which no one except the 'Maze Runners' have done. 2. The open and confusing ending. At the end it is showed that they escaped from the maze and are helped by a mysterious group of people. The people that put them in the maze are all shown dead and a video shows a women shooting herself. They are shown flying away in a helicopter. The next scene though shows all the people who where shown dead, discussing how there plan worked and the kids are the future. The biggest con for me was the extremely open ending, because now I'm going to have to read the books to get an idea of what is going to happen...
7.0~trapped magnuslhad Sign in Permalink More than the trite Divergent or po-faced Hunger Games franchises, The Maze Runner strikes the right note of adventure and earnestness for a teen fantasy-adventure movie. A group of teenagers find themselves deposited one by one in a mysterious glade enclosed by a huge maze. In the three years that they have been there, the have learned that escape is impossible, and entering the maze at night means certain death. Then Thomas arrives, and challenges all their carefully constructed rules, some of which have taken on sacred value for some members. Very few iterations of Lord of the Flies get it right, but the young actors in Maze Runner are plausible, and the running, jumping and rolling between closing walls and crashing edifices is tense and thrilling. There is good balance between action scenes and character-conflict scenes, with judicious dashes of comedy. Sure there are some plot holes, but nothing that has you throwing popcorn at the screen. It even gets away with a moment that is usually unforgivable, an ending that shamelessly sets up the sequel. Good fun for teenagers of all ages.
7.0~Quite enjoyable "young adult" movie. p-jonsson Sign in Permalink One thing that I liked about this movie from the start was that it was, in my limited experience at least, somewhat original. Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes. On the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a "young adult" movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned. In my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said. I did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way? Sometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time. Bottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.
7.0~I would happily go and see the sequel! SpannersGerm669 Sign in Permalink "Not another young adult book adaptation" seems to be the common saying when referring to the numerous movies of this nature recently. Coming into the Maze Runner, I had that thought in the back of my mind but not having read or even heard of the book, I was hoping that it would surprise me, and surprise me it did. The Maze Runner is a very dark film wrapped in mystery and danger. The actual maze looks fantastic and because we are oblivious to what is lurking inside it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Combining high action and suspense with a very solid mystery theme to it, The Maze Runner managed to capture my attention and although it threatens to lose its steam towards the end, the movie never lost me, which is something I wasn't expecting. "Lost" "Lord of the Flies" and many monster movies of the past, are elements that The Maze Runner takes on, and delivers in a very memorable experience! Although the ending could have been better, the journey to get to that point, is well worth the time and effort to participate in!
7.0~Some big problems, but it's pretty entertaining zetes Sign in Permalink The newest YA fantasy adaptation, I went to see this because, one, I hadn't seen a movie in theaters for about a month now and, two, because the trailer set up an intriguing enough mystery that it got me interested. A bunch of teen boys awake without memory to find themselves prisoners in a small glade surrounded by gigantic walls. Beyond the walls lies a maze, and when the doors to the maze close at night, monsters come out of the wall to kill anyone who has remained in the maze. The boys believe there may be an escape in the maze, but are unable to find it as they search throughout the day. When a new kid (Dylan O'Brien) arrives, he is a bit braver than the rest and enters the maze at night, which ends up changing all the rules of the boys' society. This movie offers a bit of fun and excitement, for sure. There are more questions raised than answered, and there seem to me to be some fairly big plot holes. The characters aren't particularly well developed, and, as it moves towards its conclusion (as much as it has one - of course it's a series of novels), it kind of reveals itself to be much closer to The Hunger Games than you might have originally thought. But I did enjoy myself, and I'd recommend it if you like these kinds of movies. It'll play well enough on video.
1.0~Boring, predictable, formulaic, juvenile nonsense Adams5905 Sign in Permalink This will probably be the shortest review I shall ever write... I can't think what made me watch this last night, but I know if I don't review it right now, it will fade completely from my memory (not a bad thing), as it has, quite simply, not a single thing to recommend it (it's not even so bad it's good)... I only hope I remember not to watch the next instalment (yes, as has been mentioned by other reviewers, this is the first in a trilogy-Hollywood's latest ploy in parting you from as much money as possible-subdividing stories that have simple plots that could be dealt with quickly and efficiently, into several movies that contain mainly filler, irrelevant subplots, and, especially in this case, pages of utterly inane and pointless dialogue)... This is obviously taking advantage of the success of the 'Mockingjay' series, but has none of the quality of cast, spectacle, decent effects, nor dark, serious back-plot of those films... Bad as they were, they were all infinitely better than this... Every actor was awful (where did they find them), even the usually reliable Patricia Clarkson, who makes a brief appearance at the end, and whom I re-saw recently in 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'-she should be ashamed of herself for 'phoning in her performance, but it at least illustrates the point that the blame for this travesty should lie squarely on the shoulders of the director, Wes Ball. Most of his work has been in TV, and I suggest he returns there, where he can do less damage... The SFX were so-so, some of them shown on such a dark screen it was difficult to make anything out... In an age of CGI, it's hard to make a mess of this aspect of film-making, and yet this crew succeeded... But the 'plot', that's my main gripe-it just made no sense whatsoever-riddles with holes and illogicities-too many to list here-a group of boys, in an isolated community, would not simply turn to farming the land and following rules set down arbitrarily by one of their number-they would constantly squabble, argue and fight for supremacy and their own point of view-form gangs and alliances, question anybody's right to command, lie, steal and cheat-remember 'Lord of the Flies', or the feral tribe of children in 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'?.. Or even, dare I mention it the Hunger Games themselves?.. They smacked of the truth-this is just a modern-day piece of PC propaganda (let's get along and love each other-only not in the physical sense, because...)-I know it was written for the teenage/young adult market, but it's just so out of kilter, it felt awkward-or did for some of the time, because I fell asleep for 20 mins., woke up, and realized I hadn't missed a single thing... Says it all.really... So, rather than watch this steaming pile of ordure, or either of its sequels, turn off the TV and watch some paint drying instead-you'll find it more entertaining and less frustrating, and you can thank me later... Wasn't so short after all...
4.0~Fan or the books, Not the movie jtwolfgirl84 Sign in Permalink For those of you who have READ the Maze Runner books BEFORE the movie came out and LOVED the books then don't go see the movie. It's absolutely NOTHING like the books we all loved and enjoyed. They changed EVERYTHING, and I don't mean a few important things like they did in The Hunger Games or Divergent or even the ever so absolutely beyond horrible movie adaptation of Twilight. I mean they changed EVERYTHING. From the very beginning you notice what they've changed. The movie on it's own is good, but compared to the books, which by the way it's suppose to be because it's based off of them, it SUCKED. I went into the movie theater knowing they changed things, like every book to movie adaptation, but here, they didn't just change a little, they changed a lot. And to me, a HUGE fan of the books, it's not okay and it will never be okay. I honestly could punch the director, then punch the screen writer, then punch James Dasher because he knew what they did and didn't say a thing. It's just. no. I can't. I honestly can't. I love Dylan O'Brien, I've loved him since day one of Teen Wolf and I love him as Thomas, because when I read the books, I can see him as Thomas. Hell, the whole reason I got into the books was because I heard he got the part as Thomas and I read the summery of what the movie was about and I went out and bought the book and read it in a day. I expected a lot out of this movie because of the fact that it was suppose to come out on Valentines day but they pushed the date back to September to work on the film. I understand that they only had a small budget compared to other movies but come on! The only thing that was the same from the book to the movie was the name and the names of the Gladers.
8.0~Good one luqman_afzal Sign in Permalink Better movie. Watching it again after 2014. Quite diff story. so that's why some people are not gonna understand it.
6.0~A great suspenseful and thrilling first and second act, but a disappointing third act revelation YJLcool Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is another Young-Adult book-to-film adaptation that offers a great deal of suspense, mystery and excitement with many lives are at stake. The film asks us which is the better choice – choosing to stay in our own personal comfort zone where we feel safe or we brave enough to take a leap of faith to face the unknown and search for a better path. It essentially encourages us to dare to be different in a world that wants us to conform...we should continue to expand and push ourselves to do more. Without knowing anything about the book, The Maze Runner does feels familiar in some ways and it gives the feeling that we have all seen this before (very similar to The Hunger Games, Divergent or The Giver). Based on the novel of the same name by James Dashner, The Maze Runner is about a group of young teenagers or kids who are trapped in a place called The Glade, the center of a giant maze, without any memories of their previous lives. Every month, each and every one of them wakes up in a caged elevator that comes with supplies. Some of them have been there for years and they've set up some ground rules that everyone must abide in order to live harmoniously and co-exist peacefully together. The Glade is surrounded by huge walls that only has one opening that leads to the giant maze and it closes every night. In order to escape, they send out runners to explore the maze in order to find a way out. However, there are mysterious, dangerous creatures called the "Grievers" that come out at night to hunt for food and the runners must ensure that they're back before the maze closes every night. The runners have been doing that for years, but still unable to find a way out, until Thomas appears. As with many other Young-Adult protagonists (similar to Katniss in The Hunger Games, Tris in Divergent, Jonas in The Giver), Thomas is different from the rest. He's curious, questioning everything around him and willing to do whatever it takes to seek and find answers. Not to mention, he's brave enough to lead the Gladers to conquer the maze. We're also introduced to Gally, another similar antagonist that doesn't like change, who wants everyone to strictly abide by the rules so that everyone can co-exist peacefully. The first act of the movie is incredibly promising, compelling and suspenseful enough to keep viewers interested, with enough drama, mystery and tension building up in the second act. However, everything goes downhill as soon as the third act begins. The revelation in the third act is considered a huge letdown considering the thrilling, suspenseful set-up earlier in the film. Who is Thomas? Why he's the most 'promising' of them all? Who sent him here? Why 'they' sent Thomas and Teresa? What is The Maze? Why they're all trapped in the Maze? What are the "Grievers" actually? How on earth that guy (I won't spoil it for you) managed to escape and meet them at the end? The explanations are vague...the film doesn't provide clear answers for many of the questions poised earlier in the film at its conclusion and relies on the next sequel to answer them instead (some of them I highly doubt so). Furthermore, the film never takes the time to explore its characters further and makes you care about them. The actors were convincing in their roles by providing decent performances but none of them were outstanding enough to make a deep impression. The friendship and camaraderie between the Gladers are shown throughout the film, but less profound. The only girl in the Glade, Teresa, lacks screen time and she serves no purpose for being in the film. You won't feel anything missing if she's completely removed from the story, because her role doesn't seemed to affect the overall plot of the film (there's enough suspense in the connection between Thomas and Teresa but that's not fully answered at the end of the film, so the only way to explain her inclusion in the film is probably that she's an important character in future instalments). The development of the characters felt rushed and truth be told, I didn't feel any emotional connection to the characters at all. Moreover, there are no memorable moments or impressive action in the entire film. As soon as the "Grievers" appear on-screen, all you see are just a bunch of closeups, fast cuts and blurred, shaky action. For me, it is hard to tell what is going on most of the time. Overall, The Maze Runner is suspenseful and exciting at the beginning, but it fails to deliver a dramatic and satisfying pay-off to the audience after all the patient waiting in hope to finally see everything comes together in the end. http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/09/movie-review-maze-runner.html Rating: 6.5/10
7.0~A way how to forget about daily life JanisU Sign in Permalink I kind a liked many things concerning graphics and scale of this movie, but more or less I wasn't convinced about this movie until last minute, so don't get too judgmental till you see the movie till very last minute.. Actors were very well as well, I liked variety of them and the way how they were messing with me as a viewer. Though many things were very predictable. Overall this movie was a nice way how to run away from daily maze. In particular, I would highlight the graphics, music as well the way how this movie was given, especially with a lot of questions and just a few answers.. And yeas, I would recommend to watch this movie, and I hope to see the second movie soon...
7.0~Escape (without a) Plan kosmasp Sign in Permalink This is a pretty decent effort into the teenager foray, breaking into the Hunger Games area/mold. It avoids the trappings of love triangle, going for mystery and special effects instead, doing a nice job most of the time. Obviously in the inevitable sequel(s) this will change, plus the ending might feel like ... the movie was stretched to put it mildly. Hopefully though you won't care and buy into the whole suspense and what's going on, who are we kind of vibe the movie is sending out. The questions that you won't get an answer to in this movie and many things that feel like they are wrong if you think about them, should only start if you are not affected by that vibe. It's a bit male dominated, but still a nice watch
9.0~A story of survival monstermayhem32 Sign in Permalink Even though the maze runner is indeed 20th century Fox version of the hunger games but I will say that the film itself is different since it seems to offer something different. The story starts off with Dylan o Brian character Thomas being transported from an elevator into a place called the maze. He has no memory of his prior life or why he was there in the first place. However a threat behind the maze walls is called grieves who target the gladers inside the maze, however Thomas starts to realize that perhaps there is a reason outbox the maze and become a runner along Minho. He also encounters a girl from his past named Theresa who holds vital information as to why the maze was created.
6.0~Great pace and shallowness begob Sign in Permalink The pace of this is great - the scenes join up like a sprint relay, with the tension mounting all the time. The characters were fairly well marked out, although the introduction of the girl showed the lack of ambition of the story - that should have caused some funny reactions amongst a group of 50 sex starved boys. The only faint laugh was the "girls are awesome" scene. The ending is sequel bait, but at least it left you guessing. Even to the point you wonder if the hero is really a plant. Lack of humour is a weakness throughout. The scenario is interesting. But the big failing is that in that kind of world the future will not be technological - more feudal.
6.0~Where is the logic? claircolella Sign in Permalink I found the plot interesting , but there were too many holes. I was yelling half of the movie because a lot of things didn't make sense or were left without explanation. Why don't bring better weapons in the maze? They had machetes and fire in the glade, why would they go fighting monsters with sticks and knives? Why no one tried to climb the wall? They've been there for three years, why not built catapults or traps? It's not like they have better to do anyway. The characters were too predictable and they did random things, especially Gally. I liked the action scenes and the premise, but I'm pretending that the last fifteen minutes didn't happened. I cringed so much. Who would trap teenagers in a maze to study them? and the Sun thing, really? I laughed a lot, but who do movies shouldn't underestimate people's brain. Ps.English is not my native language, but I tried my best. I didn't read the books, but I'm sure that they are better.
1.0~Demand A Refund, Even If you Saw It Free! frankeljseth Sign in Permalink This movie was one of, if not, the absolute worst film adaptations of a book I have ever seen. After binge reading the book over two days (mostly out of boredom) and being pleasantly surprised, I decided to watch the movie on HBOGo. To say that was a mistake is like saying Hitler was misguided, The movie, aside from not being remotely similar to the book, didn't captivate at all, contained almost no plot, and seemingly ripped off Lord Of The Flies more than its namesake, though I apologize for even putting it in the same sentence as such a classic. If you are in the mood be angered and gouge your own eyes out, please enjoy this sorry excuse for a blockbuster. I strongly advise any would-be watchers to seriously consider spending their time in a more productive manner, such as getting stung by bees in the testicles. Shame on whoever allowed this to pass off as a bona fide movie.
2.0~un a MAZE ing............ a-little-squeek Sign in Permalink Look...it's the middle of a trilogy. There's no initial plot development, there's no definitive ending. There are many "invisible" characters who never get developed and you can easily figure out that they're not going to make it to the end of the movie. The one and only girl gets put in with the large group of guys that have been there for years...I wonder how that will work out for her! Prediction: the sequel will add more guesswork as to the plot why's and wherefores and the third installment will be a prequel which will finally give insight to the over all story line. yawwwn.... This movie made me feel like it's a retread of an old tire. I guess that there are no new ideas coming out of Hollywood these days. Just the same old stuff, plot tweaked, with new CGI, repackaged and dished out to the public. I won't be eagerly anticipating the next installment.
9.0~A Good Movie Because It Is Similar To The Book inserrtnamehere Sign in Permalink I give this rating because I judge movies based on how well they correlate with the book off which they were based. This movie was very similar to the book and so it deserves a high rating. The Maze Runner movie was entertaining, had audiences on the edge their seats during suspenseful scenes, and adequately captivated audiences for the entire movie. The maze and the Grievers were similar to how I pictured them in the book. While this movie is an obvious attempt to make money off of a semi-popular book, it was in fact a good movie and I would recommend it for anyone to watch. Although I would have preferred it if the code for exiting the maze would have been the same as in the book where a series of words allowed the doors to open, the movie version was simpler and therefore tolerable. However, when the Grievers attacked the Gladers I would have liked it better if they killed off one person at a time because it makes more sense with the overall point of the trilogy. Speaking of the overall point of the trilogy, I do not understand how spending millions of dollars to send teenagers into a deadly maze would help them solve a disease affecting the entire world. Still a good movie to watch though, and I stand by my recommendation for people to watch it.
5.0~3rd day leftovers. witster18 Sign in Permalink It's edible, not terrible, and it might curb your hunger, but it's nothing to write home about. So I'll write to you guys/gals. "Maze Runner" is exactly what you think it might be. Rehashed ideas, vague science-fiction, and little more than a catalyst for the following sequels. The good? THe production values are pretty good, and the acting better than average for this type of thing. While it brings nothing new to the table - the pacing of the film is quite nice, and the film does leave the door open to possibly answer many of the questions that go unanswered in the original here - and there are A LOT of questions. The biggest problem, the biggest question.. is the MAZE ITSELF!! Seriously, what's the purpose. It's weird because "getting through the maze" highlights the best parts of this film, but in terms of explaining why it's there - we get nada. Why not just put a huge wall around them? Basically, the action and the acting are pretty good, but the story, the 'science-fiction' if you will, is vague/terrible. Of course I didn't read the books and maybe the books put more into the explanation(sure they did), but there's not enough here for me to really want to dive into this any further. I mean, these producers spent multi-millions for this two hours here with a movie called "Maze Runner", and after 2 Hours I have no clue why there is even a maze, and I get the feeling that they don't either. I may actually give the sequels a try - in hopes that it really clears up a bunch of the reasoning behind the "maze". But, I'm not going to hold my breath. This is about even with the under-whelming, "No Escape", and it's also about even with the first "Hunger Games". That's to say that overall this film is very average. A full-step below "Catching Fire", and even a tad below my similarly rated "Snowpiercer". Average action flick. Lord of the Flies meets an extremely vague science-fiction plot, meets "The Walking Dead". THe monsters are called "Grievers". That's actually a good way to describe many of the movie-goers here. For a free redbox entry I don't feel slighted, but if I'd spent 3hrs and 30 bucks on this at the theater I wouldn't be too happy. 54/100 I've seen a lot worse this year, but this is about the 35th best film out of 50 or so that I've seen from 2014.
9.0~Make it a TV show hockeyfreak-63857 Sign in Permalink I found that the movie was very well done, but i think the writers could get a lot more depth into the whole scenario if they turned it into a TV series. you can start with how it all began and how it would've been being the first person in the maze. There is so much to expand on its pretty crazy to me. instead of coming out with more movies which personally although they were long, could still provide a lot more detail. think about it, it only took 3 days for them to get out once Thomas got there. imagine following the other maze runners through the maze and every now and again they get caught up in the maze and don't return like the movie suggest. Im sure I'm not the only one who would enjoy this and who knows, it could be as big as the walking dead!!!
6.0~Another YA Dyspotian Novel-Film Too Many 3xHCCH Sign in Permalink Again as is the present trend derived from "Hunger Games", "Divergent", "The Giver" and many more, "The Maze Runner" yet another young-adult post-apocalyptic science fiction novel of the same name by James Dashner, published in October 2007. It has two sequels in its trilogy: "The Scorch Trials" and "The Death Cure". I haven't read the books yet, so I will just be judging the film as it is. The film starts with a boy who wakes up in a rapidly-rising elevator, which opened in a camp of teenage boys called the Glade. The boy eventually recalls that his name was Thomas, but nothing else from his past. being the main character, Thomas, of course, differed from the other boys. He was more curious about what lies beyond the Glade, and more determined to regain his freedom. The Glade was surrounded by a giant maze which the other boys had been trying to figure out for the three years that they have been there. However, the maze changes its configuration every night. Furthermore, there lives in the maze unseen deadly creatures called "Grievers". Why are these boys in the Glade? Will they ever get out of there? What does the arrival of a girl named Teresa in the Glade signify? The situation of the teenage boys trying to survive with each other in the Glade without any adult supervision is very much reminiscent of a much earlier young adult classic "Lord of the Flies." We also see here the usual ingredients in this genre: the enclosed arena, the stringent rules, the unknown outer limits, rebelling against establishment. This is one of those rare summer blockbuster films for which I did not know ANY of the actors by name. There may be familiar faces but they were not household names. The lead actor Dylan O'Brien does well in his role but it was really outstanding in any remarkable way. I was glad to see an Asian actor Ki Hong Lee in a major role as the original runner Minho. I just don't know if his book character was as non-proactive as it was portrayed on screen. I have to say though that the action sequences were done quite well. The running within the maze scenes were quite exciting and very entertaining to watch. For all the tension built up in the film though, the hanging ending could be quite a disappointment. Nothing really gets explained clearly. While this one will feel like an incomplete film, it makes the sequels must-sees for those who are interested enough to see the story through. However, honestly, after the excellence of the film version of "The Hunger Games", with a big star Jennifer Lawrence in the lead, all of these similar genre films that followed its lead already pale in comparison. For me, "The Maze Runner" just felt like another young adult dystopian film too many.
9.0~The Maze Runner is based on the best-selling novel. keansereivathana Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner was such a great movie I have ever seen!! I haven't read the book yet but the movie are really entertaining and the effect, acting was so great It's keep me getting more interesting and feel like you're in the movies. It's totally amazing that Thomas was the only one that change the other boys mind to get out of the maze after he know that he was the one who send them here(into the glade) and can't stand watch them suffers any more. The actors/actress accent are clear and easy to listen to, their emotion in the movie are great. The movie has such a strong friendship, they always help each other out and their less romance and more action, adventure. I highly recommend this movie! And looking forward to the next season/part of this movie. I gave this movie 9/10!
6.0~Surprisingly Good sgwwpig Sign in Permalink Having read the books before watching the film I was more than a little worried that they had ruined an otherwise great story. I'm glad that I was wrong. Although the story is changed slightly it stays true to the original and is fun to watch. I realise that I was being a bit unfair by being angry that they changed some parts of the story when it's hard to recreate it perfectly. All the actors played their roles well and brought the characters to life. It kept me on the edge of my seat, even though I had an idea of what was going to happen. After watching it once, I went back a few days later with my brother to watch it again and it was still great. All in all this film is worth watching and I would definitely watch it again.
10.0~The Next Resident Evil Franchise? politehere Sign in Permalink This movie was perfection in the true sense of the word. It had everything I had ever hoped to see in a movie: a great opening, a highly engaging, thrilling, mysterious, easy-to-follow, simple yet effective and to-the-point plot, likable characters you could actually care about and root for, incredible performances delivered by each and every single actor and actress, a superb conclusion and cliff-hanger ending, which calls for a sequel, awesome special effects, the kind where special effects are kept to a minimum and are not employed for the sake of special effects but for the sake of the plot, a pleasant and balanced mix of all the popular genres: Mystery, Sci-Fi and Action. There was never a dull moment in this mystery-driven movie. I enjoyed every second of it and I was hooked the moment it started. Could this be the next Resident Evil Franchise? I have very high hopes for this movie and believe that if done right, it has the potential to be one of the most successful movie franchises ever. Now I know four of 2014 movies are my most favorite: Edge of Tomorrow, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Need for Speed and The Maze Runner. Strongly recommended. Do not miss out on this one.
1.0~Booorrriiiiinggggg crithaslife Sign in Permalink I can't believe that this film has 7/10 rating on IMDb. Jesus Christ people is your taste in movies that bad? seriously... I'll try to explain how bad this film is without spoiling much. I haven't read the book but even if I did the result would be the same- boring below-average action movie. Action movie? Wait i might be wrong there because there is no actual action. Even the "action" is boring in this film. There are endless pointless scenes, and the plot is very predictable. Beginning? Confusing and uninteresting. Ending? Very bad. Bad directing overall. The acting is also below-average, these guys are just not convincing. You don't care less about the main character, nor about the brave leader, for whom the film tries to create some touching scenes, or the main character's "best friend??". The only female one is like non-existing. These boys had perfectly styled hair and they were totally clean... in a valley outside civilization. We don't learn anything about these people during the film, their community and how they survive; we only learn their "rules". Generally it's a very bad film full of plot holes and unnecessary drama scenes. Stay away {1/10}
2.0~Worst adapt book ever... kate_baumann Sign in Permalink Wow, okay this was completely horrible... I just read the first book and I can honestly say it was one of the best books I've read.. And I watched the movie after that and I have no clue why they gave it the same name because it's completely a different plot... To start off, plenty of keys informations aren't present which causes for a lot of confusion. They do not talk about keepers, mapping, the impossibility to solve the maze, the beetle blades and so on. Here are some important stuff that should of been in the movie: Thomas isn't a leader at all - Alby is a strong leader and is helped by Newt - Minho is a strong headed character - Theresa isn't accepted by anyone - It never rains in the glades - Gally hates Thomas since the minute he sees him - Ben is actually in a changing since the beginning - Theresa is wayyy more involved in the story than mentioned - The events aren't in the same order as the movie (which is pretty key) - Some other characters were none existent in the movie - It all about variables and soooo much more... they've change the plot completely which is sad since it could of been a two part movie like the hobbit. They're so much more to it than what the movie shows. Also, the filming is horrible.. They use a steady cam which is utterly unnecessary since we still don't see anything. But more importantly the story isn't about the maze, but about the roles of the characters in the maze which wasn't represented in the movie. Finally, just to give an idea how the movie is different: in the first 10 minutes it rains in the movie (it never rain in the glades, that's why it seems so perfect and why Alby, and not Gally, doesn't want to leave) - At the end, they leave in the desert in a helicopter ( in the book, they leave in the rain with a school bus..) If I were the author I'd be shy to say that this is the movie of my book..
6.0~Good well made but a bit irrational mak54291 Sign in Permalink This movie is a great piece of art and it contain everything a good movie can have. The computer generated effect and montage is so great. It look just like the real world. The sound is something to not be forget and it rock just like the rest of the cg part of the movie. For the music, we could have got better but I guess it sound enough for a public movie. The actors are great and make this movie live like for real. Than goes the story that could interest fan of sci-fi and adventure like it was shown in the trailer. The sub story or event of the movie make the movie sound real and emotional. A bunch of normal people making a story for normal people. Because it's good to note that despite all its greatness, the movie contain mistake that can be clearly see on first view and non sense that could make some people leave the sale. In my case I have decided to watch it completely and see how good it get on the story. Was not a deception. Did I forgot about the damn nice job of the shooters! A modern piece of great work. I bet it could easily reach the 8 for some people!
6.0~A lot more enjoyable than it's other "dystopian" counterparts eddie_baggins Sign in Permalink Another entry into the string of dystopian teen novel adaptations (see also Hunger Games, Divergent etc.), Wes Ball's cinematic retelling of James Dashner's book of the same name is a film that thankfully remains constantly entertaining due to an air of mystery and intrigue that all stems from the films main attraction, the titular maze. This maze is an ominous, foreboding presence that perforates the entire movie and overshadows all other elements of a genuinely stock standard scenario of hero's arising from the ashes of despair. With a cookie cutter assembling of characters we've seen a million times before, from the reluctant hero Thomas played by the not overly annoying Dylan O'Brien, the lovable fat kid Chuck, through to the token bully/bad boy Gally played by an overacting Will Poulter from Son of Rambow fame, this collection of rag tag teenage boys is anything but original, but against all odds the film remains intriguing from its impressively abrupt beginning through to its slightly overblown yet relatively ripe ending. Maze Runner's ability to keep you entertained, often against your better cinematic judgement stems from the films often bleak and gritty tone but largely the films biggest ace up its sleeve is the as mentioned maze, a work of concrete beauty that harbors much narrative potential. The maze constructed here is a character all to itself. What exactly lurks the narrow corridors of this behemoth at night? Who and what has designed it? How will the "runners" unlock its mysteries? There questions that are quickly raised by you as tribe leader Alby describes the maze to our "greeny" Thomas. Ball does a solid job of directing around this central aspect and if all else fails around it, there's little doubting that the viewer will endure if not only to see what lays hidden within this large enigma, an idea perfectly tapping into our lust to discover the unknown and mentally uncover the mystery before someone else does. A whole lot more enjoyable than the Hunger Games and its weaker cousin Divergent, The Maze Runner is by no means stand out movie making but it's a solid and often heart pounding engaging thriller that features some thankfully un-annoying teenage performances, a great production design and a central plot device that will hopefully be expanded upon in its upcoming sequels. Out of all current teen book adaptations, this is a series that possess the most potential based on this first outing. 3 perfectly constructed maze reproductions out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com
8.0~Maze Runner Review Al_The_Strange Sign in Permalink A kid wakes up in a cage that's climbing up an elevator shaft, with no memory of who he is and where he came from. At the top, he finds himself stuck in the middle of a grassy plain, surrounded by trees, and giant metal walls beyond. Beyond the walls is some kind of massive labyrinth, which closes itself off every night, and there are deadly cybernetic creatures that come out to slay anybody who's stuck inside. This kid finds himself among a small society of other kids who have been stuck in this place for years, and could never find their way out of the maze...until now! If nothing else, I think The Maze Runner starts off with a really cool concept and it remains enthralling all the way to its end. Even if it does fall into the typical tropes, clichés, and formula set up by other adaptations of YA fiction novels (especially The Hunger Games), the film is very consistently thrilling. It's not just the action scenes, of which there are plenty and they're never really overdone - it's the plot and the methodical way it unravels that captivated me the most. It starts off so enigmatically, the film kept me glued to the action to see what the heck is going on and what the secret is behind the maze. The maze lends itself easily to building suspense, as the characters have to maneuver through its winding corridors and evade death at every turn. Outside of the maze, the film keeps the tension high thanks to an overarching sociological struggle that forces the characters to question whether they should risk their lives to escape or remain alive in their well-organized mini-society. At times, this takes the characters to darker and savage territory. The film can be pretty violent and nasty when it needs to be; it's not too distastefully graphic, but it is definitely not all that fluffy either. The plot runs pretty evenly with minimal drag, thanks to the plethora of conflicts that emerge among the different characters and the events that unfold. That being said, it's still not a perfect story; I personally found it odd that all it takes place in the course of three days (were it not for the dialogue, I would have assumed that months had passed). There are moments in the film where you could question why certain things weren't tried to accomplished before the main character's timely arrival. I found most plot holes easy enough to dismiss, but the film's success in the long run may depend on how the sequels do (and yes, the movie does end with a huge infodump that leaves more questions unanswered, and offers a lead-in for the next movie). I found most of the characters likable, except for one major antagonist, who may be one of the most unreasonably jerky characters I've seen in a while. I wanted to slap that Gally upside the head. The story seems to dig up some very interesting sociological themes, thanks to its focus on the group, the system they built, and their ongoing struggle through the maze. I have no idea how this movie compares to the original book, but it certainly has me interested enough to read it sometime. The film looks mostly-good. Photography is great in many scenes, but a few of the action scenes tend to be jittery and erratic at times. Editing is decent. I felt the cast was good, especially considering that so many of these actors are children. Writing gets the job done; there is a lot of exposition, some of which dumps a lot of new terms on the audience, but it keeps things rolling well. This production has decent-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is okay. This film is a bit like what you get if you take the death-match scenes from The Hunger Games and crossed it with The Lord of the Flies. It may look like just another YA adaptation, but I think The Maze Runner is decent sci-fi and it could be the start of a cool new film franchise. Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)
9.0~Message Between the Lines Delivered Amazingly hotimpression7 Sign in Permalink I may not comment on how movie/plot/dynamics lead from one situation to another as story of the movie proceeds as our hero Thomas (Dylan O'Brien" get injected in to the maze. .... The movie touched my heart with only one thing. which was this amazing message that "Never Give up". when they get divided in to two groups where one says 1. we should do things the way it has been getting done since beginning ( Gally played by Will Poulter) while others 2. believes that this is not our home, we have been put here and we must try to escape/go home, Courage, hope, confidence and the amazing line when Thomas says ....or we should die trying..." is the one shook me. ... life is a maze, you have been put here,,,, if you afraid of trying and settles on nothing, ONLY you are to be blamed the suspense, fear factor in the movie since beginning is very nice. pace is somewhat slow but movie delivers in time and believe me it worth watching at least once more!! I will be watching this movie again. and time with my family :)
8.0~Love the premise and execution dfranzen70 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is an exceptionally entertaining little movie that belies its origins as a young-adult story. It's one of those increasingly rare movies that make excellent use of such quaint amenities as setting and atmosphere to instill a real sense of panic, courage, determination, and fear in even the most disaffected teenager. It's tightly paced, with few logical inconsistencies to nitpick, too. It all begins when Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up to find himself in a rapidly ascending elevator stocked with what appear to be provisions of some kind. When the elevator stops and the top is opened, he discovers that he's the latest arrival in an all-boys community that's at the center of a giant, ever-changing, complex stone maze. The boys, some of whom have been there for a long time, have established a pacifistic community that relies on those monthly provisions and their own hard work (building shelters, low-level farming) to survive. But that maze. It's enormous and inscrutable. There are specialists, called Runners, who enter the maze each morning in order to map it and to try to find a way out. But if they don't return by dusk, the maze's stone doors will close, leaving the hapless teens inside for the night. And no one has ever spent a night in the maze and survived. This is the ominous, bleak scenario with which young Thomas is presented. Alby (Aml Ameen), the leader of the crew, explains that there are only three rules in The Glade, that happy little faux-Paradise in which they all live: do your part, don't hurt another Glade resident, and don't feed them after midnight. Wait, sorry, that last one is from Gremlins. I meant that Gladers (uh huh) are forbidden to go into the maze. Well, unless they happen to be Runners. So, once a month they get new supplies and a new young dude. But once Thomas arrives, things start to be a little different in the Glade. A runner is stung by a Griever (they're nasty robotic creatures who lurk in the maze) in broad daylight. Stings aren't good - they incapacitate the stung person and imbue them with violent tendencies. As such, he who has been stung is necessarily banished from The Glade, for the safety of the rest of the clan. Thomas isn't like everyone else, as the somewhat-hotheaded Gally (Will Poulter, Chronicles of Narnia: The Dawn Treader) is quick to point out. Gally notices that things seem a little off since Thomas's arrival, and he blames the greenie for disrupting what felt like a little slice of heaven. But on Thomas's side are Alby, Alby's second in command Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and the most-recent new blood, a young boy named Chuck (Blake Cooper), who looks a lot like Chunk from The Goonies. Something has changed with Thomas's arrival; it seems that whoever or whatever is behind the maze's creation is changing the rules. For one thing, an unscheduled arrival of the elevator yields a new member for the group: a girl. The first one, in fact. It's Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), who appears to know Thomas from before their time in The Glade. Both Thomas and Theresa have dreams regarding their "before time" - again, unlike the others. Thomas is acutely aware that the existence of the group in The Glade is not necessarily permanent, as evidenced by the attacking Grievers and the various infighting of the Gladers. Thomas wishes to find out more, and Gally simply doesn't, content to keep things as they are. This is the crux of the movie's moral issue - is it better to keep what one has, even if one has little and under repressive conditions, or to strive to escape those conditions on the hope of finding a better life elsewhere? Leaving aside the morality of having teenagers battle robot-animal hybrids (goodness knows we've seen plenty of movies about kids killing enemies or each other lately), the eternal question of why the boys and Teresa are even in The Glade lingers over them all. It's just that Gally and his small band of followers don't want to know the answer, and Thomas and his desperately do. The action is fierce and creative. Even the battles with various Grievers are well shot (sometimes tough to do with robots, because with so much activity it can be difficult to discern what's what and who's who, particularly in a low-light setting), and the maze is something to behold - a real work of art, were it real. The acting is better than might be expected for a young-adult film, and O'Brien, Brodie-Sangster, and Poulter are each well cast. It's obvious that The Maze Runner is intended to be a franchise - if it enjoys box-office success, of course. If this turns out to be another Golden Compass, then this may be the only Maze Runner movie we see. Which is a shame, because there are plenty of dangling plot lines at the end. Even so, the movie is exciting and persuasive and doesn't try to dumb itself down for the sake of its audience.
4.0~If you're looking for this movie to be like the book you will be utterly disappointed. vsd324 Sign in Permalink A movie is never as good as a book--that's a given. A movie can't develop characters like a book, and it doesn't dive deep into what the characters are thinking and feeling. Time also inhibits the amount of details that can be included. Still some movies manage to capture books on film very well. The entire Hunger Games series (2012-15) has been an excellent telling of the book series. A movie like "The Shining" (1980) has an alternate ending from Stephen King's book, but capture the essence of the novel. "Angels & Demons" (2009) left out a lot of details from Dan Brown's novel, but kept the general plot line. This movie fails on all accounts. After reading the book I was looking forward to seeing this movie. There were a lot of parts I was curious to see depicted on screen. So many details were changed, and the plot line was completely altered. I was disappointed on all accounts. In both we have a world where adolescent boys are taken, wiped of all of their previous memories. They live in a walled region known as The Glade, outside of which lies a mysterious moving maze. At night, the doors that lead to the maze shut. In the book, these doors are massive wall which shut defying all laws of physics. In the movie they show a perfectly plausible gear system only made slightly implausible by the character saying "How is that even possible?" In the book it never rains--in the movie it rains. The meaning of the maze is completely different in the two. The grievers, the creatures in the maze, are an utter disappointment. It's hard for me to tell if I would've enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the book more. The amount of death and violence is high for a very young audience, but the plot has been watered down so much it's hard to imagine it's intended for a more sophisticated viewer. If you're interested in The Maze Runner, watch the movie first and then read the book, or skip the movie entirely. Doing it in the order I did will prove utterly disappointing.
5.0~Interesting prologue but not much of a story. deniokolacek Sign in Permalink The first half of the movie is interesting but the producers have done really poor job on completing the story in some sensational way. I expected much, much more from the promising prologue. The targeted audience is probably from 8 to 18 years so if you are not in this range or close to it you shouldn't waste your time on this movie. The movie should be shorter because the plot is not that complex and the story could be finished in shorter time. The concept of maze has a lot more to offer than this movie, the maze itself is mysterious enough but the movie didn't do well in giving it more mystique content. The movie is completely forgettable and viewers are not left any felling of sensation after film. I was very disappointed with the end of the movie that has noting to offer. And it should. Because you wasted almost two hours hoping that you wouldn't be disappointed. I felt it was lacking more lady characters.
3.0~Unfortunate deschamps_teneshia Sign in Permalink It is really very unfortunate this movie turned out the way it did, the books them self are beyond outstanding, written like movies I personally thought. But the movie unfortunately was nothing but a huge disappointment. I have watched plenty of books-to-movies, and sure, there's things changed here and there, but so much was either changed or left out from the book to movie that the movie was left, empty. It felt rushed, and confusing, as if they were trying to make it exciting and visually compelling instead of keeping to the story. It's a sci-fi book, but the movie turned out less sci-fi then expected. I believe many would have enjoyed it more if it was kept as interesting as the book, more character development and the different types of technology used in the books. I highly recommend the books! You will find yourself pulled into the story's mystery this way! :)
6.0~An above average young adult film alindsay-al Sign in Permalink We have another film based on a book in the maze runner and this film is alright, even though there are problems. The premise of the film sees a young man transported to a forest with a group of other young men. As he regains his memory he wants to convince the others that they can escape. Now Dylan o brien isn't a big name actor but he does a really good job in this film. At first I wasn't sure about his character, but he really grew on me as the film progressed and was a really good dramatic character. Will poulter plays a more hostile character in the film which was completely different to other things he has done in a good way. However, the rest of the characters are paper thin and you end up not caring about him. I liked the story of the boys being stranded in this community and the conflict really worked for me. However, this is one of the weakest endings in recent memory that does nothing but attempt to set up the sequel. The script has some good powerful dramatic dialogue and scenes. But it truly lacks any humour to it which makes the characters harder to like. The style of the film looks great with some decent action scenes. However, the CGI of the creatures didn't really work for me and the lack of light made it hard to see allot of the action. Overall this is an above average film but I hope the sequel is better.
4.0~Intriguing concept, but terrible writing and execution addeisdead Sign in Permalink My wife wanted to watch this because she liked the Hunger Games and was hoping this would be at least half as good. I had already heard plenty about the book series and even read a few chapters, so my expectations were much lower. What you get here is a series of action sequences strung together with ridiculous exposition and a back story that is so contrived it makes the Hunger Games sound like historical fiction. Not that it really matters - ultimately the film is just these kids in a maze for 105 minutes with some unexpected and convenient stuff happening in the last 10. Any form of metaphor, theme or meaning within this is basic and shallow at best. Don't go in looking for any kind of relevant social commentary. And a lot of this could be overlooked if there were at least some interesting characters, but instead we're treated to the usual tropes, who go about their duties with little development or charm. They're convincing at least, but bland as a Dodge Avenger. Anyway, I know a lot of the 14-25 crowd will disagree with my review, but that's okay. They are who this movie was made for. It's a competently made film with enough action to entertain you for a while, but it's not remarkable or exceptional in any facet.
7.0~Chappy Watched: The Maze Runner chappywatched Sign in Permalink So I got tickets to an advanced screening of this film and I fully expected to have it full of teenagers screaming over Teen Wolf star, Dylan O'Brien. I walked in to the cinemas; the line was huge and full of teenagers. CRAP! Finally got my tickets and then found out that all these teenagers were going to see the new Step Up movie. YES!!! I had heard about the movie and when I found out that it was going to appear at WonderCon this year, I got a copy of the book. I only got about 100 pages or so in – not to any fault of the books! – and then just never picked it up again. I really, really enjoyed this movie. I had heard a lot of criticism that this was just another Hunger Games. I actually found it to be more like Lord of the Flies than Hunger Games. If you couldn't tell from the trailers or the advertising, this story pretty much revolves around Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and starts straight from the beginning of his time in 'The Glade'. The Glade is very well done, it looks like it has been built by humans with very little equipment and not made unrealistic by CGI. The Maze is also very well done, simple, built for it's purpose and looks real and doesn't try to be over creative. If anyone is going to make it out of Teen Wolf and succeed, it's going to be O'Brien. I have stopped watching the show but his character of 'Stiles' is what got me watching the show in the beginning and is what kept me watching as long as I did! The character of Stiles is, more often than not, the comedy relief of the show, with his uncoordinated movements but the character of Thomas is essentially quite the opposite. The cast was pretty awesome, not a lot of them are well known but doesn't show in this movie and while Thomas may be the headliner, the heart of the movie, even though with a smaller role would definitely have to be Chuck, played by Blake Cooper. There seems to be an inkling of a possible future romance between Thomas and Teresa, the only female sent to The Maze, but I didn't feel any chemistry between the two other than a brother/sister relationship. This movie is based on a book series and while it wraps up 'The Maze Runner' chapter, it does leave some aspects and story lines open for the future films. There better be future films! I really enjoyed this film more than I thought I would and will more than likely go see it again, probably even buy it on blu-ray when it's released.
10.0~A great test blackmamba99971 Sign in Permalink I guessed at the beginning that this was a trial of a sort where a few dozen people stuck in the centre of a maze would be their downfall. Impressive was the fact the maze itself changed every so often to give the group a random idea to see if their intellect would stand up to the challenge. Needless to say Thomas was that man. Through memories where his life as an observer to the maze was turned so he could partake in the procedure to see if his fellow glade members who has been stuck for three years in a stalemate could also step forward to freedom. I like the idea that the director of operations explained briefly what had happened to the earth which is why the young glade populace was placed within the maze. It was in order for them to overcome some of the harshest conditions after what was known as the Flare. Where the sun sent out a cataclysmic solar exposure to the earth nearly rendering it uninhabitable. Billions of lives were lost in the flare but in order to create a new human to overcome obstacles in the harshest degree the director needed survivors probably to search for others in the wastelands or to at least find the weeds and pluck them out before chaos escalates to sheer panic. It is a nice twist to the dystopia and anarchistic approach. Where humans who survived the worst tragedy creates an even more pure form of violence using test subjects as her weapons. I think there might be a second movie to this film to see what Thomas does now that he is free of the labyrinth with his friends. Whether he will follow orders or take down Wicked at its core. As for the special effects it was nicely done although CGI in some cases. The sets were very well done as was the music. It left a gritty taste in your mouth with some of the death scenes but that's what survival is. I did however see this film had a very close resemblance to a class movie called Lord Of The Flies where a group of boys were stranded on an island and had to survive using whatever means at their disposal. It was still a great movie for the most part with new actors and new faces. What was surprising was the actor who played Gally. He does have a strange resemblance to River Phoenix with his facial expressions, which made me question if he is related to him found that was not the answer. I can recommend this to ages above 14. Can't wait for the second instalment.
3.0~Plot holes, unnecessary characters, a dumb storyline. khupminlian Sign in Permalink I haven't read the book and after watching the movie, Im glad i haven't. The story is so plain and dull with lots of unnecessary characters and scenes that doesn't add up to no answers (if they are trying a little suspense). Within 5 minutes into the movie, you know exactly what is going to happen, the only twist of excitement i found in this hour and a half movie is that the protagonist used to be the bad guys. Some of the holes in the storyline - What is the deal with the black guy (ably?) did he know something the others don't, he was the first guy sent out there. and if so why wasn't that explained or implored in the movie to the audience - How and where did they get their supplies: food, tools, oil for their lamps,etc. - The soldiers in the last scene who took the boys (the girl too) home- who are they? why didn't they save the boys from the start. they were not down with the experiment anyway (they killed all those evil human researchers). they even got a chopper. I checked the ratings here before i watch and was a decent 7. How in the world did this movie got that a high rating?? anyway, the end of the movie suggest a sequel (blah! not again!!). If you like Percy Jackson series or the last air-bender go watch, if not don't waste your time and money on this senseless and dull piece that might just turn out to be the next twilight saga.
5.0~It's watchable newmailbrendan Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner (2014): A movie about escaping a place where you and others don't want to be? Okay, let's see how that turns out. It's well done if it comes to planning a escape or explore different kind of occasions. But the overall character development and a more detailed story telling will set this movie to among the other great escape movies. Sadly, they couldn't deliver that. Also the requisites of achieving a "good movie" seems far away. Review by: Brendan Resnick.
8.0~Film is satisfactory In suspence mycwhite Sign in Permalink The movie is excellent, writing, actors/actresses were great, scenes were emotionally moving and length of film is good. I am pretty good at predicating most films, this movie surprised in most scenes and that grab my attention. Remember it is very emotional and fun too. Great Movie its worth your time..
8.0~The Maze Runner, Skewed and Reviewed garethvk Sign in Permalink Skewed and Reviewed's Sasha Glenn gives thoughts on The Maze Runner and how it compares to The Hunger Games over at sknr.net. The Maze Runner is 20th Century Fox's attempt at the current trend in Hollywood to cash in on Young Adult-themed science fiction in a dystopian setting. Coming off the heels of hits like The Hunger Games and Divergent, The Maze Runner is the first story in the trilogy of novels by James Dashner. As such, I thought I would use this review space to compare this first film in the trilogy to another. The Maze Runner versus The Hunger Games (self-titled, not Catching Fire) sorry Divergent, I haven't seen you. DIRECTORS The Maze Runner's Wes Ball vs. The Hunger Games' Garry Ross The Maze Runner is Wes Balls first major motion picture, but you wouldn't know it because the visuals and pacing are fantastic. Garry Ross, on the other hand, directed both Pleasantville and Seabiscuit prior to The Hunger Games. Both great movies, however this slow thoughtful style I feel was not the best choice for the action-paced-with-thought story of the hunger games. Guess that's why he was replaced for Catching Fire, which is a superior film. Advantage: The Maze Runner for more, visit: http://sknr.net/2014/09/19/maze-runner/
6.0~Solid but let's itself down too often evanobrien100 Sign in Permalink There are a plethora of recent Hollywood trends sequels, remakes, reboots and behemoth CGI orgies. I feel as if though it's the rampant young adult novel adaptations are the ones that inherently work really well on a cinematic level. There's a lot to admire in the Maze Runner that YA fiction really excels at. It helps capture the angst, identity crises, the sense of desperation and claustrophobia. This manifests itself to awaken the characters survivalist instincts. The premise is rock solid, the performances surprisingly come off well, the atmospheric direction is suitably dower, the initial world building is absolutely convincing. The establishment of the characters and their relationships towards one and other are what I thought worked on a meaningful level, it's something that isn't done nearly often enough. There are a few developments and moments where the film agonizingly let's itself down though and on more than a few occasions. It does this before it can properly cement itself as a solid piece of work. I couldn't help but notice the outright dialogue over dubbing especially in relation to the character of Newt. Every line he delivered I could tell was so clearly recorded in a studio and not the natural environment of the movie. There are a couple of times especially towards the end where the movie has some twists and turns that do demean the compelling narrative the film had built for itself. It's a shame considering how much I had significantly enjoyed proceedings up until those one or two moments. The good outweighs the disappointing ultimately. It's not world changing but it does make a fine companion piece to the Hunger Games which is a significantly more striking set of YA novels and adaptations.
7.0~Surprising Addition to the Child Dystopian Genre view_and_review Sign in Permalink I watched The Maze Runner to see how much like or unlike Hunger Games it would be. By the trailer alone it looked very akin to the few, already released, dystopian flicks featuring teens (ala Hunger Games, Divergent, and even Ender's Game). I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was distinguished enough from the aforementioned movies and yet still good. As you probably guessed, the movie is about a maze. The movie starts off pretty intense. You are immediately thrust into the impending situation. It bodes well for the flow of the movie because you are experiencing everything as the main character, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), experiences it. The movie moves along at a nice pace and there was one particularly refreshing aspect. Most movies featuring a number of boys and teens have the typical issues: alpha male, the click, the outcasts, the new guy, et al. In this movie you saw these young men making a concerted effort to work together and put their egos to the side in order to survive. Thomas broke up the structure they had to some degree, but it wasn't without good cause. I liked the movie. It had a nice balance of intensity and mystery. The actors, and more importantly, the characters, were bearable. Not very often you see something like that.
5.0~Doing Okay Until the End... datemaru Sign in Permalink Maze Runner is accused of being a Hunger Games rip off. Well yes, but is that really that bad? It is end you do it poorly. Maze Runner is about a bunch of teenagers trapped in a staging area of some sort and the only way out is through a maze. I thought Maze Runner would be about finding their way through the nightmarishly complex maze full of traps, dead ends, monsters, and praying you find an end. *Major Spoiler* You find out they already mapped it out. Yeah, by the time Thomas, our hero, arrives he is told by the Asian kid (whose name I'm not sure they ever use) that they already mapped out the whole thing. There are 8 sections and every day one section will open and the other even will close. At the end of each section is a number. In short, what the movie should have been about, is summed up in two minutes of conversation. Thomas manages to kill one of the monsters and they get a device of it which unlocks a new area which has the exit. But one of the leaders is convinced Thomas has done nothing but bring danger to them by killing the monster which makes little sense because we don't have the context for it. Douche teen (again, I don't remember his name) says they've always coexisted with the monsters which makes no sense since they seem really dangerous and determined to kill them. To make matters worse, that night, they're attacked by the monsters and many of the teens killed. With little to lose, Thomas leads most of the teens (minus douchbag and a handful of his followers) through the maze and it turns out those numbers were exit code. That would have been cool if we were there to see them find the numbers. They go out of the maze and into some hall and find an exit sign. Which is actually the only funny scene in the movie. And this is were the movie really flies off the rails. It turns out its Resident Evil. I'm not kidding. It's not a Resident Evil movie, but the sun scorched the Earth, most of the human race was killed, and then some rage virus broke out. These teens are the only ones immune to the virus and this was some kind of test which raises a million questions like: 1) Why risk killing the few people immune to the virus? 2) Why erase their memories? 3) If you needed to test them and make sure they were ready to take back the world, why not tell them and send them to a military style training facility? 4) Why didn't you tell them the truth? Wouldn't saying "you're seriously our only hope or its the end of the human race" be a pretty good motivation? 5) If you could build a sustainable environment like where the kids were living with these giant walls, why not just move in and live there? Then are questions like how much they don't climb the vines. Sure they say they don't go all the way to the top, but I can clearly see they do!Why not say there are auto-turrets that will kill you or something? Maybe in the book that its based on the vines really don't go to the top which means the movie added a plot hole. Also the teens themselves really aren't that interesting. I remember Thomas, girl, douche bag, leader/black kid, Asian teen, teen who seems to be Thomas's other friend, and Chuck/Piggy from Lord of the Flies. I will say I'm kinda' interested in seeing the sequel so it didn't kill my interest that much, but this movie is really stupid when you get to the twist. And that whole exploring the maze would have made for a more interesting movie. Or a pretty decent video game where you have to explore a maze in a time limit before night comes while dodging traps, monsters, and changing walls, find a number and then put it into a code to get out. That be pretty cool.
1.0~Running on empty... joker-scar Sign in Permalink I saw this trailer and it totally turned me off from seeing it. 2 years later and now it is on Netflix so...hey why not I've already paid the monthly fee. This film is a typical teenage-hero-fantasy plot..and as with teenagers has no real logic or sense. I can go on and on about faulty plot, characters, cliché's, etc. but others have already pointed those out in previous reviews. 5 minutes into this film I thought that if this "maze" is not a mental construct and is actually a real construction, then it is stupid from the get go. In this "destroyed " earth how could anyone build such a maze, a vastly expensive...in material, time AND labor, it is simply impossible. It would be a billion dollar, 20 year endeavor in a fully functional and working society let alone a devastated planet. Every movie must have its rules, no matter how far fetched or fantasy based, this plot hole alone is clearly lazy writing. Also, this is the first film and it should, even though it is a "series", should still end on a satisfying note as the end just like any other single film regardless, but it ends on a cliffhanger which equals it being a total whore to a sequel. Even STAR WARS can be seen as a separate film without watching the rest BUT this film is a total tease to watch the next one. No thanks...rather stick a pencil in my eye.
7.0~Nice movie, has it flaws, but who's to blame? G_R_Davies Sign in Permalink Notes: Let me begin by stating that I did enjoy the movie, but my words to come can sound harsh. But are my words/frustrations a reflection to the movie itself? Spoilers come in several degrees and I can't complain without pointing to certain details, but don't worry it won't be spoiler-spoilers. I won't reveal other than the obvious. Review: Maze Runner is yet another attempt by Hollywood to create another Harry Potter/Twilight/Hunger Games series. Those are the successful ones. Failures were I'm number 4, Enders Game and i'm indecisive about Percy Jackson. They don't measure up against the former. And making an attempt i'm OK on that, but where Hollywood is trying to maximize their income by cutting up the latter parts - with Harry Potter it was OK, the books became thicker, but with Hunger Games? Come on, that's stealing! - it shamelessly is apparent that we are going to get a sequel with this one, a textbook open ending. Up yours Hollywood, we're not walking wallets! And yes I know I can choose not to go, but you also know it doesn't work like that. The movie itself is based on a trilogy book series, which i haven't read, so i can't make that comparison, but the first movie has an interesting premise. Boys are dropped inside a camp inside the center of a Maze and their memories are wiped. Can they escape? Essentially they know as much as the viewer/reader, feeding you with questions and like the characters will you get the answers? And the movie does it quite well in a quick pace. One minor gripe, it's based on a children/young adolescent book, so sometimes "problems" are solved in a too easy way. I'm not talking about realism but is it probable in the 'given universe of the movie'? If you can look past that, the movie is quite enjoyable and in the end they feed you with more questions. I'm sure I want to know the answers. Hopefully I will get them in the sequel. 7 out of 10.
3.0~Maze idiots najibelmortaji Sign in Permalink I found it... well. ridiculous and very disappointing. I like mazes and smart movies and that's why i decided to watch the film without knowing nothing about it. From the first 5 minutes, i knew my decision was bad. We have a hero who is an idiot and we cannot identify with him in any sort of way + the way that the script introduce the maze is cheap and without any effect. If you like these kind of movies and you're probably a teen, just watch it you won't notice what's wrong about it. If you like movies and have really a criticizing ability, skip it, it had many plot holes and you will laugh a loooot through it, the bad way. No fun for me in movies lately !
5.0~Grow up... nicky_hansard Sign in Permalink To the reviewers who gave this less than 3 - shame on you. Also in my opinion anybody who gave it more than 7 has no business writing reviews or voting on films. Now for my reasons and logic. I fully understand how conceited and arrogant the above paragraph sounds - and it is. However the beginning of the movie (let's say the first 30 minutes) was by no means bad and the last hour or so was ridiculous and illogical. Giving a movie with surprisingly good teen actors and a few solid sections of film anything less than 3 is atrocious, you should be ashamed of yourself and anybody willing to ignore the atrocious plot holes and illogical sequences of the film and giving the film above a 7 is equally atrocious. I understand why you do this, you're angry that other people don't agree with your opinion of the film, so your exaggerated scores are your way of getting some sort of twisted revenge (while I admit that some people would genuinely give this film a ten or a one, your opinion is bad, it really is). This is a ridiculous comment that I'm making but it is a necessary one. You people ruin the point of IMDb and other sites like it. Don't vote with your emotions, that's not the point of a review, you are supposed to be reviewing these movies to the best of your ability in an unbiased manner. An eye for an eye mentality never works, even if your reasoning is that 'well that person gave it an unjustly low score so I'm going to give it a ridiculously high score' than you're as bad as that other person, who was more than likely simply responding to somebody else with the same mentality as yourself. Now for my reasoning as to why anything less than a 3 or more than a 7 is way of mark. The good aspects. Interesting concept - albeit used before. Interesting opening sequence that created a particular atmosphere of suspense. Unusually good teen actors - the majority were anyhow. Interesting visuals and designs. Interesting social commentary - perhaps not intended - about safety verse freedom, about the good of the many verse the good of the view, about cultural conditioning verse unbiased reasoning. The bad aspects. Plot holes - e.g. Why did that particular part of the griever serve as a key. They were machines that were entirely mechanical, they would have had many parts of their body of similar appearance. How did the 'creators' know the Gladers would be able to kill these seemingly unstoppable robots and than have the insight to know that this particular part was a key after dissection - it wasn't a dissection in anyway shape of form to begin with. They could have built a ladder with the abundance of trees and nailed them to the wall of something of this nature. The importance of sector 7 was never mentioned, the 7 displayed on the part of the machine they took was thought to indicate where the griever had come from, so what if it had come from sector 6? Was there another exit or did all grievers originate from sector 7? What if they hadn't discovered the order that the maze changed in and how would they know it would be important, if they didn't all ready know that? How did they decide what was the beginning of the sequence? Did something particular happen when the maze reset to the beginning of the sequence? Perhaps it was something to do with the beginning of the sequence being assumed to be Sunday? How would they know that anyway. Why did the grievers come out after they found the entrance? What if they didn't know the sequence that the maze reset itself in? They would have not survived much longer if they didn't escape so they would have been dead without that information. I'll leave it at that for now, perhaps I missed some important key information that explained these issues. How did Calley make it to the control room. Now for non plot hole problems. Why the girl? Why not another male? Why didn't the dudes in the helicopter come to the middle of the maze, I realize they were in on it but that's a dead giveaway that they aren't what they seem to be. If our hero is as smart and as curious as we are supposed to believe than that is inconsistent writing. Stupid character motivations and inconsistencies in the story. Aka Calley. The rest besides Chuck weren't that bad. Why send Thomas in if he works for you? If they are special why does it matter about them personally, study those kids and find an antidote, obvious scientists believe there is something of a mystical nature special about these subjects, it's called genetics. There are more but I think that's enough to get my point across.
10.0~Sit Down and Stop Running Richie-67-485852 Sign in Permalink For shear entertainment, here you go! Watch this movie not knowing anything about it and you will be enthralled, tensed and very curious to the point where you hang on every word to find out what is going to happen as well as what just did happen. Having no major stars allows the viewer to concentrate on the story. Just when I thought it would end, we are introduced to yet another scene and then another each one holding you and perplexing you. That's one hell of a good story and movie if that can be accomplished. When the movie finished, I couldn't wait to want to know more of this story and I was very pleased to hear there were books out and sequels coming. This type of movie watching takes us back to the fifties where a good story is what made the movie and if you add good directing, sound and all the rest, it becomes memorable. Recommend finger foods to break the tension like popcorn and sunflower seeds. Definitely a tasty drink and no cell phones or distractions. You want the movie to have you and nothing else. Let it!
7.0~It's all confusing.. merrilanil Sign in Permalink With Every hope that Dylan o' Brien will woo me again with his wit and charm just as he did with the character of Stiles in Teen wolf, I entered the hall to watch The Maze runner, also armed with a confidence that came from having read the book, but the fact is that rather than watching the movie, I spent the entire 113 minutes checking for the discrepancies between the original book and its movie version. So you could say that I was rather going through a check sheet than watching the movie. It is completely different to the book. Yes they have picked up the basics from the book but the narration, details and execution are all totally different. I can't blame Dylan o' Brien for anything firstly because owing to my crush and secondly he was playing a character that in itself was a confusing one in the original book itself. If you have read the book, you will be confused as to what exactly the character of "Thomas "is and considering that I would say Dylan has actually brought some life and credibility to the character and has given his best with the limited resources he had. What was pricking me through the whole movie was the casting. Everybody almost seemed to be casted in the wrong roles. For example Thomas Sangster was kind of out of place as Newt and looked more perfect for the role of chuck. Similarly Will Poulter who played the role of Gally, looked more apt for the character of Newt or Alby . Aml Ameen would have suited the description and role of Gally much more than the character of Alby that he played. So half of the time I was finding it difficult to place these actors according to the book description. For me, it was like watching wrong faces in wrong body. But while at it I would say Dylan was convincing as Thomas and Will Poulter though given a wrong character brought out the best in the movie and is definitely one who manages to stand out in the movie.
7.0~The good performance of some actors, special effects and the mystery of the environment in which they found themselves is enough to keep the audience interested. pedjoane Sign in Permalink Not bad! The good performance of some actors, special effects and the mystery of the environment in which they found themselves is enough to keep the audience interested. It also has a good direction that didn't put the typical teenage romance, that can be so tiring. However, in my opinion, "The Maze Runner" is unable to get it to be thrilling.The film comes to an end without knowing the answer to several questions in order to make room for the second film. So I will be waiting for a new episode and news surprises from Wes Ball and T.S. Nowlin in "Scorch Trials" :)
3.0~The book is great. Read it. anamatrix421 Sign in Permalink *Cue* This is more of a rant than a review, but I've seen worse on here. - - - The book is great. Read it. The movie. . .? Eh, well we're getting to that. The director, producer, and a few of the cast say that the adaptions were going to be to the 'fans liking'. I think not. TO me, although in some strange circumstances is close to impossible, a book-to-movie adaption should be a close to the book as possible. Here they did little to nothing of the sort. A few examples: They keep saying, 'three years' instead of 'two years'-- this fact was very much established in the first book and so on. --My opinion- they put it in there to have it be more dramatic. PLEASE never do that again. Many of the character designs were the unexpected. This one is self-explanatory. Many of the characters switch their roles. Example: In a scene from the book which was excluded completely from the movie, a Griever gets into the Glade and scales up the Homestead wall-- in which the ultimate conclusion is-- Alby dies. Gally was supposed to die in that scene. . . But naw. Shuck it. We'll make Alby die (Although, in retrospect, in almost every movie I've scene--the black guy/guys/girl dies first. Although it wasn't that case here, surprisingly...) And lastly, the camp's design. Sticks and rocks. Yeah. No stone. No concrete. Just sticks. Poles. And rocks. Even the Homestead seems to have suffered, being it is now degraded, from the third little pig's brick house, down to his little brother's; a stick house. Yeah. Sticks. And the Map Room. Now sticks. Made of STICKS. And it very clearly says, many times, and I quote, from The Maze Runner book-- "iron door of the Map Room". Can you put a iron door on a house of sticks? You could, but to no actual success. - - Conclusion- Movie sucks.
2.0~Really not worth it shannonb_04 Sign in Permalink As someone who truly loved the books, this was seriously disappointing. I understand that films often go away from their book plots, but I think that the direction the film went was ridiculous in comparison to the books. There were times I was thinking...what's going on? This makes no sense whatsoever! Anyways, just don't be surprised to be disappointed if you love the book! Regarding the film itself, it was really slow getting. I felt a lot of the acting was forced. My husband, who has no background in the story, was confused sometimes (yes the story has some mystery to it, but there are issues with the film plot). It seemed like a rip off of many other movies around, but the all around big picture is somewhat original and interesting. If you are really interested in this movie, I would recommend renting it. It's not worth the money to buy it or see it in a theater. But that is just my opinion.
9.0~Its a spectacular thrilling movie!! haroonshareef Sign in Permalink I really don't know why many people hate this movie and why so less rating....But for me this movie is so good...Its so thrilling and makes you to watch the second movie...Its so thrilling.Thomas is very confident....His appearance in the maze just changed everything.... There may be many questions occurring to you but don't worry you will soon know everything.....The actors are good..And the movie is awesome!!!There isn't much description in this movie about who sent those teenagers in the maze and I think they will explain it all in the second movie.....Every month a new boy will be sent by the people....Everything gets interesting when Thomas arrives....This movie is awesome !!! Its a must watch movie for you!
8.0~Very gritty and atmospheric, pretty good writing Horst_In_Translation Sign in Permalink This is a 2014 movie which runs for 106 minutes (without credits) and throws the audience right into the action. We see the protagonist being thrown into an entirely new world and together with him, we explore what is going on. Actually, we never know more than the characters do and I liked that. Discovering the maze and the area where the boys live was a pretty great viewing experience in my opinion. The group dynamics were fascinating to watch (friends, foes, runners...) and one reason for this was that all the boys who were major characters looked pretty differently. That made it a lot easier to understand who is who and what each one of them was like. Talking about the maze, the idea that it constantly changes is not new, but it worked well in this scenario. This was a very atmospheric movie. Another thumbs up for making it work. The location is pretty much the same for the whole film and it's not too easy to keep it from getting repetitive, but they did. There aren't any really famous actors in here (unless you count Oscar nominee Clarkson), but that's not needed. It's all about the script and this one is definitely a success. It's only the first feature film for the director and the writing staff also wasn't experienced at all, so it's certainly a positive surprise that they came up with something so good here. I am definitely looking forward to their next projects. But lets also not forget the novel writer. About "The Maze Runner", there will be a second film coming out in roughly 3 months and a third in 2017, also based on the literary works of James Dashner. Still, I have some minor criticisms. I don't think the girl added as much to the film as I hoped she would, even if she was extremely hot. They certainly could have made more from her storyline. Maybe some inner conflicts within the group. I mean nobody was even horny and they didn't see females for years. I thought the way Thomas was almost treated like a Jesus and how he becomes the leader of the group after a couple days only was slightly too heroic for my taste. And I liked the first half more than the second. Basically when their quest to freedom really gets going, the film gets a bit worse, maybe also because it focuses more on action sequences and fights against the grievers. I am also not entirely sure what to think of the ending. It's not really clear if the other people outside were good or bad. Before Clarkson's character shoots herself (or did she?) it looks like they were good which would also make sense if Thomas was one of them as they said several times near the end. But Clarkson's character appeared again at the end and there she seemed evil. We will see about that in the next movie. With the ending this film has (friends and foes die), it was obvious already when they made it that there would be more movies. I hope the next ones will be equally good again as the first half of this film here. I enjoyed watching "The Maze Runner" and highly recommend it. One of 2014's finest.
8.0~A gripping action flick movie. missjutekbanget Sign in Permalink Well, I haven't read the book. But now I want to read it so badly because many people said they didn't included several material that would add more substance to this overall a good movie, and after I watch it I felt the same. Not that this movie lack substance, far from it, But sometimes, the action flick is too much for me to handle. I wish they crop several useless action flick and add something more interesting stuff. Love it when a Movie create a decent multifaceted character like this to drive the story, and it's make them more human. For me what drive's this movie is the character. Overall I love it and I can't for their next chapter.
7.0~Mediocre-High expectations from an AMAZING book, big disappointment for movie.*IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOKS THEN READ THEM* lindseeeeyc Sign in Permalink So when I first saw the trailer for the Mazerunner movie and the great reviews on the book, I decided to read the book myself. I thought it was incredibly amazing, it honestly beat the Hunger Games series for me. I eventually ended up reading the two other books to the trilogy; going to buy the prequel soon. FIRST OF ALL, the trailer already was messed up. The biggest change was that the Maze WAS NOT suppose to work that easy to be honest, with that metal device thing they found in that griever. Let me begin with the things I WANTED to see and they SHOULD'VE shown. For some reason, Gally seemed more weak to me in the movie than he was in book. I imagined him completely despising Thomas, like so much hatred was in him that made him insane. While Thomas stuck himself in the Maze with Minho and Alby, MINHO was suppose to show a weak side of him; run away, freak out, cry.. THOMAS was suppose to be the only one to tie up Alby on the vine and THAT was how Minho and him grew so close, how he believed in Thomas so much. That scene in the Maze with them was one that stood out for me in the book- because Minho, being a strong headed tough guy, was weak! He was negative! And that's when Thomas was suppose to change his mind about everything he believed in. I WAS REALLY MAD/DISAPPOINTED THAT I DIDN'T SEE THAT PART. The biggest fail was the way out of the maze.. it was suppose to be more complicated getting out and finding the exit. THE CLIFF. THE CLIFF! That blew my mind in the book- the idea, and I didn't see it, once again! Seriously, some device that leads you to the exit.. how easy compared to the book. There's not really any changes I liked.. I think I would say it was good just cause the casting was awesome. Wish I could've seen the sassy Minho I fell in love with from the book.. and more of Chuck (even if he wasn't one of my favorites) because I didn't really feel for his death in the movie. I'm sure my review would be the complete opposite if I haven't read the book and haven't become such a fan of the series... but books are better than movies anyway. This was a poor adaptation of the book though :/ I also forgot how Newt's limp is really important as well.. because in the last book, he tells Thomas that he tried to commit suicide in the Maze, that he really just hated living, therefore wanting Thomas to kill him when the Flare was getting into him (not being immune, sadly). It was the shuckiest shuck- faced move to not put such important details in the movie from the book. Low expectations for the other movie(s) of the series. The movie was better in my head when I was reading the book, but I absolutely adored the cast, they are amazing and did great jobs of following the script so 7/10 overall but 10/10 cast!!
5.0~It had everything but the Script logueybear Sign in Permalink OK, the actors are good, the maze itself is brilliant and stunning but sadly the thing that lets this film fall flat is the script that cuts just that little bit too much out of the book. The book is packed with plot and character moments that are important and I can understand that adapting this book would be a real challenge but they lose too many of the moments that help build character and mystery. I find the premise falls flat after the great opening. The mystery seems to evaporate and it never gains ground as the plot is simplified just that little bit too much. The scenes go by without enough breath between them and it never quite builds in terms of character and mystery. Teresa is a good example of a character who has been made less important and interesting thanks to the plot and mystery becoming thinner. The direction is strong enough to deliver tension during the scenes in the maze but when it comes to the story telling it loses it way with too little. The movie to me should have bee 2 hours plus with events following the book more closely. Particularly with Teresa who in the film doesn't do much for the plot or story. In the book, her and Thomas can telepathically communicate making the connection between the characters stronger and making the mystery deeper and more complex. There are moments in the film where I can see brilliance but the story didn't do enough to help make them more powerful. Overall, the script over simplified a complex story. I hope the next one doesn't suffer from the same troubles.
7.0~From a reader's point of view brandnewlaw310 Sign in Permalink Overall the movie was great in its own way, although I found myself yelling at the screen at some points. I was hoping that the script would stick as close to the book, but there were some parts where I felt if I didn't read the book I would be scratching my head in confusion. One scene in particular where Alby gets taken away in the Glade instead of by the griever hole made me upset. In general with Alby's character, the movie did not portray him as a strong leader as he was in the book. They could have used more of the terminology too. Also in the end the woman was suppose to talk about leaders and the group b. Therefore there were more than just one group of teens being tested. Last but certainly not least, did it bother anyone else who read the book that Teresa and Thomas did not talk telepathic at all because that really is one of the main reasons why they stand out the most?!?! Other than those points and Gally's character being too nice since he didn't go through the changing, the movie was how I imagined and more. The grievers and maze were way better looking than I imagined.
7.0~Good, but not great. Gracelovesmovies Sign in Permalink This movie feels a lot like the Hunger Games mixed with the Lord of the Flies, so the concept and content is already a winner but the pacing is awful. We don't get a chance to feel the boys' relationships grow. Things happen too fast in a way that makes the it hard for me to feel empathy and emotional attachment to the characters, rather than making the movie more exciting. The acting is not that great-the lead is very stiff and unnatural in many parts of the movie, and the curly haired kid's death was badly acted as well. Kaya was not that believable in this movie too, and neither was the blonde scientist. However, the concept and execution of the maze was very nice to watch. I had to strain my eyes badly to make out what was happening during the night scene when Grievers attacked, but otherwise I found the movie quite visually appealing. I'd say this movie is worth watching and is a good way to pass time, but I am still a bit disappointed by the execution. The director had a great story to work with but didn't make it come through that well. Between this and the Hunger Games, I'd say HG beats this in all aspects.
5.0~Mediocre. timoros Sign in Permalink Reminded me a lot of the excellent film "Cube". But sadly it is not even half as good as the original. I have not read the book so I cannot comment whether or not is a good adaptation of the book. I like a lot the "dystopia" settings and films like that, but this film was way too predictable, and many times made me wonder "why the heck they don't even try this" to get out of the maze. Like, why they did not build a ladder, if not to escape, at least to see what is happening beyond the wall. They have an entire detailed map of the labyrinth and they have not even tried to climb the outer walls, even just to take a pick what is happening outside? I wonder sometimes with the people writing those scripts. They really believe people are that stupid and not at all innovative? A nice idea but ....
5.0~What the hell were the screen writers thinking gabiliron7 Sign in Permalink I'll keep this short. Even for a Sci-Fi movie this movie makes no sense. I saw the movie with my 14 year old son, who is not as picky as I am regarding continuity, logic and so on. By the time the movie was drawing to a close he was complaining as much as I was, and actually wanted to leave the cinema. The action was OK, and the effects were as we have come to expect from a block-buster, but the complete lack of reason is so extreme that I could not disregard it. From about 20 minutes into the movie all I could think about was "why would some one do that". I would skip this one, maybe "Maze runner 2" would be better.
6.0~enough action to cover up lack of character development kaveroneau613 Sign in Permalink This film, based off of the YA best-selling novel, is one of the biggest adaptations to hit theaters since The Hunger Games. Originally when reading the book, the first thing that came to mind was that it's story would be much better told through the medium of film. After seeing the film, I still stand by my original thoughts. Action-packed, quick-paced, and full of suspense, this film does a nice job of covering up the cheesy dialogue and lack of character development. In adventure stories such as this one, we -- the viewers -- expect to see the characters go through some kind of transformation throughout the film. Unfortunately, in the case of the main character, Thomas, this does not happen. He remains the same throughout the entirety of the film -- bland. The characters are all incredibly cheesy and contradictory to the plot of the film. However, I did find this film somewhat enjoyable because of the quick pace, special effects, and high amounts of action that leave you gripping the edge of your seat at times. The plot is so enormous that it covers up the fact that the characters are pretty weak. Overall, I found this film to be entertaining, however I would like to see some kind of transformation and development of the characters if there are films to come -- which, seeing as this looks like it's going to be the biggest new franchise in the dystopian genre of film, I'm sure there will be.
3.0~hmmm.. didn't i see this movie before? ah yes, about a 1000 times tuvalmor Sign in Permalink Seen the "maze runner" yesterday, please don't listen to the critics, which I keep getting the strong feeling that they are getting paid by some the disturbers. It's a pretty bad movie, you will watch it feeling that the screenwriters just did copy paste from every somewhat successful movie that has been done lately, he even thrown in at the last second a Kristen Stewart look a like complete with the half dumb look in her eyes, since the movie is pretty much all made from well kept only boy teens do seems a bit over the top very gay, in any case most of the acting was OK even though you are wondering did the deserted characters had a beauty salon close by that fixed their hair every two hours? the script was lame and movie time way too long, so save your self a good two hours of your life and go do something else , something fun, maybe running?
9.0~One of the most unique book franchises out there flblueeyedboy Sign in Permalink Only seen this movie once, but the execution and plot are brilliant! The land itself is spectacular. The perfect example of Louisiana backwoods bayou country. Any fans of book franchises like The Hunger Games and The Hobbit would most likely enjoy this feature. The story sucks you in until every detail is revealed, and until you know the truth, you regret having to pause the movie and come out of the trance. The grouping of characters of different accents, races and nationalities gives a sense of equality to the movie. There is a star and hero of every kind of race. Overall 'The Maze Runner' is a very impressive piece of work, worthy of a book movie trilogy. I would have given it a 10 if the end wasn't such a cliffhanger.
7.0~nice to watch stivekech Sign in Permalink i just watch this movie and its so amazing in terms of concept and the characters, I'm suggesting everyone to watch it. :) this is info i read from wikipedia before i watch it: he Maze Runner is the first book in a young-adult post-apocalyptic science fiction trilogy of the same name by James Dashner.[1][2] The novel was published October 2007 by Delacorte Press, an imprint of Random House and is being made into a 2014 major motion picture by 20th Century Fox. The novel spawned two sequels: The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure. James Dashner has also written a prequel to The Maze Runner entitled The Kill Order, that came out in 2012.[3]
8.0~Not As Bad As All The Haters Make Out Steveredrum2003 Sign in Permalink The Film had a different theme compared to most out at this time. The Maze Runner is a brilliant film. Right from the first scene the mystery surrounding the main character & what the point of the maze is, has the viewer intrigued. The maze is ominous & creepy. The action & running scenes in the maze are exciting. The only flaw in the movie is the creatures in the maze, known as Grievers. The makers of the movie should have made them a lot scarier. Dylan O'Brien is outstanding as Thomas. Aml Ameen is effective as Alby. Ki Hong Lee is great as Minho. Blake Cooper is brilliant as Chuck. Thomas Brodie-Sangster is excellent as Newt. Will Poulter is amazing as Gally. Dexter Darden is impressive as Frypan. Kaya Scodelario is awesome as Teresa. The supporting characters are brilliant as well. The Maze Runner is a must watch.
9.0~Very pleased deelusionalmusic Sign in Permalink I went in to watch this movie not knowing much about it. I have never read the books and didn't even really know the full synopsis either. I figured the movie would be decent at best. Much to my surprise, I was wrong. This movie was so awesome it really blew me away. The special effects and monsters in the movie are freaking awesome. If you have any second thoughts about watching this, put them to the side and get ready for one heck of a thrill ride. You won't regret it. I will say that, I didn't much care for the boy who played off of we're the millers. His character was a bit lame. The plot was really cool and intriguing. Again, me not knowing anything about the movie helped me grow to like it. I have heard that those who have read the book didn't really care for the movie, but I would say it's a nice little gem. They're already filming part 2 as well, so hop on the train while it's fresh and enjoy your viewing.
6.0~a little bit of excitement andrew-wiltshire Sign in Permalink Not a bad movie. It sucks you in for the most part into the characters mission of escaping from the maze/maze camp. It achieves this despite none of the characters themselves doing anything to make you interested their well-being. I mean you care about them insofar as they are human and seem to generally be nice people but none are particularly likable and all are fairly bland (a result of poor duologue and poor acting). The blandness of the characters doesn't detract from your absorption in the movie toooo much, I'm guessing partly because it is part of the premise of the movie that the characters are thrown into the maze camp without any self-knowledge (can't remember what they were like before they woke up in maze-land). The movie is at its weakest when it tries to develop the characters and make you more emotionally involved. These scenes (for example a scene where the Chuck is talking about wanting to get home to his parents) are completely ineffective and generally laughable. The story that is built around their attempt to escape keeps you interested. The maze itself looks cool and is believable. The ends a bit of dud. It's predictable and doesn't really add any substance to the overall movie Overall there is enough in this movie to keep you interested and provide a bit of excitement but you won't walk away with anything besides that.
10.0~I almost made the mistake of not watching this movie based on the bad reviews qmco Sign in Permalink I LOVED IT!!!!.... From beginning to end, AWESOME MOVIE!!!.... The people who gave this movie a bad review must have some pretty tough criteria for what they consider good... Or they are just flat out insane!!... They DEFINITELY have their bar set WWWWAAAAAYYY up there!.... If I could rate this movie higher I would.... My recommendation is to just watch it for yourself and decide... can't please everyone I guess Says my review is too short, gotta add lines Excellent acting.... plot and story are original, suspenseful, and keep you wondering what is going to happen next... Effects were spot on... typical setting up for possible sequel twist at the end.... I don't know if this is a movie based on a book, but it did have the feel of a larger story crammed into a small movie time frame like it is a shortened version of a great book... I'm going to look into it for sure... must be a great read!
9.0~The Next Big Thing stefangriff Sign in Permalink Having read the book before going to see the movie I had a nervous feeling of how good this film was going to be and how closely it would tie in with the books and with recent flops like "The Host" and "Beautiful Creatures" I didn't want them to ruin it; But all of those feelings were for nothing, the movie throughout showed fluent story and very much followed the book give or take a few scenes changed or extended. Watching this film in the Cinema gave me an on the edge of the seat moment throughout just like the books did, i loved how they created the max into a real life situation from fantasy form to real life. i thought that the casting was amazing especially "Teresa's" casting and the movie has now become a new favourite up there with the likes of "The Hunger Games" and "How To Train Your Dragon". Such a thrilling book and such an incredibly amazing film that has got me so excited for "The Scorch Trials" i cannot even wait BRING ON September 2015!!!!!!!!!!
1.0~Crap! I only kept watching because i wanted to believe it would get better, but it got worse! ripeandfresh Sign in Permalink I couldn't believe the characters because the things they did were too stupid and shallow. The "resolve" at the end to help explain this bizarre situation just annoyed me because i found the premise of it entirely illogical, even degrading of human intelligence. which killed it for me. I wouldn't bother watching this , or recommend it to anyone i can think of, the acting of the lead was not terrible and neither was some of the other acting, the graphics were good and it was imaginative but the whole thing was founded on a concept that betrays believability even at a stretch and given the bizzarity of the premise, it really needed some kind of half descent reason to be so in my opinion.
8.0~A movie that keeps you wanting more rdg588 Sign in Permalink As a movie alone, this film is great for individuals who enjoy movies that suck you in and make you think. It has intense moments that leave you wanting more, and make you ask questions. Setting up for a second movie, it leaves you hanging on to the thought that there is more to everything than you first believe. I enjoyed the relationships shown throughout the film, and I thought the actors chosen were perfect for the roles, especially Newt, and Thomas! As an avid reader of all 4 novels, this movie changed a lot of the plot from the book, but still enjoyable. The music heightened every scene and allowed for climactic moments to reach their full potential. I highly recommend this movie to everybody!
8.0~Brilliant story k_who Sign in Permalink I rated this 8 not necessarily because this movie was such a great piece of cinematic art.That it wasn't, even though many of the young actors were brilliant! I rated this "teenage movie" this high because it moved me from the very first scenes - the elevator going up, out of control, the person inside not remembering anything about himself, not even his name. He comes up and he is bewildered, terrified, overwhelmed. And what does he find? That he is caged in a big concrete box, with no escape but through an incredibly dangerous and intricate maze that closes at night fall and changes every night and then opens up again every morning. And there was this sense, from the beginning - there is some hidden meaning behind all this, that he chose this life even if he does not remember doing so. Is this a test? Is this a trial? Are the beings who sent those kids here benevolent, do they care at all, or is this just entertainment to them, like watching ants? To me, layers and layers of deep symbolic meaning permeated the whole action of the film. It resonated, disturbed me and moved me as very few movies do. This movie will soon be forgotten, as it is nothing really special. But the story it tells is universal as long as people continue being born. And it manages to capture this story with rare precision and force.
1.0~Some kids get trapped in a maze and they have to find a way out. sconnellncahs Sign in Permalink I heard that this movie was bad from my friends who had watched it. I just finished the book and wanted to watch the movie anyway. I know that the movie was going to be different than the book but Gally was completely different in the movie than the book. The directors butchered any depth in his character and made him a stereotypical "can't handle change" sort of antagonist. Important scenes and details were either completely changed or not even there in the first place. Where was the Homestead? How come Thomas and Theresa can't communicate telepathically? The entire ending was completely different and it sucked. I didn't like the book that much either but I expected more from a movie that received an award for Best Hero.
10.0~Highh hopes, high expectations, all of them met kzthao4 Sign in Permalink After watching the maze runner, I was seriously surprised by how amazing it was. There were a few parts that I was worried about but then I was mind blown. I was also worried about the major parts of the book that were not going to be incorporated but then again I was surprised. As a teenage who's read all the books I can seriously say that this is probably the best directed dystopia book in comparison to the hunger games.I really recommend this movie, it's auctioned pack and suspenseful. If you want something entertaining to watch, the maze runner should be something you really consider. Dylan O'Brien did an amazing job portraying "Thomas." Thomas is a very intricate character in the book, the author James Dashner wrote the book so you can really understand Thomas and his thoughts, you get to know and understand Thomas in a different way, although the movie does not have Thomas narrate I still believe it was Amazing.
4.0~One of the Worst Endings in Movie History? MattBirk Sign in Permalink Another dystopian movie with children being put through hell for 'the greater good'? No thank you. The movie raises far more questions than it answers and to make things worse, it demands you return for a sequel for 'potential' answers. Other notable movies like 'The Lord of the Rings', 'The Hunger Games', 'Harry Potter' leave questions between films, BUT they don't start a million new questions in the closing minutes of the movie, they all had some sort of closure. Aside from all the unanswered questions, most of the excitement comes from the mystery of the maze, but it is unfortunately overshadowed by the annoying struggle between the inhabitants. The fact that the inhabitants are given a CHOICE to either run the maze or stay and live their lives trapped takes away any sense of urgency. They should be all trying to solve the maze and a way out, but instead they are docile, submissive characters, accepting defeat. Characters on 'LOST' and 'Lord of the Flies' are FORCED to build a society because they have no other alternative, unlike 'The Maze Runner'. Katniss in 'The Hunger Games' is FORCED to kill and survive, which makes the movie more tense and exciting, which yet again makes 'The Maze Runner' feel less appealing. Characters in 'The Maze Runner' have the ability to potentially solve their captivity, but they basically chose not to, where's the excitement in that? In the end, the movie unfortunately solves the mystery of the maze (bittersweet in a sense) and now tells us that phase two has begun, which makes the entire movie now seem completely pointless. The driving force of the movie is the maze and now that that mystery has been solved, the future installments feel completely thin without such an obstacle based on these characters.

7.0~an engrossing YA adaptation lasttimeisaw Sign in Permalink Another YA adaptation gets the green light for a sequel this year, after Shailene Woodley's star-making vehicle DIVERGENT (2014, 6/10), although both are welterweights compared to THE HUNGER GAMES juggernaut as far as rate of return is concerned. THE MAZE RUNNER is unique in its claustrophobic single-location setting (considerably slims down the budget, an estimated $34 million set side by side with $85 million of DIVERGENT), 90% of time the youngsters (boys exclusively) are entrapped in a glade (so they are called gladers) with the only exit is a giant maze with jumbo cybernetic arthropods named Grievers preying them. One asset of the film is that it is utterly engrossing ever since the first scene, there is no conventional post-apocalyptic pretext. Audiences are catapulted to the strange place with our protagonist Thomas (O'Brien), whose memory is erased as those precedent gladers. Save that Thomas intermittently recollects some fragments of his memory with blurry and glitchy flashback sequences, the narrative closely clings to how he adapts a game-changer identity among the group with his agile movability, gallant actions and sharp judgment. Thankfully, it is not a lone hero scenario, the story rightfully homes in on the collective collaboration, with discordance looming around, and a ruthless body count which declares that some key members have no chance returning for the sequel. The action set pieces are not so frequent, but director Wes Ball consistently cashes in the mysterious surroundings to elevate an atmosphere approximate to an edge-of-the-seat thriller, although we are certain they will find a way out, nevertheless the curiosity is resided in the final revelation, who is the heartless mastermind behind-the-scene and why on earth these boys are treated like guinea pigs in a laboratory, for what purpose? The ending only moderately justifies our questions, and leaves a glaring plot-hole (how come Gally finds the way and the password to enter the lab anyway) which necessitates an explanation in the sequel. The young cast has done a crack job, O'Brien, Lee (as Minho), Brodie-Sangster (as Newt), Poulter (as Gally) and Cooper (as Chuck) are all sparklingly prominent in the male-bonding- or-clashing coterie, the only girl Teresa (Scodelario), is an awkward addition, rashly introduced in the middle stream, it is a blessing there is no romance lead to distract our attention, anyway, in a three-day span, it is plausible there is no room for that cliché, but it is a sure thing the chemistry is bubbling under between Teresa and Thomas, and luckily we will wait for it in the second chapter. The movie fully taps into its formidable production design and as a whole it is neat and compelling without any eye-rolling bells and whistles (no nudity, mawkish love story or tangential ego-boosting blah-blah), a 2D version is a satisfactory pick for a Saturday matinée and I will say yes to the next chapter in 2015.
5.0~Book is way better, but there are worse book-to-movie adaptions blackbriar246 Sign in Permalink To start, if you're torn between reading the book first or seeing the movie first, read the book. Then go see the movie knowing that it's changed some things around and is an overall lesser experience. If you HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE RIGHT NOW, then give the book a whirl if you don't absolutely hate the movie. If you read the book, you'll probably be a bit disappointed. The more I think about it, the more things I remember were left out. I'd say that overall the movie kept about 55% of the content from the book. A lot of stuff was either compressed or completely cut. A lot of things were changed around too. Characters act and/or look different, some key elements from the plot are shortened or absent, etc. The movie isn't an incoherent, awful mess like Eragon was, but it isn't as faithful an adaption as the Harry Potter movies were. To give some examples without spoiling anything: the relationships between the characters are shadows of what they are in the book, especially Thomas/Theresa the 'rules' of the Maze are different and thus key events unfold differently the whole story moves much quicker and things happen pretty fast. It's very action-driven and things sort of happen to the characters rather than them figuring things out. I also think that the movie takes place over a shorter period of time than the book. the whole thing is less violent and dark, probably to appeal to the tween girls that cling to leading man Dylan O'Brien's ankles But as I said, not a disaster. Visually, the movie looks pretty decent. The CGI isn't bad and the sets for the Glade, Maze, etc were cool. The acting was all on point, especially Dylan O'Brien and whoever did Chuck and Newt. I remember seeing the Newt dude in Doctor Who a while back. Hopefully they move on to bigger and better things, especially Dylan. the dude's the one bright spot in Teen Wolf and he was also the person who brought this movie up from a 4/10 to a 5. Guy's a good actor. And yea I'll admit, I went into this movie already a fan of his. ANYWAY I'm a bit torn on how I feel about all the changes made.... on the one hand, it grinds my gears a bit because I feel like the book's version of events is better. On the other hand, it keeps things fresh for people who have already read the book. But you know what, if you go to see a movie based on a book you've read, you aren't going for a new experience. You're going to see the story that you read on paper and acted out in your head played out on the big screen. So in that regard, the movie fails. Go into the theater knowing the experience will be different, and you might not hate it. You might even enjoy it a little bit. But on its own, it's a 'meh' movie, and as an adaption, it doesn't do the best job. So if I had to sum up my feelings about this movie in one sentence, it would be: Not the worst thing ever. How's that for advertising. Stick it on the posters and trailers. THE MAZE RUNNER Not the worst thing ever. - blackbriar246
9.0~Entertaining 851222 Sign in Permalink Greetings from Lithuania. "The Maze Runner" (2014) is very well paced, directed and crafted motion picture. It's a very compelling sci-fi, which tells very interesting and involving story. Although the main structure of "The Maze Runner" will probably look familiar if you have seen more then 100 movies in your life, it's still expertly paced and done so you will be glued to your screen for the whole ride. Overall, "The Maze Runner" is not to be missed one if you like sci-fi movies, which are good crafted and tells interesting stories. It's not revolutionary good, but it does a very good job for a one evening viewing. I will look forward for sequels.
7.0~The Maze Runner abouhelier-r Sign in Permalink Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow "runners" for a shot at escape. Since all of us were hoping for yet another young adult novel to be adapted to the big screen, we have The Maze Runner. Apparently this is the new trend in Hollywood since Harry Potter and Twilight have exploded. This film film is directed by Wes Ball and stars Dylan O'Brien (Teen Wolf), Kaya Scodelario, Will Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster among others. It's a pretty well directed movie with a very good lead performance by Dylan O'Brien, who is excellent. Will Poulter (We're the Millers) is also particularly good and his adversary relationship with O'brien's character ad something to the movie. The Maze sequences are very impressive and suspenseful. The creatures are good even if the cgi is not the best we've seen this year and a little obvious from time to time. I liked the tone of the movie as wherever you look 360° is just a big wall, a confine feeling is settling very quickly, a feeling that these guys are really cut off from the outside world. We don't know where they are. Who put them in this maze? Was it human? Was it Alien? Why? All you see is this field in the middle of the maze that's where I feel really isolated and I loved that because that's what you are supposed to feel like. As I said before there are few intense chase scene and in a movie called like this: I want to see that kind of things. That's what the movie delivers. However very quickly you kind of know where the movie is going though, it doesn't keep the intrigue alive too long and "it's in the book!" as friends said to me is not an excuse. Because certain aspects are not working on the screen, keep in mind it's an adaptation. Plus the ending is once again a disappointment. I think I'm doomed to bad endings in young adult novels adaptation. It's one of those endings the more you are thinking about it on the way home the worst it gets. It completely deconstructed the whole movie and make it irrelevant in some way. It does not make sense because the movie does such a good job isolating you, it was all about the environment. This lead me, finally, to the obvious sequel announcement. It's so obvious that when a character said his line I actually laughed. There's going to be another one guys *winky face*. Overall The Maze Runner I liked the movie, it does look good, there are some really good running/chasing sequences, the main actors were very good but the end is a little bit disappointing.
5.0~Not what i expected but still an okay film to watch! pantelisandreou98 Sign in Permalink Based on the popular book series, The Maze Runner is an intense and suspenseful thriller. The story follows a group of young boys that find themselves wiped of their memories and sent into the centre of a giant maze that's constantly changing. What the maze is and why the boys have been placed there is an enticing mystery, and the writing does an impressive job at setting up this world and creating intrigue. Additionally, the performances are fairly good, and the costumes and set designs have an interesting look and feel. However, there are some problems with the storytelling, as it seems a bit rushed at times with some random elements thrown in to add ambiguity. Though it's a little weak on story, The Maze Runner is an entertaining and exciting adventure. 3/5
7.0~The Dylan Show liam-ranga Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner, High anticipated with the female teen community, why? Dylan O'Brien is why not because of his acting because of his looks. Throw Dylan in any movie and it will bring in the big bucks. This movie was enjoyable full of suspense and mystery but the child acting was slightly up par the only stand outs would have to be the high paid actors (Dylan, Thomas and Will) which is a disappointment I was looking forward to a cast of strong memorable characters but I was slightly disappointed. The whole concept of the movie was engaging and the Grievers were great "villains" and weren't just thrown at us they were slowly introduced and you didn't get to see what they looked like for the first 10-15 minutes of the scene you only got to see the legs which was engaging you just wanted to know what had been co-existing with these boys giving them a reason to fear the outside of the walls so they would stay where they were which I guess was part of the test. The ending made me want to watch the second movie, what would Wicked do next? if I read the books I would know but come on lets be honest if your on IMDb your more interested in movies. For the reasons above and more I give this movie a 6.8/10.
7.0~Good of its type utgard14 Sign in Permalink Good 'Young Adult' sci-fi mystery. Better than most YA movies adapted from books. A few expected clichés but, for the most part, it's a smart movie that doesn't lower itself to pander to an audience expecting more of the same they get from similar films. Perhaps most shockingly for a YA movie, there's no central romance. I am unaware of the books and the relationship between the main guy here and the girl introduced later in the film could very well lead to that in a sequel. But here romance is left out of things, which I found refreshing simply because of how tired and predictable that had become with these sorts of films. It's an entertaining movie with good performances and nice direction. I wish it could have been reworked into a complete story rather than stretched out into a series but I understand how the business works with these things. Still, that feeling of being cheated out of an ending so I'm forced to come back for part 2 is enough of a negative to drop my score some.
5.0~Another audience-kept-in-the-dark money-grabber calle_2565 Sign in Permalink I went in to this movie without reading the books, and only watching the trailer. Long story short, I wasn't expecting anything good. But on the other hand, I came out quite satisfied. But only quite. The story centers around a group of children and young adults, trapped in a maze. With seemingly no means of escape. Until one day when two other persons enter the mix. Suddenly things start going go wrong, and the newcomers are apparently to blame. So far so good, the mystic feel is interesting. The characters that is built up are great, it's easy to understand them even if they're not to your liking. The visuals are very impressive, given that the setting is a concrete maze with a forest center. However, there are some things that I don't like with the film: The fact that there is a huge concrete base, out in the open, conducting sick experiment on youngsters, with a forest (while there has been a scorching of the entire world), and the "good guys" ambushing the base in the end has taken (what I can deduct from the dialogue) three years to make a move at the base, the fact that the youngsters didn't wondered why the "good guys" didn't stayed in the base after breaking in to it and putting an "end" of the operation, this is especially directed to the main character, Thomas (that is a character constantly asking questions up until the end of the movie, eh... whatever). The biggest foreshadowing of a characters fate I've seen in a long time. Given, I can see that many of the problems that I have with the film is context based and will probably be explained in the next movies. But it doesn't change the fact that the real plot is rushed, much due to the fact that information has been kept from the characters. But, you have some scorching of the earth, a brain decease, somehow the brain decease is supposed to be connected to the maze-project (somehow is putting kids in a life threatening maze with giant cyborg spiders that gradually making you insane while they show you the truth, supposed to produce a cure). Is it an entertaining movie, yes. Is there things that doesn't make sense, yes. But, given the situation I can buy it. We're kept in the dark just like the characters. But there better be more explaining in the next movie, at least to the viewer. It just feels forced to put all the important information five minutes from the end. Does it make people want to watch the, more than likely, sequel, yes. And like any other series going on at the moment they will probably make a ton of money and drag it out more than needed. To me it's a film that you see once, maybe you see the sequel (which I plan to do, 'cuz I ain't got time fo' them books, son!) and get a tiny more bit information, three more times. Give or take a few films. Give 'em your money...
7.0~Fun and entertaining movie to watch. undeaddt Sign in Permalink I am not a person that likes to give negative reviews and have negative perspective on things, especially when movies are the subject. There for, I like this movie pretty much. Yes, if you read the goofs you will notice that there are a lot of mistakes and things that could have been done to escape the Maze, but they are not done, but still, it is a quality movie with a lot of good moments and tension building in the very best way possible. The acting is top class, all the kids show their talents in acting and that is one of the things I respect the most. 7-8/10 for me.
3.0~Not a good movie. My review contains some events to expect in this movie but I believe they are general in nature. mr-tachyon Sign in Permalink This violent movie has little to offer other than gore and obscure hints of what is coming. It is written in the genre of most of the violent movies coming out of Hollywood except that it is more gross than most. For example , there are gross looking and sounding monsters that tear apart people, and horrible diseases that infect them. There is a woman introduced who does next to nothing and evil seeming female control freaks introduced at the end of the movie, who are saving our world from environmental destruction. Nevertheless, I have liked some violent movies. However, I did not like this one. Note also if you start by watching this one, there are going to be sequels. It reminded me of the book "Lord of the Flies" while I was watching it.
7.0~Runner is Not a Blunder, But Rather Vague rgkarim Sign in Permalink This weekend is a big weekend, with at least three blockbuster movies releasing in my neck of the woods. I start my reviews this weekend with perhaps the most anticipated of the bunch, the Maze Runner. Once again Hollywood has decided to take a book series and run with it, in hopes that it will be the next big series to change the world. Yet like always, the question remains: Is this another glorified mess from the trailers, or have they done a good job? Well with two of my good buddies, I headed to the theater to start my weekend of reviews. I've never read the books, but knowing general trends Maze Runner has some big shoes to live up to. The premise is quite simple, a boy gets sent up to a center of the maze with a handful of other boys, and no memories of where he was before. This familiar bout of amnesia, is apparently normal, and within seconds he is integrated into a culture reminiscent of Lord Of The Flies. Of course, like always, Thomas is the one who defies the normal rules, and starts the journey of change that starts the trilogy. While the story is nothing we haven't seen before, the Maze Runner has some suspense and unknown elements that keeps you latched into the film. Throughout the film, my mind worked to uncover and guess the twists they had at the end, knowing the general nature of the set-up, yet not quite able to figure out the specific details. It is this element, at least for a Maze Runner newbie like me, that kept me into the movie. Despite the underlying mystery though, there were some other elements in the mix that made the Maze Runner an interesting experience. For one thing the movie is well shot and edited together. The entire journey is captured well, each angle well suited to give you the greatest detail in as little transitions. The same techniques remain during the dramatic argument scenes, which, when combined with the audio of booming drums and blaring horns, brings out the emotion and tension the boys are feeling. Yet, the best part of the camera editing are the action scenes, especially concerning the maze. It is always nice to see a movie defy the trend of shaky camera work, forgoing the "realistic" first person perspective for actually showing us the scene at hand. Whether it be running or fighting, the camera is surprisingly stable and well focused on the matter at hand and brings some excitement to a rather slow plot line. Yes, unfortunately the story of the Maze Runner is a little drawn out and at points, rather vague and inconclusive. At first the ambiguity is fun, the multiple, unanswered questions keeping you wondering what path the movie will turn down next. These elements are integrated quite well with character developing moments, allowing more character buildup to help set the stage. However, for this reviewer it's nice to get some answers at points in the movie instead of more questions. Maze Runner for me provided vague solutions to the unknown, leaving more questions with that answer. Now this can be good if there is a nice wrap up to the madness, but for this movie that wasn't the case for me. I know, many are going to say that there are three books and answers come later, but this reviewer wanted a little more wrap up to at least some of the questions that developed over the two hours. To tell you the truth, I felt kind of gipped at the end of the movie, saying at the end, and I quote one of the characters, "Really?" Despite the ambiguity though there are two other elements that help keep the movie going. First off the action is fun and relevant to the plot, the maze portions in particular being an intense fight for survival. Despite being a little savage and gruesome at parts, the evolutionary drive to remain alive is balanced with strategy, running, and fights with primitive tools. The action doesn't seem extra, but is built into the story quite well, spanning the fighting spectrum between the male rivalry to fighting the raging the Grievers. Of course the action is only as good as the acting as well, especially when it comes to interacting with CGI settings. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is the staple to the casting, surprising me with his performance of a male version of Catniss. Unlike the leading lady though, Thomas fought the culprits without being as whiney, a plus in my book for a leading character. O'Brien had a nice balance to his role, passionate and fiery, without crossing into an overacted, melodramatic mess. Lead Maze Runner Minho (Ki Hong Lee) was also a nice supporting character, bringing the wing man role to life and adding a little grounding to Thomas's flamboyant attitude. As for characters like Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Alby (Aml Ameen), Chuck (Blake Cooper), and Gally (Will Poulter), they were good too and each did a nice job playing their respective characters. Though with the exception of O'Brien, the real strength was the chemistry between all the group was the greatest quality of the acting and the community they formed. Overall the Maze Runner is a decent addition to the movie based on book library. There is a nice design to the movie, and a lot of good character building to set the stage in this morbid tale. Acting wise it is enjoyable, but in reality it's the action surrounding the story that got me the most. I still wished though that there was some better wrap up than what we got, despite the opening it provided. Overall a decent movie to watch this weekend, and has elements worth a visit to the theater. My scores are: Action/Mystery/Sci-Fi: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0
3.0~It's like The Hunger Games, but 100x more confusing! Meven_Stoffat Sign in Permalink If you liked The Hunger Games but felt it didn't nearly have enough rules, then The Maze Runner is for you! The Maze runner takes place sometime in the future, where a young man whose name I forget so I'll refer to him as his slang name he gets called, Greeny, wakes up in an elevator and is constantly taunted and teased by all the other ones for not being as gifted and able as the others despite the fact that he only just woke up there. In particular, a kid who looks as if his mother has been giving him Botox injections since he was a toddler stands as the big boss and Jorjen from Game of Thrones stands as the kid who is all "don't worry, guys, he couldn't possibly harm us" nice man with an awful British accent (strangely despite the fact that the actor portraying him is British). Then there's plenty of others but for the first twenty minutes or so, apparently these guys are the only important characters in the movie Anyways so they're surrounded by a maze and nobody can go in at night or they'll be devoured by these monsters called "Grievers" which look like John Malkovich's character in The Hitchhikers Guide to the a Galaxy but with bigger legs. And this is where the film starts to get really problematic. First off, this apparently takes place sometime after the apocalypse, but how on earth did whatever company that made this get all that metal? And if they truly wanted nobody to escape, the walls didn't need to be that high. The height that they are seems to be trying too hard to impress the audience. And as for the Grievers, many problems there too. They can apparently climb the walls. Why don't they? And why are they even there in the first place??? They seem to be thrown in just for the sake of having a big bad guy. They don't even explain it at the end during the typical "we need this explanatory monologue to tell the audience why this movie makes sense and they're wrong to be confused" scene at the end. If you don't have a reason for these creatures then your movie is stupid So anyways, the kid from Teen Wolf, I mean Greeny, and the obligatory Asian guy get locked in the maze for a night and by sheer miracle, Greeny is able to outsmart a griever. Alright maybe it isn't a miracle because Greeny seems to have no problem outrunning him and seems to know what to do, and things only get super complicated when he's squeezing himself through a big set of closing walls and boom, bye bye Griever. So when they get back to the center, he tells them he killed one and instead of being happy they get mad at him. Again, no explanation given why. So he gets promoted to "Runner" status and while out in the maze, where they go find the Griever corpse, they find something lodged in its brain: a canister that acts as their key to their base. Anyways while out in the maze he and wither find that there is a hole where the Grievers get in through, then suddenly the maze goes apeshit on them and they try to make it back to base. Then suddenly a girl pops up! But for some reason she isn't that important. Or maybe she is because she keeps pretty much info dumping the plot. Ugh, I'm going to stop here because the more I type the angrier I get about this movie. But the whole time, I kept thinking about the hunger games, but this had more rules than it, more plot details and at a few points it got so confusing that it felt like a brain workout to continue watching. And not the good kind like Donnie Darko or an early Cronenberg movie. But that here are so many story lines and rules and plot details that. It was almost like they shoved an entire trilogy into one movie. I would say maybe the book is better but considering the book was written by a middle school student, I don't even think the movie even has that advantage. Mind you there are some things I liked about the film. It looked pretty and the special effects a re decent, so they get my 3/10 rating for that, but wooden acting and nonsensical plot really does it in
6.0~Not a solid movie as a whole Seraphion Sign in Permalink A kid wakes up memory-less to some boys, all similarly memory-less, in The Glade, a clearing surrounded by walls of a maze. He remembers his name Thomas as he learns about The Glade; every morning the maze door opens to different sections changing each week, and closes every evening, monsters called Grievers roam the maze at night killing anyone inside, their sting makes the victim go kind of berserk, it's been three years since the first boy came here, every day 'runners' explore the maze looking for an exit to no avail. When a runner is stung by a Griever and sent to die in the maze, The leader Alby goes into the maze retracing the path. Alby returns wounded, carried by the lead runner Minho, just as the door closes. Thomas runs to them, helping to hide Alby from Grievers. He and Minho trick and squash a Griever. The next morning the 'box' elevator shocks everyone, sending a girl with a note "She's the last one EVER". Newt, the second in command, decides to punish Thomas for going into the maze but makes him a runner for the next morning. Thomas and Minho retrieve a device from the Grievr carcass. They then match the device to the maze map pattern. The girl Teresa wakes up and talks to Thomas, giving two syringes which Thomas figures out as Alby's cure. Thomas goes to his punishment when the night comes. The next morning, Thomas and Minho reenter the maze, finding new paths with the device. As they go back, the door doesn't close and Grievers attack that night. After that, Thomas uses a Griever tail to sting himself, discovering after Alby wakes up that it helps return some memory back. Injected with the last syringe, Thomas wakes up knowing he and Teresa were part of the people who put them all in there. Gally, the third in command, decides to offer Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers. But the Gladers are divided; some support Gally while the others want follow Thomas out of there. Thomas' group retrace the new path and Teresa enters the code from the map while the Griievers attack. They escaped and found labs with dead scientists. A video explains what happens; the Gladers were test subjects for brain activity to find a cure for the Flare, a virus attacking the brain, happening after the apocalyptic disaster years ago. But the final scene reveals that there are still more than meets the eye. The story plot looks like an attempt to even more dramatize the novel's original plot. It changes the novel's story quite significantly, opting out some details and thus inevitably changing the nature of some of the significant characters and their roles in the story. In the movie, the story changes from one that has great emphasize to the individual characters and their relationships, to one that only thinks about the characters getting out of the maze. Having only one female in the significant character roster, the movie tries to insert a significant dose of action sequences. This enables it to be recognized as an action genre, and also adding up the ingredients to attract the male young adult viewers, the demography less targeted by most movie releases. It will surely be a great move if only the action sequences are that good. Instead, within the all running actions we only see the characters run, merely run, without any real variation in their moves. The slightest variation comes when the Griever attacks come in. And even those scenes only present the boys to be clueless in what they're doing. The mystery aura is quite well kept for about half of the duration. It's done using the medium paced flow and all those "I only know this" dialog lines. It's still looked maintained for the rest of the duration, but as the focus slightly yet surely shift to the more action oriented sequences, with faster paced story flow, the mystery feels reduced of it's significance. The acting is just a decent overall performance. Having no senior names on the cast sure takes it's toll in the mentoring of the young talents. Dylan O'Brien does his first lead role In a big-budget movie doesn't really disappoint. It's just that the whole movie doesn't seem to have a solid bound over everything it offers. Kaya Scodelario fails to make her only female character in the story to stand out although she did quite okay. Will Poulter used his experience to be confident, yet sometimes over-acted, on his role here. My say s that The Maze Runner (2014) deserves a 6 out of 10 from me. A recommendation is just a so-so option from me. This movie is quite an entertainment, yet it falls a little bit short of adequate satisfactory.
5.0~Doesn't Deliver as Promises theamitverma Sign in Permalink My mistake - had a huge expectation from this movie. This movie appeared promising with promos and trailers but doesn't deliver. Yeah, start (initial few minutes) depicts as if it is going to be entertaining, going to deliver... but then it slips, gets lame, fall flat on its face and inhumes viewers along to the abysmal trench, where everybody is lost. Least, I can talk about myself. After those initial minutes, rest of this movie are completely illogical and waste of time.. Doesn't live up to the expectation. Try to avoid if are not lured as I was..
10.0~OMG what an EPIC MAZE!!!!! baehr_adam Sign in Permalink I will start by saying that I just finished watching this movie today in IMAX and I absolutely loved it. I have seen all of "The Hunger Games" movies and even "Divergent" and I loved those movies as well but there was something about "The Maze Runner" that sucked me into the Universe. I will say that I haven't read the books yet but I now intend to buy the box set after watching this movie just to read them and I'm not a huge reader at all. I loved the acting all the actors did Superb jobs especially "Dylan O' Brian. The action was top-notch from start to finish and the visuals were Awesome. The movie I felt was just the perfect amount of time and although some people complain about the ending I felt the ending fit perfectly with what is to come in the sequel and it had me asking a ton of questions which I don't mind doing at all. I would definitely recommend this movie Hands-Down to any and all fans of the 2 movies I mentioned earlier and if you can watch it in IMAX then do so.
6.0~If it wasn't based on such a bad book it could've been a great movie. aryates19 Sign in Permalink The script was full of plot holes which got harder and harder to ignore as the story went on. But if you chose to look past the apparent script issues and most of the characters being one dimensional (which obviously stems from the source material) you could enjoy it. The director did a fantastic job. Watching this you would have thought it was made by a seasoned director not someone who was making his first feature film. The special effects were pretty awesome too. Most of the cast did a great job. I especially loved Dylan O'brien's performance. Overall it was entertaining but not something I would watch twice or recommend to anybody I know.
5.0~Predictable JackUK1973 Sign in Permalink If I had just one word to sum this up I would say predictable - but I have 10 lines to complete so I'll try and stretch that out a little. The plot is fairly straight forward, once a month a new adolescent boy gets delivered to a glade surrounded by very high concrete walls that form a maze. The maze opens every day and 'runners' go in to the maze. They must return by nightfall when the maze closes - nobody who has spent the night in the maze has ever returned on account of the 'grievers' (wooooooohhhhh!). None of the boys knows why they are there or have any previous memories other than their name which they remember after a couple of days. And then Thomas arrives....... The next hour and a half follow the exploits of Thomas and the boys who choose to band with him in their efforts to escape the maze. As you would expect things happen to Thomas with accelerated timing, there are dissenters among the other boys. Things happen (ie Ben attacking Thomas) just in an effort it seems that some other boys can explain things that happen where they are. The dissenters gang up on Thomas because he challenges the status quo, some people die some in heroic ways, there's a last minute attempt by leader of the dissenters to kill Thomas. A character dies, the boys move on to the sequel. And now you're up to date. I mean, it was OK, effects were quite good, plot was a bit weak, I appreciated not having to think too much for the duration of the film, and life goes on...........
1.0~worst movie ever hhababeh Sign in Permalink I hate those movies were the writer and director completely ignore that the viewers have brains or can at least think, and they (writer/director) disrespect the our ability to analyze or anticipate. it's really annoying that this type of movies is getting really repetitive, with very obvious copying of ideas of movies such as "hunger games" and "divergent" without any mentionable changes and what's even more disturbing is that you can find many ways to escape a situation, where the hero can only find the hardest, and you would see a lot of logical-mistakes in the story, when it seems not bothering the hero, and you when you don't find any explanation for something you would at least wonder why, but not he, he will just go on, not thinking, not asking, not doing anything, just sacrificing the non-important characters and taking very long time to die if it's important, killing a whale with a needle or destroying a spaceship with a candy bar, loving the girl who has no other role but being loved, leading after being lead. in short the hero in this movie doesn't do a thing, he just waits for the director to adjust everything to suit his purpose. the real hero here is PURE LUCK
8.0~Loved It! (seen with Barco's 3 screen panoramic concept) onyxangel14 Sign in Permalink I for one came into the movie already having read the book, so naturally my expectations were rather high and i have to say despite some small unnecessary changes to the original story ,which of course i expected, it did not disappoint. The casting was pretty near perfect and Dylan O'Brian gave an outstanding performance. The actor who played chuck was the only one who fell a little flat for me and didn't quite connect the way he should have, other wise it was a very well casted movie. The visuals were phenomenal and ,I'm sure, met the expectations for anyone who imagined the maze ,as i did, while reading the book. Even if you haven read the book i would highly suggest this movie, it truly breaks off from that whole "young adult novel" theme and really conveys some deeper concepts such as freedom vs security and a very "lord of the flies" take on how society forms among a large group of young boys. I would HIGHLY recommend ,if you can, seeing this movie in a Cinemax theater with Barco's new three screen projection system, its only available in five theaters in America and "The Maze Runner" is the first movie to be commercially seen through this format. It's honestly one of the most visually stunning concepts I've seen used in a film since "Avatar". The three screen panoramic style make you feel like you are in the maze with the characters and is especially effective in the opening scene, truly no other movie would have suited this style better than "The Maze Runner". Seen With the Barco experience i would rate this movie 10/10 purely for just how immersive the whole experience was and how well it fit into the working of this story. This new system and the compelling twists of the movie will make your heart beat right out of your chest and i hope to see this technology used in several more movie in the future. Basically GO SEE THIS MOVIE
3.0~Redeeming only if your kids want you to see it with them stevenwbruner Sign in Permalink There's a lot to like here for a 10 year old, and since mine asked me doe-eyed to watch it with him, how could I say no? If I had seen the film in any other context, I would have been seriously upset with myself. But as it turned out, there was enough to catch the eye to forget the inane plot. In fact, given the impaired storyline, the acting, cinematography and film editing were really quite good - in fact, one of the supporting actors, I think, won an award for best young British talent. I won't bore you with the plot - you can read it in 100 places on this site. Suffice to say, it's hard to go 5 minutes without laughing at its ridiculousness. This is sci-fi on the cheap, story-wise. Thank god for the producers, there are enough kids of a certain age (and their parents) out there. You won't lose any sleep if you miss it. And if you pay for it and you don't get a "Wow, Dad, that was cool" afterward, then you've seriously wasted your time.
8.0~interesting movie over all hashim_32 Sign in Permalink it was an amazing movie overall, it was totally unexpected from the trailer that it will be too good,specially looking at the cast. One of the best movies in this year. From the start of the movie it was very interesting , every another scenes creates a curiosity as if what will happen next and little bit shaky scary scenes as well :) Overall actors and performance was good as well. Just the end scenes like passing the maze with all the group in one shot was very fast secondly how come gally passed the maze ? he was never a runner and didn't know way to reach the operating area n killing the poor kid anyhow still a must watch movie
7.0~Is It Greeny on the Other Side ThomasDrufke Sign in Permalink For a film that is budgeted at merely 34 million dollars, this film visually looks really good. For comparison, Fantastic Four had a budget of 120 million and the effects and so called 'set pieces' were awful. This is one of the biggest problems with Hollywood, but that's a discussion for another day. The Maze Runner is actually a surprisingly entertaining movie. For an age in which the medium is flooded with young adult novels and movies, the film feels fresh and isn't overwhelmed by clichés like so many others are. It's led by a relatively unknown cast. Dylan O'Brien, from Teen Wolf fame, is thrown into a maze structure along with a few dozen other young men who soon find there is more to the maze than they were led to believe. Let me be the first to say I think O'Brien has some chops and definitely has a future in this business. The role doesn't require a ton of range, but I think he proved he can lead a huge action film, and not many actors can say that. The writing itself I thought could have been a little smarter and more mature. Will Poulter, who played a much different character in We're The Millers, was solid in the role that was given to him. But the writing had him doing some really stupid things and was full of forced dialogue I felt. With that being said, the mythology behind the story is pretty interesting. And they made the film into a more traditional monster film than I'm sure the book originally called for, but it really works. The horror element to the film was by far the most intriguing, and had the biggest payoff. The 'Greavers' also proved to be pretty terrifying, something I didn't think I would say about a film with a bunch of teenagers. So I really only watched this because I'm probably going to see the sequel this weekend, and i ended up enjoying the movie. Plus, having Littlefinger as the next villain gets me pretty excited. +Monster flick +Surprisingly well acted +Suspensful -Some stupid dialogue 7.2/10
1.0~Do not watch!!! alastaircathcart Sign in Permalink A complete waste of time. So much so I went to the trouble of making an account on IMDb to save you from this bullshit. It makes a reference at the end that there will be a second one... filmmakers, I seriously advise that you do not do this, save the millions you are thinking of wasting and buy yourselves a Ferrari. (Apparently there are not enough lines to submit my review however there is literally nothing else to say so here's some Shakespeare... See see, my beauty will be saved by merit! O heresy in fair, fit for these days! A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise. But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill, And shooting well is then accounted ill. Thus will I save my credit in the shoot: Not wounding, pity would not let me do't; If wounding, then it was to show my skill, That more for praise than purpose meant to kill. And out of question so it is sometimes, Glory grows guilty of detested crimes, When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part, We bend to that the working of the heart; As I for praise alone now seek to spill The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.)
10.0~A movie to make you want the books! jaimebuckley Sign in Permalink Just took my wife to see this movie. I'd seen the books over the last couple years and heard growing interest in it, but hadn't taken the plunge to buy them. I will now. Wow. That's my first reaction to this movie. I write fantasy books for a living and honestly, there hasn't been a movie in some time that grabbed my emotions so smoothly as The Maze Runner. No, no spoilers here--but I'll tell you that this movie had my wife and I caring about the characters so quickly, I actually did a double take. I actually sat up in the theater and looked at my wife and said, "Woah. I...actually care about what happens to these kids! How the hell did that happen?" Decent acting, good story...and when the lights went up, our agreed decision was to get home and buy the books for our Nooks ASAP. Well done!!
7.0~A-maz-ing stuff! scottshak_111 Sign in Permalink ‎Wes Ball‬'s first big direction venture couldn't be ignored. Albeit ‪Dashner‬ hands him over his brilliant tale on a silver platter, Wes still makes it appear equally great. Dashner's story is a reflection of our real world. It makes you ponder, if we too are a part of something inexplicable, that our life is a maze and we are just surviving. Are we also pawns of someone's experiment? Are we supposed to search for a door? Our lives have inevitable elements like ‪‎Gally‬, like a religious preacher who stops people from going out or finding a door, forcing you to stay in the labyrinth, following rules that conventions made! And like ‪Alby‬ who was the oldest who created them for mere extant! ‪‎Will Poulter‬ was brilliant as Gally and ‪Dylan‬ worked really hard to get into Thomas' shoes! His acting is developing. The movie packs in surprises as it climaxes which were subtly portrayed. The screenplay hasn't much to offer, visual effects are fine. There are some flaws that can be ignored for the amazing concept. Pointing some - The deadly ‪Grievers‬ becoming suddenly less fatal when sticks were poked at them, the clichéd bit of Chuck's fate, the knock that brought Thomas' name back, a gal ‪Teresa‬ who has to be there even though she didn't have a purpose, questions like why couldn't they make a ladder Maze-tall in three frigging years? At least they could have seen where they were at, or if the walls were concrete and they had weapons couldn't they create fractures in the wall and try to climb? Overlooking every such minute bits it was overall a great movie on its way to become an even greater franchise!
5.0~Promising concept, but ultimately a let down. sbweightman Sign in Permalink Although the concept is promising, the plot feels cobbled together and the explanations it gives simply don't satisfy the audience's curiosity. Some of the acting is good and shows real emotion, but the characters and their traits are typical and predictable. The monster chase and action scenes look good due to the special effects rather than the dark and shaky camera work that is employed.
8.0~The Umbrella Corp is back at it in The Maze. BJHutton_AU Sign in Permalink I watched this movies last night. I found the movies had a great story line and we'll played via the main cast and crew. Special mention to Dylan O'Brien for his expressions in act during the movie and Thomas Brodie-Sangster for his roll as the mature decision maker. The movie is exciting and absorbs you in the chase. However I did not find the robots logically could jump to the vines with such design without gravity setting in, but somehow make it. I like how the living arrangement is the actual center of the maze with a little bit of a kill run made the result worth while. I like how it was not a love story of man and women such get boring and repetitive, chicks in would generally not survive these types of circumstances. Such is a great series to come and look forward in the future games to come.
7.0~Original and pleasurable, but could be better salarismirko Sign in Permalink I liked it, but it could have been so much better than what it actually is. Through the whole movie you don't understand why they are there and the final explanation is just worse than anything you came up with during the movie. Then there are a lot of noticeable plot holes and that's just bad.
5.0~Great concept, mediocre execution the_real_smile Sign in Permalink Wow, I really anticipated on this movie, suspense, action, the unknown, it all sounds very exciting. Now I must say that I have seen some very good movies and series round this theme that may influence my judgment, for example The Cube (1 - 3), Persons Unknown, Saw, etc. all have a person or group of persons who don't know how they get there or how to get away. How is it possible that those movies, some dating from 1997, are so much better then a 2014 movie? And being almost 2 hours long, how come so little happens in those 2 hours? Some reviewers already mentioned the contradictory and illogical elements in this movie, and yes, this does this movie, with such much potential, not much good, it's just annoying to see them not try what is so logic. The movie is entertaining, but leaves you very unsatisfied.
4.0~Disappointing rx2587 Sign in Permalink In a way, this movie is a little like the Peter Pan story. Instead of Neverland, it is the Glade at the center of a Maze. And instead of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, it's Alby and his gang of Gladers. Instead of the ravenous crocodile, it is the super-sized arachnoid Grievers. Instead of Captain Hook and his band of pirates, it is the WCKD (read wicked) personnel. And instead of Wendy and her Darling brothers, it is Thomas and Theresa who come late to the party but once they've arrived, the adventure is afoot. Alby and the other boys suffer amnesia upon initial entry into the Glade. Other than name, and even that takes a few days to return to memory, they have no recollection of who they are. (Sounds like Peter Pan looking for his shadow, doesn't it?). I was disappointed in this movie. But I confess, I never read Dashner's books. Maybe if I had, the story would have made more sense. I am not daft. I have seen other movies adapted from books I had not read, and was able to understand the story in those. But I did not understand this one. And after investing 2 hours, I arrived at the end of the movie and still did not understand what had happened. There were just so many questions that remained unanswered. And so many events in the movie made no sense. Too many contradictions like, why is there a verdant glade in the middle of a desert? In fact, it would be exhausting to try to list them all here.
1.0~horrible staceyyoakess Sign in Permalink If you've read even a portion of the book DO NOT watch this movie. The movie was horribly boring, and most of the time made absolutely no sense. The plot holes people keep complaining about are typically during segments that have been drastically altered from what happened in the book. They attempted to deviate from the story for cinematic effect, but unfortunately it didn't work whatsoever. This is just a movie that just so happens to have the same name as a very good book, but it is in no way an adaptation. Had they stayed with the actual storyline, in the same 2hr time frame, it could've been a great movie... even despite the bad acting. I'm excited to begin reading The Scorch Trials, but I can promise you I will not be watching any "adaptation" that follows. And honestly this film would be crap even if I hadn't read the book.
5.0~Horrible Dialogue, Bad Acting, and Sequel-Baiting Ruin a Solid Premise tgrock Sign in Permalink I was intrigued by the trailer. It pretty much just showed the premise of the film and scenes from only the first 30 minutes. That made me think there was going to more to the movie than just exiting the maze. There was a little of that, but the movie ends about 10 minutes after they exit the maze to start "Phase 2" as it is stated in the movie. There is no hint of what the sequel could even be about which is disappointing. Due to its bad dialogue and hammy acting, I wouldn't particularly want to see the sequel either unless the film gets outstanding reviews from the critics. My advice is stick to "The Hunger Games." This film is definitely not in the same league as that 'young adult' film series.
3.0~Very illogical and not appealing. datorsiers2 Sign in Permalink A bunch of teen boys living in nowhere for years and all they have done was gardening and building a little shelter? really? Nobody ever even thought about building a ladder, to look what is over the walls or to over see the maze? Making a miniature of the whole maze, while it has been shifting? Thomas stings himself on purpose, so he would remember some things, he remembers that he and Theresa are kind of responsible for all of this, since they were working for the corporation, but it doesn't add anything to the movie, he already found a way out before, he and Minho could have gotten out easily the first time they were at the door, but they didn't even try. A girl gets sent to the place, where dozens of boys have been living for years and nobody even says anything, really? That is not how it would be. Yeah, cool, the ending is meant to be a shocker or whatever, but it is just nothing special, they got out of the maze and they are immediately sent off to a destroyed city to start everything over again, the second part is going to come out in 2015, so kind of fast, hopefully it will be way better, which i doubt. The idea itself is not that bad and this idea could make a good movie franchise, but i don't know if people will really want to see the other possible parts, after watching the first one. Action wise it could have been more intense as well, a couple of robot - monsters here and there, nothing too original.
5.0~What's the point benisof Sign in Permalink The movie is bearable, the action is interesting, but the whole thing is predictable (up to a certain point). We know immediately that the new guy will be the first to do what no one else has done before... There are lots of points I don't agree on, but the main one is the end. The premise of the maze is that the smart ones will get out. The feeling of the one who watches is exactly the opposite. If someone thought to kill all the staff, the doctors, the maintainers of the maze, then why not save all kids directly? The end scene shows the survivors being flown in a helicopter above the maze. The survivors need to be stupid if they didn't realize this was a setup... If they wanted to save them, all they needed to do was to fly the helicopter in the center of the maze and pull them out... Other things I found odd: - the new arrivants are not fully briefed on the maze and the dangers inside. That's the sure way of making someone curious... - how can the maze runners always find their way, and map it, if the maze keeps changing? - how could the kids fight a mechanical spider with sticks? In the end, the thing could just wipe them out directly. - the world ending brain disease justification of these maze trials was a little absurd... I'm curious what the book does with this... edit: I just read the book, to see how it ends. In the book, the maze is covered, so clearly, no helicopter can reach the Glade. Furthermore, the kids are "saved" using a bus, not a helicopter. I don't know what the script writers have for brains, for putting that helicopter fly over the maze scene at the end.
7.0~Recommended n_dhruv Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is another masterpiece from Hollywood.It is based upon the novel written by James Dashner.This is the first movie of Wes Ball and he has done a very good in fact fabulous job.He is also known for his other short movies.Screenplay has been written by Noah Oppenheim,Grant Pierce Myers and T.S.Nowlin.They have written so well that you won't get bored in any sequence. Thomas(Dylan O'Brien) when wakes up he doesn't remember anything except his name.He finds himself in kind of enclosed environment where a new boy arrives every 30 days.The only way to come out from this is to survive from maze that surrounds that place.Thomas meets Alby(Aml Ameen),Minho(Ki Hong Lee) and many others.But their lives change when they meet Teresa(Kara Scodelario).Now Thomas takes stand to leave this place.Will he make out? Go and watch the movie. Everyone has done good job especially Dylan,Kara and Dexter Darden.Everything is good from performance to background score to story to screenplay to direction. Overall,this movie is kind of movie that will make a place in your mind and won't leave that place for long.Go for this !! Recommended !!
5.0~Action and mystery, scratching my head isabelle-frater Sign in Permalink Frankly, I didn't know what to expect when I decided to go to this movie. I have seen that some of the people I follow for book reviews have read it, and it got mixed reviews. However, sometimes even bad books can be made into good movies or TV shows. Recently The 100 comes into mind, which was like this. It probably also occurred to me, because it has similar themes. Teens trying to survive in a world they don't know much of after an apocalypse. This movie is very action packed. The pacing is good for the most part, however, the ending was a bit abrupt. As if they were shooting, looked at what they had, and realised that they spent too much time on the stuff so far, so they had to finish it already. The story itself isn't typical current YA. Mercifully, no romance! There could be in the future, but not right now. The beginning made me think of Lord of the Flies. While there are moments when it could go that way, it doesn't. Perhaps the makers had enough faith in humanity to think that when a bunch of boys get together, they don't necessarily go for the "kill 'em all" scenario. Even though there are indications that there were more violent days, they could establish peace. There aren't any movies this one specifically reminds me of. That could just be that other than superhero movies, I rarely watch stories with this level of testosterone. Or it could just be that most of it was really vague, and the answers weren't forthcoming. I could liken it to The Hunger Games. However, while it does happen in an enclosed space, there isn't that sense of Big Brother, since the boys don't know where they are, or why. It is obvious that someone is watching, and that some aspects of the environment are controlled, but not to that extent. The people trapped are also victims of some system, but it's not the overarching sense. I even considered that like in another movie that I saw about a futuristic prison that people escape, only to find out that there is no one else out there, and everything was running on automation all along. This idea was actually reinforced by the look of the maze. It had a lot of rust and decay, more than 3 years of the alleged use of the place would indicate in my opinion. So while some details of the story are similar to some other stories I've seen, they only came into my mind afterwards. The characters are a bit clichéd, but it could just be that the action was favoured instead of the character building. The action was really good, had my heart pounding at times, so I didn't mind. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is the main character. It is his appearance that kick starts the changes in the camp. While this could be a flaw in the story, there are indications that this isn't a coincidence, and after a while that can become obvious. There were also some things about the events surrounding him that left me with questions. I hope they will be answered in the next movies. Though if I know myself, I won't stand it that long, and soon enough you will be seeing book reviews of this series, so watch this space. Thomas is the boy who acts, and isn't content to let the bigger, stronger boys lead him. He becomes a leader himself. Thomas' character takes the adventurous character of Stiles to a new level. He is the kind of guy that sees a mountain, and wants to know what's behind it. He also runs towards danger, so he's a kind of hero. I'm not sure if I actually like him, but I often agree with him. Alby (Aml Ameen) is the leader in the camp. He is a good leader, though one of his decisions is strange, because he seems to usually delegate, but then he doesn't. That part felt a bit out of character, but could be better grounded in the book, or not there at all. Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) is Thomas' ally. They have a regular bromance from the start. It may come from Newt's generally relaxed nature, but they have a connection. In this story the actor's British accent felt weird. Everyone sounded American, and then he opened his mouth. I wonder if that was for the character, or an oversight, or he just had a hard time getting rid of it and they left it like that. In spite of this, I soon forgot about his accent, as he formed a really likable character. Gally (Will Poulter) is the evil guy. He is a bit of a cliché from the very start. The bully. The guy who never agrees with Thomas. The guy you just know will end up doing something horrible. He is also the opposite of Thomas in that if he sees a mountain, he just sees the peaks, and then looks around and feels content with what he has. In a way, like a lot of bullies, he's scared of change, of anything different from what he knows. I almost felt sorry for him. The ending was kind of a surprise. Though frankly, I didn't know what to expect. In fact, the end brought up more questions than answers. Why I'm sure the series will be on many new reading lists, and sales will increase. People generally aren't that good at waiting for answers. Overall, an exciting movie, and a baffling one. I kind of hoped to decide just how much I liked it in the course of writing this review. I'm still not sure, thus the 3 stars. I do recommend it though, if not for anything but the exciting action, and the interesting mystery. Don't expect to leave the theatre fully satisfied though. Frustrated would be more like it.
3.0~this movie is awful phiup Sign in Permalink 1. Cliché dialog between characters, "we have 3 rules here, don't hurt other people, contribute, and we don't go in the maze!" "dont you get it, we are already dead!" "We cant just leave him!" "He not only saw the griever, he killed it." "This is your first new find in 3 years right?" "I'm going back in" "We found a way out" "You led them to us." "Get....them.....out!" Under developed Characters -Thomas cried over his friend chunk, he knew him for 3 days. -Thomas and Teresa cant remember each other, but somehow had a kinship that surpassed even those loose relationships that Thomas had already made. -Minho, started off with the cool, special forces vibe. He was built up as the bravest of them all...then digressed into super infant status at the first test of courage. -Alby was the wise prudent one, but digressed into a fool by the halfway mark when he ran into the maze, breaking his own rules, but didn't have to because we find out later that the entirety of the maze had already been mapped. Conclusion -we have a video message from President Snow's (hunger games) wife, she says, "I am sure by now you all must be very confused...angry, frightened. I can only assure you that everything that's happened to you...everything we've done to you...it was all done for a reason." WHAT!?!?! i am sorry, but this is horrible! first 20 minutes, boring, next 40, C+ last 40-50 minutes, garbage.
9.0~Great Movie Adaptation of a Book - Sophisticated with YA Actors actingbauer Sign in Permalink This is the first movie I've seen that is completely comprised of young adult actors that hasn't catered specifically to young adults. Any kind of romantic element was conspicuously absent, as it was in the book, and the actors were not all stereotypical hot models that would have probably brought in a much wider young adult female audience. From what I could tell, the directors really wanted to keep this as close to the original story as possible, and everything from the CGI'd maze, to the glade, to the actor portrayals showed that they really cared about making this gritty, and enjoyable to watch. Other young adult movie adaptations of books have been very heavy handed with the romance between the boy and girl, and have dumbed-down both the language and context to give children something to enjoy. This was refreshingly different! This was a REAL movie that to me was the same caliber as any great blockbuster to come out this year. Please keep doing what you're doing! I went into this movie with low expectations and now can't wait to see the sequel!
8.0~Another Great Sci-Fi Movie julianakeagle Sign in Permalink I saw this movie over break and I really enjoyed it. I thought it had a great level of suspense throughout the movie. Even the opening scene was suspenseful as you saw Thomas rising in the box. I also thought the cast was selected well as the boys were selected by W.C.K.D from around the world and this was well displayed by their diversity. The graphics were also really well done in the Grievers and all of the stunts and action present in the movie. The dissection of the dead Griever was interesting and very well done as the viewer discovered that although the monsters are mechanical, they actually have working organs which made them even more creepy. I thought that the relationship between Thomas and Chuck was well developed and Chuck sacrificing his life for Thomas was very touching. Finally, the cliffhanger at the end of the movie was well done and I am anxiously awaiting the next movie and will definitely start the book series in the meantime.
6.0~Good plot line, adventurous and good background score but too much focus on the protagonist and characters are all shallow mugen-is-here Sign in Permalink The main plot line is quite interesting and the story feels adventurous. You keep wondering what will happen next and whether or not they will survive. But as with any other teen movie this one too seems to have the world revolving completely around the protagonist. There is no depth to the other characters. Everyone constantly keeps looking at the boy. There are many camera shots where a group of people are expecting an outcome of a scene (for ex waiting for something to open/close, waiting for someone to come/go etc) but instead of looking at what lies in front of them they all have their eyes focused on the boy. It's as if their life is all about finding out what happens to the boy. Suppose you're waiting for astronauts to land on the moon. Just at that moment, would you look at the astronauts or would you look at your friend's face constantly nearby? As for the boy the very first thing you notice is that he's arrogant. He looks like a snob and his dialogues are all bad. When he clearly sees a someone struggling he needs to reassure the other person that he did a great job, we're all grateful to him, times are changing, his help is still needed etc. But instead he responds in a self-centered and arrogant manner. Then there are a bunch of really close scenes all focused on his face. I felt quite repulsed by the close shots especially because he's looking at everyone else like everyone else should bow to him. Plot line is pretty good and kept my focus. I would say if you like adventure/suspense/thriller movies then you can watch it once. It's not that great but it's still good enough to watch once.
6.0~overrated, storyline has no sense tonipetricic Sign in Permalink This film is totally overrated it has no sense acting is poor the story is good until the end when you realize it has no freaking sense to torture them end put them there because of some cure how is that even connected torturing people whit no reason,and cure????? The film would be better if they did better story (reason) for keeping them there) and more mystery. Acting is poor and effects are not much better all in all it could been better the best thing about movie is the trailer. They are in film industry only for money and I don't like that. There is no more passion in film making it is all about dividing movies in more movies and selling the trailer to us.
10.0~Not your typical "teenage action" movie, really worth a watch! mirooka Sign in Permalink ***May Contain Spoilers*** Imagine yourselves waking up in a metal cage with no recollection of your previous life, including your name, your parents' name, where you came from and how you got there. This is what happens to Thomas, an eager and curious teenage boy, who finds himself in the Glade, a place surrounded by walls which protects him and other boys from the horrors and mysteries of the Maze that surrounds them. Life seemed at peace at the Glade, until Thomas arrived, and then all hell brakes loose. For such an unknown cast (aside for Thomas Sangster and Will Poulter, which already made a name for themselves in GoT and Meet the Millers, and of course, Patricia Clarkson as the "Wicked" doctor), the acting was fantastic. No stuttering, no monotones, and their facial expressions made them look like real A-listers. The setting had an apocalyptic feeling to it, like the boys were survivors of something horrible, and were put in the Glade for their own protection. The Grievers added an macabre effect to the story, making the Maze much more frightening. The plot was fast-paced, and every scene drew the line between those who wanted to find a way out to those who, despite all the dangers, wanted to stay in the Glade. However, the plot took a sharp turn after the appearance of Teresa, and I think that a lot of scenes were cut after that, because there seemed to be many plot holes, like Ball (the director) was in hurry to get to the climax. Dylan O'Brien was excellent as the main character, and led to story with amazing skill and professionalism. As I haven't read the books, I had absolutely no idea who created the Maze and why, until the boys and Teresa found out for themselves towards the end of the film. All in all, the movie was great and I enjoyed every minute of it! 10/10
1.0~Bad Bad Bad ... ... ... stenen-mineralen Sign in Permalink Trivia information : "Dylan O'Brien had four days to read the book before filming." The movie really shows that he had only 4 days the time before filming it. the story line in the movie is horrible and incorrect. - lack of details makes in uninteresting to watch - after the movie i did only remember 2 names of the characters, i thinks that does say enough. - i will never watch the follow up. - a budget of 40 million dollar, and this is the result???? wasted money. better give the follow up money to a charity to save the world, instead of bullying us with a second one. + i am interested in the book, to compare the 2. i've seen some bad movies, but never this bad. Normally a follow up movie is not better than the original movie. but in this case ... i would call that impossible. it can't be worse that this one.
10.0~We've got a Runner! mik_mik_90 Sign in Permalink If you ain't scared, you ain't human. As a fan of The Maze Runner series I got to say that there are many changes in the movie which I think is necessary because of course you'll notice that usually movies runs from 1 up to 2 hours long only...so what do you expect? (this is actually for those whiners who didn't have a clue) Besides I think that those changes makes the maze and the Grievers (a bio-mechanic monster) much more dangerous. Main Casts was actually great for me. I'm familiar with Thomas Sangster (Newt), Will Poulter (Gally), Kaya Scodelario (Teresa) and Patricia Clarkson (Ava Paige) since I have seen their other movies before. Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) though was new to me, I've heard that his from Teen Wolf which I don't watch, but I was actually surprise with his acting performance in this film, it actually pretty good. Another newcomer is Ki-Hong Lee plays Minho which until now I don't know whose famous scientist he was named from. The movie experience as a whole was incredible, it was heart- pumping and wicked! I am already excited for second installment The Scorch Trial because that is craziest part of the series besides I would love to see those Cranks in horde too. And if you guys saw the film but didn't read the book, I think you should read it.
6.0~An entertaining movie with plentiful technical flaws but decent enough for a one time watch! rahulsinghrahulsingh2 Sign in Permalink The Maze runner is a science fiction action thriller film directed by Wes Ball, based on James Dashner's book with the same name. The movie is no misnomer: it revolves around a bunch of people stuck in a maze, and their struggle with it; with much focus on the one true 'maze runner', Thomas. Is the movie worth a watch? Well, the below list should help you decide that, while you do of course need to factor in your personal preferences in terms of which ones you value more! PROs- 1) Cinematography is the highlight 2) Imagination and creativeness deserves a kudos 3) Actors did a decent job 4) The movie is consistent in all its qualities (good and bad ones!) CONs- 1) Plentiful technical flaws (Its not really possible to mention these without giving away too much of the plot, so lets not mention it here) 2) Many sequences, and in fact much of the movie is predictable 3) I personally found the climax to be dissatisfying (though possibly that's just me!) All in all, I'd say its a good entertaining movie; just don't use your brain too much when you're watching it! :D
5.0~Not impressive rehmankhilji Sign in Permalink I am not a book reading person, so for its the movie that matters. What ever was in the book and what ever was adapted thus seem irrelevant. There has not been a single time i have come across some stating that the movie was better then the book. So book readers for you the movie will never be better. Better not watch it or else you will be up for a one big disappointed. From a movie point of view it is once again on those lines that world is destroyed and some people have survived and now they are living up for some goal. But what goal this movie had is something remained unanswered. Its on the same lines of Hunger Games and Divergent but unlike them its not focusing a women be the center, this time its a guy who saves the day. Young kids are put through a test for achieving some unknown results. But what i failed to understand all of them were of the same age except for one and they even killed him in the end. The second thing i failed why and how they made Robo Cop monsters, like what was the purpose. Movie left me with many questions. Not a 7 as IMDb but for one time watch if you don't have anything better to see. So its a 5 for me.
6.0~Good, not amazing foxmulder-8 Sign in Permalink This film was a bit like the Hunger Games, only with a male lead. It's the usual dystopian world flick populated by oppressed teens. I enjoyed the fast pace of the movie, but at times it did seem like it moved along too quickly and didn't allow the characters enough time to develop any real relationships. The main character Thomas was your cliché all-American teen lead. Sometimes I wish they'd just let a normal looking person be the hero. Despite this, it's entertaining from beginning to end, which is the most important when watching any movie. It introduces the series well enough to leave viewers hungry for the next installment.
7.0~Explosive Start Devolves into a So-So Final Conflict! Still, Much Better than Most if the Recent YA Releases! prospectus_capricornium Sign in Permalink 'The Maze Runner' marks its run by setting its path ablaze in an explosive heart throbbing start. Right away, it builds its seemingly intriguing and smart storyline with a solid opening sequence, throwing us into immediate action and suspense as the first scene depicts the amnesiac teenager, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), struggling to find his way out of a rattling lift, ascending through a darkness-filled elevator shaft. Emerging to the surface, he finds himself surrounded with multi-ethnic boys who seem not surprised by his arrival. He is immediately welcomed to a commune of teenagers who have been struggling to find their exit from the world they've been mysteriously thrown into--The Glade, a forest dominated settlement surrounded by thick concrete walls whose only gate opens to an intricate and ever-changing maze, one the boys suspect to end up to their only way out of that prison-like expanse. Knowing only his name, curious Thomas joins the league of runners who run into the "griever"-infested maze every morning, to unfold its secrets. His courage is convincing enough to earn him equally-earnest companions to run with him side by side, in his quest to discover the passage out of the Glade. That courage itself, puts growing suspicion to the tough bullying elder, Gally (Will Poulter), whom Thomas immediately finds to be his inevitable and insecure rival. Adding to the tension, is the arrival of the first and only girl in the group, Theresa (Kaya Scodelario), bearing a note that tells she's the last one. There are many obvious elements that keep 'The Maze Runner' within the confines of the Young-Adult Adaptation genre: it happens in a post-apocalyptic era, young teenagers appear to be the last hope of a controlling dystopian society, and at its center is a young protagonist who would go through all lengths to escape his brutal fate. It is interesting to note though some attempts to set itself apart from the craze. Most notably, it doesn't have sexually-intuitive characters as it appears to be more focused on the action and adventures of the hero. The mood is also set in a darker tone, adding more excitement and suspense to its already intriguing premise. However, it's also not easy to shrug off some flaws in the film, flaws that could have been avoided if first time director, Wes Ball, had put equal attention to both the film's visuals and script. While it boasts stunning visuals, the movie's overall output is weighed down by some nonsensical clichés, bland dialogues and tiring one-liners, some not fully developed and utilized characters (ex.Theresa) and misplaced highlights, all these pushing the story out of its track. It feels as if it hasn't maintained, much less taken off, from the level of excitement and suspense it achieved in the first half. Towards the end, it loses grip of its the initial thrill, barely bringing back the intensity with a uninteresting final conflict. In the end it tries to save itself by hinting a promise of an inevitable sequel, one, I can say, it utterly deserves.
6.0~Although the setup is mildly engaging, The Maze Runner fails to satisfy joeravioli Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is definitely not the worst teenage-directed dystopian flick out there (I believe that Divergent has that one locked down), but it is definitely not the best, either. Its setup is interesting and builds adequate suspense to keep us watching with slightly interested eyes, but it falls apart with its repeated, clichéd, TV drama like dialogue. It serves to forward the plot, but often tends to show little of anything, really. And it happens a lot. Most of the film is spent talking, mostly about the maze as a sacred, untouchable thing that no one should go into under the consequence of death by the monsters that lurk within the maze. The action, when it happens, is fun, but it doesn't happen often enough. The film follows a boy named Thomas who is cast into a mini society put together by a group of boys that live in the center of a maze, in a place they call the Glade. Every month, an elevator comes out of the ground with food and a new boy. No one can remember anything before they came into the Glade, although Thomas has visions of symbols and people in his dreams. No one is allowed past the doors that mark the entrance to the Maze except the Runners, a designated group of kids who map the maze in order to attempt to find a way out. The doors close at night and open in the morning. Alby, the group leader, warns Thomas, "No one survives a night in the maze." Of course, Thomas is curious about the maze. The Maze Runner follows what I like to call "The Avalanche Framework". A person or event disrupts the quiet structure of a strict society, causing it to spiral out of control, inciting absolute panic and chaos within its "walls". Events snowball together into a massive avalanche that destroys everything that the people who created the society ever worked for. It is usually an enjoyable film to watch, and the endings are usually satisfying. The Maze Runner lacks a satisfying ending (It is random and senseless), but it is enjoyable to a certain, very small extent. It holds you by the tips of your toes, never gripping your eyes to the screen or pulling you to the edge of your seat. There is barely anything to make you want to keep watching. The Maze Runner is surprisingly dark. That is probably the best thing it has going for it. It is more gory and frightening than most teenage movies (although this may not be a good thing), and the helplessness of the whole situation is a feeling uncommon as well to these types of films. It is a reasonable film, bordering between good and bad. Me being me, I give it the benefit of the doubt.
5.0~The Maze Walker ratulghosh89 Sign in Permalink The alleged 'Hunger Games' starring a boy falls way behind Ms.Katnis' efforts and charm. Haven't read the book so not very sure how well it serves up to that but if its the exact replica then please don't care to make a sequel. The acting is nothing great with the kids trying oh-so-much to prove their credibility. This movie doesn't even leverage out of the Big screen experience. Graphics are OK and the plot is weak. The biggest flaw about this movie was simple and uninteresting background.There is no suspense or anxiety as to how and why did our world end up being the way it is shown here. The reasons are way too thin to believe. Skip it if you can..
7.0~fantastic and epic. yasirjunejo Sign in Permalink I only watched this movie for Dylan o'brain.and his acting was great.i became fan of him after i watched teen wolf and his acting was amazing. great movie along with great story,good setting really loved it. great adventure,epic and great fantasy. good approaches has used to design a maze. clear story.
10.0~A Maze of Ideas: The Ultimate Pan-Optic Mystery By-TorX-1 Sign in Permalink Aside from its kinetic action and proto-juvenile cinematic tropes, The Maze Runner is also unique in that it (however improbably) strikingly offers a sustained philosophical and theological methodology that speaks to past and present thought orders and cultural configurations. In terms of precise ontic collectives that the alphic film explores, it arguably principally factors upon the central heliocentric primal-narrative that underscores the classic 'So-Called Proper Name' metaphysical principle, a proposal that has haunted European epistemological revelation for at least five centuries, and which led to the valiant (but doomed) post-Enlightenment quest for the ur-standard in pseudo-ludology. Moreover, in the middle section, the film progresses to cryptically evoke the imaginary mediation of the De Interpretation-like inescapable traction that Zoran Toltec argued bedevilled ancient Greek thought, and so it brings to light the near-forgotten Scythian teleological dilemma in synthesis with the broken thread of the modern 'Beauborg Maxim.' All of this places the filmic chronicle, in its quasi-zenith, within the confines of a delirious (yet grounded) apotheosis of illusion, and (somewhat audaciously, it must be said) incontrovertibly presents a pan-optic mandala scenario to confront both the characters and the cinematic audience directly and without compromise. Consequently, in the final sequences of the first chapter, this is ultimately the character of Thomas's non-physical/embodied Möbius status: an immanent and immutable rhizoid stasis within a revitalised and hyper-heterogeneous simulacrum of what Viktor Imzadi famously dubbed the 'Labyrinth of the Eternal Thought Cavern.' Thus, it will be interesting to see where the series takes these ideas, but from the philosophical foundation that is central to the first instalment, it seems evident to me that the story will inevitably journey into the very heart of Kazimir Yadlo's conception of the primordial Origami Cosmos thesis.
9.0~Fun interesting action film that adds a heap of mystery benm-42909 Sign in Permalink Really love this movie but I don't believe it's going to stand the test of time, this movie isn't too memorable although this movie is really well done. Some of the scenes are very captivating and the whole plot of the movie being the maze is a mindblowing mystery in the first time you watch it , you really get into it and you can relate with most of the characters within the movie.
6.0~A Fair Enough, Albeit Unremarkable, Viewing Experience xenoraiser Sign in Permalink Grim visions live on in James Dashner's The Maze Runner, the latest young adult novel to receive on-screen treatment. If 20th Century Fox have their way, we can expect at least two more entries, especially since a sequel is already in pre-production. The pitch is that a group of boys are stuck on a small slab of land (the Glade) surrounded by a large maze that, at night, closes and plays host to creatures known as Grievers. Enter Thomas, our protagonist and the latest in a monthly addition to said group. Unlike his more settled companions, Thomas immediately repels the idea of confinement and urges his newfound neighbors to take initiative in discovering a way out. One can't help approaching The Maze Runner with an air of trepidation, given the number of similarly styled movies we've seen a sudden influx of. There are only so many times younglings can be subjected before we feel we've had our fill. The film does have its competencies, but the chances of captivation and anticipation for the apparently-confirmed sequel are simply far-fetched. The Maze Runner's greatest facet is its overall intrigue--the mystery it initially presents for us to pick at. While the use of momentary flashbacks is disenchanting, viewers can expect a light mental stretch from their first viewing. Another commendable aspect is how the themes are implemented. They aren't subtle, but we're at least spared the disservice of being drilled by overwrought messages and symbolism. Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise, however, is the consistency of acting. O'Brien does an adequate job as the curious protagonist with a drive to do something, yet Will Poulter stands tallest as Gally, the stubborn voice of suspicion. In that, the chemistry is also worth touching on, but you're not going to experience the same level of connection as Harry Potter or even The Hunger Games. This is where the unlikelihood of The Maze Runner's overall resonance stems from. Most of what's presented works for the sake of adequacy, but finding anything of superb quality is almost as frivolous as making sense of the ending. For most of the runtime, The Maze Runner moves at a steady, methodical pace. Then those last five minutes pull the rug out and leave the film to slip and crumble oh so comically. About the only reason to feel indifferent to this coy play is the probable lack of total investment, which is to say (and confirm) that if you remain detached throughout the whole affair, then you may be better off than those who are more impressionable. www.theretailjudge.com
6.0~Movie felt rushed... itz_henry_jai Sign in Permalink When I first learned that The Maze Runner series could potentially turn into the big screen, I immediately bought all four books (The Maze Runner, The Scorched Trials, The Death Cure and lastly, The Kill Order; this being the prequel) a month before the movie was out. There was a lot of mixed reviews regarding the books, but I still decided to grab them and fell in love, having read all three in a month on my kindle. Still working on The Kill Order. The prequel book felt different and slow in my opinion...This was obviously one of many proud moments in my life to finally have had the chance to not only READ, but WATCH the movie. Being able to compare the two was very cool. I swear I was nodding and smiling throughout the movie. However, I was a bit disappointed with the movie. ****WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW. DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. SPOILERS BELOW.************************ First and foremost, the movie was roughly 1 hour 40 mins, not including the credits. There was a lot of character development in the books, but the movie didn't cover that part which isn't my main complaint. THE MOVIE FELT VERY SHORT AND RUSHED. The director skipped out on so many major points that could've made the movie a lot better or at least give the audience (those who didn't read the books) a better grasp of the environment Thomas & Co. was forced upon. In the book, it seemed to take forever to find the way out of the maze. In the movie it was just BOOM. BOOM. OHH, There's THE EXIT. THE END. Just a few key points in comparison. BOOK: 1. Newt was the first to welcome Thomas after he arrives. 2. Thomas shortly discovers a mechanical insect that has W.I.C.K.E.D written on its body, multiple times in different occasions (important) 3. Thomas was given a proper tour of the Glades, all four corners had a special meaning (farm, slaughterhouse, homestead, graveyard). 4. Chuck and Thomas shared more bromance in the book. 5. Alby sacrifices himself towards the end. 6. Teresa and Thomas can communicate telepathically. 7. Thomas & Co. doesn't know about Ava Paige (director of W.I.C.K.E.D). 8. Thomas finds the exit which is a hidden portal at the edge of the maze. They would have to jump off the edge into the portal. 9. Gally runs off to the maze towards the end (important). 10. Gally kills Chuck with a knife which was meant for Thomas. Thomas reacts by punching Gally to the point where it is considered smashing instead.(important). 11. The group escapes through a bus. Saved by civilians that were against W.I.C.K.E.D 12. They enter a building (barracks) and finds food and bed and they all sleep, thinking everything is over. 13. Thomas first learns the meaning behind W.I.C.K.E.D while exploring/running in the maze. 14. The maze drawings was the key in part of finding the way out of the maze. 15. The Map Room was burned down. 16. People slept on the grass. There were HUNDREDS of people. 17. Alby was being "controlled" (important) by an unknown entity while he was being treated for getting stung by a griever. MOVIE: 1. Gally is the first to meet Thomas in the elevator. 2. Thomas and Teresa didn't communicate telepathically. 3. There were probably half the amount of people compared to the books. 4. They find a "key" inside a dead Griever. 5. Said key opens the door to the exit. 6. Alby is killed by a Griever. 7. Alby wasn't being "controlled". 8. Gally kills Chuck with a gun and Gally gets speared by Minho. 9. Thomas & Co didn't meet the "founders in white" inside pods, per se. 10. Thomas & Co escapes via helicopter. 11. Movie ends while the helicopter is entering THE SCORCHED TRIALS. OH YEAHHHHHHHHHH!!!! SEQUEL PLEASE. MORE THAN 2 HOURS PLEASE. 12. Ava Paige fakes her death, but explains why W.I.C.K.E.D is "good" before her fake death via recorded video. 13. I counted 9 survivors (Thomas, Teresa, Minho, Newt, Frypan, Winston? and the rest). The ending was a big twist compared to the books which I don't mind at all. Again, my main complaint was that the first movie of a potential trilogy felt very short and the director/writers skipped out on a lot of events that could've made the movie better or at least added more time to fit the 2 hour slot, just like any other trilogy-based book-to-movie adaptation. At the end of Maze Runner, there were still quite a number of kids left. Curious to see how the sequel will play out with this small group. 6/10
1.0~another terrible movie helwazan Sign in Permalink This movie starts with a mysterious maze, no one can escape for the last 3 years, and the characters adapted to this and started building homes and living there, but the story starts to give an interest in who is trapping them inside, well no, you will not know of course you need to wait and pay for the 2nd and 3rd part of the movie, and maybe fourth, you start to figure out that the movie is pointless once you get out of the theater and why did you even waste money on or time, the movie ends not knowing who trapped them in that maze, and why, or how, in the end when i figured out that this is just a silly preparation for a sequel, just to get more money from the audience,i can tell you the story is just that: starts some guy find himself trapped and there are other guys trapped there as well for the last 3 years, he works with them and tries to think what's behind the walls, they answer him, that this is a maze, he enters the maze several times, till he figures it out and gets some people out, to figure out that this was some test and all the people who tested on him are dead and he used to be one of them, and then those people who tested on him are not dead and now I'm not making any sense exactly like the movie, if i can give this movie a negative rating i would give it a -10
6.0~Gritless, yet this is a confident, exciting and sleek debut from director Wes Ball. ScottGentry Sign in Permalink "The Maze Runner" (12A) Directed by: Wes Ball. Starring: Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Will Poulter, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Patricia Clarkson. Rated: '12A' for containing intense scenes, threat and violence. Running time: 113 minutes. Released in UK cinemas from the 10th of October, 2014. In recent years we've had countless adaptations of various teenage novels (the "Twilight" saga, "The Hunger Games" series and the beginnings of the "Divergent" chronicles are to name but a few) but it seems to me that they are always clichéd, erroneously written and occasionally prove to be tedious affairs. "The Maze Runner" was different, if only slightly. Our unusual film begins within the confines of a small depressing lift, currently inhabited by our protagonist, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien). Sent hurtling up the lift shaft, he is anxious of what awaits him when he reaches the top. Suddenly the lift reaches its pinnacle, and two large doors are flung open, revealing bright sunlight. Thomas is surrounded by a faction of young and intimidating men, and quickly decides that he must escape his fate; good or bad. But when escaping on two legs doesn't exactly work out and his mind fails (due to the complete wipe of his memory), Thomas learns that he may have to adhere to the group's one rule: he must always stay within the confines of the glade, their home. Upon discovering that the group are stuck within the Glade, Thomas learns however, that beyond the Glade there is a maze; an ever- changing labyrinth of such large proportions that it's impossible to escape its towering facade. Yet, during the day, the maze is mapped by a group of people named runners, fast and agile boys who constantly search the maze for a way out. They've been searching for three years, but when the new arrival begins to shine, the group decide that he may be their one chance of liberation. Nonetheless, the group are threatened, due to the fact that at night, the maze is patrolled by vicious beasts named Grievers, malignant beasts which possess a deadly sting. Yep, it's a "Lord of the Flies"-esque survival story and to be perfectly honest, it feels like we've seen many of its elements before. Testosterone fuelled arguments and violence amongst the survivors are the key ingredients here, but it doesn't stop "The Maze Runner" from being an enjoyable piece of science-fiction. Personally, I was formerly unaware of "The Maze Runner" book series, and this proved to be an interesting concept, but I couldn't escape the feeling that it was somehow similar to "The Hunger Games" in its idea of children being tested beyond their expectations and abilities. But, I'm willing to let that slide. In fact, this is most probably one of the most satisfying young adult adaptations in recent years, superior to "Divergent" and its various rivals, but it falters in its inability to be gritty. At the rating of '12A', the distributors are obviously attempting to encourage a wider audience into cinema screens and obtain a larger amount of money, but to impress the fans you need to keep the realistic aspects of the effects of violence firmly placed within the film. If not, it just feels as though the entire film is a large cash-grab for distributors, if it wasn't already. Saying that, there are moments of violence and bloody detail which is quite bold, but due to the lack of the film's dark nature there isn't any satirical bite to the film, or the ability to feel for each character. Even with its interesting concept, the film's script is undeniably weak. The dialogue unfortunately feels as though it should belong to a TV film, but the relationships between each character are strong and allows the film to bypass its feeble dialogue. In spite of the film's lack of gritty elements or rich conversation, it is kept afloat by its young, yet talented cast. He may be relatively unknown, but O'Brien produces a strong performance amongst the high-calibre cast, leading the film throughout its highs and lows. The film also contains three of Britain's most engaging actors currently working in film/television today. Aml Ameen, Brodie-Sangster and Poulter (a delightfully silly antagonist) are all perfect additions to the cast, once again providing skillful performances amongst the large array of cast members. Alongside the film's broadly unknown cast, composer John Paesano is an unexplored certainty in relation to the film's wonderful score. Often tense and at other times notably melancholy, Paesano's first score is an intriguing foray into blockbuster entertainment, which is strikingly promising. One of the film's most appealing elements however, is the direction of Ball's debut. Without having worked on previous films before, Ball is an unforeseen pleasure in the art of direction, as he seems to receive honest performances, but still manages to connect with the film's Sci-Fi aspects, by providing expert camera-work alongside cinematographer Enrique Chediak. Verdict: "Lord of the Flies" this isn't, and neither is it as gritty as it aspires to be, but this is a confident, exciting and sleek debut from director Wes Ball. "The Hunger Games" has finally received some worthy competition 6 stars out of 10 Check out the review on my website, at this address: http://utopiareviews.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/the-craze-for-maze- scott-gentry-reviews.html
2.0~What did I just watch phantom_pixie Sign in Permalink I had no expectations on this film, and it left me with just that. I could might as well watched a tree grow for that amount of time. I felt that they spent most of the films budget on making a huge CGI maze. Rather than getting good actors. Not in one single scene is the acting remotely close to believable. I never care about any of the characters. It's obvious from the first scene who will live and who will die during the film. I never worry about Thomas, nor Newt or Minho. The only interesting thing in the film are the Greivers, that you unfortunately barely see and that they don't develop further. Just like the illness or W.C.K.D are left in the dark, so seems most of the script. It all seems rushed. The film have a few decent looking actions scenes, but nothing worth watching the rest of it. If you want to see kids fighting some obscure monsters, you can watch the last ten minutes of the film. If you are looking for something with more substance, you pick something different to watch. Given that this film should be a mix between Lord of the flies and The Cube. It had potential. It just wasn't good.
7.0~Another of the many young adult dystopian films david-sarkies Sign in Permalink Once again we have another young adult dystopian movie hit our screens, though I must admit that this one was somewhat more engaging than Divergence (and I have yet to see the movies that have spawned out of The Hunger Games). I had wanted to see this film since it started being advertised but when I sat down in the cinema and the movie began I wondered if I was going to enjoy it. As it turned out I did, despite the slow start (though it wasn't all that slow). However, I would suggest that the story was hardly original, to an extent. As I was watching the film I kept on thinking that I had seen a similar story before. In a way it is like The Truman Show, namely because we have this group trapped in an artificial world where they are being watched by an unknown group on the outside, however it is not necessarily a television show for the entertainment of the masses. Still, I could not get past the feeling that there were number of similar elements (especially how the entire premise of the movie is to attempt to escape). The other story that I felt it had borrowed from was Lord of the Flies, however there were a number of differences, namely that we did not watch the boys move from civilisation to a state of savagery. However it was certainly much better that Divergent (which I ended up finding incredibly corny) though the setting is quite similar (though I will not go into too many details as I do not want to give away the ending). Basically the story involves a young adult named Thomas who wakes up in a cage that deposits him in this large glade in the middle of a huge maze. Every night the maze closes and they hear the sounds of monsters and walls shifting. As such the inhabitants simply try to get on with their life within the glade and accept that they are never going to escape. This is not an option for Thomas though because he is always looking for a way to get out, despite the fact that he has no memory of where he was prior to being deposited in the maze. The other catch is that the arrival of Thomas heralds a number of changes, which indicates that maybe these boys (and later on one girl) are probably not supposed to remain here forever, and it is clear that this is something that Thomas does not want to do. As I said, it actually wasn't a bad movie, however it appears that this is the first in the trilogy, so it is yet to be seen whether the rest of the series is anywhere near as good as this particular film.
10.0~Love this movie!!! ninjafire336 Sign in Permalink Watched this movie only the other day from Itunes on my laptop and I actually fell in love. Finally a popular franchise without the cliché love triangle! Would definitely recommend this film to the vast majority of people, especially if you're into the Young Adult genre. The cast are all fantastic and are a perfect match for the roles they play (my personal favorite is Newt played by Thomas Sangster), the set looks incredible. It's amazing how realistic they've made the maze look even though half of it is CGI! The Glade seems like the peaceful and harm-free place it should be (even though at the actual set they had a ton of snakes, mostly poisonous). James Dashner is awesome to have thought of this incredible plot line and Wes Ball is brilliant to have brought this to life in the way he did.
6.0~Don't watch the last 5 minutes Bethandavis Sign in Permalink I actually enjoyed this film until the very end when it was spoiled with completely unnecessary story exposition. Before that point I'd felt the cast and acting was great, the special effects were believable and there was good pace to the film. Then they ruined it with a 'narrator' scientist woman, explaining in an unnatural scenario to another random group of scientists, that the world had been destroyed by a solar flare, that the maze was all some big test, and there would be further tests for those teenagers who'd survived the maze. As if the scientists working in the maze wouldn't already know all this stuff, and if they didn't perhaps they ought to find employment elsewhere. This blatant attempt to hook us into watching the next film only caused me to question the ridiculousness of the final scene and consequently the whole film, like...Why would these scientists invest what must be absurd amounts of money to build an over- engineered maze only to kill off most of the teenagers they put in there? Why was the scientist woman and her team lying on the ground 'pretending' to be dead when the teenagers entered the room? How long had they been pretending? What happened if one of them needed to pop to the loo? Had they considered the possibility that one of the teenagers would prod them with one of their wooden sticks? This bizarre scene was stitched onto the end of the film and was pointless to boot as I'd already watched the film at this point! Way to go whoever wrote this script!
4.0~Being the average Hollywood flick that it its, should I say more? nekoinesto Sign in Permalink You know what I mean, it's the type of movies everyone hates here - the Hollywood flick. It has a lot of mistakes that go unnoticed, but for a serious viewer can be a real pinch in the eye. For example, as the movie says (no spoilers), they were stuck there for 3 years? How did they shave themselves? I mean, they look young, but you have to grow just a little bit in your facial hair or hair at all. They however, look perfectly clean. Second thing that pinches my eye is - come on, they are young as I said, it's impossible everything can be so peaceful, If it was realistic, I think that a lot of them would just, die...
10.0~Remember it's only a movie.....it's not that bad. RogerCampbell Sign in Permalink I actually liked this movie. As I watched this movie I was somewhat reminded of The Lord of the Flies, but with a lot of science fiction thrown in there. Yes, this movie has flaws, but what movie doesn't? Is it believable? No, but so what. Is Star Wars, The Avengers, Batman, Captain America, and The Hunger Games believable? No. I have read a lot of reviews on here that pan this movie, but that's just it...it is only a movie. Just sit back and let yourself enjoy the fantasy. And if it was really that bad why would they be making a sequel? It must have done well at the box office. I bought the DVD for my son, and I am sure that he will enjoy it more than I did.
4.0~Illogic and contra-dictionary Plus another praise of youth in Hollywood. tommokrusty Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner (2014) Another "youth competing/surviving for their life" theme movie 30 November 2014 Just another praise of youth. Or how can you put it...Hollywood is again using very young actors, and the plot or theme is,sigh,again about a group of people competing in order to survive. And the sub- theme about society is dividing people into a few class. Just mention The "Harry Potter","Hunger Games" series, plus "Divergent","Ender's Game",TV-series "The 100","The Giver" etc. etc. Of course there are differences of those movies/series. But the overall big picture is quite easy to see that Hollywood is into the "youth competing for their life"-kind of genre these years. Plus the placement is very often a society who put the citizen into a few classes right from birth or given when they are teens. I was close to give this movie only 3 stars because I'm getting tired of seeing the same theme repeating over and over again from different movies. But I gave it a 4 star because of the good special effects. And the kids gave an okay performance despite an mediocre manuscript. I know the story should be a big thing as a book. I don't know about that, but I can't just give my review of the movie. Don't give me wrong. I don't mind young actors. But they should be giving characters that seems plausible to the story. Plus in most cases, the older actors with more experience, will, In my mind, just act better than preteen/teen/tween etc. Fx I like "Lord of the flies" because the actors where very good. But besides that, the movie had a good story and manuscript. Plus at that time the movies plot was original. Making a movie like that one or two times a year, and the originality quickly fades out. To go into the detail of "The Maze runner" it was quickly to me, it had some things that could make it a better movie. From the start of the movie, there's a lot of secrecy about why the main character (Thomas) can't get out of the area they are put and go into the maze. Thats quite obvious that's just put in there in the movie, to give the audience some mystery. But for me, that already broke down my "4th wall" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall), or the realism of the movie got broken there. For me, if it should be more realistic, it would be more realistic if the people who was put there in the maze, to right away give warnings to newcomers about how dangerous it would be to step into. The "greenies" or newcomers to the maze, are quickly told, they have to work for the community. That also seemed a bit odd to me. They get the food served on (metal)plate each month, so what is there to be done more really? But I guess that was another odd thing that was placed there just to give a bit of false drama. Despite all those things, the rest of the movie was okay because you got curious what the maze had to offer. But it was rather predictable. Okay. No spoilers from me. But you can watch it one Sunday if you feel bored. But I would recommend "Rollerball" (1975),"The running Man" (1987) and "The lord of the flies" (1990) instead if you want a bit similar themes.

7.0~Entertaining Watch, Shaky Writing Palidan400 Sign in Permalink Before the trailer released, I had never even heard of the books. From the trailer, I expected a generic young-adult film that would still entertain me. Its premise seemed interesting though so I was glad to see this screening. Coming out, I can say that it was a fun 2 hours that was worth the time. However, several issues really bring it down and keep it from standing out. Again, The Maze Runner did successfully entertain me (and the rest of the full theater from what I saw). It was action-packed and intense, definitely an enjoyable experience if you're looking for an exciting movie to watch. The visuals were great, and interpreted very nicely according to my friend who has read the books. The maze's design brings in a lot of different elements/influences from cultures around the world to make the environment appropriately interesting and incredible at times, in no small amount due to the visual effects. The film started out smoothly, very quickly introducing its characters and setting up the plot (or at least what we know for now), throwing you into the action. However, as it progressed, a few things began to bother me. The writing in specific situations is a bit shaky, and ultimately it doesn't succeed well in separating itself from other generic, clichéd action films. A lot of the characters, their personalities/actions, are predictable, and that takes away from their development, at least for me. They essentially played into roles and did not establish their own personal and emotional connections to the audience, so there wasn't much weight to consequence that occur. In terms of the general story and background, I find that it takes a large amount of suspension of disbelief, and a lot of the things that happen or how they happen are expected to just be accepted. Regarding the characters themselves, Dylan O'Brien pleasantly surprised me. I think he did quite well in his role and I am excited to see more of him. Aml Ameen as Alby also performed decently. However, that is the extent of my compliments for the actors unfortunately. No other character really stood out from the actors' performances, and some of them are unconvincing at times. Gally, as the "villain", was a weak character I find, and he didn't really have logical motivations for his actions. However, my friend who has read the book has told me that the characters are better fleshed out in the books. Overall, I would have to place The Maze Runner with a 7, but verging on the lower side of that. It's definitely entertaining and I don't regret the watch. The writing and acting holds it back, but it has still set up a nice world and I am quite interested in seeing what they make of it next. Hopefully they will improve upon the issues found here. RATING: [6.5/10]
8.0~This is one of the movies that push me to read its book qwertz_qwertz Sign in Permalink This is one of the movies that push me to read its book. I think, the producers wasted an excellent source but this movie one of the few good movies I've watched in last years It kept my attention on the screen (most of the movies can't; I just watch them to spend time) Some of the movies don't worth to write a comment it's too bad and some of them are too excellent there is no need to write a comment. I write this comment for the producers if they focused on the art there might be a cult or an excellent movie. For the readers who wounder about this movie, it reminded me Ender's Game and The Hunger Games which I didn't like the first one but when I watched the second one I'm looking forward for the third one. I joined IMDb seven years ago and voted movies as far as I can remember but in simple calculation I've watched over ten thousand movies since 1994.
8.0~Good acting, amazing action and better than mediocre. rebeccaspurlock Sign in Permalink When I first heard about that the book was being made into a film I was doubtful, but it surprised me very well. Dylan O'Brien unexpectedly did extremely good and so did Wes Ball at directing, and what about Will Poulter with another fantastic performance. Now the book was obviously better because it has many differences and took risks with language and violence but it's toned down in this film. Thomas has a lot more emotional tense moments in the book and that's why I liked it so much and the movie converted some, meanwhile Teresa was way under used in the film. Now when Thomas, Newt and the others make it out and find the outside world in the book it lasts longer and here its too quick, especially the death of Gally and Chuck. There is the most obvious "There's gonna be a sequel scene ever" I mean hey there's other books, but Jesus you don't have to force the upcoming sequel in our faces. I enjoyed the film so much from start to finish and The Runners' have a bright future for the big screen.
9.0~Mind-blowing movie saratonin24 Sign in Permalink I came into this movie knowing absolutely nothing other than the title and the fact that the main character played in Teen Wolf, a show which I despise. Because of this I assumed the movie was going to be dull and only watched it to pacify a friend. After having watched it twice now I can say that I was very pleasantly surprised. I've been seeing other reviews stating that the movie wasn't that great so I'm not sure whether my great experience comes from knowing nothing about it or what; if so I would definitely recommend going that route when watching this. Granted, it's not a perfect movie. There are things that don't line up and not having read the books yet I'm not exactly sure what is plot holes and what is intentional but nevertheless I still really enjoyed it. This movie kept me glued to my seat the whole time. I had no idea what was going on or what the maze or grievers were and it left me hooked. Just as soon as the credits rolled everyone in the room looked around and was absolutely mind-blown. It was all we could talk about, to the point where we had to re-watch it with some more friends who had the same reaction as us. This movie gives you just enough to welcome you into the world and leave you craving more. Every single person I watched this with was researching where to get the books. It leaves you with so many questions (a good thing in my opinion) that you just have to go out and see what happens next. If I had to describe this in one word it would be "Mindblown". Absolutely amazing.
7.0~Practically 3 locations AlexandraBello Sign in Permalink I really liked this movie! I did think that it was made out of practically nothing, but it was still going along with good rhythm and slowly releasing small details that would spin it off completely and add another layer of drama and tragedy to the story. It is a very simple topic though, well told story, which makes this simple topic appealing. The same storytelling that kept everyone paying attention at all times, not to miss a vital detail that might change their path to the whole story. The movie started right with confusion and practically ended like it, which is an element that I don't quite appreciate when I go watch a movie, because I find it rather mortifying. However, since it started dumping a young adult "Thomas" in the middle of nowhere or in the middle of a valley that is surrounded by fortress, with guys that have been living there for THREE years. Like I said I really liked this movie, but it doesn't mean that I agree with every piece of information that was part of the story. Since I didn't read the book I don't think is right to focus on the story's elements and smash them, but I will just disagree with the obvious ones. The story looked to me a little old, in terms watching it after being exposed to "The Hunger Games", "Divergent", "Surrogate", "Alien" and even "Peter Pan" for a little bit; as well as being exposed to any story that contains characters with similar realities, but don't cross my mind right now. Of course they had to make it unique its own technicalities. The cinematography was on point, with Wess Ball leading, as the director. Very creative and fresh vision, having such a great outcome with this talented, fairly new director, another evidence that great directors don't need to be all up in Hollywood flicks to prove who they are. Every actor did a great job, I particularly enjoy watching Dylan O'Brien on the big screen, since the time when I watched "The First Time", he was so telegenic and decent looking. However, I don't love his look in this movie, he looks better with a little more weight on. The special effects in the movie were very realistic, it is clear that the production team put a great effort into plotting this out with vast detail; and for only showing a couple of locations, they kept it interesting. The action sequences were pretty suspenseful, with great music by the hand of John Paesano and following a good pace. However I didn't understand why these people were there for 3 years, we're talking about people that were born to tests and were apparently pretty smart, but couldn't shake the fact that whatever they were doing was not working. Let's say they started sending the runners out after the first year; that still makes it 730 days of trying. I also didn't understand why the characters didn't catch on to the fact that there was a helicopter waiting for them outside the maze, I think it would've been more realistic if one of them would've posed the question about how possible it was that the helicopter could've picked them up at the center of the maze in the first place. There was no need for the film to show that the story continues and mortify us one more time showing that everything was a test and everyone was ready to get to the next level. Again my issues with this movie focused on the story elements and making some sense of what was showed and what wasn't. I still recommend "The Maze Runner" and give it 7 IMDb stars. © 2013 Alexandra Bello
7.0~Haven't checked out the books yet but this film really made me want to do it! manhhahlu Sign in Permalink To be honest, I went to the theater without any high expectations. Dare to say I was not in a good mood either. But the film did not let me down alas, which was a good thing. First of all, I really like the approach of "The Maze Runner". It was direct, intriguing and straight up to the point. However I did find it a bit confused at first when everything was displayed in front of my eyes without much explanation about the context behind it all. All truth to be told, the I-have-a-set-of-rules-which-you- probably-gonna-break-anyway thing was getting a bit too tiresome and unconvincing, since we were not left with the impression that those rules were made to last. But the film did manage to pull out some pretty touching moments as well as some small twists, which in my opinion were quite appreciating. Overall I did enjoy the plot, though I still could point out dozens of holes in it. Next, talking about the cast. I really did not enjoy the 2 main actors and actresses. They acted very forced as if they already knew what was going to happen next. But the supporting casts did quite a plausible job. Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt played a believable character whom seemed to be smart and encouraging. And the young Blake Cooper really gave quite an impression though the playtime of his was not so long. Last but not least, Kee Hong Lee as Minho also did his part very well in term of being a leader of the Runner team. Since the film does not possess a real villain aside from Mr. Nice Guy Will Poulter, I can safely assume that this guy could not, I repeat, COULD NOT play a bad guy. Even being a confusing one at that. To come to a conclusion, let's just say that this film is good enough for me to start picking up the books and see what happens next to the characters.
1.0~An easy suggestion for those who've read the books bil_94 Sign in Permalink -SPOILERS AHEAD- (unless you've read the books) If you've read the books, don't even approach to this movie, it takes it into a big loop, missing plot, adding unuseful stuff, and of course, destroying any future possibilities for the movies in the future. My suggestion, don't watch it, and if you haven't read the books, read them, but save your time not watching this movie. Some examples are the serum against the grievers, it doesn't exist, it comes up later in the movie. Another one is Gally, that disappears half of the book, it's around like 3/4 of the movie, and it doesn't really hate Thomas. The part that Thomas gets his "punishment", the whole of the people around are in there, and Alby isn't there (you'll find out why)
6.0~Didn't worth the money, but it did has surprises. nerdingsince1996 Sign in Permalink I had read the book a few months ago and I didn't like it. It was not about the story-well mainly though I did have problems with it-but the writing style and the main characters portrayal. However, it did not change the fact that this was one of my few anticipated movie this year, mostly because I wanted to know how it would be brought to the big screen. So called me biased, I thought the movie did not change my opinion of The Maze Runner. I gave it 6 out of ten, an average at best, but it did has a few surprises. Surprisingly, the directing style, the scores, the visual effect, and the editing were blended together nicely. I have a very low expectations for YA adaptations now, but this one was handled quite well. Good job, filmmakers. Despite that, I did have complains. I thought all the characters are miscast, and their acting did not change my mind. I did like O'Bryan as Thomas, and I actually hate book-Thomas, but his acting was average at best. The made minor change on the story, some which actually worked. The pace was not rushed or significantly slow. I did get bored, but I blamed it on the story. The girl (Teresa) role in this movie was clearly minimized, I was sure it's because of the time limit. But, this was a wrong move. Teresa was the one making the movie more thrilling. It sparked my curiosity. I had all kings of predictions. Who is this girl? What's her connection? They were making her seemed important. But, they blew the candle. And if that's not enough, her portrayal is all wrong. She's useless, more of a cameo really, an eye candy. Who want to watch all boys movie now, hmmm? I know she will make more appearances on the next movie. But, we're not talking about the sequel, are we? All in all, this one is not worth my money. If this movie had not been in my anticipated list, I would have waited until it was available on rent.
7.0~Only the 2nd hour. erroll1707 Sign in Permalink With a sleepy first hour, the second hour gives glimpse of a superb action movie. A few moments of fabulous acting were seen only during some great action scenes. CGI was used at its best, 10 stars to that, if not for the first half this could have been an unmissable movie. Another good aspect was the diversification of cast from different cultural backgrounds. We rarely get to see a good mix of ethnicity in movies. I personally feel that Kaya Scodelario's role in the move wasn't justified well enough, she could have been omitted. We don't always need a female actor in a male movie, or vice versa. I give it a 7, and you need to watch this if you are up for some good CGI action. If not for the first half this could have been an unmissable movie.
10.0~Best movie of the fall season emilylucas147 Sign in Permalink This was truly roller coaster of emotions and even when you thought it was over,it was just the beginning. Never predictable and it left me on the edge of my seat the whole time! Besides having Dylan O'Brien as the main focus, it still creates a sense of close knit cast you wouldn't even know that this was the first time they met. This was definitely a must see and what you always look for in a movie, with every unexpected twist my adrenaline was pumping! Dylan shows he's not just that "MTV TV star" he shows tremendous strength and character that every great well known actor has to have. I love the original,unique style of directing and storyboard I can't wait for the second one already!
9.0~One of the best movies set in dystopia Abijit_Radhakrishna Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner: as the name suggests 'the Maze' is the most important part of this movie. Based on the novel of the same title, this movie gives us a lot of Hold-your-breath-moments. All the actors have delivered amazing performance.The crew has done an excellent job and hats off to the director who is immensely talented. I would've given 10 out of 10, if the movie had a more rational/logical reason behind the activities done by 'WICKED' and if the climax was a bit more detailed like the novel. Anyway,this is worth a watch. Must Watch. Suggest to your friends and family. This can also be regarded as one of the greatest movie adaptations of famous novels.
9.0~Fantastic but not for everyone meshkatmohamadi Sign in Permalink Its awesome but not everybody like this kind of movies,only the one who can think...
7.0~The movie if watchable, but the plot is really poor. PavlicT Sign in Permalink Well, it is not that I did not like the movie. Is intriguing and the expectation are immediately high... but in the end it fails to deliver. I mean... the ending is rubbish. So, the sun is devastating the earth and, moreover a brain virus is exterminating the rest of humanity? OK! Here is what we are gonna do. Even if we are probably on a very very tight budget, since the post apocalyptic scenario, we will build an enormous maze full of terrific bio-mechanical monsters, with a miraculous irrigation system (since everything is desert, while the middle of the maze is a paradise). Then, we will take the rare children that are immune to this brain virus and we will put them in this dangerous maze. This because we will understand why they are immune to the virus by monitoring how fast they can run away from creepy giant spiders we have programmed to kill them. Yes, this might work...
9.0~An Action Packed, Visually Stunning Film That Will Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat Throughout rannynm Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is an action packed, visually stunning new film that made hold my breath and kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end. The Maze Runner tells the story of Thomas, played by Dylan O'Brien, who wakes up in a giant crate with no memory of his passed. He is taken to "The Glade," a place full of boys who were taken and had their memories erased as well. Thomas soon learns that they are trapped in a giant maze, and once you're stuck inside, you never make it out alive. Everything begins to change when a girl is brought to the Glade and so Thomas decides it is time to face the maze and find the whole truth about the people who placed them there. But the truth they find might be even more horrible than the maze itself. I absolutely love this film. It is so intense and visually stunning. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made my heart race through the entire the film. Every time Thomas is inside the maze, I felt as if I was there with him, running for my life. But this isn't just an adrenaline packed adventure. The Maze Runner also moved me to tears and made me think about the way we can work together when we are truly faced with a challenge. The visuals are incredible as well. The maze is so complex and ever changing and it's so cool to be able to "explore" it in a sense and see all of the detail put into the CGI. The entire cast is incredible. All the characters are so unique and have their own personality and quirks, but they work together in such a seamless way. My favorite character is Thomas played by Dylan O'Brien. He is the main character in this film and really makes the whole thing come to life. The boys that live in the Glade have been there for three years and, of course, they have tried to find a way out. But, most of them have essentially decided that they will live out the rest of their days there. When Thomas shows up, he tests the system and refuses to accept his fate of being stuck in the maze. I admire his character because he thinks outside of the box and finds his own way. He looks past his fear and is a strong leader despite the doubts people may have in him. It's been very interesting seeing the theme of films that have been coming out recently. Hunger Games, Divergent, Enders Game, The Giver and now The Maze Runner all have something in common. They tell the story of young adults, children really, who have to group together and take on some very serious situations, sometimes things even adults can't handle. It shows youth questioning authority, standing up for what's right and making their own way. These strong themes send out a message of empowerment to the youth of our generation, but this can also be a bit overwhelming. I know it's difficult watching adults fight for their lives, kill and be killed, and have their worlds torn apart. But it's even more shocking to see children go through these trials. Because of this, I recommend The Maze Runner for ages 13+ because of the intense situations and violence. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made me hold my breath during the intense situations, and I love when a film gets me so involved, but that may be too much for some to handle. I give The Maze Runner 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait to see it again. Catch it in theaters near you now! Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

8.0~The Maze Runner - Review CharlieGreenCG Sign in Permalink Based on the best-selling YA novel, The Maze Runner is the newest, and one of largest adaptions to arrive in cinemas yet. Comparable to The Hunger Games and Twilight, it is in fairly good chances to be the next big franchise. Here is what we thought of it; Setting the tone immediately, lead star Dylan O'Brien awakens suddenly in a very dark and eerie lift travelling from deep below the ground, it becomes apparent that he now knows just as much as we do. The fear is visual and quite real  and just like a young child on our first day of school we are pushed into a new, confusing experience for the next two hours. Arriving atop the lift and unable to remember anything other than his name, Thomas. He is told by a group of teenage boys that he is in a field in the centre of a maze, called the 'Glade', where they all live. Having attempted to find a way out many times, all they know is that the maze is open during the day-time, and closed at night where it periodically changes and is protected by fearsome creatures called 'grievers'. Anyone in there at that time has never returned. Much like an episode of Lost meeting The Lord of the Flies meeting Labyrinth, we understand narrative at the same time as Thomas, who is eventually told that three years ago a young teenage boy first arrived at the glade, and each month since one more arrives in the lift with certain supplies to survive. Unknowing of why and unable to escape they have become helplessly trapped there since. Similarly to The Lord of the Flies, the group of boys, all probably aged 10-20 have creating a living-area, created rules, swearwords and the imperative code to 'never go beyond those walls' - but as Thomas arrives at the glade all seems to change for the worse, and many of the other 'Gladers' take note. Admittedly we had not read the book until after we had saw the film, but from the very first paragraph we noted its book-to-screen accuracy. Fans of the book will be more than satisfied with the minimal changes, and any made are for the better. The film, upheld by a ninety-nine percent teen cast, feels news and many of the actors are in roles unseen before. Dylan O'Brien, From TV's Teen-Wolf, provides an exceptional lead role as Thomas and carries the film in both story and emotional trawls. Although new to the setting and with the films entirety taking place over just a few days, he comfortably fits in, although ruffling many traditions too. At one point it is said 'I don't know if he is brave or stupid, but we need more of him'. Co-staring alongside Dylan O'Brien are equally exceptional performances by; Will Poulter, in a dark tough-guy role, (and absolutely nothing like his recent role as Kenny in We're The Millar's); Thomas Brodie-Sangster stars as a fellow Glader; and Kaya Scodelario in a surprise turn-up as the first female at the Glade - but also 'the last one ever' to arrive. Although the narrative between them is conflicting at times, the chemistry is smooth as if friends both on-and-off the screen. Notably, we can confirm that the characters live-up the book creations and are almost perfectly cast. Evidentially former director/writer/editor/effects maestro, Wes Ball uses skills from his previous work on this film and it shows and flows evenly. Take note future producers, this is how to successfully make a YA adaption, which surprisingly, is just as impressive as the book. Yet unfortunately leaves us with far more questions than answers by the end. Based on the trilogy by James Dashner expect more answers to follow in sequel movies in the soon to be massive franchise. Or, you know  you can read the books before hand? Ultimately, you do not have to be a fan of the books, or even a YA to enjoy the film it, it has something for almost everyone. The Maze Runner arrives in US cinemas 19th September, and UK cinemas on 10th October. Be sure to check back soon and read our exclusive interview with director Wes Ball, and leading cast; Dylan O'Brien, Will Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Brace yourselves Maze Runner fans!
8.0~An enjoyable film with great characters. noah_chick Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is a 2014 action/sci-fi film in which a teenager named Thomas wakes up to find himself without any memory of who he is, and in a small colony surrounded by a dangerous maze known as "The Glades". Maze Runner as I will call it really surprised me, I was expecting a sub-par action flick with annoying characters and teen drama, but to my surprise it had very little of that! It's a well acted and thrilling film with more upsides than down. Maze Runner itself if very reminiscent of Lord of the Flies, and just like the book, the characters are the main selling points. The characters are both beautifully written and acted, but the supporting characters are the real meat of the film. The characters make level-headed and surprisingly smart decisions, and when a struggle occurs it's not out of nowhere, you understand why the characters would make these decisions. But in my opinion, the best part of the film is the maze itself. The special effects and design of the maze is both beautiful and creative that disorientates you just as much as the characters. But, sadly this isn't a perfect film. The character of Thomas is under-developed and dry, the maze could have been utilized a bit more, and the character of Chuck is both annoying at times, and poorly acted. But honestly, it's still a really enjoyable film that has the potential to be a really great trilogy.
10.0~What new idea! Its_JaggerAlert Sign in Permalink My mum had always read the books to these movies and she told me if it was worth seeing - this was a massive 'YES' from here. So we went to see it and not expecting a lot but the first part of the movie really got my eyes open! The movie didn't sense of course at first but they slowly got straight to the point and it helped - we didn't have to guess what the plot line was, in some movies this work but in some it just doesn't and this movie put it dot on perfect with telling us what happening and leaving use to use a bit more. At the end a lot of things made sense but it left us a big cliff hanger! There was something funny in it but the main one was what they had been looking for in a funny way! watch and see!
7.0~This movie when not compared to the book is awesome! orbitgyrl208 Sign in Permalink This movie when not compared to James Dashners book is wonderful. The cinematography is wonderful, the script is great, and the acting is even better. I admit I might be biased on the acting part my favorite actor stars in this movie. Here are the reasons its not good. Alby shows Thomas around the first day. The screen writer gave Alby all of Chucks dialog from the book. Theresa doesn't go into a coma. Ben isn't in "the changing" when Thomas comes to the Glade. there is no cliff. the "keeper's meeting" isn't private. Gally doesn't get mad at the meeting and leave the Glade. In the maze Thomas has Minho's help getting Alby up on the maze wall. it rains. Theresa brings the serum with her. Thomas and Theresa don't communicate telepathically. The Griever attack is all wrong. Gally doesn't give himself to the grievers. there are numbers as a password. the scientists are dead when the "Gladers" arrive. Gally doesn't want to leave. Gally kills chuck without being controlled. the maze is not underground. For those reasons I give this a rating of seven. it follows the book but leaves out things that are important. Not all of the things I put are important to the movie. but I felt were.
6.0~Worth a watch but nothing special MovieSonic Sign in Permalink This was basically a very low-key version of Divergent. I wasn't particularly impressed but it's entertaining enough so I'm just going to give a brief overview of the good and bad points. Bad points being that it literally is a low-key version of every tween film ever made - I think they spent about 5 seconds quickly pointing out all of the gangs and establishing which was the 'cool' gang. It's all about 'being chosen' and 'being special' which I think is very damaging to young children's personal development because that's not how life is. The white guy is the saviour of literally everyone. They all seem a bit too well adjusted for people who have been kidnapped, no insanity or OCD habits and ticks. As usual the monsters have this weird thing where they are extremely agile with lots of legs and extra tentacle-claws so theoretically they 'should' be able to catch and/or kill the people they're chasing fairly easily but movie logic ensures they can't. At least until the script requires it. Good points are that enough things happen to keep the viewer's attention and while it's not believable that there weren't more arguments, this actually made the film easier to watch because it's annoying when there is too much opposition. One bad guy is enough. The scary monsters were genuinely scary and I thought the twist(s) at the end were good. I'd watch a second film but this one is so unoriginal that I have to give it a 6.
8.0~The Maze Runner.....would watch again! hks650 Sign in Permalink "The Maze Runner" is a tale with themes of societal contentment, following the human nature of curiosity, and apocalyptic fiction. Thomas, who is played by Dylan O'Brian is a young man thrown into an all-male society. He can't remember anything from his past life, not even his name. Amid his confusion about where he is, and why he's there he is reassured that he will be given his name back. It is the only thing "they" allow you to keep from the past. Everyone seems quite content with their new world, adapting to the rules and regulations of this place. Thomas grows more and more inquisitive about what's beyond the circular walls of which they are in trapped. Initially his curiosity is kind of annoying; seeming to block the viewer from learning the ropes of is this place. With his curiosity he finds out how he's connected to all of it, and why they're all there. Director, Wes Ball builds suspense by allowing him to find clues intermittently throughout the plot. There were many visual affects used such as the tracking shot/ dolly shot from behind as they run from the Grievers. As the viewer it makes you feel as though you are running with them in between the huge, seemingly concaving walls of the maze. The director also used a variety of angles such as bird's eye view capturing the full affect and details of the intricate maze; low angle revealing the intimacy between two characters as one of them is dying, and many others. The sounds used in this film were awesome! There was a mixture of diegetic and non-diegetic sounds. An example of a diegetic sound used is the echoing, clicking sound from the Grievers (large creatures). Their sound instills a sense of fear in the viewer; when you hear them you know danger is brewing. I don't watch many movies twice but this one I would watch again. The movie concludes with some hints to there being a sequel, and I'm looking forward to watching that as well.
2.0~Predictable brifizz01 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner, a poorly written mess of a film. While, yes some parts were quite entertaining, the whole story is very predictable. The ending was quite abrupt and half-assed as well but I will continue onto that after I address moments which happened earlier in the movie. First, the whole concept is quite interesting, although the writers did not expand on it properly, leaving the whole movie to be rushed and unenjoyable. The Maze Runner is a few young, up- and-coming male actors, a plot that does not live up to the original and way too many cliché moments. Watch, as everyone in the audience pretends not to predict scenes like: Chuck risking his life for Thomas, Thomas bursting out into tears over a child he has known for 5 days, Thomas running into the maze just for the lols, Gally showing up at the end for no apparent reason even though it was almost impossible to follow the group out of the maze etc. etc. The ending, as stated before, is half-assed, abrupt and completely rushed. Half of the events were unexplained, and when they were the explanation was just plain boring and predictable. Plus at the very end it hints towards a second movie, god help us. I could go on and on about this movie, but the fact is it is one of those movies you watch, like, think about then realize how poorly written it actually was. Spare yourself the 113 minutes and just watch the Hunger Games: Catching Fire.
7.0~Entertaining really, but still flawed. Filvies144 Sign in Permalink I haven't seen the second film, Scorch Trials, but I have seen this one (That's why I'm writing the review, duh). But know that I think of this film, it's a mix between the March 2014 Sci-Fi Divergent and the 1998 Jim Carrey Comedy, The Truman Show. I will explain the similarities soon in this review. BTW, I've never read the books, but when I watched it, it felt like I didn't need to. In the story, a teen stumbles upon other teens around him all trapped in an area with walls surrounding it (See, the Truman show similarity?). Everyone in the area called the Glade has no memory of why they are there, but they try use this electronic maze to get out, which included 3 years of failed attempts. Its like putting the characters of Divergent in a Truman show like environment. Actually, it's an enjoyable film with the good execution and it's even thought provoking. But one plot hole is this: The Glade has some trees in it, yet the people there never tried building a ladder to bypass the wall (it isn't a dome, unlike the Truman show). Not a single one of the Teens figures this out. Isn't that just moronic? But even with that, it also has some twists, like a condition where a person would go insane and will have to be killed in the maze, and the condition is caused by a "Sting". So overall, things do get a little creative here, even with similarities to other films, but it does have some issues like that plot hole. The special effects are very effective I should say. Get it? But seriously, for 32 million dollar budget, it looks amazing. The technology in the film like the maze, the grievers, and more don't look cheap. The effects look artistic and look like very special effects. Get it? Okay, enough with the puns. But still, don't expect awful CGI creatures that look like Jar Jar Binks or that lazy CGI dog from the 2002 Scooby Doo. The characters in the film. Ah, not so great. The protagonist Thomas seems to be like the confused Teenager that is actually be very helpful, but he's treated badly in the Glade like an idiot. I think that he's a pretty good character, actually. Other than a few exceptions, the rest of the teens in the glade aren't very smart. Like I said earlier, they never figured out about a ladder ever and are huge jerks to Thomas. Plus, they are pretty bland. BTW, I can't tell you about more important characters because they will spoil the movie, who actually are pretty interesting. So overall, some characters are good, others, not so much. So overall, The Maze Runner has an enjoyable plot, Great Special effects, but not so great characters. Oh, and FYI, I can review the Truman show and Divergent soon to share my thoughts on those.
10.0~some one traps a couple kids in an unknown area and they have to find an escape route erodriguez-55554 Sign in Permalink This movie is a great film if you are looking for action and drama. This movie is a 10/10 because it has great actors and is very dramatic. It kind of reminds me of the fifth wave in a way because the aliens capture humans and keep them in a secured place for whatever reason. This movie portrays good quantities but also has a few areas to improve on.
7.0~Imagine if The Hunger Games hadn't sucked! hoytyhoyty Sign in Permalink Imagine if The Hunger Games franchise didn't suck! Take 'The Hunger Games', then - Remove the cheesy back story that's just there to take up time - and instead just fit a back story in where it needs to go. Remove the stupid emotional BS that's there as a placeholder for character 'depth' - and replace it with actual character unveiling with great performances. Remove the dumb CG and stupid 'arena' stuff - and replace it with a genuinely atmospheric, spooky, strange and downright scary maze. ... and you've got The Maze Runner! It's not high art, but it was well told, excellently acted, scary when it needed to be, pacey and not boring - and, as a result, I really quite enjoyed it. - -- ---
4.0~The Maze Runner - Movie review amelie-de-nobele Sign in Permalink It was a Wednesday afternoon when I thought I was finally getting answers to my questions. The screen lit up. We heard a boy sighing deep, and I was already flashed back. I thought this finally would be a good movie, that doesn't profit of the worldwide phenomenon of The Hunger Games, but clearly, just after a second or two, I had already realized that that was just not going to happen. For a moment, I thought I would see Katniss Everdeen crying as she entered the Quarter Quell, but apparently she was replaced by a 16-year-old boy named Thomas. Seriously, are we doing this again? I avoided the entire Divergent franchise because of "it", and "it" meaning the book-to- movie adaptations that are based on a book that clearly liked to fly on the wing of the big Mockingjay, hoping to reach success without even having to do any kind of effort. I tried to enjoy the movie, yet I couldn't resist comparing every little detail of it to my beloved The Hunger Games. The grievers were just another name for the mutts that the Capitol made, even the clothing was the same: the poor dressed in dirty, retro clothes, and even the villain was dressed in pure, innocent white. Maybe they didn't have to kill each other? They didn't have to, but apparently they did it voluntary after being injected with a serum (aka being hijacked with tracker jacker blood). I had some serious doubts if this movie wasn't written by a 6-year- old who just watched The Hunger Games. Why the girl? Why doesn't she do a damn thing? Is she really just there to make another awkward romance? I really didn't know why she even was there, in a world full of teenage boys. Of course it will probably be explained in the sequel why she is so special, but I still consider her as not worth any attention, I mean, she could even be replaced by a plant and it wouldn't even make that big of a difference. The important telepathy part from the books that made her not as useless as she probably could have been, was completely ignored in the movie- adaptation. And finally, Chuck died, and I just couldn't help but laugh inside. I just knew it was about to happen, I could feel the Rue-ness in the air just from the moment when Thomas was introduced to him. Oddly enough, Thomas didn't do any kind of three-finger-salute to a hidden camera. Although I really did not enjoy the movie at all, I could give a bit of credit to Dylan O'Brien for the acting that wasn't as terrible as most of the plot. In fact, I could see him playing in better, more pleasant franchises soon.
8.0~Well done jesseesau Sign in Permalink I'm going to start this review out by saying that I walked into this movie no knowledge of the book series, so all I know is what friends of mine told me happens in the book; which I learned after the movie ended. From what I was told, they did leave out certain aspects of the book, and slightly altered the ending, and I believe that these book aspects were unnecessary anyway, as they made a film which told an exciting story anyway, regardless of the story the book told. My criticisms of the movie are that the ending wasn't very original. Knowing nothing of the books, I was surprised because I didn't know that there would be a series out of this, and it wasn't just a stand alone film. This definitely helped me appreciate the ending more than others, but now that I know, I can look back and realize that the set up for the sequel was just awful. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that they could easily have made it more subtle, and it would have improved it quite significantly. My other concern is that it predicable to a certain degree, and when they find out why they are in the maze, it seems like a situation that is being overused these days. Having said all that however, the film did manage to excite me for the sequel, which I didn't even know was going to happen. The CGI was pretty good, there were some iffy moments, but overall I was impressed. The story also managed to remain interesting while setting up for the climax, with incredible action sequences, and one really tough to watch scene about how they deal with a deadly infection. This scene was emotional, and hard to watch, but it brilliantly illustrated how desperate and helpless the boys in the movie are. The films highlight was the acting. There was not a single moment where the acting was bland, which was a nice surprise to me, considering the youth in the cast. Kaya Scodelario did have a few moments where you could tell she was struggling to fight her British accent, but her acting was still well done. The three highlights of the cast were Dylan O'Brien, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, and Will Poulter especially, who was fantastic. These three actors more than anyone were great in every scene they were in. Overall, I give The Maze Runner an 8/10, because the story, effects, and acting were great, while the ending could have been better
5.0~Lots of Running Gubby-Allen Sign in Permalink The film is full of running, lots of it and the characters barely break sweat at times. It never really felt like a film, more a TV show, where you watch the first two of eight hours. It would have been better making it apparent from the start, that there would be no real ending and it would lead to a further part. It was ok, a few good scenes, I stuck.with it, but it is a bit of a mess and full of cliches and inconsistencies. Too many of the residents seemed oddly content and at ease with being there, the female character served little purpose and how one of the characters who chose to stay in the camp, then miraculously ended up outside made no sense. 5/10
1.0~Huge rip-off; would rather watch paint dry lbishopkyo Sign in Permalink Here's how I first imagined the movie: these people are trapped someplace, and they're only hope is make it through a maze in order to get home. You know, like a live-action Pac-Man, no? That actually would've been a pretty cool movie. The premise would've been trite (in video games, that is), but it would've been cool to see it be taken a step further. Instead, what do we get? A huge rip-off of The Hunger Games franchise and 28 Days Later (2003), followed by awful storytelling and one-too-many unresolved things. Here's why I hated this movie: As said before, this is a huge knockoff of The Hunger Games. Teenagers trapped in a dystopian future that takes place mostly in a field, they shoot bows and arrows all the time, live in shacks, hmm...where have I seen this before? I also say it's a 28 Days Later knockoff because it involves some huge epidemic infecting people or something, I don't know; I'm usually asleep at this point. There are way...too...many...unanswered questions! God, there are so many questions this movie leaves viewers asking that are never answered. For instance, when that girl shows up and she's carrying the note that reads "She's the last one ever." Never explained. Also, everybody keeps having mood swings; they switch from "We're gonna get through the maze," to "We can't get through the maze." Also, what exactly is a griever? And if nobody survived a night in the maze, how does anyone know what a griever is (the grievers only come out at night, remember). (This is where the spoilers kick in) Finally, there's the mean-spirited ending. The ending makes me cringe. It also makes me sad and angry. I didn't care that much for Chuck, but when he gets killed, I was just like, "No, no, no, no, please, for the life of me, do not kill Chuck!!" and they do. Hearing Thomas cry over his body makes me want to kick him in the groin; he acts like a little kid crying on Chuck. Finally, nobody even lets them mourn. They're just pulled away against their will and Chuck's body is left to die. Also, I hear that Gally (Chuck's murderer) is set to appear in the upcoming 3rd film. How can that be? He died too, and I was happy to see him go! Overall, The Maze Runner is definitely not worth the time. The movie should've either been about the grievers themselves, or it should've been about just getting through the maze, no subplots about epidemics or anything like that. Also, they take forever to actually get to going to through the maze. God, I'd rather watch paint dry than watch this awful movie again.
7.0~Better than I expected atrevino90 Sign in Permalink I thought it was just gonna be another twilight bullshit or hunger games movie, which it kind of is but in a good way, it's not as predictable as i thought it would be, but there are some ridiculous stuff in there too, put a bunch of young guys on an isolated space for 3 years or more and i'm supposed to believe nobody tried to have sex with the only girl which on top is hot as hell? and where the hell was she getting so many rocks she threw when she was on top of the isolated wooden structure? who even let her in there in the first place? anyway besides some minor points it's worth watching and it seems like it will get better on the sequel, but let's just wait and see
7.0~Faithful to its own logic, at times intriguing, ultimately disappointing jrarichards Sign in Permalink Let us begin by noting that there is good acting to be had here in this youthful cast, not least from Dylan O'Brian, whose character Thomas fetches up in an ostensibly well-provided-for and even kind of idyllic "don't rock the boat and you'll be OK" world operating in accordance with its own set of internal rules, as well as - in effect - as a prison, given the external conditioning associated with gigantic walls and the imposing and unconquerable maze that exists beyond them. We the audience get increasing insights into this strange place at more or less the same time as an initially-disorientated Thomas does, and all is well done, intriguing and quite acceptable. The film effects seeking to persuade us that a gigantic (and nocturnally-mobile) maze could be built and could be defended by revolting biomechanical spider-like creatures are also good enough to serve their purpose. Hence so far, so good, and we immediately feel shades of some kind of hybrid between "Lord of the Flies" and "Cube". And although the cast is young enough, the makers are surprisingly un-squeamish about having them killed off in various ways. Alas, problems begin to appear, for characters and sceptical viewer alike, as too many questions of the "Why?" kind begin to be asked! Interestingly (and I really mean that), the character of Gally - played by Britain's Will Poulter with an American accent - actually DOESN'T want to question too much, taking a kind of "out of the frying pan into the fire" view, whereby the existence he's got for himself seems likely to be better than, not only life in the maze, but also life in the world of before and beyond. And it is with that kind of stuff that the snags with this film really begin. We are shown how new arrivals are disorientated, not even remembering their names for a day or so, and so we could live with the idea that they don't know too much about that before and beyond. They see what they have around them, and don't question because they don't remember anything - better or worse. Right? Wrong! As the film moves on, it becomes increasingly - embarrassingly - apparent that some gaps may actually reflect failures on the part of the film-makers to care enough to cover for all those awkward questions. Good-value as ever, Thomas Brodie-Sangster plays the bright second-in-command kind of kid called Newt, and in this case a British actor remains British, but nobody thinks to ask why that should be, when everyone else (even Will Poulter) is a Yank. Then suddenly a particularly youthful kid called Chuck (again well enough played, this time by Blake Cooper) mentions his parents, so then we ask why no kid at any point previously had mentioned parents, or questioned the fact that - for some reason - they had been separated from their parents. Surely the kids would have been far less content with the society they had built had they in fact been fully aware that they once lived elsewhere, had parents, and so on? The same applies to the abrupt appearance of a one-and-only female in their society, which does not create the kind of ructions one might have expected among hundreds of young males. While they in no way lament the lack of girls earlier, at the moment one arrives, the boys are fully aware that she is a girl. While there is some truth in the idea that "one does not miss what one has never had", it seems that they DID have some awareness that females of the species exist, yet ran a society of several years' standing well enough without them. This "selective memory loss" plot device seems very selective indeed, and seems to be covering a multitude of sins here, leaving the whole effect profoundly unsatisfying in comparison with, say, the Star Trek Next Generation episode "Conundrum" - in which the crew re-establish their identities, and their relative positions in the hierarchy, having indeed suffered near-total memory loss. If "The Maze Runner" fails to match up to episode 114 of "STTNG" (made in 1992) then we begin to wonder what we are doing watching it. As if all that were not enough, there is the certain expectation on the part of the film-goer (if not necessarily the sci-fi series watcher) that, having invested a couple of hours in a film, one will finish the thing enlightened and satisfied and having had a well-rounded experience. Suffice it to say that the ending ensures that this is no way the case with "The Maze Runner", and unfairly so in my view, even allowing for "part 2", which we "only" had to wait a year for...
7.0~loooooooooov katenichols79 Sign in Permalink Okay,so yea it was MOST DEFINITELY NOT LIKE THE BOOK but that's a good thing considering how BOOOORING it was; the book was just slow it took me (a speed reader) like days just to tough out the beginning then BAM it took off and everything started to FINALLY make sense, was it worth it tho (meh that's debatable); the movie however was amazing : graphics-perfect, boring useless scenes in book- CUT OUT,yeeesh! I loved how they set it up it was PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT. (okay so they didn't add the telepathy from the book :me say TO HELL WITH THAT!!!!! JUST FYI SPOILERS AHEAD Teresa the ONLY girl in the movie (if u don't know ho she is I suggest u drink some bleach) is EVI. There's also a group b that had to face the maze just like Tomas's group a oh yea and newt he's gonna DIE :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(
5.0~Visuals before story Frank-Wofu-Boettcher Sign in Permalink TL;DR: Acting is okay; visuals are very good; plot is just plain stupid. SPOILERS: The plot of the movie is this: A deadly virus wipes out most of mankind. In an effort to produce a vaccine, teenagers who are immune to the virus are rounded up and tested upon. Now how would you develop a vaccine based on a number of immune test-subjects? Maybe study their immune-system? Nahhh; what we need to do, is to build a giant maze with spider-monsters in them, that we can dump all the immune teenagers in for a few years, so we can see, "what makes them different". BRILLIANT! As the title of the review states, visuals came before the story; somebody wanted the image of a few desperate teenagers running through a maze, being chased by grotesque monsters on the screen, so a ridiculous script about some virus or whatever was written. Conclusion: If you are just interested in the visuals (or if you are a 14-16 year old male), then go ahead and rent this movie; otherwise it would be a waste of your time and money.
7.0~'The Maze Runner' might not be your go-to young adult film, but it is definitely thrilling and highly entertaining with some decent reveals in the third act. bryank-04844 Sign in Permalink To end the summer and start the fall season, we have yet another Young Adult film adaptation from James Dashner's book series called 'The Maze- Runner'. Like the young adult movies to come out before this one such as 'The Giver', 'Divergent', and even 'The Hunger Games', it all takes place in the a futuristic society where Earth is mostly in ruins. And there is one person who might be able to set things straight and save a bunch people and bring peace. 'The Maze-Runner' is no different when it comes to these plot points. While 'The Hunger Games' is still one of the better made and looking films of this caliber, 'The Giver' and 'Divergent' fall in the "less than thrilling category" if you get what I'm saying. Fortunately, director Wes Ball has conjured up a great cast of young adults and has shot a fast-paced action thriller that keeps us entertained and at times, on the edge of our seat. But with it's fast pace, the character development of some of the supporting characters is left in the gutter. But it doesn't seem to matter, because Ball has stylishly filmed the action scenes that we forget about any of the misgivings this movie has. We open our eyes and see a teenage guy named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) who awakens in a steel cage elevator and arrives in the Glade, which is in the center of The Maze. Thomas is greeted by dozens of other boys who have came up there before him along with much needed supplies. The Glade is a big open field surrounded by woods and meadows and is enclosed by a giant concrete wall, which at night changes itself so it's a different Maze the next day. Alby (Aml Ameen) is the Glade's first prisoner and has been there the longest, which is three years, who gives Thomas a crash course on what they know, which isn't much because all of the boys seems to have some sort of amnesia where they can't remember their past other than their names. Alby and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) head up the leader faction of the Glade, while Gally (Will Poulter) leads up the security portion of it. Other factions include farming and food, and building weapons and shelter. Then there are the most respected faction amongst the boys - the runners. The runners leave each morning and run as far as they can through the Maze to map out an escape route or find out why they are there in the first place. However, they must be back before each night, because the walls change and the scary-as-hell Grievers come out, which are giant spider like creatures that are half organic and half robot (it's scarier than it sounds). Thomas is learning the tricks of the trade very quickly, which some like and some don't - mainly Gally who is trying to keep things as they are and not wanting to upset the Maze. But when the arrival of the first girl ever comes up the elevator by the name of Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), things get tense quickly. Not only is she throwing off the balance and peace of the other guys, but her strange connection to Thomas makes the others think something bad is coming for them. But soon enough, Thomas leads a band of people through the Glade in order to find a real way out and maybe they'll find out why they were put here in the first place. The movie suffers a little bit from some of the cheesy dialogue from the co-stars. It could have been better if there was a little more backstory to the characters, but some of this comes off as rushed and therefor some of the dialogue doesn't always work. What does work are the action scenes. They are top notch that will keep you on the edge of your seat. They are choreographed very well and keep the film's pace moving along. And the actors here all turn in great performances that are very believable. 'The Maze Runner' might not be your go-to young adult film, but it is definitely thrilling and highly entertaining with some decent reveals in the third act. After watching this first film, I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel.
7.0~Likable But Underdeveloped Characters; A Contrived Set-Up for a YA Dystopian Franchise alexgarcia732805 Sign in Permalink Another YA dystopian novel movie adaptation?!? I'm starting to wonder if the market will become oversaturated with these films (though I doubt it). If you're just looking for one nice movie to be entertained with, you might be disappointed with TMR because the movie ends with a cliffhanger and is the first in a quartet of books (and probably future movies). It has an interesting premise (Why are the Gladers in the Maze? Who put them there? Will they ever get out?), but to new moviegoers TMR might feel like simple franchise bait and will leave them with more questions than answers about the world of TMR. You might not get much closure. The Gladers are likable characters, but they aren't developed much and are too similar to familiar character archetypes. Thomas is an OK character, to be honest Newt and Alby are more interesting than he was. This is probably due to Thomas having no memories, and most of his scenes are ones that set up the series mythology and ones where he's in fight and chase scenes. The rest of the Gladers don't do much or are there only to advance the plot of the movie (but they're likable). You don't focus on this much though as The Maze Runner is a very fast- paced book and movie. Thomas and the "Gladers" rush from one shocking event to the next dangerous chase, all while trying to find a way out of the Maze. Even though TMR only has a $34 million dollar budget, the movie still looks visually nice. I loved to see the Grievers, the Maze, the Glade, and the Gladers brought to life from the book! I think they were cast very well: Thomas, Teresa, Alby, Minho, Gally; they all look like I imagined them. To the disappointment of some action, effects-heavy, CGI explosion fans there are no super-big set pieces in TMR, and the fighting is pretty primitive (with almost no guns or heavy hand-to- hand combat sequences). But there's still excitement with the chases from, and the fighting against the Grievers (bio- mechanical lizard/scorpion-like monsters). TBH the fight scenes could've been a bit more professional. There are a few small things changed from book to movie, but most help the movie become a smoother cinematic tale (albeit slightly cliché) and more understandable to those who don't know all the info that comes with reading the books. However, others are quite unnecessary. The movie ultimately spends too long setting up future installments than fleshing out the characters, but it still has enough things going on for you not to get too bored. It's adrenaline-fueled, suspenseful, and thrilling. I personally think the fight scenes could've been better choreographed and more exciting. Also, the characters really could've used more development. I think we should've got to known the Maze, Glade, and Gladers more because the movie is IMO too short. PS, for those of you that don't know, a sequel to TMR (called The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials) is set be released on September 18, 2015 in the United States. Also, a second prequel book has been announced by James Dashner called "The Fever Code" (possibly to be released in 2016). Score for The Maze Runner: 7.4 %%SPOILER ALERT%% Does it really make sense that, with an unlimited budget and support of the world's governments, WCKD (or WICKED in the books) decided to make a maze of death in an attempt to find a cure for The Flare? If they wanted to study the brain patterns of the Gladers, couldn't they put them under complex simulations (like in Divergent)? It'd be stupid if they hadn't invented the technology, because they have "Transvices" and "Flat Trans" (mentioned in the other books) in their world. They have those futuristic devices, but not simulation serums? Also, why do they only measure the killzone (or brains') reactions to negative things and dangerous situations? What about positive emotions/situations? Wouldn't those have to be tested too? I personally think the government and scientists would've just exterminated all the infected and they all would've hid in some bunker. So I think that the Maze Runner is a bit implausible in that regard. But whatever. %%END OF SPOILERS%% If you liked this review, please read my other ones on movies, TV shows, and videogames.

7.0~Not great (so why did I enjoy it?) bowmanblue Sign in Permalink 'The Maze Runner.' I would start by saying that it's one of those 'teen sci-fi romance' films. Ever since 'Twilight' came along – where the basic premise is that you take a supernatural (or science fiction in some cases) event then add a teenage love story and you have a highly successful (and therefore profitable) franchise. I was going to say that, as when it started it certainly felt like one. Only it had an 'all male' cast (yeah, you could add a bit of romance to that, but you'd have to be one brave screen writer). Anyway, 'The Maze Runner' is about a bunch of young lads, all of which have been captured and imprisoned in a field, surrounded by a maze. Why? We don't know, but obviously we'll find out. And, when a new guy arrives in a box (that's how 'new arrivals' get there, apparently) he decides that they should do more than just farm, eat crops and get eaten by giant cyborg spiders. Did I mention those? There are a load of giant robot spiders living in the surrounding maze who have a tendency to eat the kids if they stray too far. Okay, so it's a reasonably simple premise – kids have to find a way out and work out why they were put there to begin with. However, it's far from perfect. Its problems are simply that there are too many plot holes everywhere. Seriously... you just can't actually allow your brain to think about anything for too long. Because, if you do, you'll realise that most of it doesn't make sense. Then I realised why it felt like a 'teen romance.' A girl arrives in a box. Guess what... she falls for the main guy. But I still enjoyed it. Even though the maze (and everything in it) is heavily computer-generated, but I overlooked that. I guess my brain was obviously tired and I wasn't thinking about all the negative elements contained inside it. Then there's the ending. Obviously I can't go into that in too much detail without giving away things. My advice... the film is about an hour and fifty minutes long. After an hour and FORTY minutes, just turn it off – you don't need the ending. It really is the worst bit. So, if you have kids, they'll probably enjoy it. The romance element isn't too central, so I suppose it must be for younger boys than girls. Plus people like me who can allow themselves to dumb down enough to appreciate the action scenes and general atmosphere may get something out of it. As much as I know I should hate it, I just don't. And I can't really say why.
8.0~Good movie darestv Sign in Permalink All round decent movie with some interesting concepts. Acting/plot is weak at times but forgivable.
10.0~Action Packed dakotaluebbertdl Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner and the Scorch Trails were both Jammed packed with action and adventure. I highly recommend The Maze Runner to everyone looking for a action Movie. The Death Cure the third movie comes out January, 26th, 2018. This movie is going to be over the top, can't wait to watch it.
2.0~A miserable marketing mess. invisibleunicornninja Sign in Permalink This thing is just a few hours of filler designed to get you to watch the next movie. This is not worth watching, discussing, or paying money for. The acting and "plot" and visuals are all bad. I don't understand why this is popular. Well, I do. The books were popular and kids are stupid.
8.0~Good but could be better. oceanblueangel Sign in Permalink I like the plot and the characters. Yeah, they should've made the plot easy to understand but this is way better than The Hunger Games and Divergent. Have you seen Divergent, that is probably the worse movie in history.😂
9.0~Great Cinematography, Score, and Characters andrew-phan97 Sign in Permalink This film was great when I saw it the first and the second, and the third time around. There were some faulty aspects to the story such as how Gally knew the way out. Also, Theresa's impact within the story wasn't as great as the books. However, the film did live up to much of it's hype. The cinematography was amazing and had an effect and wrapped you into the film. That's how you know a cinematographer has done it's job. Enrique Chediak did a great job with how Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) came out of the Box and introduced the world within the first 5 minutes of just mainly visuals. Furthermore, the Maze shots were amazing. The shot as Thomas runs into the Maze without any approval to help Minho and Alby was amazing rehearsed. There are more shots, but I am limited by the word count. For the score, it really created a lot of tension to the film and hit different spots. The scene where Thomas and the Gladers take on the Grievers has a great impact, such as where Chuck gets shot. The characters were greatly written and each one had an amazing character arc such as Thomas, Newt, Minho, and Gally. I felt these were the strongest while some characters such as Chuck and Theresa was underdeveloped. Over and all, great film. It will be remembered for years to come in cinema, hopefully. I can't wait for the sequel.
8.0~It wasn't that bad serialteg Sign in Permalink So I've read a lot of people dissing the movie, and I don't find it that bad. Maybe the book was better. Boy, doesn't that happen enough? The cinematography is good, the effects are good, the clichés are there. But if I leave it at that, you'd think "why did this guy give it 8/10"? Well, because I was entertained, I was left wondering, it could've been better like 99.9% of all movies ever made, but it also could've been a LOT WORSE. I studied - majored - in Cinematography, and I can appreciate the hard work that goes into a movie. Even if it's a bad movie. I stand and leave theaters when it goes bad, and I wouldn't have done it here. See the movie, draw your own conclusions (about the ladder: do you think the grievers wouldn't climb up?), and it looks like a book reading is in order.
8.0~Kept me on the edge of my seat but still very flawed. egeorge585 Sign in Permalink I haven't been on the edge of my seat while watching a movie in quite a while and watching The Maze Runner definitely reeled me into the experience. Throughout the entire movie I was on the edge of my seat just thinking WTF. The entire movie is shrouded in mystery and unfortunately even after the movie is over and get somewhat of an explanation you will still be wondering what the heck is going on, but they set the movie up that way on purpose to uphold the mystery for the future movies... but I am hoping for some major explanations. I wouldn't consider this movie one of those mindless action packed movies that Hollywood just loves to pump out. Although the movie didn't explain too much, there is so much to be revealed in the future and that gets me pumped. It's gonna make me come back for more. The dialogue is very cheesy at times but luckily everything else in the movie makes up for it. During the movie I was so wrapped up in trying to figure out what was going on I didn't think of any plot holes or flaws but they were there. Like how could you damage half metal beasts with a wooden pike? With vines leading to the top of the maze around every corner why not just climb up them to see the maze, seems a lot more efficient than running aimlessly. What's the point of even mapping the maze if it changes every day? How do teenage boys that haven't seen a woman in three years not try to lust after her (although I like that the movie wasn't sexualized at all this did seem very out of place)? Although I would have enjoyed at least some sexual tension between the guys ;) I guess if I read the book it'd hopefully answer some of these logical fallacies. But at the end of the day when I was watching this movie I was captivated and that is exactly what a movie is supposed to do. I am looking forward to the sequels but I'm seeking a lot of explanations in the future and hopefully the creators try using logic a bit more.
6.0~Oh look! Another dystopian teen film has been created InsideABanSheesMind Sign in Permalink I'm going to begin this review with a personal rant. Sorry in advance It would seem Hollywood has completely run out of ideas, nothing original is getting through anymore, just the same thing over and over again personally I find it a little ridiculous. With all the new ideas out there, new screen writers surely they can come up with something different to what is being released currently Once again another dystopian society, living off what the planet can sustain, in a place where new laws have been created and everyone pitches in to do their bit. Sound familiar at all??? A young man who early on has no name wakes up in an old rusty elevator, once it stops he finds himself surrounded by a group of boys all about his age of 16 or younger, he soon discovers that he has been trapped in a place the boys have called "the Glades". In his new society the nameless teen learns that the leader of the group keeps things running by having placed rules amongst the group. Rules though are meant to be broken, having a curious mind the young teen wants to know all he can especially about what surrounds the Glades. Surrounding the Glades are four very big cement walls and during the daylight hours one of the walls opens and leads to very large maze. Everyday a few of the boys who have been given the job of title of "runners" take to the maze and try to find the exit. At night the doors close and whoever is left still inside the maze is never heard from again due to the "Grievers" creatures of the night whose only instinct is to poison the young group which in turns them full of angst and eventually death. This has been going on for 3 years now and the society that the boys have set up works well that is until the elevator arrives again with a new arrival this time a girl and note stating she is the last.. The Maze Runner has a little glint of freshness about it but not enough to make it something new and wonderful; it is exactly what you think it will be a cross between Lord of the Flies and every other dystopian film that has been released in the past 3 years hence my little rant earlier. Now I'm not saying that's a bad thing because The Maze Runner does have its finer points. The actors were all very good in their roles, some more than others, but good enough none the less. The world created was quite visually appealing, sure apart from the green grass of the Glades all there was, was cement as high as the eye could see but for what it was it worked. There were a few very nice twists towards the end and I can guarantee if you're anything like me you will be trying to work out what the big secret is from the very beginning. I'd still say don't waste your time at the cinemas with this one wait for the DVD to be released and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home. May not be for the kiddies this one either.
8.0~Awesome digdog-785-717538 Sign in Permalink what can i say. i LOVED this film. yeah sure, it has a *few* weak points and maybe a plot hole or two. And the acting is barebones, these are kids, not Cyrano De Bergerac or Mephistofele, but boy the film is well done. I mistakenly googled the film's name before it was over, and disappointed myself to learn that it's just the first of three parts, so it means waiting another 2-3 years for the other two films, but that means also that i have something to look forward to. Now, i normally like more "profound" films, but for once, i really enjoyed this sci-fi romp and no, it's nothing like Twilight. A couple of the characters (Gally, Chuck) are phoned in, but then again, how would you write this kind of plot without these characters getting thrown in? So the film is a very pleasant, well paced, well directed, reasonably well acted, decently scored, great .. well, nice CGI, entertaining film that will please just about every audience there is, without being horribly commercial, soppy and cliché. I haven't had this much fun in a long while - although i gotta say Edge OF Tomorrow was just as good. My final vote - a very solid 8/10, and I'm wishing for parts 2 and 3 ASAP.
9.0~Maze Runner Review melodysriinai Sign in Permalink If you are a fan of action, mystery and sci-fi movies. Maze runner should be in your list. This movie is about a bunch of friends trapped in a maze and are trying to escape, the plot wasn't so predictable because it didn't give out any spoilers. One of my favorite scenes was when chuck got shot and Thomas was crying his eyes out for him to stay alive. The message in this story are about teamwork, friendship, bravery and courage. Their acting made the movie very convincing, the best dialogue was when Thomas decided to get out of the Maze with his friends to find out why they were there in the first place. The movie also has some bad points, there wasn't any love story between Thomas and Teresa, a lot of people died for the same reasons, and they all died because of the flares and grievers. The movie had special effects such as the grievers, the maze were the filmed it and also the props used. This movie is scary yet interesting. I would watch it over and over again. I'll give a thumbs up for this.
3.0~Maze Runner...not tags_skeewee Sign in Permalink I rented this from Red Box last night. Me and hubby started watching it. I fell asleep after 15 minutes. I woke up the next morning, thought maybe after a full nights rested sleep, maybe I fell asleep last night because I was tired,not because it was boring. So, I popped the DVD in and quickly surmised I fell asleep because it was boring. And stupid. It is evident that each year the average intelligence and common sense of today's youth is sadly declining. First off, the setting: we are expected to believe that a group of teenage adolescent hormones a blazing boys are communal, getting along...GET REAL! This may be more believable if this was a group of girls. The boys are supposed to have been in this maze/glade for 3 years, but their clothes look slightly used, there aren't any showers around but they look clean. The characters: who are these kids, where did they come from, why are they there, are the kids cloned, so many questions that are not answered. plot: made no sense what so ever. A forest in the middle of the desert?! Teens stuck in a maze and instead of trying to get out they farm?! Like another reviewer said, this should be called 'the field talker' not much time is spent in the actual maze. Ah, they finally get into the maze, I guess they ran out of money for set building. This has to the most boring maze ever. Spiders and falling rocks,that's all. There was no character development, you don't care about anyone. What is the point of the spiders? What is the point of the maze? So many questions left unanswered does not make me want to wait for the next movie. Think I will pass.
2.0~Please Stop. vincentryan29 Sign in Permalink I started off watching it thinking it was going to be like The Cube crossed with Hunger Games. Not bad I thought, not original but certainly entertaining. The acting wasn't bad, nothing that will have the academy deciding on golden phallus's next year but nothing that broke me from the submersion of the movie either. I guess that's as much as I could ask for in this sort of movie. The writing had it's faults but the overall premise I thought covered up many of the downfalls there. The antagonist needed development instead of irrationally deciding to screw with the protagonist on a constant basis. Hell, just make Ben his best friend or lover and it's done, he has all the irrationality needed now to pull any stupid crap he likes. Now where it fell down and crashed so horribly was the ending. I understand it's a series of novels and knew that the plan was not to end the movie here, but how many movies do we need that give us a small resolution and major questions left unresolved? I feel that's a massive "screw you" to the audience. Hello and welcome to our franchise, would you like to buy your tickets now for the actual story which will come in future releases. I am sick of seeing this, has Hollywood fallen so far, being governed by the next major cash cow, that all they see now are how to sell the next project within the current project? This formula needs stamping out and the only way people will see the quality of these projects increased is to put their wallet away when the next "installment" comes out. However, like sheep, people will keep on flocking to the cinemas, putting up with mediocre quality entertainment and convince themselves they have just seen a masterpiece. Honestly, how many people rated this as 10/10? There are maybe a half dozen movies that deserve that and I'd be pressed to find one of them released this millennium.
3.0~Don't read the book beforehand if you want to enjoy this movie... BabyPunkRock Sign in Permalink First off, I want to point out that I'm an avid reader. So whenever I see an interesting movie trailer that's based on a book, or hear that a book I've been eyeing is being made into a movie, I ALWAYS read the book at some point. 9 times out of 10, I read the book first because I like to have some idea of what I'm getting myself into. When I saw the movie trailer earlier this year, I thought it looked incredible, so I made a point that I would read it when it got closer to the release date. I literally finished reading the book 1 hour before my movie started, so it was VERY fresh in my mind. But even within the first 30 minutes of the movie, I was in awe at how much was changed. Like I said earlier, I've read a lot of books and seen the movies afterwards, so I know that there's always that risk of the director changing things here and there to make the movie flow better. But with the Maze Runner, I literally felt like I was watching something completely different from what I read. It felt like a parody of the book because it was so off base. By the end of the movie, I was literally SHAKING with anger. As an overview, the 2 biggest issues were that 1. There simply wasn't enough time to fit everything into the movie (happens a lot, so I don't feel it's a valid excuse), and 2. I think they wanted to market this as an "action" film when it wasn't meant for that genre. In my opinion, this really is the ROOT of the problem, and what forced a domino effect of changes from the original story. Side note: I'm literally holding my copy from the library, and it's labeled as "science fiction", so there you go A major thing that pained me about the movie was that it was so hard to follow the story and to properly empathize with the protagonist Thomas. There were several moments in the book between Thomas and Chuck that solidified their relationship as wanna-be brothers. The movie has 1 momentcould it have killed them to just add 1 MORE MOMENT? As I saw someone mention before, there was also a very pointless play-fight scene between Thomas and Gally that could have DEFINITELY been cut to make time for another important scene, like I described with Chuck. The lack of Thomas-Chuck screen time made me almost cringe at the scene when Thomas was grieving over Chuck's sacrifice for him. It just didn't feel as genuine as it could have, and I feel like Dylan O'Brien was kind of robbed of having a better emotional pay-off than what he had Another big no-no: it's called THE MAZE RUNNER. They made maps of the MAZE every single day for 2 (or, as the movie would have it, 3) years, but they were COMPLETELY OMITTED. They created such a fun system with utilizing the maps to spell out code words that would in turn help them escape the Glade via the "Griever hole". But that was completely ignored in favor of what, some metal part of a Griever brain that acts as a strange GPS device that leads them to their exit? An exit which was also changed, to a much-less-interesting version of the Griever hole found over the Cliff. It was exciting to read about them discovering that there was a way out amidst an abyss. There was no challenge with the exit they found in the movie I could go on and on and on about things that we changed and shouldn't have been, but I don't think I have enough characters to express my disappointment on all those topics. So with that, I gave this movie a 3/10, and have 3 good things to say about it 1) The girl was super hot 2) Chuck's character was by far the most accurate to the book, despite being given very little screen time to display his personality 3) I give them props for some of the Maze scenes when the characters were cutting it close; I'm pretty claustrophobic, so every time someone looked like they were about to get crushed, I was highly distressed. Not too bad for an action movie that shouldn't have been
6.0~How many times can you say 'Thomas' in one movie. leitejohannes Sign in Permalink Typical unoriginal Hollywood action/sci-fi//adventure movie. Gave me the exact same impression as The Hunger Games/Divergent "ish" movies. For me I would say it is very light entertainment, with nothing more to it than that. Also, the movie seems like a competition about how many times they can say the name 'Thomas' in 2 hours. If you're looking for semi-action/light entertainment without any brain food, you should take a look at this movie. If you're searching for an original and profound flick, then this is isn't for you. I'll rate it 6 out of 10. Few plot holes, but all in all, decent entertainment.
1.0~Great expectations - Big disappointment danilo-verginis Sign in Permalink Franchise movie, part one of a hundred until last cent in the pocket. This movie is pointless, bad story, without end, funny weapons, bad script,... The movie for public under 10 year old. Jesus, all is wrong in this movie: the maze is under the same Sun but like in the other Universe, all guys are clean and haircut, story is stupid and pointless, there is no end at the end. This story could last at least next five to ten years. My main motive for watching this movie was young, beautiful and talented Kaya Scodelario. I expect her as the main girl role but - she got only few sentences in the role and lot of running cadres. I really don't know why super talented actors like her wasted their time, talent and energy in bad and forward lost projects like this. Plese Kaya, next time just read storyline and please say NO to movie like this. What is better: to have 10-50 magnificent, brilliant roles in your life or 1000 pointless and worthless roles in movie disaster like this one. :( I always wonder who choose that: actor or his/her manager. For me - this movie only one (1) star deserves. Please avoid this movie in a long circle. :)
6.0~The poor man's Hunger Games; moderately entertaining vithiet Sign in Permalink The poor man's Hunger Games. Moderately entertaining nonetheless
6.0~Holds your attention TheMarwood Sign in Permalink Another entry in the dystopian young adult machine that pumps these out in hopes of striking gold with a franchise - The Maze Runner is derivative stuff, but it's serviceable entertainment that is successful in its storytelling more often than not. In the process of trying to build a franchise, most of these types of films feel narratively incomplete, as they try to arc a thin story over a series of films - but The Maze Runner feels like it can stand on its own, even if the end is completely botched. The cast is decent enough and it's refreshing to see grime and dirt on actors in an appropriate setting, instead of perfect hair and makeup. The film wastes no time, as the first scene drops our lead character Thomas into this small community of youngsters, which is surrounded by a giant, deadly maze. The maze is an interesting visual effect and the inside is a good combination of sets and vfx. The maze is far more interesting than most of dialogue that takes place outside of it. The first 45 minutes or so are interesting as we try to figure out the why's and what's, but the young adult subgenre insistence of giving silly names to everything can come across hokey. "We call them Grievers" "We call this The Glade." Even with the worst incidences of of expository dialogue, the cast is skilled enough for the film to keep its dignity. The last few minutes of the film fall apart, as an inevitable sequel is set up and whether this ending is true to its source material or not, it simply doesn't work on screen. It's an eye rolling ending for sure, but it doesn't sour everything that came before it.
7.0~A Fan of the Maze Runner series cw-64413 Sign in Permalink First, I was very excited when this movie was announced. I have followed the books, and read them all at least twice, so I had high expectations, but also high hopes for this movie. After watching the trailers also, I was feeling a little less excited, but I was still hopeful. Finally, the day of the movie came, and I went in. Coming out of the movie, I began looking back at all the stuff that was wrong. Not only did some stuff look different, but something felt off. The actors sometimes felt as if they weren't acting, but just reading lines. The grievers were very different than the book, and so was the big slaughter with the grievers. I am not terribly disappointed in the movie, but I was sad that the movie didn't follow as closely as the book as I was hoping. Plus, the new movie coming out soon makes me question what the directors were thinking and doing.
6.0~Fairly unoriginal, but it's still a pretty decent watch jimbo-53-186511 Sign in Permalink With this film essentially being sort of cross between Cube and The Truman Show it was never going to win any prizes for being original. However, despite this The Maze Runner still manages to be reasonably enjoyable. The start of the film is shrouded in mystery; who are all these people? Why are they there? How are they going to escape? It's a very easy spectacle to get swept along with and a lot of this is down to the likability of the majority of the characters and the fact that the majority of them are forced to work as a team to solve problems. The film begins slowly and is what I'd like to call a 'slow burner', but it never felt padded out or unnecessarily long and essentially just starts off by developing a few of the key characters. There are many exciting set-pieces (the first one in the Maze with the griever was great fun to watch). The performances from the principal cast vary, but O'Brien was the stand-out performer with Poulter also being very good as well (it may just be me, but I thought he had a bit of a look of River Phoenix here). As much as I found this generally fun to watch and relatively exciting there were some issues with the film.... Most of the problems I had with this film related to the concept of the maze and its opening times; OK, we learn that it opens at certain times of the day and is open for a certain amount of time, but when watching the film we see runners going in and out of the maze and timing their exits from the Maze to perfection. This made me think that at some point someone must have had to have worked out how long The Maze opened and closed for, but unless you sat there staring at the opening with a stopwatch there's no way you could accurately know how long the walls opened for? I didn't see any evidence of anyone having watches or mobile phones in order to time the opening of the gates so I doubt anyone had a stopwatch. This, to me, was quite a serious flaw, but thankfully it didn't affect my overall enjoyment of the film so much. Despite the aforementioned issue the mystery, intrigue, excitement and sense of fun that the film offers does help to cover up some of the weaknesses in the writing. It's certainly no masterpiece and it's not terribly original, but if you're looking for a reasonably exciting and intriguing film then you could do a lot worse than The Maze Runner.
10.0~MAZE RUNNER - RUN OR DIE by: Wes Ball larypitta Sign in Permalink I always liked movies about science fiction and when was premiered I was very curious about the essential point of the history . The movie was based on the 2009 book, of the same name by James Dashner. The filming was in Baton Rouge, Loisiana. The filming started 13 of May, 2013 and officially finished in 12 of July, 2013. And all the emotion, makes the viewers feeling inside the history. In some scenes, this movie almost allows us to see inside the minds of those figures, as well as the minds of personages. Other thing that, particularly, I liked about the movie is the director clearly explain what is happening. And the thing that have viewers thought-provoking on the movie, is how the personages will get out the labyrinth . The movie personages have many boys and only one girl, but I think for this reason is better. I would like recommends this movie to anyone likes of fiction science, as I, and that likes have fun, because is a great movie.
7.0~First instalment in a solid dystopian science-fiction trilogy with a cast of youths kluseba Sign in Permalink Based upon the novel by James Dashner, The Maze Runner is the first instalment in a dystopian trilogy that follows a group of youths as they fight for survival and against manipulation in a desolate world destroyed by heat and disease. This first movie follows a very young man who awakes in an elevator that transports him to a group of male youths that is living in a restricted natural environment surrounded by a gigantic maze. This society calls itself the Gladers. The young man doesn't remember his past and only recalls his name after a few hours of confusion: Thomas. He soon realizes that the other boys and men share his fate. They have established some basic rules to live together in peace and harmony as everybody has specific tasks to do. The most important group of people are the athletic runners who go inside the maze when it opens up in the morning and return late at night before the gates close again. The runners are trying to solve the maze to find a way out. However, there are mechanical creatures called grievers who live in the maze which can attack, kill or sting their human victims in a way that makes them go berserk. Thomas is a curious individual who doesn't like following rules and his appearance soon devides the group of youths. Some people support him as they believe he can help them solve the maze while others have gotten used to their lives in a restricted environment and consider him a nuisance. Things take a more dramatic turn when a last human being is sent up the elevator: a girl named Teresa who seems to know Thomas from the past. There are several elements that make The Maze Runner stand out positively. The idea to live the story through the eyes of the charismatic Thomas who gradually tries to find out what is going on around him makes the film captivating, mysterious and suspenseful. The fact that the film takes place in a restricted environment soon leads to quite intense relationships which help the story move forwarde. Most viewers will identify with one character or another. If compared to similar dystopian films, this movie doesn't seem to overuse special effects which gives it a more authentic atmosphere. The final half hour is quite tense and violent and leads to a bittersweet finale. On one side, one finally gets some important background information that explains most of that happened in the first ninety minutes but on the other side, the new answers lead to even more questions as the movie ends on a cliffhanger which almost makes it mandatory to watch the second instalment as well. If you're not planning on watching a trilogy, don't watch this movie in the first place. The story also has a couple of flaws. The background story seems surprisingly basic and is lacking many details. Some events in the story are illogical or simply left unexplained such as the Glader who got stung outside the maze which is never fully explained. The story obviously also has some similarities to other dystopian movies, especially concerning the bleak future of our planet and the basic main protagonists and antagonists. The movie's middle section is somewhat plodding and the movie could have been shortened by about ten minutes without leaving out anything essential. In the end, you will like this film if you're a fan of other dystopian science-fiction movies with a set of young characters like The Hunger Games or The Divergent Series. The unique setting and the mysterious plot certainly make this movie stand out. If you are looking for a creative and unique experience, you might find the movie somewhat boring and predictable.
7.0~Would have enjoyed more if I hadn't read the book danburyark Sign in Permalink First off, I loved reading the entire book series and although, I know films are never as good as book; I was expecting this to be excellent. The acting is terrible, except for the portrayals of Alby, Newt and Gally (Aml Ameen, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Will Poulter respectively). Thomas, who is meant to be at least slightly likable is not; he comes off as stupid, condescending and arrogant through an awful performance from Dylan O'Brien. Kaya Scodelario also portrays Teresa quite badly; however Teresa plays barely a part in the film; so I didn't have much to judge her on. The acting is not at all aided by the script; which is badly written and either too blunt or over-complicated. Alby's characterization is well-off target; in the book he is tough-as-nails and very unwelcoming. Whereas in the film; he is very friendly towards Thomas and doesn't come off as a leader. Gally also changes moods too quickly, as he first is horrible to Thomas and then alright and then hates him; while in the book he hates Thomas throughout. Gally is also portrayed too sympathetically; in the book I'm rooting against Gally, but in the film I feel sorry for him and am rooting for him because he honestly makes more sense and seems more likable than Thomas. Chuck is meant to be the sympathetic character and when he dies; it's meant to be like when Rue dies in the Hunger Games; but Chuck doesn't have a large enough part in the film to make that much of an impact. The film is too cramped that it has to skip parts out and rushes other parts so much that half the film doesn't even make sense. The film is marginally exciting with action-packed fights and well-used and not over-done CGI.
6.0~Another teenage thriller wrapped up in a scifi/fantasy package. fahimakhter Sign in Permalink Distopian future, good looking people with a likable persona, a love interest, the world to save, losing newly made friends along the way, twists and turns only to find out the reality isn't what it seemed. BOOM! Welcome to the Summer block buster of this season and every season for the last decade served with a side of explosions and a cake with not enough layers on it. In a society governed by people whose objective seems logical on a broader scale yet not ethical. But often there is something more selfish behind the what appears to be logical solutions where humans are treated as guinea pigs and the hero questions if the one live sacrificed (usually his love interest) is worth all that and usually ends up saving the girl friend and the world welcome to every dystopia film focused on an teenage audience who wants more something more than the traditional romance or the action flick. Something and I quote 'deeper' , hello call me a sci-fi nerd if you like because I saw all of the 100 million dollar budget sci-fi's with the pretty girl next door persona girls would you guess where oh yes the iMax. It reminds me of a scene from Black Books Bernard: You're going on holiday. You want trash. But you want different kinds of trash. (To female customer) You're a woman, you want social themes, believable characters. (To male customer) You, you want plots, suspense. This'll do you both. Female customer: Hmm... Bernard: (holds up another copy of the book) There's this temp, right? She's 29, she can't get a boyfriend, oh my god. Female customer: Sounds great! Male customer: No, no way. Bernard: And she's got 12 hours to stop nuclear war with China. Male customer: Great. This film is all that is written above and some things more. What I do like about the film is that it has less of a romance that you would expect from others of the same genre which makes it a bit better. Everything else is pretty much the same the chosen one who goes against the rules, breaks them and succeeds. Isn't popular with the older leaders but everyone loves them, because well he is giving them more than the typical good life that they were used to before. Now its exciting there is hope, drama and dead bodies. This group of young adults is stuck in a maze. Where they are there is food, shelter and all you need to survive but they are stuck in a maze run by they don't know who. Are they alien? Are they scientists? Does the world exist as they knew it who knows. Anyways so the maze opens its doors everyday and closes them at night if you don't make it by the night, you're dead what kills you is a mystery. There are different classes, the runners are the Alpha who run the maze memorize it and perhaps find a way out one day. In comes our rebel hero, sacrificing, charming, fast and all. The rest is no mystery. There are some twists and turns and yes they do leave that Chuky is still alive moment at the end. Since its not in cinemas anymore , you can watch it with some folks over if you want to test out the new big speaker that you just acquired.
10.0~Dylan did a great job! blaine036 Sign in Permalink I think the movie is really great, and I read the book before the movie, although the book is better than the movie, but I wasn't disappointed at all. Dylan did a great job, and of course all of the cast did a great job. But Dylan was magnificent! I can't think of anyone else to play Thomas but Dylan. I had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the movie, and I just couldn't. I was so hypnotized, really. An awesome movie. Loved it. Can't wait for the next one. And it's nothing like The Hunger Game, or Divergent. It's much much better !!! The Maze Runner is not only movie for boys. I'm a girl and I love this stuff.
8.0~Awesome and intense just_for_movies Sign in Permalink This movie was awesome, definitely better than I thought it would be. The maze scenes were definitely my favorite, I loved how the maze was designed and all the intense scenes that happened there. The actors did a great job portraying their roles and Wes Ball did a great job making this movie the best it could be. The story was gripping and there were definitely some suspenseful scenes but they were executed very well. I was a little worried how they were going to do the ending because it's very emotional but it was really well done. The cinematography was very cool as it provided the viewer a real experience of the maze. I said this before but I was really interested how they were going to present the maze itself and after I saw the movie I think that was one of my favorite parts because it was just so cool and forbidding with it's ivy covered walls and gritty texture. Lastly, I have read the first book and was quite excited for the movie. The movie certainly didn't disappoint and stayed true to the book for the most part. I would definitely recommend this movie even for those that haven't read the book.
1.0~Only suitable for under 10 year olds sourmanflint Sign in Permalink Complete and utter garbage from the Hollywood teen angst factory. I wouldn't recommend anyone over the age of 10 to watch this movie as you need to be naive enough to believe what passes for a plot. It was a struggle to see it through to the end, I did hoping it would start to make sense at some point but it never did. There are so many plot holes as to make you wonder if anyone had actually read the script before they turned up on set to film it? Technically the CGI looked good and the camera work moved the thin storyline along and that helped me to stay awake, but why oh why must Hollywood always have actors that look like they just came from an audition for one direction or some such? Surely even in a dystopian future there must be someone with even an ounce of character? A lot of money really doesn't equate to a lot of quality these days.
1.0~I am glad I saw it for free championbc-99-5005 Sign in Permalink Redbox gave me a free movie code, so I picked this one up. I got just what I paid for. I am so glad I didn't pay theater prices for this lame excuse for a movie. This is one of the stupidest things I have ever had to endure. Try to imagine "Matrix," "Hunger Games," and a little bit of "Lord of the Flies" all wrapped together, using the worst of all those movies. Now, throw it all together, and pretend that it has some real meaning, and that, in the course of the movie, we will figure it out. Then, introduce clues to the puzzle, and make sure none of them add up. Make deaths as sensitive and illogical as you can, and be sure that any real message about hope, endurance, integrity, friendship, or courage does NOT come through. Try your best to discourage any viewer who has come to this movie with any expectation whatsoever. Be sure to kill as many people as you can, and after some of them have used effort and sacrifice to pass through an impassible maze, be sure to, at the end, let the biggest coward suddenly show up, somehow, with them, and kill someone else before he himself is killed. Then, have some old battleaxe in a lab coat pretend to say something that is supposed to have meaning, and leave it cryptically hanging there as the closing credits roll. I think it was supposed to be "bait" to suck me in to an interminable parade of sequels. Yeah, right. I've already seen one too many in this pathetic series.
7.0~Was not what I expected from the trailer. docb969 Sign in Permalink For never reading the book, or books on Maze Runner, I was impressed with the story line. I can't wait for the 2nd phase to come out. Ya I know the big spiders, were a joke, and looked as if a 4th grader thought them up. They may have even been an after thought. Who knows or cares. I will not know till I read the book, or books. They could have used better graphics on the spiders, in my opinion. But it did make you think. Whats next? If I were in the situation, how would I react? It did however keep my attention. I will however be expecting the writers to be going a little more in depth on how things came about. The ending on this one was a little vague, but left the door open for a better sequel on the 2nd Stage. I did enjoy the movie, It had lots of action, as always a pretty girl, drama, and is a good family movie. Not sure if you readers will agree, But I give it a 1 1/2 thumbs up.
7.0~A riveting introduction to this new YA series GazDutlow Sign in Permalink http://whatdidgazthinkof.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/the-maze-runner.html Bringing words on a page to life is a hard task, and debut director Wes Ball has succeeded for the most part with James Dashner's 'The Maze Runner'. While it doesn't achieve the heights of 'The Hunger Games', the film is a riveting introduction to this new YA series. The film opens inside a freight elevator, as it delivers Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) to the Glade. The beautiful meadow is home to a community of boys, who are looking for a way out of the mysterious maze that surrounds and has trapped them for three years. Thomas has no memory of who he is, where he came from, and what his purpose is - it had been the same for every person that came before him. There are runners, who go out each morning to try and find a way out. But there lies the catch. Every night, the towering walls of the maze close in around the Glade to prevent terrifying 'Grievers' from entering and attacking the Gladers. The mechanics of the maze shift and rearrange the walls, preparing a new maze for the runners to solve the next morning. But, since Thomas' arrival, things are beginning to change. The fabric of their society begins to tear, and circumstances finally force the Gladers to find a way out once and for all. These Grievers - part mechanical, part animal - are genuinely threatening and inject pure tension into their scenes. They are a treat for fans of the book; it's everything you imagined, and the film will have you on the edge of your seat. Wes Ball treats us to beautiful scenes and gripping action, but never at the cost of the characters. The ensemble cast is refreshingly multicultural and do their best to hook us for the rest of the series. Dylan O'Brien has proved himself as a capable lead, after supporting roles in popular series 'Teen Wolf' and 'The Internship'. I won't reveal the reasons for the Maze's existence and boys entrapment; the film merely gives a taste of what is to come. The film (ironically) races to tell its story within the 113 minute run-time, especially in the final act. Any unanswered questions will have to wait for a sequel - which is already in pre-production.
6.0~A version of TV's SURVIVOR show . . . tadpole-596-918256 Sign in Permalink . . . in which the contestants are slightly younger and do a better job of keeping their clothes on, MAZE RUNNER would NOT last long on the "boob tube." MAZE RUNNER's tribal councils are too short, and the lack of an immunity idol takes away most of the suspense. Biomachines probably were "old hat" by the time the original ALIEN flick was released, and the HARRY POTTER franchise exhausted any possibilities for giant spiders left open by THE LORD OF THE RINGS series. HUNGER GAMES, DIVERGENT, and THE GIVER all have carefully-crafted "back stories" that make honest attempts to establish a Screen Reality. MAZE RUNNER would be less unfair to consumers if its ads were required to have "black box" disclaimers stating, "Do NOT expect to enjoy this movie if you have not read the book first!!" Throwing in some last-minute Dystopian gibberish from a previously unseen elderly White actress who seems destined to be revealed as a VISITORS-style Lizard Lady in Part Four of the MAZE "trilogy" would only confuse anyone with an attention span not up to reading long book series BEFORE coming to the multiplex (assuming they were still paying any attention to the final half hour of this misfire).
10.0~Very Interesting ashraf2103 Sign in Permalink I have just watched the movie premier, honestly I was not very enthusiastic as the movie does not have any of those golden name stars, but my daughter was pushing us to watch it because she read the books, for the entire movie we were silent fully attracted to the movie, my daughter told me that the movie has overlooked a lot of details mentioned in the book, but I don't see these details have affected the story, on our way back I was trying to convince her to tell me the summary of the other 2 books, but she refused, so now I have to read the other 2 books, I don't believe I would wait until next year to release the second part.
9.0~forced me to consider the difference between 'what is, and what it seems' kikitownley96 Sign in Permalink MAZE RUNNER - This was phenomenal in regards to acting, directing, SFX, semiotic codes and the offering of a deeper insight to the humans purpose. I couldn't stop thinking about it so I went home and read all three books in 8 days! Was slightly disappointed that Thomas and Theresa couldn't telepathically communicate; as this was one of my favorite elements! Also, I imagined Gally very different, as described in the book, however Will Poulter stunned me with his aggression, as opposed to his clumsy innocence in 'we're the millers'. I watched maze runner again about 3 times after reading the novels and it allowed me the access to the thinking process of Thomas, Mihno or Newt before an action. However, this doesn't mean that without reading the book, I wouldn't of been as capable to escape into the film, because I fell in love with it before I even knew what had hit me. Also, excellent and portraying the grievers! spot on ! Cannot wait to see what you do with the cranks and scorch trials! Other than the minor changes,it was everything a girl could ask for - Dylan O'Brian, wow, marry me please.
7.0~good start for yet another YA franchise SnoopyStyle Sign in Permalink Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is unconscious in an elevator as it opens up onto a field. He has amnesia and surrounded by other kids. He remembers his name later but nothing else. A new boy arrives every 30 days with supplies. It's been 3 years since the first one. The forested field is surrounded by a giant maze. They sent out Runners to map out the maze and set up rules to only allow Runners into the maze. There are deadly Grievers in the maze during the night when the doors are closed. Thomas keeps disobeying the rules and run into the maze. He kills one of the Grievers and makes some discoveries. Then the only girl Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives on the elevator with a note "Shes the last one EVER". This is better than many of the new YA movies. Why? The first thing I noticed is that the movie doesn't open with a lot of explaining the dystopian world. I like it. The characters are just as clueless as the audience. We are essentially discovering the world together and I usually hate the homework these movies impose on us every time. The acting is pretty good led by Dylan O'Brien. The kids' society is a little bit of Lord of the Flies. I like most of the kids. The maze is good although I couldn't really figure out this place. It felt like there are some miscalculations about this dystopia. Something isn't adding up. When the final message happened, that didn't make sense either. And then there is the reveal which simply put a big question mark on everything. I haven't read the books. I'm willing to wait for the sequel to pass judgment on whether this all adds up. So it's a 7 for now, but if the sequel doesn't make better sense of this world, the rating may have to go down.
9.0~Goosebumps worthy. JFPouncey Sign in Permalink I loved everything about this film. If you plan on watching this, and you are a reader, then please, PLEASE, read the book FIRST! It's a lot better! I've watched this movie four times already, I love it. It's fast paced, thrilling, and some scenes are goosebumps worthy. The only bad thing I can say about this movie are the plot holes in some areas of the film. Which Isn't all that bad, lots of movies have them, wouldn't want to watch a 5 hour movie right? Like I said in the beginning, read the book first. It will leave you with a much clearer picture of what exactly is going on.
4.0~Everything this YA novel adaptation was trying to do to stand out was ripped apart by the revelatory ending estebangonzalez10 Sign in Permalink "You are not like the others, you are curious, but if you stay here you have to follow the rules." Wes Ball's The Maze Runner didn't stand out from all the other YA novel adaptations we've been bombarded with lately. Perhaps I went into it with high expectations considering it had a 63% rating according to critics on Rottentomatoes. I thought it was pretty high considering that this genre is getting tiresome, so I expected it would be a breathe of fresh air, but I was wrong because it follows basically the same conventions as all the other YA adaptations (a teen who doesn't seem to fit into the role that society has put him in and ultimately becomes some sort of savior against a repressive system that seems to place them in a particular set of groups). These novels seem to repeat the same message: being different is good. I don't have anything against these films (I actually am a fan of the Harry Potter and The Hunger Games franchises), but I feel like beginning new franchises with pretty similar premises is a major letdown. The Maze Runner tries to introduce an interesting and different premise, but the novelty wears down quickly and it ultimately becomes clichéd. Most of the film is predictable despite trying to create new concepts, but the more you think about the plot the more holes you find. There are so many things about The Maze Runner that don't make much sense and I just felt it tries to raise a lot of questions without giving us believable answers. The ending is the weakest part of this film and what ultimately brings it down. It basically unravels and deconstructs all the interesting premises (like having all these young characters isolated from the rest of the world) it set up at the beginning. I really can't find anything appealing to the inevitable sequel, but will probably end up watching it anyway. For a film that centers on a young and unfamiliar cast the performances work well. The special teen this time around is played by Dylan O'Brien and we know his character is going to be the chosen one from the get go. YA adaptations have become such a formula that you just can't help it, you know he is going to be the savior. He still pulls off the role as the lead character delivering a solid and engaging performance. Will Poulter, who we saw in a comedic role in We're the Millers, shows his range playing the antagonist, Gally. Other memorable characters in this film were Alby (Aml Ameen), Newt (Thomas Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Chuck (Blake Cooper), and the only female character in the Maze: Teresa (Kaya Scodelario). The rest were all simply included to be disposed with like most of the films in the genre do and there is very little recollection of any of them. The main cast in the film is solid and so are the special effects. The set design of the maze itself looks really cool and of course it is very symbolic of how teens feel at times trapped in maze without knowing what direction to head to next. I know a lot of people liked the monsters in this film (the grievers), but they didn't really do anything for me. The Maze Runner tries to stand out from other YA adaptations, but it ends up being basically the same allegory of teens trapped in a restrictive system where the only way to survive is following the rules and playing your role in society. The few things I actually did enjoy about this film ended up being brought down by the unsatisfactory ending.
7.0~In the end, The Maze Runner is A Lord of the Flies type inspired dystopian movie that feels like it's could have came out during the 80's and that's not a bad thing. alexcomputerkid Sign in Permalink Every aspect of a persons life can be defined in one way or another. Something like high school days, college days or marriage years are obvious categories. But for me being the pop culture/nerd and sport fanatic that I am, my years will be most remembered by this stuff. Today, iPhones by Apple are the most popular phones and social media could not be bigger. I sadly had to watch Lebron James make it to four straight NBA finals appearances and the biggest trend in films now seems to be dystopian society themes with kids living on their own, kids facing conflict, kids fighting kids and kids killing kids. It can be a very interesting subject matter. There are many reasons why this subject matter in movies is interesting and makes money. First, all of these movies are based off books. These books have a fan base and have sequels attached to them. If the movie has a nice box office run, the studios are surely going to want to do some sequels. Second, the source material has already been put together before the movie is made so the filmmakers do not have to invent a plot. What seems forgotten about this certain genre of film is it very dark. This involves kids living an adult life and often with some criminal intent. In real life, these kids are not of the proper age to be doing these types of things but that seems to be thrown out the window in these movies. In The Maze Runner, Thomas (Dyaln O'Brien) wakes up inside an elevator with no idea of his name or identity and he is eventually taken into a society in what seems to be the near future. The society is led by teenagers and the physical boundaries of this society are marked by a giant maze. The maze has many mysterious things about it and some could ultimately be be the key to getting out back into the real world or it could be the death to all of them. In terms of the characters and the depiction of the society, The Maze Runner is all over the place. The acting is not a problem and considering the young cast, this makes it even better with some fresh faces. We know none of where these characters come from, their background or why this society has no woman in it. I would compare it to the The Host, another young adult novel based film that is also set in a dystopian world and has the same flaw. How in the world does a society like this survive? How are these kids getting food? Where is there waste being disposed? That said, the movie does provide an original ending that shapes this film into being sort of creepy but still leaves the story wide open. Obviously, the biggest thing to this film is the maze itself but this is really also what slows down the film. The maze sets up the atmosphere of the film throughout and it's the maze is what keeps us thinking and pondering how it will shape the characters and their society. Once the characters do get inside the maze though, close to nothing happens in substance but the action scenes are still intense and special effects here are pretty effective. Still, I wish there was a better payoff once inside the maze. I bet the payoff will be bigger once the inevitable sequel comes along which has been announced for next September. Surely I would have loved more details about The Maze Runner and also wished it wasn't so up and down but the movie does have more positive then negative parts to it. Comparing it to the other trend films of this genre like Hunger Games to Divergent, The Maze Runner will no doubt be the least remembered. The film also really needs a sequel to give us answers to some of the questions raised near the end of the movie and this would also make this first installment better. In the end, The Maze Runner is A Lord of the Flies type inspired dystopian movie that feels like it's could have came out during the 80's and that's not a bad thing.
6.0~Surpricingly good! priyantha-bandara Sign in Permalink t is OK for me to admit that The Maze Runner delivered more than what I expected. After a brief glance over the plot I set my self to witness another Hunger Games movie but what I got was something more thrilling, gripping and a suspenseful experience. Being said that The Maze Runner is not a fresh approach to a plot or Sci Fi nature. And it is based on James Dashner's 2009 novel of the same name. There has being many mind boggling cinema on certain mazes (or traps true or imagery) and escaping from it including Cube (1997), Inception (2010) and Pans Labyrinth (2006) to name a few and each delivered a very powerful cinema experience. Standing against great movies like what I have mentioned earlier The Maze Runner is still has a long way to go being this is the first of a sequel of movies we are about to see in the coming years. But talking of this one alone it had done a pretty decent job. Thomas our 16-year-old hero wakes up in a strange place without having any memory of his earlier life. He and another group of people who experienced the same are trapped in a glade surrounded by a giant concrete maze. Though finding the way out of the maze and getting back home sounds a good idea the maze comes with many lethal surprises. But it seems like Thomas has some answers and soon the gang realizes that he is different. For a dystopian sci fi thriller The Maze Runner has some gripping ground to start off with. And the movie steadily evolves within the first hour from nowhere to somewhere and the viewers get to feel the strange and mysterious presence of the maze. There is no scene that I can call as dragging or irrelevant thought they seems slow or not filled with enough action and suspense. But the movie quickly hit a phase of action and adventure and from there the game plan completely changes. What I really like about The Maze Runner is it's overall mood. As the viewer just like the people who are trapped in the maze are kept in dark so the same mysteries boggle in every ones minds. It's as if the viewers also has to find answers to the mysteries and we are left with no options but to try. And at times we are left to make tough choices. Equipped with strong acting and brilliant CG The Maze Runner is a movie that will keep the viewer engaged every second. And when it finished it opens up a whole lot of new questions while answering only few of the burning ones that was laid out at the start. I guess we have to wait another year to find out what happens next.
2.0~boring baberchik Sign in Permalink The best way to describe this film with one word is "boring". bad actors, plot full of holes, a lot of plot elements are plain stupid, all the "action" scenes either lack enough logic or are simply cliché. If you are expecting anything NEARLY as good as "the cube" you will be in for a disappointment. Although the movie shares a similar concept the boring to death actors and the complete absurdity of it all bury all viewer expectations way before the end. And what's worse most of the movie is pretty much a soap opera. Yet another Hollywood sewer dump for the teenage audience, and I frankly don't see this garbage being anywhere near a blockbuster even with the less intelligent crowd. The movie does have potential, but the director doesn't. Like, at all.
5.0~A good passing of the time bravesfanc Sign in Permalink I started the book but didn't get very far. Not because I didn't enjoy it, just didn't have the time. Then I found out a movie was coming out and thought I didn't need to finish it. It's a very interesting concept as a boy awakens in an elevator of some sort and all he sees are a large group of boys staring down at him. He has no idea who he is or why he's there. As the movie goes along we learn about all the boys and where they are. There is a maze close by and no one has come out of it alive. Everyone also have a specific job and are categorized based on skill. The boy we first see remembers his name (his name is Thomas) and all he wants to do is get out there. His curiosity gets the best of him and runs into the maze. This leads to him killing a very large spider like creature. News of this back at the camp doesn't go over well as they believe consequences will be faced. Thomas and some of the others believe there is a way out through the maze. Others don't care and think that the rebel inside Thomas is causing chaos and whoever has sent these boys here will retaliate. It's an interesting story with a neat little twist at the end. I didn't know it was part of a series so the ending leaves you hanging but you can just read the books if you're too impatient. 5 out of 10 because while interesting it's nothing special.
9.0~Awesome Picture pacetti7 Sign in Permalink This is really a terrific picture, especially if you are an avid fan of the "Hunger Games" genre. Special effects and the acting are really superb and the story is credible, even though there are some small flaws in the plot line. One of my personal favorites is the fact that the maze looks considerably older than the 3 years the cast has supposedly been imprisoned there. Blake Cooper who plays Chuck, really did an awesome job, with credible performances being logged by Dylan O'Brien, Aml Ammen, and Hi Hong Lee. This film is definitely designed for a sequel, but that's really not a big surprise, is it? Anyway, the wife and I really enjoyed it and we are looking forward to The Maze Runner 2! =D
7.0~Great movie - until the ending! ellen-thorell Sign in Permalink I really liked the beginning of the movie. But after a few minutes you knew exactly what was going to happen. There's the guy who's against "the hero" and he's doing everything to stop "the hero". Even though I knew what was going to happen I enjoyed the movie. But when you knew who was behind the maze and the reason for it the movie sucked. Like honestly, shitty ending. And they just shot the little guy in the end so that the movie would have a scene to cry to. I normally cry to movies but this was just weird. But do keep in mind that I enjoyed most of the movie. The actors where good and also the settings. It's worth watching, the ending is just really bad.
10.0~This really was "my dreams come true" -movie akir-53426 Sign in Permalink YES! This really was one of the best movies in this genre (for me) of all time! I really don't usually give high ratings for movies (especially not the best possible), but I MUST to give this movie. There really is everything I like! Let's gather all my favourite things about the movie: 1. Let's start here this is scifi movie. I like just particular type of scifi and it's hard to find. And this is one of them 2. Limited filming scene with limited actors 3. The maze itself. I LOVE mazes. They are just fascinating for me. And when the labyrinth changes every night, it's even better. 4. Plot does not fall flat as the movie goes on. It stays very interesting. 5. The idea to be trapped in somewhere where "victims" must survive is my favourite type of genre. (Like Cube movies. I really don't care about the plot at all, when I'm watching that kind of movies.) 6. Adventurous and has cool technical creatures. And yeah. What more can I say. I also loved the acting, especially by main character. Many people says that it's not that great, but in my opinion it is. Everyone act their roles well. I really can't pick up the minuses. If I HAVE to say something, it was the ending. But it wasn't a big let down. Especially when I know that the sequel is coming so maybe everything comes clear in that film. So it doesn't lower the vote. I really enjoyed this one!
6.0~This Film is Decent. Sci-FiHorrorFan Sign in Permalink I enjoyed this film and I found the film interesting and very entertaining. I thought the Film had some good special effects and some Fun Action scenes.I also found the Writing and Directing okay. Now Does this film have problems? Yes but they are small ones like a lack of interesting characters and a slow start but regardless of that the film is still Decent and I actually started to like the main character,at first we don't know much about him,and his character was a little flat but after a while he grew on me and I actually started to like him,and that's because I found him brave and determined to escape the maze,also he seemed like a caring person and he put himself in danger to help others,and I liked that about him it made him likable, and by the end of the film I was cheering for him to kick some ass and escape. The film is about a group of teenagers who get put into a big field of land called the Glade which is surrounded by a giant maze and some of the teenagers don't remember their names and none of them know how they got there. Our main character wakes up in a lift and he doesn't remember how he got there and he gets taken to the top where he meets a group of teenagers and he feels threatened by them because he doesn't know who they are and they surround him and he starts to run and that's when he realise he can't leave because the maze entrance is sealed up and the group explains to him what is going on and they tell him that everyday the entrance opens and closes and that anyone that goes inside the maze does not make it back out alive. the group also tell him that they've been trying to escape the maze for 3 years and have had no luck and they all seem to think escape is impossible but they have all kept trying to get out and they have selected maze runners to go into the maze every day to try and find a way out but you can only be a maze runner if you pass certain tests. We also find out that every day the maze changes and rearranges itself which makes finding a way out even more hard. I must say I found the story to this film really interesting and involving and it had me thinking about ways for the characters to escape the maze. Later in the film The group of teenagers realise they need to work together to escape from the maze,and we get to see some exciting chase scenes with the Robot creatures which I really enjoyed watching. All the chase scenes with the creatures were really exciting and action packed,and the special effects were good in my opinion,they looked like practical creatures they did not look fake at all and I was happy with that. The film has pretty good action scenes and the special effects of the maze were very good too.As for the acting I thought it was okay,some actors out acted others but at the end of the day they were all fine. To sum things up this is an Okay film with an interesting story that I found captivating.the film also has some good mystery that was interesting Like who is responsible for putting the teenagers in the Glade?.I found the film interesting from beginning to end. Definitely recommended to people who like sci-fi Action and cool Looking creatures.
6.0~An overused dystopian atmosphere, but had thrilling action scenes. nicolechan916 Sign in Permalink When I first came out of the cinema, I was feeling pretty good about the movie, then I thought about it some more and realized it wasn't really that good. The maze aspect of it was very cool and unique, however apart from that, the whole dystopian world was pretty much cliché. The acting was pretty OK, it was a bit static and felt a bit overacted at times. O'Brien does a pretty good job but I did not like the fact that his character became in the lead so fast after just emergingit did not seem that plausible. Ki Hong Lee, I've known from YouTube and maybe its because I know how he's actually like, so didn't feel that anything was wrong with his acting until my friend said he was a bit awkward. The addition of Chuck was a good detail; Blake Cooper did a great job with his character and managed to get the audience on his side. He also added a bit of a comical element to the film. The effects were pretty cool and helped to establish the complexity of the maze. However, I feel that they didn't play around with the maze as much as they could have. The running/action scenes was about the same every time they ran, a bit repetitive. And I did not get the deal with 'The Grievers', that seemed a bit too sci-fi for this movie. (Wait, is this actually supposed to be a sci-fi dystopian movie? Doesn't seem like it though, that's why the 'grievers' felt out of place.) And don't even get me started on the female character. ONE girl and she does about absolutely nothing. Why do they do this to me. It's like they want me to keep pointing out how sexist films/books are. No doubt she and Thomas will get together in the next film (or they already have in the books, I don't know I haven't (not going to) read them).

5.0~5 is too much... slavov_desislav Sign in Permalink When I saw the trailer, I was really excited and impatient to watch this movie. BUT like in 90% of spectacular trailers, the movie wasn't be good on 50% of the trailer's success. There wasn't a plot, the story was really simple, the characters aren't developed at all. The best thing in the movie is Tomas, his play is good. I expected film effects, but there was only in 3 or 4 scenes. From the beginning of the creation of The Maze Runner the focus is on that to have second part, third part and so on and so on, like all blockbusters nowadays. The feeling of no end of the movie is not good. If you do not know what to watch on cinema, I recommend you to wait one day and to go watching Gone Girl, which release date is tomorrow. From me 5 from 10, which is too much for this movie.
8.0~A fast moving and intriguing Thriller tushar-43598 Sign in Permalink The concept and plot of the movie is quite interesting, wherein the element of suspense in maintained pretty well till towards the climax. The story never stops and keeps on moving with a decent pace and the plot is carried on in a way wherein viewers are drawn into the storyline, looking forward to the last mystery being unveiled giving rise to another mystery. The actors though are pretty average and the weak point of the movie is its weak character development and average acting. Overall it is a good one time watch and this first movie sets ground for an interesting sequel which i am definitely looking forward to.
6.0~Good, but could easilly be better tinovalkki Sign in Permalink Although The Maze Runner story isn't one of the brilliants I have seen, it is interesting enough to satisfy my interest. Opening scene is intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such movies as Cube and TV- shows like Lost keeps you interest awake about what to come. Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days. I stay wait sequel with great interest.
8.0~Well dont know why people hate this but, honestly, for me it's a good movie, but could have been better NotASmartCritic Sign in Permalink I always like action scenes in movies, but this movie could have been longer to have more action scenes, and could have been more better, these are the problems of the movie, but actually i watched this movie always since 2015 and i still enjoy it up to now
8.0~Huge potential on display in this exciting YA adaptation leannematrix Sign in Permalink ** Contains spoilers ** "The Maze Runner" is an incredibly enjoyable movie which shows some excellent potential for its sequels - "The Scorch Trials" and "The Death Cure". Well adapted from the original YA novel by James Dashner, "The Maze Runner" is an exciting 2 hour movie that is ahead of most of its counterparts (think "Divergent", "I Am Number Four" etc.) and only really lags behind the superior "The Hunger Games" franchise. First time feature-film director, Wes Ball, shows his mettle as a director set for a fine future, as well as Dylan O'Brien who is on top form as our hero Thomas. Anyone familiar with O'Brien's work as Stiles on MTV's "Teen Wolf" will be well aware of his acting chops, but here he gets the opportunity to really show that he is potentially a huge, future A-list actor. As well as this, "The Maze Runner" is neatly paced sticking to the three act structure and Hero's Journey to the letter. And there is an air of mystery to the reason for the boys (and later Teresa) being trapped in the Glade which only adds to the movie's appeal. The action scenes are expertly shot and the maze itself is beautifully realised by a combination of physical sets and CGI. The Grievers (whilst physically differing to their book counterparts) are terrifying and well designed. As good as the action scenes were, however, I found it was the quieter scenes which really stood out for me. For instance, Thomas' scene with Gally in the Pit was perfectly acted by both and gave us a nice look into Gally's mind and motivations. I also particularly liked Thomas' chat with Chuck - their brotherly bond that is so present in the book was beautifully illustrated. And all of the flashbacks Thomas' sees of his past at WCKD. However, the best scene of the movie was the "false end". Similar to the book, yet heightened by the choice of camera shots - and particularly John Paesano's score - the scene in the lab before Gally's miraculous reappearance was perfection personified. If I hadn't have read the book beforehand, and knew a certain character's death was coming, I would have been astounded by the final sting in "The Maze Runner"'s tail, as I think it's completely unexpected. After this, the Gladers "rescue" proves to be a neat and tidy ending, whilst simultaneously whetting the audiences' appetite for the sequel. The aerial shot of the maze in its entirety was beautiful, and our first look at "The Scorch" was exciting. There is so much potential on offer with this first instalment of "The Maze Runner" trilogy, and more often than not, this adaptation hits rather than misses. Well acted, well directed, and well written, "The Maze Runner" is a 2 hour thrill-ride that races through its run time and leaves you eagerly awaiting films two and three. 8/10
8.0~A tense film with surprises around every corner dazzask8 Sign in Permalink Now although the books were very good I thought that this was a risky move making the books into movies. However on watching the movie I have been persuaded that the risk has paid off, although I am 16 and this is one of my favourite genres around. Thomas (the main character) is found stuck in a maze with many others "gladers"(other boys that have been trapped in the maze) that have been trapped in the maze. There mission is to try and make it out of the maze with runners trying to map the maze every morning. If they get trapped at night in the maze, they get killed by the boy eating machines known as "grievers". Unfortunately I cant say much else otherwise I would be giving the plot away. Due to reading the first book before I went to go see the film I know what the story was about, and the movie stuck to everything that was in the book, which some movies are poor at doing. And the effects of the maze and the grievers were astonishing. However the only thing that I saw wrong with the movie was the ending as they tried to add a bit of humour to the movie. Bearing in mind it is an action film, this way of trying to add humour to the movie didn't really work in my mind. Also the movie did take a little while to get into the good stuff, which just made the start a but too long winded. In conclusion however, I would recommend the movie to anyone who has seen the hunger games or similar as the movie is similar to it but with not as much gore. However the movie was fantastic with twists and turns around every corner. Will defiantly be watching this movie again. PS: first review done by a 16 year old so please don't criticises
5.0~Formula that's done to death karenlim89 Sign in Permalink Such a shame that the talents of the young cast were wasted on such a shallow film that spent too much time pretending to be something else. I scored this a 5 out of 10 because the cast was pretty good but sadly, the storyline was anything but. Ever since the popularity of The Hunger Games, it seems that movie studios are keen on the whole sci-fi + dystopia combo but honestly, it's done to death. In The Maze Runner, I felt as if the story led me to believe I had gone down a rabbit hole when I had only been on a wild goose chase. The attempt at creating a mysterious and conspiratorial air didn't quite achieve the desired effect with audiences, probably because too much time was spent on it that when we ultimately reached the great reveal, the outcome was a tad disappointing and slightly underwhelming. I get that surprise twists are all the rage, but I was left feeling boggled and unclear about certain parts of the big reveal. This movie is definitely a forgettable one but while you're watching it, that's not to say you won't be rooting for the protagonists. You may feel for the characters and be drawn in by the cool action sequences, but all in all, watching this movie is highly likely a one-time affair. -POTENTIAL SPOILER- The concept of a maze that constantly shifts/alters is awesome and it felt like the movie could have been so much more. Would have been nice to maybe see Thomas experience the frustrations of trying to get the lay of the land as a new Maze Runner instead of being the clichéd hero who miraculously saves (almost) the whole colony in just a few days.
6.0~Another Movie Based Off A Popular Book... How Is It? sharms219 Sign in Permalink First things first, if you read the book The Maze Runner and liked it go see this movie, end of review for you, but if you haven't read the book keep reading. The Maze Runner is about a boy named Thomas who one day finds himself trapped in the center of wall in a small society surrounded by a maze made up of other boys. None of them remember their past, only their name, and when Thomas shows up he is determined to find a way out of the maze. I was really excited for this movie, the trailer was great, the cast was pretty good, and although I hadn't read the book I heard it was fantastic. I can tell you that the first 45 minutes of this movie are enthralling, suspenseful, and overall really, really impressive. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie isn't all that great. The first half of the movie leaves the audience excited and begging for answers to all the unknowns the brought up, but the problem is the answers aren't satisfying. I won't spoil anything, but the reason the boys are in the maze literally left me in awe at how ridiculous the reason was. And that's not the only answer that left me thinking,"Are you joking me right now?". Now, the reason I said that anyone who read and liked the book should watch the movie is because they already know the answers to the questions in the movie, and they're already satisfied with those answers. Still, anyone who hasn't read the book might be, and in fact probably will be, pretty let down. The only other negative thing I have to say about the movie is the rushed and sloppy ending. The final events occur so quickly that there really isn't any time for the viewer to soak in what's happening. Despite my complaints The Maze Runner isn't a bad movie. Like I said the first half is absolutely amazing. In fact the first half of the movie is so good it might be worth watching just for that alone. And let me add that on top of the impeccable first half every actor does a fantastic job. The action scenes are well shot and suspenseful, and the fantastic score only adds to the excitement. And let me say the CGI maze as well as the grievers look fantastic! The Maze Runner definitely has it's problems, but the good portions of the movie are so good that I might consider it worth going and seeing in theaters. Thanks for reading! I hope this review was helpful!
9.0~Super Awesome Nail Biting Thriller pratikshya-mishra72 Sign in Permalink Based on the novel of the same name by James Dashner, 'The Maze Runner' is a dystopian, futuristic thriller. It keeps you excited, interested, curious and at the edge of the seat throughout. The twists and turns every ten to fifteen minutes is so unexpected and shocking, you'd find it difficult to take a break before watching the complete movie. And I bet you'd watch it at one go, without pauses, let alone breaks! It has so many nail biting moments I lost count of them all. And enough of 'what is going to happen next?' moments to keep you hooked. My eyes were bulging out of my sockets the entire 1 hour 50 minutes of the movie, in anticipation. This one is worth a watch for all thriller lovers. Hats off to the author for creating such an awesome plot and an equally awesome maze. If you are a 'Hunger Games' fan, you'd like this one more, better.
3.0~Lord of the Flies did it better vandelour Sign in Permalink This review is simple. Lord of the Flies meets CGI and the result will be SEQUELS. Which is the goal of movie-making these days. Make one movie and then make it over again. And again. And again. Was the original idea for Maze a ripoff from a better movie, a classic movie called Lord of the Flies (1963)? Yes, so what. Put the idea in a blender on high, add some CGI and some updated fear-factors and whammo ya got a project that can get some financial backing. Make more money by thinking less. Was Maze pointless without a real ending? Yes, so what. Leave the movie with a stupid unresolved ending so you can MAKE A SEQUEL. And sucker the rubes back in again. And again. Hell, the next generation of movie viewers won't even recognize the ripoff anyway.
7.0~The Maze Runner is a confident start to another YA franchise. TheMovieDiorama Sign in Permalink You might be getting sick to death with these YA universes, but guess what? You just got another one. Fortunately though, this is more "The Hunger Games" than "Divergent" in terms of quality. Don't get me wrong, there is a maze...and there is lots of running...a film that I still think, to this day, Tom Cruise would be more than suitable for. Yet, the central mystery and intrigue is what brings you into the story. Mysteriously trapped in what looks like an endless maze, Thomas must figure out why he has been brought to the maze where his survival skills are put to the test. Aside from the sci-fi traits, this strongly reminded me of William Golding's classic novel "Lord of the Flies". In fact, the atmosphere and interactions within 'The Glade' are the most compelling scenes. A struggle for power and authority, the creation of a civilised environment by employing rules that the 'Gladers' abide to and dictating the roles of each individual from agriculture to the more dangerous job of being a "Runner". The way the narrative establishes the characters and their roles may be slightly uninspired but for what it's worth, it works. Dylan O'Brien, in a more physical role, controls the film and is surprisingly engaging (considering his lack of previous lead roles). But it's Will Poulter who yet again shines. His lust for power consumes him and conveys him as the antagonist, however there is more to his character that evokes a sense of sympathy. Confident and commanding. Thomas Brodie-Sangster was also good, but Kaya Scodelario...I still find her wooden and monotonous. She really didn't do much here. The plot is fuelled by conveniences, where one convenient plot device leads to another convenient answer and the mystery continues like that. For its target audience, it's functional. I was onboard and intrigued, so I can't say I was ever bored. I did find it was too focused on building a sequel. This becomes apparent during the rushed expositional conclusion. A fun film that caught me off guard.

8.0~Pleasantly surprised! petarmatic Sign in Permalink I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this film. Although we saw similar plots before, I have to say that there was something new in this one. It was not all repetitive from the previous films of the same kind, it had something new in it. Those big spiders we saw before in some other films, I can not recall which ones but some similar animals were shown all the time in other sci fi films. The maze was spectacular and scenes inside were great. I really enjoyed it. Acting was good for the teen actors, I especially got fond of the character of the chubby little boy. All in all I have to recommend this film, especially to the crowds who enjoy sci fi films. Go for it!
2.0~Ill-conceived; ridiculously plotted "boys" movie ilikeimdb Sign in Permalink The entire premise of this silly excuse to do a boys' adventure movie lacks the one thing that would really matter: A valid reason for making it. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, and you find out at the very end why nothing makes sense and then you realize you've been ripped off: The idiots who created/wrote this movie don't give a hoot about rationality, don't give a hoot about consistency, and nothing in this movie matters to any degree....all they wanted was an excuse to do some CGI and some action sequences that involve each and every male coming-of-age cliché imaginable. How they roped Patricia Clarkson into this sad movie is beyond me (perhaps Dame Judy Dench laughed too loudly when she read its premise).
8.0~Onward and Upward stephenlovelette Sign in Permalink What do The Hunger Games, Ender's Game, Divergent and The Maze Runner all have in common? They're based on dystopian YA novels. They're also introductions to a multi-part series. And I never stop hollering about this, but they're all rated PG-13. Which is ultimately The Maze Runner's least redeeming quality. After all, it's my favorite of the four previously mentioned. The MZ's mostly a quality flick. Although the stakes are high, the ratings-board approved shellac is still clearly visible. An educated viewer can't shake the awareness of censorship. For example, during the more harried sequences (mostly involving a battle or pursuit via 'grievers') the filmmakers use the shadowy quick-edits to obscure the violence. Luckily the CGI monsters are shown in full. The 'grievers' are buffalo-sized mechanical beetles. As far as creatures go, they're truly outstanding, original and horrific. The only problem stems from a false hint at the surreal. If you pay close attention, The Maze Runner is an astounding allegory for entering adulthood. This is in keeping with the summer trend of allegorical science fiction, with Snowpiercer (which I do recommend) and The Zero Theorem (which I don't). The plot develops lightning fast. This in turn can lead to confusion. Or maybe I'm just too old for this sort of thriller. So, yes, an elevator shaft is reminiscent of the birth canal. Yes, a labyrinth is a classic metaphor for life. Yes, the supporting characters resemble archetypes. But the mind-bending portion of this thrill ride's a red herring. Because, no, the plot doesn't take place inside the protagonist's head. The viewer need not be concerned with how individual events fit into the self-contained metaphor. Consider the sequence of obstacles Thomas (played by Dylan O'Brien) must overcome while fleeing the first griever. Think about the ways he adapts to the physical environment, the increasing risk and differing tasks required to move forward. A few notes on the acting. The girl, Kaya Scodelario, turns in a solid performance as Teresa. As does Blake Cooper playing Chuck, the protagonist's younger buddy. Thomas Brodie-Sangster (of Game of Thrones fame) plays Newt, punching the thespian clock with efficiency. Will Poulter from We're the Millers plays a bit of a one-note character but executes the role proficiently. I like this guy; he's going places. Patricia Clarkson plays Ava Paige, a mash-up of Glenn Close's Nova Prime in Guardians of the Galaxy and Jodie Foster's Secretary Delacourt in Elysium. Much like Teresa, we learn very little about Ava. The mix of action, suspense and adequate special effects add up to a compelling thriller and a strong entry into the YA novel-turned-film catalogue. See it in IMAX - this is one you won't want to miss. Things aren't looking good for the Ender's Game franchise. However, according to Wikipedia, "Two weeks prior to (The Maze Runner's) release 20th Century Fox decided to move ahead with the sequel and pre-production began in early September 2014 in New Mexico." Whether or not the box office earnings compensate for the $34 million budget, it seems like we'll be seeing a follow-up. If anyone's looking, I'll be in my tent, eagerly awaiting The Scorch Trials.
3.0~A film that's hard to take seriously. amdarmy Sign in Permalink This movie could be ended with a ladder. And they have all the materials to build one. That simple fact sucks all the drama out of it. They're in there because they choose to be. While the whole premise is kind of silly and senseless; compared to the ladder problem, the other giant logical holes just kind of fade into the background. I have trouble really caring about any of the characters, as without actually being trapped, they're just kind of camping in a really dangerous place. If they get hurt,it was their own decision to put themselves at risk. Not that the reason they were put in there makes any sense; the plot doesn't work regardless. However, there's no real reason to analyze further when the ladder issue just sucks all the life out of it right from the start.
4.0~goofs. full of them... paul_gasca Sign in Permalink well, I don't want to suggest anyone not to see this movie, but ... as far as I see an escape plan from a maze, well the whole movie is built with goofs like these: 1. first of all, they did not even try to climb the walls by any means (ladders, trees, etc) 2. in the scene where the giant robot spiders enter their glade (the grievers), they are trying to hide from these beasts, in the forest... well, with a torch in their hand!! come on! how can you hide from someone during the night, when you have an one meter burning torch in your hand??? And that's it. I will stop here with this kind of flaws. I can't even imagine how this movie is rated so high on IMDb, but, anyhow. good luck to it. I was so bored at one point, that in the scene where the leading actor was trying to find gate number 7, I was laughing out loud thinking about the scene with the maze, in the 1975 "Three Men in a Boat". "follow me... and now, turn to the left" and so on. PS: this is my first review. can anyone tell me if I can uncheck the spoiler button later?
6.0~Decent, but Nothing to Write Home About mattneub-1 Sign in Permalink The premise is pretty entertaining, though as others have pointed out here it is not entirely original. See "Cube" (1997) for a much better treatment of the "Strangers trapped together and they don't know why." theme. Maze also follows the approach that viewer learns more along with the characters - which works pretty well for most of the film. The visual effects were well done throughout and the design of look and feel of the maze creatures was very well done. Unfortunately while the story starts out strong, the plot pretty much falls apart at the end, with a lot of things happening that don't seem to make a great deal of sense, and then they throw in a big hook for the sequel. Generally the acting is pretty good, other than the over the top stuff by the fellow playing Gally. Perhaps he was just upset because his character was badly written, but whether it was the acting or the way the character was written it doesn't work. I have not read the books on which Maze is based so there a number of unexplained or poorly explained plot points especially toward the end that I didn't get. Some folks have suggested that one ought to read the book to really get what's going on - I'm not going to do that, the screenwriter's job is to explain them or leave it out, and this movie wasn't good enough to sell me on the books. I think the most disappointing aspect of The Maze Runner is that I have the distinct impression it could have been a lot better if they had spent more time on adapting the story.
7.0~A tense, entertaining film with enough thrills and drama to cover up its narrative inadequacies. shawneofthedead Sign in Permalink It's rare for a big movie studio to trust the future of a potential blockbuster franchise to a brand-new director. You'd imagine that there would be just too much at stake when it came to translating James Dashner's series of best-selling dystopian novels to the silver screen. But it's easy to see why Wes Ball got the job - with this one film, he graduates from short films to blockbuster movies with flair to spare. Indeed, The Maze Runner is such a cool, confident and thrilling blend of action beats and character work that it's hard to believe Ball has never before commandeered a full- length feature film. It's true that the narrative gets a little away from him by the end, making less sense as more secrets are revealed. But this is more a problem with the source material than Ball's own skills as a director. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) finds himself thrust rudely into the world of the Glade: a community of boys who have figured out how to live while encircled by a giant, constantly changing maze, within which dwell giant, boy-eating monsters known only as Grievers. Many of the boys, including benevolent pioneer Alby (Aml Ameen) and champion of the old ways Gally (Will Poulter), are content with just surviving day to day. Thomas winds up unsettling the entire camp with his refusal to follow the rules and determination to ask questions: he wants to explore the Maze with designated runners like Minho (Ki Hong Lee), and figure out a way to get free. Life in the camp gets more complicated when, weeks before the next boy is due to be sent up to the Glade, a girl in the form of Theresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives instead. There's a lot of blockbuster potential to be squeezed out of this premise, and Ball does so quite wonderfully. The Maze encircling the Glade is a stonily grey, massive enclosure, and the Grievers - when the boys encounter them in increasingly close quarters - are odd marvels made as much of machine as flesh. Ball cuts scenes of great, heart-stopping tension together masterfully: whether it's Thomas running through walls that are fast closing in on him, or Thomas and Minho trying to outrun a Griever while burdened with an unconscious Alby. The film even finds some welcome dramatic depth in this strange little community of lost boys in the Glade - Thomas' growing antagonism with Gally is balanced against the mutual respect he and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) develop for each other, and the brotherly connection that he forges with the adorable Chuck (Blake Cooper). The politics of the situation is fascinating as well: as much as The Maze Runner is about, well, running for your life in a giant maze, it also raises big questions about identity and integrity. Is safety and security worth giving up your right to information and choice? What works less well is the secret around which the Glade is constructed. As viewers, we aren't given a whole lot of answers about why the Glade and the Maze exists, nor do we get many explanations as to why Thomas is so different and insatiably curious. But the ones we do get - all centred around the mysterious, severe figure of Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) in some kind of control centre - oddly render the film and its characters less, rather than more, interesting. It's a strangely deflating experience to have the film's rich ethical dilemmas and intense action sequences give way to an underlying dystopian narrative that isn't really all that compelling. Nevertheless, The Maze Runner remains quite an accomplishment. It's an assured, impressive debut for Ball, one with enough electric tension and moody drama to intrigue throughout its running time. His young cast is fully capable of carrying their own weight, with Poulter - morphing from comic sidekick in We're The Millers into hateful adversary here - the standout. Its story collapses a little into itself as it hurtles towards its climax, but Ball's work is quite enough to leave viewers excited by the prospect of the inevitable sequel.
10.0~A must watch Stewartamber81 Sign in Permalink This movie is fantastic. I loved it at first I didn't think I would like it but I liked it by the beginning it's a eye catcher. Anyone of all ages would like this movie. It's a year jerker sometimes. But you will fall in love with it. :) I promise. The main character just wakes up one day in what they call a box and he soon finds out there is no way to escape. So he and the gladers must join together and help find a way out. The story line in this movie is great. The details and affects were also great. I loved everything about this movie Evan eyyyebraws aka galley. These kids are all just scared and worried that they will never find a way out. But you will have to tune in to see the movie for your self and see what happenes.
9.0~Pretty Amazing!!! zardoz-13 Sign in Permalink Usually, Hollywood does little justice to novels. Undoubtedly, this has something to do the sense of unity the author or authors impose on their work, despite any tampering on the part of the publisher. By the time the novel illuminates the screen, a horde of individuals—including but not limited to the producers, directors, writers, and the studio bosses—has gone through it in an effort to make it more palatable for movie-going patrons. Sometimes, they change the book so you don't recognize it or audaciously leave it intact. In the latter instance, the author may have adapted his own work for the screen. Indeed, this seems to be the case with David Fincher's "Gone Girl." Typically, Hollywood doesn't let the author interfere until that piece of literary genius has coined multi-millions at the box office and the sequels and prequels are in the works. Meantime, one of the biggest problems with adapting a novel is the drastic difference between books and movies. Some things that appear promising in print simply don't translate to the screen. Occasionally, the novel may be too massive for the screen like J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy was until the advent of computer-generated imagery. Surprisingly enough, "The Maze Runner" ranks as the exception to the rule; it surpasses its literary counterpart. Anybody who is a stickler for faithful adaptations will grit their teeth at the liberties freshman director Wes Ball and scenarists Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers, and T.S. Nowlin have taken with James Dashner's post-apocalyptic, young-adult, science fiction bestseller. Apart from "The Maze Runner," Oppenheim has written only one other screenplay and it is for the upcoming "Divergent" sequel "Allegiant: Part 1," while Myers has written nothing else. Not only has Nowlin been revising the forthcoming "Fantastic Four" reboot, but also he has been hired to script "The Maze Runner" sequel "The Scorch Trials." Mind you, some of the events depicted in Dashner's provocative novel wouldn't have appeared as realistic on screen, principally; Ball and company have altered the Griever's hole, eliminated the cliff, and changed the Glade layout. I think they have done a splendid job of sprucing up "The Maze Runner" without sabotaging it. When we meet him for the first time, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien of "The Internship") is a 16-year old who doesn't remember his name. He awakens to find himself ascending in a supply elevator "The Box" to place called 'the Glade.' After the elevator jars to a halt, several teens pull him out. Gally (Will Poulter of "We're the Millers"), Alby (Aml Ameen of "Red Tails"), and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster of "The Baytown Outlaws") are among those teens. Afflicted with amnesia, Thomas knows nothing about his new surroundings. Initially, Gally proves to be the most inhospitable member of the Glade. He hates Thomas from the moment he sees him. Thomas reciprocates this sentiment and tries to escape. This little stunt earns our protagonist a night in the slammer. When he emerges the following day, Thomas learns escape is impossible. He stares in awe at the towering stone skyscrapers that enclose 'the Glade' where the teens thrive on supplies brought in by the Box. Those gargantuan walls that tower all around the Glade constitute the perimeter of 'the Maze.' While the sun shines, the Maze doors remain open. At dusk, these colossal doors rumble back together as if by remote control and slam shut. Thomas discovers some of the Gladers have been imprisoned there for three years. Everybody, our hero learns, performs a specific task. Some tend the gardens; others prepare meals; still others build the enclosures, and some even serve as medics. The job Thomas desperately relishes is to be a runner. Runners enter the maze at dawn and explore the exotic premises until dusk. They scour this enormous labyrinth in search of an exit. Unfortunately, nobody has yet found one. None of the runners prowl around after dark in the maze because grisly creatures known as the Grievers lurk in the shadows. These giant, slimy, bug-like predators scamper about on mechanical legs. Moreover, they can scale walls when they aren't charging down corridors. Equipped with stingers, they dispense venom that can transform a teenager into a screaming maniac. Miraculously, Thomas lures one of these hideous devils into a corridor as the walls shift and crush it to bits. This is the first time a Griever has ever died in the maze. Horrified, Gally wants to banish Thomas. Things get worse when the Box delivers a girl, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario of "Moon"), and she brings a message that the end is near. Gally wants to kill Thomas and Teresa, but everybody else stands up for the two newbies. "The Maze Runner" takes its cues from a number of ancient myths, classic novels, and recent movies. First, because the teens tangle with the Grievers, this saga resembles the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. Second, since guys dominate the Glade with a peculiar code of justice, "The Maze Runner" is reminiscent of William Golding's post-apocalyptic novel "Lord of the Flies," published in 1954, about a group of students marooned on a desert island who struggle to survive. Inevitably, "The Maze Runner" resembles the sci-fi saga "Dark City." In "Dark City," aliens control a replica of Earth as they try to come to terms with what it means to be human. Similarly, these aliens alter the landscape of their bogus city, much in the same way the maze changes during the night in "The Maze Runner." Naturally, Dashner's book bears some resemblance to other young adult novels such as "The Hunger Games" and "Divergent." Director Wes Ball does an admirable job of generating baffling mystery and white-knuckled suspense throughout this tantalizing tale of terror. Nobody gives a bad performance, and Will Poulter makes a wicked villain. Sadly, the tension and suspense lapses after our heroes survive the maze and prepare for the sequel. Nevertheless, "The Maze Runner" qualifies as pretty amazing.
1.0~Sterile, Humorless and Chaste! OMG! Please Not A Sequel! I Beg You! OMG! Please Not A Sequel! I Beg You! interestingfunstuff Sign in Permalink The story makes no sense, whatsoever! Nada! Nothing! Not in the slightest. To make matters worse, the ending was nothing more then prepping the audience for a sequel! It was so in your face it was insulting. You mean the audience won't have a clue as to why all those innocent people died unless you come back and waste another 12 dollars! Wow! I will be avoiding any future sequel like the plague! The Maze Runner also reflects the sterile and chaste expectations of the American movie going audience. For starters, you have young men living together as a colony for up to as long as three years and they all have perfect haircuts! Give me a break! I couldn't believe how well groomed they all were. Did they have a hair stylist pop in from in from another dimension on a regular basis? And how could they all be so clean shaven? Did they bring razors and shaving cream with them? None of these men have delayed puberty problems that I could tell. LOL! Some of them must have developed facial hair after years of being stranded. But what bothered me most was what great shape their clothes were in. These are young men in there late teens and early 20's. Did they bring a seamstress and a washing machine with them, too!? They are supposed to be living like Robinson Crusoe, not like George Jetson! In this entire awful film there was only one single moment of humor. Even worse it has zero sexuality. Here's all these incredibly good looking and physically fit young men and we don't see a single one of them with their shirt off for a second! Why is non-stop violence, intense screaming and even murder OK, but not showing off the male body? Why have we become such a warped and sterile society where death and violence doesn't offend in the slightest, but God forbid you show a single male nipple or hairy armpit?
8.0~I simply enjoyed it raresandreinegoita Sign in Permalink Yes, it has its drawbacks. At some point it was illogical or too contradictory but there were more than a few scenes that left me speechless.
5.0~Maze Runner: The Search for Women estreet-eva Sign in Permalink An extended pack of newly pubescent boys wanders parent-less in a lush "Glade" (did Albert originally pen that name? It seems a little college freshman 101 English for a kid) and yet they display no obsession with the lack of women? Did the wiping of their memories also give them an interest in gardening to the extent that they are reluctant to try to solve the ridiculous cement maze that surrounds them? In real life, the lack of female companionship would have meant more boys would be volunteering as maze runners than hanging around building lean-to's as occurs in the film. Teresa's arrival - the first woman many had seen in 3 years - might have started an out and out civil war. Putting the sexual (or lack thereof) politics aside, the movie presents a fairly book-y device of a government in crisis using scarce resources to build a massive climate-controlled, cyborg filled intelligence test which takes 3 years to produce results. Couldn't they just have administered the Wechsler and saved themselves 2 years, 11 months, 3 weeks, 6 days and 23 hours and a billion dollars? Applying a fair amount of disbelief the story itself is a relatively straightforward one of group problem solving under adverse conditions. The twists at the end are dopey but do serve to set up a half billion dollar sequel. The characters and their characterization leave the audience whispering: "who's he again?" Only Will Poulter's "Gally" distinguishes himself as the voice of conservatism against the more charismatic, liberal Gladers. His views are compelling and one assumes had the grievers not mounted a mass attack, he probably would still be the Glades's democratically elected leader. How he shows up at the end of the film makes no sense within the story's own logic - remember the giant metal blades shut beyond the group? In short, a not un-entertaining also-ran among the "Hunger Games", "Divergent", dystopian future subgenre.
6.0~6/10 grahamdavidson007 Sign in Permalink This film... What was i expecting? maze challenges!! thats what the name suggests... however i feel i am disappointed.... this is hunger games#1 mark 3.... similar story history and because of this rather disappointing... for obvious reasons i am nothing going too in depth... watch it on DVD do not see it at cinema! Hollywood is clutching at straws here... Perhaps next year there will be some better writers... At the moment, you never feel like you connect with the protagonists! its more a jaunt round a sand pit with dinner at evil grannys than a film which is meant to raise emotions.... the British kid who dies (lol can u guess who??) is OK.... he has come far! but he is capable of more and this film for any of the participants never encapsulates their abilities... let me direct i will have a better chance!
6.0~Disappointing mystery MihaiSorinToma Sign in Permalink A boy wakes up in a cage being lifted up in a very odd place. As he doesn't remember anything, he finds out he's trapped with a couple of other guys which struggle to survive in a harsh environment, being surrounded by an enormous maze which is as lethal as it is big. Unlike the others, he's not willing to accommodate in that place, so he starts venturing in the maze, trying to figure out why they were sent there and search for a way out. It seemed like a very interesting idea even from the trailer, but, as I was expecting, it proved to be quite a bad movie. That surreal place is being "populated" by some boys who are as intelligent as the concrete walls surrounding them. Instead of trying to find a way out, something any normal human would do, they waste their time mocking each other, fighting, or even bossing around. They are simply happy with their current life and are not willing to do anything to change it. The main character isn't much better either, many of his decisions being arguable, to say the least. I gave it this rating for two main reasons. It has an interesting "arena", where the action takes place and, although it's mostly predictable, it brings a surprising and plausible conclusion, while leaving room for a sequel.
8.0~Bring On The Sequel! callanvass Sign in Permalink I've never read the book, but I saw considerable praise for this movie. When my friend and I decided to see this movie, I had decent expectations for it. I expected a well made movie with a fair amount of thrills and action. Not only did I get that, but a lot more than I bargained for. This is a very well made movie that has solid storytelling and lots of intense action. The action scenes are filled with tension, building the suspense very efficiently. There are some fantastic chase scenes that had me on the edge of my seat especially the one involving Tomas and a Griever. I was blown away by the performances in this movie! Considering I had only seen a couple of the actors in other things. Dylan O'Brien is excellent as our hero, Thomas. I've never seen Teen Wolf, but he was great here. Kaya Scodelario is really good as well and played off O'Brien very well. The rest of the cast is just as good. Even Patricia Clarkson has a brief role at the end. The only minor complaint I had is that it was rather simple to figure out where this was heading. I picked up on it pretty quickly, but I still enjoyed the ride. The ending was quite satisfactory, filled with emotion and suspense, setting up the sequel nicely. This is the best movie I've seen in theaters this year. Even if you aren't familiar with the book, you can still have a great time. I don't see how you can possibly dislike this movie, but that's just me. It's well worth the money to see it in theaters. 8.3/10
1.0~worse movie I watched in 2014 aaronjoseph-123-537920 Sign in Permalink I never take the time to review a film on here, but I just had to say a few things about this film. I understand that people have certain likes and dislikes, but come on.....why did this movie score so high? I don't know who would score this movie above a 3 besides kids under 15, and even then I wonder. Again, I understand everyone has their own taste, but I was so angry I even wasted my time to watch this. I agree with a few readers, the first 15 minutes of this show are okay. But just okay. But then after that, this show just didn't make any sense. I won't give any spoilers so if you want to go give this movie a try, go ahead, but it's a waste of time. Then, about half way through this show, which kept getting dumber and made no sense, I told myself to just shut it off.. Don't waste my time. But.... there was a small part of me that just had to find out how this movie ended. What was the big mystery?? Maybe this show would have an okay ending and give this movie some sort of merit....... WRONG.... I should of shut it off.... the ending of this movie was the worse.. And I didn't think anything could get worse.... After reading up on this movie and seeing the score IMDb had for it, I had good expectations for it.... I still can not fathom how this movie scored so high.. UGH..... BOOOO... this movie just stunk!
10.0~YA Adaptation of the Year rebook424 Sign in Permalink I had been sooo excited for The Maze Runner movie ever since I heard there was going to be a movie! I read the book and quite liked it. It had a lot of elements I thought would look good in a movie, such as the griever and the maze, duh. And it did. It was awesome! Fastened Pace - A Positive Change Perhaps I shouldn't, but I will start right away with the changes because this affects the plot and pacing - which I'd like to talk about now - and most of the things big time. There were a lot of changes made, which usually I don't say as a compliment. However, this time it enhanced the quality of the movie (unlike in many other cases. Khm...I'm looking at you Divergent and City of Bones). Because this time, it wasn't for the sake of difference and it wasn't simply (awesome) scenes cut out. These were all well thought-out, important, meaningful changes. For the most part, they were to fasten the pacing. In the first half of the book, we get to know a copious amount of information and then goes the action. It works out fairly well in a book, but in a movie less so. Hence they inserted more action scenes (read: a LOT more action scenes) and what we needed to be informed about, we got meanwhile. I was not bored for a second! The Cast - Pure Perfection I don't know when I had the luck to see such an excellent cast last time. When an actor gets the role of a book character - especially if the book in question is one of my favorites - I have doubts. Serious ones. I care about my books and since there is a fat chance after the movie the image of the character in my head will morph into the actor/actress they're played by, I want the actor/actress to be very good. This time, however, I didn't feel anything like that. And post-movie, my opinion is untouched. All of them were perfect for the role as for their appearance and acting skills. It's Alive! - About Grievers and the Maze The Grievers are supposed to be scare-the-sh#t-out-of-you scary, according to both the book and the movie. They had never been defeated before after all. And they were grandiose and spiky. But in the book all I got was how ugly they were. Like, I wasn't freaked out of my mind by far. Also, they descriptions of them were a bit fuzzy even though that I could understand. When they were around it was never really time to take them under inspection. The point is, I was more than thrilled to finally see how they looked on the big screen. In fact, I went fangirly so much, I got all squealy in the middle of the movie hall and my friend I'd gone to see it with was like "It's okay. Calm down." I think she thought I saw scared. :D Not even close; I was super-huper excited. (I still am, look at that ridiculous made up word. LOL) Anyway, they were incredible! They were all spiky and grimy and monstrous and yes. Scary! A little like in Alien and absolutely cool. I am perfectly content with the outcome. The maze were nothing less. It was as if it was alive when it moved and were fighting with the grievers for the first place monster award. They changed the code and the relating things a bit, the code was only a sequence of numbers for instance, which I thought took away a bit of the excitement of figuring it out, but I could overlook it after so many goodies. Minus the Paranormal When I first heard they would take away Thomas and Teresa's mind speaking, I wasn't sure how much I would miss it. Now I can answer that question; a bit, but I got used to it quickly. But I can understand why they did it. It was a nice mystery in the book, but it just wasn't necessary in the movie. I would go as far as saying it would have been strange if suddenly there would have been disembodied voices flying around. Furthermore, the movie already had enough action without it.
5.0~Better than the book but terrible chrystel-sinclair Sign in Permalink I am going to summarize my review: this movie was bad with tones of flaws. I don't know how many times my bf and I pointed out ridiculous mistakes and we aren't even the kind of people who watch movies in slow-mo to criticize and find errors. I am happy it took away all the bad stuff from the book (such as the stupid telepathy and the winning) and was amazed it didn't show any of the horrifying violence that the book has like throwing a fellow so he can be eaten by the grievers or the end where adults basically kill some kids. So compared the the book, I give it a 9... But as a movie, I give it a 5ish because, not more because of all the flaws. Now I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it either.
6.0~tgchan says YES / www.tgchan.pl tgchan Sign in Permalink Ratings: 6.8/10 from 243,820 users, not so bad. I am really curious about this one. I love films where the main characters are running and fighting for their life etc. The constant pressure makes it really interesting. Will I find it in this flick? Let's find out. 5 minutes - yuppie for bush-craft and survival~! 11 minutes - definitely interesting, but... so is any other film where a protagonist doesn't remember anything etc. 37 minutes - it's intense and you are not bored even for one minute 41 minutes - lame... nobody could do it for years... but he is special and somehow he managed to pull it off... once again LAME! 1h 39minutes - good news: the story explanation makes sense lol 1h 46minutes - what a bloody good idea for a sequel~! It was a decent film, I really want to see the sequel which is coming out this year: Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015). It looks like the second part should be definitely more interesting. tgchan's rating: 6 /10
8.0~Like a YA merging of 'LORD OF THE FLIES' and 'LOST'! Hellmant Sign in Permalink 'THE MAZE RUNNER': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another Young-Adult book adaptation; this one is based on the first novel (of the same name) in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi trilogy, by writer James Dashner. The film tells the story of a sixteen-year-old boy who wakes up in the center of a maze, inhabited by other teenage boys, and is surrounded by viscous mechanical monsters. It was directed by first-time feature filmmaker Wes Ball and written by first-time feature film writers Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers and T.S. Nowlin. The movie stars Dylan O'Brien (of TV's 'TEEN WOLF' fame), Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Aml Ameen, Blake Cooper, Kaya Scodelario and Will Poulter. I found it to be pretty entertaining, and well-made, for a YA movie! O'Brien plays Thomas; a sixteen-year-old kid who wakes up in an old elevator, in the middle of a grassy clearing, surrounded by other teenage boys. He has no memory of who he is, or how he got there, but he does remember his name, after getting in a fight with another boy (Poulter), the first night. He soon learns that all of the other boys awoke in a similar fashion and they've built a community there, which they call the Glade. He also finds out that 'the Glade' is at the center of a deadly maze, surrounded by vicious monsters. No one has ever made it out of there alive but designated 'runners' investigate the constantly changing maze everyday, before it's doors close at night. With the arrival of Thomas things start to change, for the better and worse, for the first time. The film is a little like a cross between 'LORD OF THE FLIES' and 'LOST'. It's of course not nearly as interesting, or thrilling, as either of those cult classics but it is kind of like a YA merging of them. For a movie based on a popular teen book it is pretty dark and suspenseful. The premise is engaging and the acting is all decent enough. The film is definitely not nearly as good as the best YA movies (like 'THE HUNGER GAMES' or 'DIVERGENT') but it is better than most. Hopefully the sequels (with bigger budgets) will be even better. I'll be there. Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/SWKktTowhSI
10.0~finally, an Asian male actor was in a leading role! Hunky Stud Sign in Permalink Asians have been living in the USA since 1800's, but there is very few Asian males in any leading roles in any of the Hollywood films. most of the time, they were hired for comical effects, or as gongfu fighters, etc. for that reason alone, i gave this film a 10. when the film first started, I thought that it was just another film about black and white people, I thought that the black actor will be the leader throughout the film. I was surprised that Lee Kihong (koreans are like Chinese, they put last name first.) was acting in most part of the film. although i have to say that the storyline may appear illogical in some areas, it is just very entertaining. I truly enjoyed it. It is rare that this film gave me an out of this world experience. i can't wait to see part two. Maybe someday someone will make a TV series for this film, who knows. It is kind of similar to the TV show - lost.
2.0~Below average action movie barker_dl Sign in Permalink I guess I'm kind of a traditionalist, because I like a story to build, including the part where you get to know the characters at least a little bit. I go into movies with an open mind and just let the movie unfold. I don't read reviews, although I come to IMDb to see the genres of movies and the rating. When I saw this had a 7 star rating I felt safe going to it. I'm guessing if you are a young child or a teenager this was interesting as this has all very young actors, which in itself isn't bad, but add that to a lack of story and no character development and I felt like walking out of the theatre about half way in, and the urge was growing the longer the movie went on. However I was there with my wife, we were in the a theatre with food service and I was enjoying the coke and popcorn, and I didn't want to bother my wife. People get stuck into a living area surrounded by maze, people find a way out in the end after battling some strange mechanical creatures, find out in the end of the movie they were put there as an experiment, and an obvious lead to a sequel as woman says next is phase 2. That's the spoiler. Oh I forgot, there was the character who was mostly an antagonist and the person who pushes to get out via the maze at all cost.
1.0~One thing only journeygr Sign in Permalink I have some questions. The soldiers picked them up with a helicopter. The maze had no roof. Why not pick them up by flying over the maze in the first place. Since they were the hope of humanity due to virus immunity, why put them in the middle of a maze, memory washed, in a daily danger and why sending the beasts to exterminate them at the end? Because they found a way out? Come on!!!! They should be treasured. Stupid movie no reason to existing full of plot holes.
6.0~Are we going to find our way out of this one? thekarmicnomad Sign in Permalink I was so looking forward to this. I am a big fan of old Sci-fi where strangers awake to find themselves in some unexplained and dangerous setting. I didn't really get what I expected. A big deal is made about the maze and the world they live in but in actuality it is really a side line to the story. This movie is definitely targeted at a young audience. It is dripping with teen angst and rebellion - you know? "I can go in the maze if I wanna! Your not my real dad anyway!" The actual puzzle of the maze is more Darwinian than cerebral and has got to be the worst method of testing ever devised. But maybe that's what its creators were after. Which brings us to the next point. This is a something-ilogy so don't expect any answers or resolutions for at least a few more years yet - this is getting a bit tiresome. Movie has good production, good acting, there is some action but the whole story feels a bit of a fraud. It would be a bit like having a Hunger Games movie where she hardly fought in the games -oh. Teens will love it (good for them) I found it a bit grating.
6.0~"Lord of the Flies," meet "Cube" mgruebel Sign in Permalink This is a pretty strong entry in the youth action genre (think "Hunger Games"), but the scriptwriters mess it up a bit at the end with unnecessary clichés. Like the much better mother of them all, the 1963 version of "The Lord of the Flies," the film presents us with boys building their own makeshift society on an island, this island being contained in a gigantic maze. Like the much better "Cube," the maze shifts around and is filled with deadly things. None of the young adults have any idea of how they got there, but the two most recent arrivals, a curious boy and a GIRL are stirring up a mess. The new arrival Thomas (they appear mysteriously every month through an elevator shaft) almost gets himself and the others killed by making forays into the maze that are forbidden by the law of this makeshift society. Eventually it becomes clear - big surprise! - that they are all just an experiment to train youth immune to a deadly virus to survive in the post-apocalyptic outside world, which supposedly will make the monsters in the maze look harmless. The ensemble cast does a good job at acting their way through a surprisingly linear plot, considering it takes place in a labyrinth. Our hero has as his foil a leader who wants to keep the status quo. The semi-mechanical monsters that stalk them are well executed. The maze may remind many of us of "labyrinth nightmares" we had as kids. The final explanation is a bit hokey, and features one of the most blatant setups for a sequel you are likely to see anytime soon. But then, perhaps the girl in this movie will serve a purpose in the sequel, other than just a girl being in the movie? I was ready to vote 7 at the beginning of the third act, but then they have the boys' leader, who blames hero Thomas for all the evils of the maze, show up out of nowhere at the end, the typical all-too-expected-unexpected-evil-guy. It really is an unexpected plot hole, as the maze shut itself dramatically after our heroes escaped, and there really is no explanation of how Mr. Leader rejoins the escapees. He does gratuitously kill the "fat boy" (a standard stereotype character in such movies) before they all get rescued and it is revealed that the true evil mastermind (perhaps she tortures our heroes out of necessity) is guiding them towards the sequel. So a 6 it is; worth a watch, but not a flick to come back to over and over again once its meager secrets have been revealed. It is however well enough acted, art-directed, directed, and scripted (save for that silly ending), that I'll probably check out the sequel. Kind of like the Star Wars prequels: not great, but good enough to make you curious what they are going to come up with next time. In the meantime, go see the 1963 "Lord of the Flies" if you want to see a good film about savage makeshift youth societies, or "Cube" if you want to see a good film about a relentless labyrinth out to get you.
4.0~Hunger Games? iguth Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is one of many young adult novel movie adaptations that plan the series before movie one. As far as these types of movies go however, this one is one of the better. The good part of the film is the time spent within the maze, luckily this is most of the film so it is totally watchable. While having character, the main group is very one dimensional and throughout there is never a moment when they are force to make a particularly hard moral decision. The beginning is the best part because the small society manufactured within the maze is interesting to learn about, however the rest of the film involving the outside world is very cookie-cutter.
9.0~Well made sci-fi mystery DarkVulcan29 Sign in Permalink I have not read the books, but I saw the movie, and it had me glued. It is trying to live to The Hunger Games. It is meant for the teens, but I'm not a teen, but I still liked it. If anybody likes an sci-fi like journey of wonder, then The Maze Runner is that movie for you. The set is awesome looking, looks mostly like a recycled set from the old Planet of the Apes films, but still awesome looking. The young actors really perform there roles really well, and not just playing there roles has annoyingly one noted. There are some action scenes, and good suspenseful moments. I also like the way the story slowly unfolds before your very eyes. The twists you just won't see coming. Also the effects are also good.
7.0~The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078 Tss5078 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner series really appealed to me and long before it was a movie, I read all four books. I was hoping that like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner would be a page for page telling of the story, but it wasn't and in fact several important elements crucial to the sequels were left out. The story begins with a boy named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) waking up in an elevator, surrounded by dozens of other boys. Thomas has no memory other than his name and quickly learns that none of the other boys do either. They are all trapped in the middle of a maze with no idea why or how to escape. This film was done well, but compared to the book, it is like a seventh graders book report. All the players are the same and the events are relatively the same, but all those little things that made this series so special and unique were left out. The film is just a simple story with some terrific special effects, but the book was really extraordinary and non-readers will never have any idea of just how good this movie could have been. Teen Wolf's Dylan O'Brien stars and really was the perfect choice to play Thomas. Unlike some of the other casting choices, O'Brien really seems to jump right from the pages to the screen in a defining role that almost seemed made for him. Thomas was the same in the movie as he was in the book, but he was the only one. It's very hard to be objective about this, because if I hadn't read the book, I still would have enjoyed the film, but realizing just how much of the story is missing really bothers me and skewed my review of the film. The story is unique, the special effects are great, and their some very good young actors here, I still highly recommend The Maze Runner, but if you are a reader and you enjoy Science Fiction, by all means read the book first.
5.0~Wasn't so aMAZEing midas-jacobs Sign in Permalink Maze Runner is about Thomas (Dylan O'Brien). In the beginning of the movie we see Thomas waking up while getting lift up by an elevator. When the elevator stops he sees that he is surrounded by a group of young guys. They are all standing in a circle of a forest like landscape, but this place is surrounded by a maze. To escape from the maze they send out these 'runners'. By day the runners go in to the maze and try to memorize the maze so they can find a way out. the guys don't send runners out by night because the maze closes then and there are these grievers. of course Thomas wants to be a runner and so the story starts. I have some questions about this movie that made the movie just stupid, so let me get them out of the way. First question( and probably the most asked one): Why didn' they climb on the vines? I know that Newt(Thomas Brodie-Sangster) said that the vines didn't reached to the top, but you could clearly see that they did. Or they could have at least build a ladder or something. My second question is maybe a bit dull but still, How do they get their hair gell? I even read on the trivia that Dylan O'Brien almost didn't get the roll just for his hairstyle, because there was to much gell in it. So why bother Dylan but let the rest of the guys keep their gell? My third question: How could they have mapped the maze if it changes every night? And now my biggest complaint: The ending!. It was just to much set up for the next movie and it didn't make sense, they also let someone die. The makers hope that you care about the person that dies but you really don't. I also have some move problems with this movie, but they are just small problems so I don't bother telling you. Now the directing. The directing of the movie was overall not to bad. Only the scene where Thomas gets attacked by one of the grievers for the first time you couldn't really see what was going on. This was due to the dark and by the shaky cam. This wasn't very tense, to not say it wasn't at all, because you just knew that Thomas would survive a night in the maze. But the fight scene between Thomas and Gally (Will Poulter) was well directed and tense. but this was one of the only tense moments of the movie. The special effects were good at times (the maze) but also bad (the grievers) and sometimes you could just see that they were standing in front of a green screen. the script of this movie wasn't that good it was just a bit dull, there were some good parts. This is why you just didn't care about the characters and why I didn't feel sad when someone was killed of. Due to the bad writing the jokes didn't also really work. But the overall plot was OK, just the ending. The acting was surprisingly good. Dylan O'Brien was likable as Thomas. And Will Poulter surprised me as Gally. Gally was this leader of the group guys before Thomas came. And Thomas didn't really follow the rules of Gally, which gave some chemistry between the characters. There was also this character Chuck, played by Blake Cooper. I didn't like his character at all. He was supposed to be the comic relieve. But he wasn't funny and I was annoyed by it. Blake Coopers acting wasn't so convincing. But overall the acting was good and I think that that was the best part of the movie. This movie isn't a total disaster and you won't get mad about it, just about the ending. I get why some people liked it and some people don't so go watch it and decide by yourself.
7.0~This movie could be better, but it's not disappointing asm130 Sign in Permalink Labyrinths, struggle for survivor, lack of information and sense of discovering are the major themes in this movie that could be better, but it'll not disappoint you. It' a journey to discover what's all about, because, you, as the spectator, know as much as the characters. Everything is unknown, but it has a shocking and unexpected end. In this movie, we see the fight of a bunch of kids trying to survive and to the purpose of the labyrinth they're living in. They organize as any good civilization could do, they establish rules and track the maze in order to get a way out. The Maze Runner tries to be as good as science-fiction stories, like The Cube, The Hypercube and Lost, but instead we have a "Hunger- Games-ish" ending. This is not a spoiler, but at the end you'll agree with me. Although The Maze Runner didn't disappoint me, I thought the movie could be a lot better, because there are certain things that diminish the importance of the actions in the plot: the tiny an uncomfortable laughs; and it looks like a Disney movie, but it has really aggressive moments. In the end, the film is OK, just one of the bunch. Maybe if it had other director, one that can impose the sense of darkness and unknown, the Maze Runner could have a serious recognition.
7.0~A Thrilling Dystopian Drama akash_sebastian Sign in Permalink 'The Maze Runner, based on the first part of James Dashner's young-adult post-apocalyptic sci-fi trilogy, is a good and interesting start to the series. It has enough thrills and twists to keep you intrigued and on-the-edge till the end. The cast, which is almost entirely filled with teenagers, has done quite a commendable job and help making the dystopian scenario quite believable. The plot may seem like one of those stories you've heard time and again, but it does have new and interesting things to offer. Since there are so many characters, their development is quite limited. Few of the answers regarding the plot are answered towards the end; maybe, the remaining answers are left for the sequels. I would have no issues if this becomes a big movie franchise like 'The Hunger Games' simply because it's much better than other big movie franchises of the past, like The Twilight Series.
6.0~Fast-paced character-driven tale that avoids being boring or predictable moviexclusive Sign in Permalink There has been a recent wave of movies adapted from Young Adult (YA) literature, containing similar settings and characters. Dystopian society – check (The Hunger Games and The Giver). Teenagers abandoned in a fight or die arena – check (The Hunger Games). Main character finds himself/herself thrown into a new world – check (The Mortal Instruments). With such tough competition, the Maze Runner is given a difficult task to move away from the rest of the YA movies and shine. On paper, The Maze Runner sounds similar to the hugely popular The Hunger Games series, where teenagers are sacrificed by the adult controllers, and thrown into an arena or maze without any assurance of survival. That said, the similarities end there. Instead of hunting each other down, the emphasis on cooperation and living in a cohesive society can be seen in The Maze Runner, which puts the movie in good stead of differentiating itself. Like the film's main lead, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), the audience is plunged into darkness as the film starts. Coupled with the shaky camera, flashing lights and clanking of machinery, the film attempts to make the audience feel Thomas' disorientation and fear, before the cage Thomas is trapped in comes to a grinding halt. Thomas is 'retrieved' from the cage by a group of hostile, rowdy boys, and is welcomed to the Glade by being thrown to another cage. Fans of the book might be disappointed as the film apparently departs a fair bit from the original. This writer has not read the original, and has no idea what the movie was about except for the information provided by the trailer. Being thrust into this new world like Thomas, it was admittedly hard to keep up with the terms used (e.g. "Grievers", "Gladers", etc.). However, the fast pace of the movie meant that what was lost through the quick dialogue and name-dropping was quickly learnt during the film (spoiler: Grievers are oversized mechanical spider-like creatures), as the series of events quickly familiarises the viewer with the world within the Glade. The society within the Glade was emphasised right at the start, with the typical characters to be expected for a film containing such a large number of men-boys. Alby (Aml Ameen) is the magnetic, de-facto leader, and first person to ever inhibit the Glade. Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) is second in command, who was thrown out of power when Gally (Will Poulter) usurps the power in the Glade. Lastly, there is also the protagonist's sidekick – Chuck (Blake Cooper). The actors were convincing in their roles but not outstanding, perhaps except for Newt. Brodie-Sangster's portrayal of Newt's weakness and lack of confidence as a new leader was commendable, especially when the character was first thrust into power and caught between Gally and Thomas. There is also character development, noticeably in Minho, shown to forsake his friends right at the start, and ends up saving Thomas eventually. O'Brien's protagonist is then, unexpectedly, the most predictable of the lot – the game-changing, hot-headed newcomer to the Glade. Thomas is central to the story right from the start, questioning conventions, being the only person Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) knows, and finally, leading the Gladers to conquer the maze. Without such a figure tearing apart social norms, the story would admittedly not progress and the movie would not reach its conclusion. However, this is no excuse for O'Brien's lack of emotions in the character. The only girl of the male-dominated Glade, Teresa, lacks screen time, but holds her ground whenever she is given the opportunity to, which is appreciated in a film overcrowded by male teenagers. Not to discount YA literature (this writer is a fan of YA fiction), but parts of the film does seem clichéd at times, with jokes targeted at a younger audience. Thankfully, the film's fast-moving plot and storyline does more than make up for this, leaving the audience at the edges of their seats, not knowing what will turn up at the next corner (literally and figuratively). Towards the end of the film, the film asks questions of which is a wiser choice – staying in familiar territory or exploring unchartered waters. While there are no prizes for guessing which option is the preferred one here, the more pertinent question is what lies beyond the maze, bringing into mind a quote from the Hunger Games, "there are worse games to play". The characters do not get to find out, and the end of the film also unabashedly advertises for its sequel, The Scorch Trials, which is currently in pre- production.
6.0~The Maze Runner is mediocre, but moderately entertaining Argemaluco Sign in Permalink I'm already tired of these poorly raised futuristic dystopias, which don't show any interest in genuine science fiction, and only work as the basis of trite teenage fantasies where the main characters always discover they are "the chosen one", or that they are "special" in some way. The Maze Runner is another one of those films, even though its good manufacture and competent performances make it worthy of a slight recommendation. Based on a series of novels written by James Mashner, The Maze Runner is kinda like Lord of the Flies with monsters, and with the obligatory sinister conspiracy as the background of its elementary narrative. There aren't many surprises or creativity; just the same formula as always, but executed with enough gravity and melodrama to keep the audience slightly interested (as "audience", I'm talking about embittered old men like me; but I don't pretend to guess the effect or acceptation this movie can have with the teenage audience it was obviously made for). As I previously said, the actors make a good work, bringing credibility to their clichéd characters of hero, villain, mentor, ally, etc. (Is there someone who didn't guess during the first 10 minutes who was eventually going to die in order to prove that "things are for serious"?). Despite its abundant logical holes, The Maze Runner develops a more or less interesting mystery, but when we finally reach to the explanations, they are absurd and excessively forced. In conclusion, I wasn't left very satisfied by The Maze Runner because of its lack of ingenuity, clichés and weak conclusion, but it managed to keep me moderately entertained because of its performances and Wes Ball's adequate direction. Besides, I have to say I found The Maze Runner superior to Divergent, Beautiful Creatures and The Hunger Games; I know that that isn't something very enthusiastic to say, but we can't demand too much from this kind of films.
7.0~Remember. Survive. Run. FandomFanatic21 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner, a film set in dystopian society where a disease (the flare) has broken out killing the majority of the human race. Until a group of people by the name of W.I.C.K.D rose up to find the cure, experimenting on young adults by setting up a small dome for them that consists of a maze they must go through to find their way out. The movie is a great appeal to teens and young adults and is great to watch with friends. The movie is great and keeps you in suspense and thrills. The Maze Runner has great acting from rising actors such as Dylan O' Brien and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. This movie is highly recommended and will be loved by those who are fans of The Hunger Games and Divergent. "Just follow me and run like your life depends on it. Because it does." -Minho, The Maze Runner
8.0~Exciting and stressful the-awesome-von-grimm Sign in Permalink I literally had no idea what to expect before I watched this movie. I haven't seen the trailer or anything, I just heard people say it's good or bad. The opinions were all different, actually. I thought it would be some kind of teen love story with the fantasy drama in the back but it wasn't any of that. This was a thrilling movie, almost horror-like, but with a magic and mysterious touch. I really liked this movie, even tho I'm claustrophobic and felt itchy and stressed every time somebody went in the maze. I recommend this movie to every horror/thriller lover, it's not a typical teen movie and there is no dramatic forbidden love story that destroys the excitement in the film.
8.0~Very Good ppramboeck Sign in Permalink I really like the movie. I think it's interesting, but it could not be any age at all. I am 12. I feel that it would be more interesting if it would be a series. I do not know. But it is very interesting.
10.0~amazing. andreaslordos Sign in Permalink They could not have made it any better.. Yes, one may argue that they missed out some key parts from the book like Teresa having a telepathic link with Thomas, or that in never rains in the maze.. But that's no big deal! (Anyway, in the movie, Thomas see's Theresa's warning through a dream, and after that warning there's not much to it.) The actors were excellent! Especially Thomas(Dylan O'Brien). The only thing that bugged me is that we didn't see much of Frypan, the cook. He has a slightly-above-average role in the books. The grievers were awesome They could've put more emphasis in how Thomas saves Alby by tying him up single handedly. 100/10
7.0~7.5/10 James_De_Bello Sign in Permalink One of the better surprises of this wonderful year. I went in this movie knowing absolutely nothing, as usual, and came out totally amazed at how much it actually managed to deliver. My expectations weren't the best from the buzz I had heard and this probably contributed to a very good time at the theater. There were lots and lots of elements in the movie that I was surprised to see executed in such a caring and detailed way. Firstly, visually the movie is pretty exciting. I'm not talking about Seamus-McGarvey-standard cinematography, even though the film actually is shot really well, but about set-pieces and world building. They all had an incredible coherence to them and served the movie perfectly. The whole maze was just amazing to look at. The visual impact of the movie also contributed to some really relentless tension scenes that had me genuinely on the edge of my seat. This movie truly had some stunning suspense in it and delivered it in every single scene it wanted to. The mystery story was also very involving and had me continuously trying to guess what was going on, plus it managed not to fall in some genre clichés and pull off a couple of interesting twists. Yet, as much as it managed to stay away from some major clichés it fell into others and by doing this it contributed to the emotional detachment the movie has. Indeed it is thrilling for the majority, but on a character involvement level it didn't really do anything special. The major negative I have with the movie has to do with the resolution of the whole mystery, even though there is a final twist I enjoyed the whole resolution really seemed weak to me. There are also some minor incoherences and shortcuts both in story development and how characters interact and talk, but they weren't too bothering. I could also have done with some better acting from the whole cast, but all in all nobody stuck out as a weak link. To sum it up I would definitely recommend this movie as theater viewing, It was really a great time and I am more than curious to see how the story goes on.
10.0~The Maze Runner layheng_chea Sign in Permalink This movie is interesting. This movie doesn't have romance nor comedy but it really attract me. The introduction really makes me want to watch and the rising action and the climax is the best part of it i can't move my eyes even a second from the screen. And Thomas is a very good actor he's very helpful even risk his own life for the life of his friends. Minho is also a good actor he knows a lot of the maze and he's very fast but at first he doesn't care about his friends and run for his own life. It's a a very good story and there's a very good moral in the story that Thomas says " if we die, at least we die trying better than dying a senseless death. This is an amazing movie i could watch a hundred more times but won't get bored. I'm really looking forward for the next series.
7.0~So many questions unanswered neil-476 Sign in Permalink Thomas regains consciousness in an industrial elevator which dumps him unceremoniously in The Glade, where he joins a group of other young lads, none of whom remembers anything except their name. Every month another member joins them: this has been going on for 3 years. The Glade is surrounded by vast walls in which a gate opens in the morning and closes at night: this leads into the Maze which surrounds the Glade. Some of the boys are Maze Runners, mapping the Maze, If they don't get back into the Glade by the time the doors close, they are killed by things called Grievers. Thomas proves to be a catalyst for change among the group, but this is not without its own difficulties. Not another young adult dystopia movie, I hear you ask? Or, more accurately, the first offering in a franchise? Well yes, but don't despair because this is not without its merits. It hits the ground running and never lets up, the youngsters involved are all pretty good (with Will Poulter outstanding), and the effects – the Maze and the Grievers – are very well realised. On the less positive side, I was quite happy with the film starting off as an action mystery, but I was less happy with the resolution – there are a LOT of unanswered questions at the end of this film, and the obvious set up for the next episode doesn't fully excuse the film for not answering some of them rather better than it does. But overall it remains an entertaining and eye-catching romp.
8.0~A very pleasant sort of sci-fi surprise Robert_duder Sign in Permalink If you follow my reviews, you'll know I watch pretty much everything. I take every opportunity to go to my local theatre and if I haven't seen then I'll see it. I figured if I got around to it, I would see The Maze Runner but I didn't end up getting around to it. I am a big fan of The Hunger Games but the other entries in this new genre of "teen fiction to big screen" have been underwhelming to me including Divergent, Beautiful Creatures, Twilight and so on. So my expectations going into this were average at best. Sometimes that helps because The Maze Runner ended up being an awesome thrill ride!! It is a terrific story, great moments of sci-fi and fantasy with a dash of Lord of The Flies mixed in there. It made me instantly become a fan of the series and moved seeing any sequels they release to the top of my "must see" list. Its not the type of film that will take home any awards but as far as sheer popcorn flick entertainment, this one sits pretty darn high. It had a few issues I thought but very well directed, great action, good story, strong main characters and it absolutely is a great start to keep you interested but it also stands on its own merits as well. You really don't feel like you're being left with a lot of unanswered questions although really we are. Relative newcomer (best known from MTV's Teen Wolf Series) Dylan O'Brien actually gives an incredible performance leading this cast. He proves, in my mind, that he could be the next "It" guy out there. I think he buries any performance by any young guy in the Twilight series. O'Brien has a great charisma and a certain leadership quality that works very well for this cast. The supporting cast for The Maze Runner is actually huge. Because you have this group of young boys all trapped together, you see a lot of faces but only a few stand out and get any sort of depth to their characters. Aml Ameen was very good as their leader Alby, Ki Hong Lee had a couple of very good scenes but he was a character I definitely wanted to see more from and I hope they use him more in sequels, Blake Cooper was very good as Chuck but his character was also a tad predictable, Thomas Brodie-Sangster was really great as second in command Newt (also hope to see a lot more from him in the sequels) and Will Poulter made a really great pseudo-villain/Bully. The most unfortunate part of this cast is the addition of the only female member of the cast (except for a very brief glimpse of Patricia Clarkson) Kaya Scodelario. Now I understand that especially in a film geared towards young adults that the addition of a female hero is necessary but Sodelario's character seems forced into the story for no other reason. She is left completely undeveloped, there is no romance per se and she's honestly pointless to the entire film. They could have easily left her out and it would have made no difference and made the film as interesting and less contrite. I am very impressed that this is Wes Ball's first full length feature film. However, he has also worked on art direction for years and it shows. The special effects and cinematography in this film is brilliant. I am amazed what they were able to do in a very reasonable budget given the type of film. Much like The Hunger Games, I felt like there was a definitive political message behind this film though its a little less "in your face" than The Hunger Games, its interesting enough to try and figure out what they're saying. You could easily compare this film to the TV Series Lost because many questions are posed and only some are answered but its a fantastic mystery with plenty of action and some scenes that are powerful and moving without being insanely inappropriate for its genre. I am so excited to watch this series continue and grow and I would absolutely watch this again anytime. If you love science fiction and you're tired of the same old...then you might want to give this an honest try!! 8/10
6.0~A good adaptation, but not a great movie cricketbat Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is good, not great. I understand why they made certain changes to the story, to make it play better on the screen, but other changes just seemed unnecessary. The young actors did pretty well, though, and the scale of the set was impressive. Also, much like the book, this movie can't stand on its own, so I look forward to see how they do the next installment.
8.0~The maze runner daleybarbaraa Sign in Permalink Having never read the books, seeing this movie makes me want to. The close calls have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more but hoping the bad things don't come to pass. There could have been a little bit more i feel, but since movies cant be completely adaptable from the books its understandable. I'm trying not to post spoilers but it is difficult. The main character is such a good actor having seen him before in other media, I am slightly familiar with his way of acting and i believe he did a good job and emulated his character very well on screen. His supporting actors and actresses also did a very good job, however i believe that some things that did happen in the movie were portrayed a little too obviously than it would have been in the book.
5.0~No clue how to adapt a book into a film FilmsForLife14 Sign in Permalink Before I start I need to bring up that I am not a fan of the book or the film. However there were aspects of the book that were good and the movie made a mess of them. For example, the book's characters were great. Gally was a great antagonist, but he became a whining bully who couldn't get his way with no notable qualities. Some fantastic scenes in the book were also altered in the wrong way or skipped completely. Alby's death in the novel was powerful and well written. In the film he is picked off like everyone else in the Glade, except he gets about ten seconds of "dying time". My final complaint is how the changes in the story line and time line opened up plot holes that didn't exist in the book. In the final act of the film and the final chapter of the novel Gally appears at the headquarters of The Glade. In the book he had been dragged off by a griever several days prior, so it made some sense. In the film Gally was still in The Glade when the other characters made their escape attempt. So how exactly did he get to the end without anyone noticing?. The only reason why I didn't rate this lower is because of the well done action.
2.0~Fantastic Book - Terrible Movie gonduras-46036 Sign in Permalink When a movie has been adapted from a book, I have to read the book first. I typically find the book to be much better since there is so much more room to expand. So, while reading The Maze Runner, I couldn't put it down. There were so many details and layers to the book that were so intriguing and exciting & I couldn't wait to see how the book had been adapted for the big screen. Let's just say I was very disappointed. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life. There were so many things about the book that I thought would be so cool to see brought to life - the grievers, the cliff & the griever hole to name a few. Everything was so wrong. The grievers were not at all what the book described. There was no cliff. The griever hole was a visible hole that you could walk right into. I wanted to see the Gladers figure out the griever hole, figure out how to get down there by having grievers chase them and fall off the cliff, etc. Then on top of all that, so much was out of order & just so incredibly different. Teresa didn't show up the day after Thomas (it was more like 2 or 3); the keeper meetings were public for everyone in the glade; there were no codes to punch into the computer to shut down the maze; Gally never got angry and left the meeting to run out into the maze & therefore when he turned up at the end, it was just all sorts of confusing; and then the biggest one in my mind - Teresa and Thomas didn't communicate telepathically (how that's going to work out in the next movie is beyond me!) & they had no chemistry. There were so many other things that were completely off, but I got to the point where I couldn't pay attention to the movie or take it seriously anymore because it seemed like such a joke. All in all, don't waste your time or money on this movie. If you want to get a good story, go pick up the book from the library, it won't disappoint like the movie version did. After seeing The Maze Runner, I doubt I waste my time watching The Scorch Trials.
6.0~Darker Better Version of Lord of the Flies thomas-w15 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner- Young-adult films in today's day and age have been pegged with the tagline of "Silly teen romance with silly life threatening situations on the side." The Maze Runner, as most can tell, is nothing like that. This movie has sort of a Lord of the Flies and Lost combo to it, making it a real breath of fresh air to the YA genre. The thing that made Lost so interesting was the questions the show posed. This film gives the same feeling to the audience members. Despite a bit of a lackluster ending and somewhat predictable plot, The Maze Runner combines strong acting, breathtaking CGI effects, and a refreshingly darker approach to the YA genre, to give the audience an wildly entertaining thrill ride for the whole film. I know a lot of people are huge fans of the book, but I have not read the book and therefore will not judge the movie with any comparisons relating to the original source material. From what I heard though, the film cuts out some scenes from the book, but still stays along the same line. All of the people that read the book that I have talked to, say they very much enjoyed the movie and cannot wait for the sequel. What I am mean by predictable plot is the common features that The Maze Runner's storyline shares with other films. The constant adversity he must overcome to be accepted as part of the group is the main one, but that is probably how it would happen so it is hard to judge that factor. The main problem that most people had with the film was the rushed ending where everything seemed to be happening too fast. The movie is obviously just setting up for a sequel. Still, it should not have to cram in so much information in the last eight minutes to do so. The film still keeps the Lost sort of feeling and leaves us still thinking towards the end which I tend to like, but others may not. When I was watching some of the action sequences in the film, I said to myself "Thank God they didn't make the action so lame so that it would be suitable for six year old to watch." I really stress when I say young-adult because the action was actually a lot darker and more gruesome than I thought it would be so I would advise you not to take your little kids to the movie. The action was actually something I appreciated because it was not afraid to hold back on the fighting. The action sequences were simply awesome. The CGI was also very well done. The amount of imagination that must have been put forth to achieve the look of the "never- ending" maze was astounding. They really had you going. It seemed like everything that was happening in the film was really taking place and that is the goal for all CGI. Another thing I was impressed with was the great acting across the board in the movie. Dylan O'Brien, who plays the curious and courageous Thomas, delivers a strong lead performance and easily the best performance of his career. Will Poulter, who plays the tough and kind of mean guy Gally, really showed that he is not a one-sided kind of character and possesses a lot of acting ability. I was skeptical of Will Poulter being the right man for The Maze Runner after seeing him play the goofy kid in We're the Millers. To my surprise, he managed to show he can play more than just one type of character. The rest of the cast were all well-casted in their roles and all did a fantastic job. As I said before, this is not the type of movie for little kids to watch. If you are age appropriate though, I recommend you see The Maze Runner while it is still in theaters.

7.0~The Maze Runner : review by a teenager alidel96 Sign in Permalink I saw this film on Monday and I enjoyed it. The storyline is interesting, even if it looks a bit like Hunger Games : the idea of young people stuck in a dangerous place. Fortunately, there are some differences so it's not upsetting to see. I like the futuristic atmosphere of the movie that we can see in the maze with the "Griffeurs" and also in the end when they left the place by helicopter, we saw a city completely buried by the sand. The scientist lady explained that there was a disease that killed most of the population of the world but the young people that they put in the maze had the ability to resist this disease, so the scientists wanted to watch them. I think it's a good plot. But a few scenes are a little predictable. For example, when Thomas (the leading character) entered at the last moment in the maze trying to save Abby. However, I spent a funny moment and I can't wait to see the second film. I recommend it to everybody.
7.0~A story well captivating and darkly detailed..... parthanandi2011 Sign in Permalink The movie banked in with such a lead that most of us would die to see what Dylan aka Styles do in this novel depiction..Believe me the confused confident curious attitude of our teen wolf Star , worked here too... Glade was a Habitable place, created in the middle of a evershifting Maze inhabited by mysterious(never seen) creatures. group of teens struggling to survive inside the glades, met a disoriented Thomas who , ever since his visit, starts u...nveilling the secrets of the maze with the help of Runners...To add up the complication a girl named teresa was sent as the last one...From there how they embark upon the journey to freed themselves is what Maze Runner All about....Teen oriented movie with a teen starcast, gave a performance so good and observable that The movie will survive the Box Office... Good Points: 1)A fresh starcast , with some brilliant performances 2)A story which was well captivating and grippy, at no point it was loose, from the first scene it will hold you back and will keep you surprising till the end...and is refreshingly dark....Much better than the book....It seemed more detailed... 3)The set was the best part, what a creation 4)Cinematography well carried out 5)Sound effects were perfect and gave the movie that extra punch... Bad Points: 1) The end was abrupt It's a watchable trade......After a long time , a performance based movie from Hollywood...
8.0~Underrated and Interesting SquigglyCrunch Sign in Permalink I've never read the books, but I found this on Netflix and thought I'd check it out. The ratings were decent (when it came out), so I thought "What the hey? I got nothing better to do". I was actually surprised to find it very interesting. The idea, first of all, is cool. The maze, the glade, the fact that there are only teenage boys, surviving together in a massive cube. It's different, and different is good in today's world of cinema. The creatures, known as Grievers, are very well designed and unique, despite not being the most attractive in monster history, they're different. And once again, different is good. The characters are all fine and dandy. Sure, they aren't delved into as completely as they could have been, but that's why we need a sequel right? To make it feel like an actual story that takes place over a long period of time, over something quickly and sloppily put together and then farted out into theaters in the hopes of making a bit of cash during the opening weekend. It feels like the story is going to keep going, which brings me to my next point... The ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the Maze Runner sets itself up for a sequel. Unlike movies based off book series (like The Giver) that hastily solve the main conflict at the end and explain everything because they know that their movie sucks but that they'll make money on hype anyways, the Maze Runner is confident that it'll be a series that will continue, and thus keeps the viewer in suspense at the end, having only revealed a bit more about the mystery surrounding the maze, but still ending with a cliffhanger that leaves you confused but eager to see more. Overall The Maze Runner is a solid addition to the children-killing- each-other-for-the-benefit-of-some-weird-twisted-adults genre that has become more popular today. It's probably the best of this genre (thus far, at least), in my opinion. Other series, like the Hunger Games, just weren't interesting and lacked the mystery and intensity that the Maze Runner captures so well. I can certainly see the Scorch Trials coming out in the near future (it already has, and I've seen it), and am certainly interested in it. If your looking to start an intriguing movie series, then look no further then the Maze Runner.
7.0~A Very Enjoyable Action Sci-Fi Fantasy dfa120374 Sign in Permalink I never really paid much attention until I saw the trailers for it, but from what I saw in them, The Maze Runner lived up to all expectations and it was a really enjoyable Sci-Fi Fantasy for me. I never knew that this was based on a book either and if this lives up to the usual routine of books typically being better than their movie adaptations then it must be a cracker of a read. It may not be the most original idea for a story i.e. the human "rats in a maze" experiment, but at least it's a film that concentrates on putting together a good plot rather than just being self-reliant on visual & special effects. Sometimes it just seems that too many movies these days rely heavily on visual & special effects to dazzle the audience while forgetting about the story (Pacific Rim, for example). Thankfully that's not the case here. Don't get me wrong...the visuals are amazing and they definitely help bring the film to life. It's just that the effects are more of a very nicely added bonus to a well written plot. With these elements combined, the film delivers a very nice amount of action, tension & suspense....the majority of which come from within the maze obviously. The maze itself is VERY imposing, and when you throw in the Grievers as well (sort of guardians of the maze), it's a place where you definitely wouldn't want to be. Another area that wasn't ignored was the choices for the individual members of the cast, who all played their parts really well, and, thankfully, it wasn't a stereotypical cast of all young buff, good looking guys who couldn't act to save themselves (such as Twilight). They were all "normal" looking actors and they all played their parts with a decent amount of believability. The Maze Runner is not an absolute classic by any means, but it is well filmed, well acted, well told, and is definitely a very enjoyable film.
8.0~More than I expected eseviour Sign in Permalink Firstly, I wish everyone would stop saying "it's not the hunger games". It's not supposed to be. This is adapted from a fantastic book, and is definitely in my top 5 (probably top 3) movies of 2014. If you actually try to get past the obvious, yes they're in a maze, yes they've been there for 3 years, no they don't have a way out yet, you might actually find a really great movie. Admittedly the book is better, but that doesn't mean you should overlook the movie. If you're looking for a character you can latch on, follow, feel the important things in life with, Thomas is it. This movie will ask you to question everything about who you are and what you really believe if you let it. And you should... It's one hell of a ride!
8.0~Better than reviewed benjomansfield Sign in Permalink Recently this film has gotten a bit of strife from critics for mimicking the Hunger Games, and having an unconvincing and predictable plot line. In the interest of keeping the seats lined, I would like to correct some of these critiques. While the plot is relatively predictable, it certainly does not leave audiences feel as though it is lacking credibility and captivation. The back story is not essential to this movie, which I might add is the first of three, and will surly come in later films, until then the lack of details is one of the strongest things keeping audiences on the edges of their seats. The screenplay is phenomenally written, as can be expected from the Harvard magna cum laude graduate Noah Oppenheim, however in agreement with other reviews, the acting is a little forced and appears to be improbable at some key decisions which can be attributed to the novice director Wes Ball. Suggesting not to see The Maze Runner for its minor problems is just as critiquing The Godfather for Sonny's magically repairing windscreen. Overall the plot is intriguing and the film is one that keeps you coming back for the next installment, try to get out to see it on the big screen, highly recommended.
7.0~Captures the intriguing premise and spirit of the book despite missing character depth Movie_Muse_Reviews Sign in Permalink Young adult sci-fi adaptations have run rampant since "The Hunger Games," and "The Maze Runner" is the latest attempt to copy that model and hook the same audience. James Dashner's tale of young boys trapped in a glade surrounded by a giant maze is much simpler than "Hunger Games," so while it can't achieve anywhere near the kind of character depth, it certainly has a chance to be as entertaining. Viewers are advised to look to "Maze Runner" for a fun, sci-fi themed, mystery-driven movie. Director Wes Ball gets the most out of it in this sense; he knows how to use the camera to add intensity to a story. He will undoubtedly go on to make more good action movies. As for building the emotional connection, however, it's almost entirely absent, though a lot of this can be attributed to the script, which favors plot points over character-building moments. To be fair, there's a lot of explaining required in "Maze Runner" as with much of the futuristic sci-fi bestsellers. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) awakens in an elevator shaft that takes him to the Glade, where he's greeted by an entire village of boys who live surrounded by a mysterious maze. All of them arrived just as he did, with no knowledge of anything that happened to them before they got there, but they believe they need to find a way out. Especially curious, Thomas starts a chain reaction of events that lead to some answers. Although Thomas spends a lot of screen time with each of the boys he meets in the Glade – including Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster of "Game of Thrones"), Gally (Will Poulter), Alby (Aml Ameen), Chuck (Blake Cooper), Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and eventually a girl, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), whose arrival really shakes things up – they mostly talk about the plot together, or explain things to the audience about the maze or any of the mysteries surrounding it. The few character-building moments are really wedged in. O'Brien is perfectly likable as Thomas, as are most of the others, but "Maze Runner" clearly leans on its premise and entertainment value. That's okay, because it has enough of an intriguing mystery, enough creative art direction and enough of a dark and creepy factor to pass muster with folks over the age of 18. Those who haven't read the entire series will likely find a less-than-satisfying ending, but these stories are written in threes these days (with the third part split in half, of course). Fans of the books will be a bit surprised by some of the changes, but ultimately should feel the story stays true to the spirit of Dashner's books. Thanks for reading!

6.0~VIEWS ON FILM review of The Maze Runner burlesonjesse5 Sign in Permalink Less than a half hour into 2014's The Maze Runner (my first review of the fall season), the character of Alby (Aml Ameen) says to the main character of Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), "you're not like the others, you're curious". Absotively boss! Absotively! That's the central theme about what's going on here. A confused young gent is catapulted into a dystopian future and unbeknownst to everybody else, wants to change things and break the cycle. Now in all fairness, I hadn't read the series of original books by which this flick is based upon. But as I diligently watched what inhabited the screen, I realized that it reminded me of so many other films that I threatened to make a list. Here's a few that I remember: "Runner" seemed reminiscent of 1990's Lord of the Flies (themes of savagery and the forming of a tribal society), Cabin in the Woods (the whole behind the scenes feel where governmental workers at a hidden station, are manipulating everything and everyone through the use of hidden cameras), 1997's Starship Troopers (there are bugs in a large maze that kill people and they're similar to the ones in Troopers), and 1997's Cube (all the characters wake up in an unknown place, don't know each other, and must find their way out of evil, deadly traps and such). Now am I condemning "Runner" because of these factoids? Not really. This ultimately wasn't the reason for my condensed, two and half star review. Featuring cinematography that has the look of a 90's Pink Floyd music video and filmed primarily in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, The Maze Runner begins with young Thomas aka "Greenie" (played Dylan O'Brien). As the proceedings first come to light, he's traveling upward in a rundown elevator that ends up surfacing towards a grassy field (with a huge corridor-like structure wrapped around it). When this elevator stops, he finds himself taken in by a bunch of other teenagers. They let him know that he's trapped (along with them) in a location (the Glade) which harbors no escape of any kind. I mean, there is a way to get out, but it involves hightailing through an enormous maze where at night, evil bug- like creatures (I think they're called Grievers) can feast on you. Things to look out for in "Runner": 1. There is less focus on the intricacies of the maze and more on the laughable law and order tactics mitigated by the budding young adults. 2. The movie doesn't really have any twists and turns and when it does, it's fully transparent. 3. Characters enter the dystopian world only knowing their name and nothing else about their past. Talk about anesthesia gone afoul. Bottom line: The Maze Runner is well edited by Dan Zimmerman, scripted in a mumbo-jumbo sort of way by three writers, and crisply directed by Wes Ball (he helmed the Short, A Work in Progress). The storytelling is mostly straightforward and "Runner's" running time (ha ha) glides by for most of the way. However, it's not quite compelling when it should be. Why? My money is on the young actors who come off as novices with the sort of heavy-handed PG-13 material. The tone at which these actors are gauging, is rather muted at best (not to mention low key) and as a result, they can't sell scenes that are pivotal to us, the audience. It's not entirely their fault though because there are times when The Maze Runner itself, can't sell us on its foregone conclusion. Case in point: when the lead player (Dylan O'Brien) goes through the maze, comes out of it all shaken up, and lets everyone know that he might have found a way out, we as involved moviegoers aren't quite convinced. I mean, this dude finds an opening where a wall is raised and deadly, menacing creatures come charging out of it. How in the heck is that a way out? You tell me. As for O'Brien himself in the role of Thomas, well he's got movie star looks (he kinda resembles a young Rob Lowe) and a so-so screen presence. But to be honest, he's about as bland as lentil soup. He's definitely not ready to carry a big studio film just yet. Overall, I'm gonna give The Maze Runner a mixed review because although it didn't blow my mind, it still sort of held my interest in a mild, time-killing sort of way. Believe me, this isn't an awful vehicle but it's not something you'd totally "run" to see. Of note: (spoiler alerts) I disliked the way this movie ended immensely. And what threw me for a loop was how it sort of left the window open for a sequel. I mean seriously, what's next? Are these poor kids gonna get dropped into another maze, with enough safe space to build another life, and with possibly a different order and form of governorship? Like I mentioned earlier, I've never read the book (or books) that The Maze Runner is based upon so maybe I'm not getting the gist of what's going on here. Regardless, my questions are as follows: what society allows scientists to manipulate kids like this? Where are their parents? Why are the young guinea pigs all boys with the exception of one girl? I mean, this flick treats the underage like furry rats in a cage. As the credits rolled, I figured that if "Runner" were to make money, there would probably be a new installment in a couple of years or so. In the end I thought to myself, "what's the darn point anyway?"
4.0~Misleading Trailer Makes You Expect billyboi21 Sign in Permalink Gave it a 4 because the trailer presented a completely different idea than that of the actual story of the film. You would think in the trailer that the story would revolve around the maze and how there kids would find their way around it or surpass obstacles and stuff. But I felt like the story actually revolved around the camp where they were trapped and how they can find their way out through the maze only to find out they were part of some experiment to prepare them on a fight against some alien invasion of some sort. The story lacked direction in the plot. I think there has been too many insertion of unnecessary scened especially at end of the film where it felt like there were just squeezed in there together to make some sort of a lame twist. Oh, and the cliffhanger, ugh....
3.0~Hardly aMAZEd thesar-2 Sign in Permalink While I was happy to finally see a male-oriented film series – and yeah, even before the last half hour of "To Be Continued!" scenes – in a female dominated marketplace (the Twilight "saga," The Hunger Games and Divergent) this movie all-but completely blew. Aside from The Maze Runner being a blatant rip-off of the superior Cube film, or its sequels, it was so incredibly bland, run-of-the- mill, predictable and A-B-C, I actually fell asleep during the movie. It didn't help that the movie was twenty minutes too long and that I knew what scene would take place four scenes ahead. During the movie I was absolutely giving it the benefit of the doubt. Without so much as telling us this was "Part One" of a trilogy (or four movies, depending on how well the first one does and they inevitably split the last movie into two so they can milk the series our longer than it needs, i.e. The Hunger Games, Harry Potter and Twilight,) the movie seemed to take its long time to explain everything out in extreme detail of their world. I was trying to be as patient as possible when I knew this was a necessity since this is a sci-fi, futuristic test for young boys. But, the rest of the movie played out this way. As if in narration form. They constantly had to tell us and remind us of the world they're referring to in the very movie they're showing us. I get it. I got it. And unfortunately, they we're showing me anything new. So, I waited and waited for something fresh. Some new take. Nope. And worse, as mentioned above, the last half-hour was NOTHING but setting up the inevitable sequels. I am getting ahead of myself since I haven't mentioned the synopsis. Very basically, once a month, a new young male recruit is transported into the middle of an obscenely large maze. He has memory loss and must have the entire plot be explained to him so he can integrate with the other males. They've been there between 3 years and present day and must make it through a hefty and unexplainably moving maze to get back to where they don't remember they've come from. Naturally, our "hero," Thomas, is THE ONE to help them get free. With little explanation and in one of the most pointless plots of recent movies, he joins forces with one of the most uncharismatic of all females – the first girl to join the group. Hilariously enough, she looks incredibly similar to Kristen Stewart of her Twilight series. Just like Bella, Stewart's bland heroine from Twilight, this one offers nothing to the table and is so hard to root for. In fact, it appears this endless rock-throwing female was only introduced to attract more female viewers. And that is a huge part of the problems here. While, again, I am glad to finally see a male-dominated teeny-bop series, not one single character had the charisma of any of the other series. Yeah, I'm not a huge Harry Potter or Hunger Games fan, but each of those had characters I rooted for and wanted to see succeed. This Maze Runner had one, and he was absolutely a second or third tier fella: Chuck. But, then again, if you've seen The Sandlot, he was the same guy who called that main character "Smalls." With virtually no one to root for, a story as old as time, decent special effects but barely used and predictable scenes from beginning to no-conclusion, this movie is highly UN-recommended. Granted, it's not the worst movie I've seen in a long while and definitely not the worst of 2014 so far, it will be so forgettable, they will be regretting they only made this movie to be part of a trilogy that should never be completed. * * * Final thoughts: If you're thinking of beginning this so-so franchise, either do one of two things: Wait for this to all come to home- viewing and have a boring, nothing weekend to get through them all or just rent/buy/stream the superior Cube series. Essentially, they're the same movie, but Cube had a tenth of the budget with ten times the heart, originality, imagination, suspense and characters than The Maze Runner had at any given moment.
5.0~If you ain't scared you ain't human. amour88 Sign in Permalink I have not read this book so this is totally based on the movie. I quite like dtytopian movies however this one was quite disappointing. I never really cared about the characters or felt a connection to them. The "reveal" was lame. The acting was pretty good though. It's not horrible it's just not very good. Some of the fight scenes needed some editing,it was all over the place. You had no idea what was going on! I felt like they showed us too much too soon,I would have liked to have some of the info later in the film,kind of took some of the mystery away. The maze scenes were exciting though,I'll give them that.
5.0~Yet another made-for-kids drama... grantss Sign in Permalink Yet another made-for-kids drama... Boy wakes up and finds himself in a "tribe" of boys, locked behind high walls. Only way out is through a huge maze which is guarded by giant spiders. Before even thinking of escaping, there is an internal power struggle to deal with... The movie has a mildly interesting plot setup - the maze - but beyond that it is fairly dull, derivative and dumbed down for kids. Pretty much Lord of the Flies meets Starship Troopers, though far less gritty. Basic plot, conventional direction. Has its moments of genuine intrigue and tension, but those are few and far between. Only surprising thing about this movie is that it doesn't star Shailene Woodley and/or Miles Teller... Then, worst of all, it doesn't really end - the whole thing is set- up for sequel. So pretty much the same prolonged, anything-to- deprive-clueless-teens-of-their-dollars bs as with The Hunger Games. On that note, that's about the best thing I can say about this movie - at least it's better than The Hunger Games, though it doesn't take much. Shorter movie, and less Disney-like. Also not a blatant rip- off of Battle Royale...
6.0~"The Runner Without a Maze" FallsDownz Sign in Permalink Well another movie that based upon another best-selling novel , it seems that Hollywood are full of this kind of movie now days such as Beautiful Creatures , Mortal Instrument , I Am Number Four or even The Hunger Games . The Problem is yes some of this type of movie works but much more of it fails to deliver for example Beautiful Creatures that actually has an interesting idea but the way it tell the story is just not working when it on the screen and it's pretty much failed. I have to say that i haven't read the book before so this review will come from my experience entirely on the movie (Even though i know before go to see it that it actually has a sequel) . The Maze Runner is a movie that's actually has an interesting idea like others Bases upon Novel movies , It talks about Thomas who trapped in this Huge Maze and they has to find the way out of this Maze. So the idea of unique and complicated Maze is there but the problem with this movie is it's has a really bad mindset of which way it's going to go , it's like the movie know that it have to have another sequel so they focus and spend a lot of time to set-up the sequel and that's okay but the problem is when they focus too much and spend too much time on set-up the sequel , they actually forget to spend time in this movie as well which mean everything in this movie feel rush and half-ass instantly , everything just come and goes really quickly without you really knowing why and that's not only affect on the story telling it also affect everything in this movie. Such as the characters that feels rush and you just barely even know anyone at all you maybe remember 3 or 4 characters but that's actually it , meanwhile when other characters dies you will just like "who the hell is that" and the main character Thomas even call their name which makes me think " Exactly when did they even talk to each other ?" . Another Hugh Problem with this movie is the main reason behind all of this event that happen in the movie is just "Absurd" i'm not sure when you read the book you maybe can understand and get that but when it actually on the movie it's just feels so over the top non-sense and when you top that up with rushing storytelling it become even worst. Even though the movie has a pretty good chasing/running scene that pretty exciting and the leading actor Dylan O'Brien doing pretty good job , it's just not enough to make up for really rushing storytelling that just ruined everything in the movie especially The Maze that feels nothing like a Maze it's has no complicated and mystery what so ever in the last 30 minutes of the movie you will even see the characters just walk in and out like shopping mall this is by far the most unforgiving thing in this movie , if your movie call "The Maze Runner" make sure you make the Maze actually a Maze not just some hallway stuff that have no unique to each area and boring as much as possible. When i'm reviewing this it's actually announced that this movie will have at least another sequel coming 2015 and that's makes me concern , i have to say that The Maze Runner have a HUGE potential but it just failed really hard to deliver because of how much they rush the storytelling to set-up another sequel , i hope they will spend more time on next one and actually make it works or else it will fall to the same problem over and over again.
6.0~Entertaining movie... Thanos_Karagioras Sign in Permalink "The Maze Runner" is a Mystery movie in which we watch a group of boys who have made a small community in order to survive because they are all trapped into a maze. Although everything changes when a newcomer motivate them to try to escape from this. I liked this movie and I found it really interesting mainly because of the plot. This movie has a lot of action scenes and much of suspense which is something that makes it even more entertaining. The direction which made by Wes Ball was very good who combined the story plot with action scenes without making this movie boring. In addition to this it has to be mentioned that it was not boring because of the very good twists which was included in the script. I liked the interpretations of Ki Hong Lee who played as Minho and Dylan O'Brien who played as Thomas. Finally I have to say that "The Maze Runner" is an interesting movie to watch because you will not be bored. Also if you want to watch a movie in your spare time then this is the movie the you have to do.
5.0~Unfortunately not as good as the Book adrianheinrich1987 Sign in Permalink I have read the book prior to the film and I am fully aware, that one should not compare the book to the film. Yet, the comparison between the plot and the characters between the movie and the book are compatible to that of an orange and an apple. While I myself did not find the book as beautifully written, James Dashner sure knows how to plot his story. The Maze Runner is about Thomas, a teenage boy who awakens in a Idyll Place surrounded by the mysterious maze. Together with the other trapped boys he needs to find a way out of their prison and who is responsible for all things happening around them. The whole game changes, when Theresa, a girl who seems to know Thomas, appears. While Thomas solves the mystery layer by layer in the book, in the film, the answer is often presented to him. I found this very irritating and it got to the point, where I felt really bored at some times. Furthermore, while we get to know the characters in the book better, we start to feel for the characters more and more which is not the case in the film. Especially the character of Minho, played in the film by Ki Hong Lee, fell to short in my opinion. Overall, the changes made for the film, made me realize, that it contained major plot holes. Especially the ending was very disappointing, which I found extremely thrilling in the book. The Filmmaking itself, was not my taste at all. Shaky Camera, to fast editing, frame composition did not work out for me. At times it felt like the early days of digital films. To conclude this review, I think it is not worth watching, I would rather read it, the plot stays thrilling that way.
7.0~An Impressive Adaption edtheiii Sign in Permalink To start, I am a member of the target audience (although I hope an objective one). I read The Maze Runner a few years before the movie came out, and then re-read it in January when I heard about the big-screen adaption. This formula has gotten pretty standard to me, having gone through the same ordeal with The Golden Compass, Eragon, Percy Jackson, and The Hunger Games. As a book-reader, I have learned to be disappointed with movies (as only those who had to sit through the horrors of Eragon would know). Frankly, The Maze Runner is probably my least favorite book of the lot. Not that I dislike it; I'm just well aware of its faults - mostly lying within an illogical narrative. So, needless to say, after I entered the movie theater, I was prepared for a flop. I did not get one. I knew the movie did not have a very large budget, and since the young director, Wes Ball, came from a CGI background, I was worried that all of the money would be spent on such things, leaving little for the acting. It turns out they didn't need to spend anything on actors, as the cast did an exceptional job. Brodie-Sangster as 'Newt' did exceptional work, and I look forward to seeing him play a role in future sequels. Maybe Ball's young age helped him connect with young actors. What Ball really managed to do well was eliminate most of the unnecessary aspects of the book, only keeping those plot points that are relevant to the upcoming sequels. Obviously, the core premise of the book stayed, but many minor details were changed in a good way. Almost every change he made makes sense to me, and the movie had a much better flow than the book did. If I had to complain about Ball's directing decisions, a few points come to mind. The first is that the movie suffered from the same issue as the book, that is, a poor conclusion. It comes abruptly and bluntly, and is almost entirely exposition for the next film. I can think of many ways Ball could have changed the book ending and still kept the series alive, but I think he didn't want to stray too far from the book when it comes to setting up sequels. It's a safe play, but not the right one. The other issue is the downgraded roll of Teresa (the girl that is sent to the maze). I understand why certain details of her character were removed for the movie adaption, but what was left over is essentially a token girl character. And for a movie that seems so worried about setting up its sequel, not developing this specific character could be troublesome. Speaking of sequels, I personally didn't find them as enthralling as the original in the series, i.e. The Maze Runner; so I hope going forward that Ball isn't afraid to deviate from the novels and flesh out some of the narrative a bit better than James Dashner (original author) did. I would argue that this is a better movie than The Hunger Games - which suffered more from the original director, and it does more than enough to satisfy readers of the book. Hopefully its sequel does as much for the series as Catching Fire did for its. When the movie is over, you're left with an impressive show of acting, strong action scenes, and hopes for a titillating sequel. Hopefully those sequels are worth the poor ending in this movie.
6.0~Not Bad seeramuun5 Sign in Permalink It was a very cliché film. The ability to adapt the kit has reduced this feature. It was not excessive, but it was stereotypical. Apart from this, it seemed that the subjects that progressed more slowly in the book progressed rapidly. They put on a constant voltage until the end. If the cliché scenes were too much, the movie would have been averaged. I do not like the players. Excessive logic fills up. Apart from this, the world created is a movie that can be watched and watched without boredom. The characters were simple. Even the character is wrong. Typecasting.
7.0~Nothing special about the movie!! Waiting for the Sequel!!!! rajatdahiyax Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is a 2014 American science fiction dystopian action thriller film directed by Wes Ball, based on James Dashner's 2009 novel of the same name. The film is the first installment in The Maze Runner film series and was produced by Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Wyck Godfrey, Marty Bowen, and Lee Stollman with a screenplay by Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers, and T.S. Nowlin. The film stars Dylan O'Brien, Aml Ameen, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Will Poulter, and Ki Hong Lee. The story follows sixteen-year-old Thomas, portrayed by O'Brien, who awakens in a rusty elevator with no memory of who he is, only to learn he's been delivered to the middle of an intricate maze, along with a slew of other boys, who have been trying to find their way out of the ever-changing labyrinth – all while establishing a functioning society in what they call the Glade. A sequel, entitled The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials, is set to be released on September 18, 2015
9.0~Simple story, set and character but amazing udehnans Sign in Permalink I liked the story in this film that makes the audience go in the maze area. The story is simple and the location makes this movie worth watching, though performed with simplicity but full of good players and the major players supporting players deliver excellent quality acting. I was impressed with the story that is not easy to guess, katakter unique and natural acting from his players. When watching a scene in this movie I really felt there in the movie, was incredible. I recommend to anyone who wants entertainment with a moderate level, then this movie will fit for you. I hope there will be a continuation of this movie because if you watch this film will be intrigued by the story of the beginning and end of the story there. Oh yes, you can bring your family to watch this movie because it is still included for teenage group. Enjoy.

6.0~Mixed feelings. tmaranhao Sign in Permalink So, I went to watch this movie twice at the theatre. Surprisingly, after enjoying it the first time, I left the second time with mixed emotions. I genuinely enjoyed it the first time (obviously why I went again when I was offered), it was suspenseful and interesting. I loved that the protagonist was a male, and the whole maze concept was intriguing. After the second time, I realized a lot of problems with the film and why I was disappointed. A good movie should never leave you with as many questions as this one did! The main character, Thomas, is a "hero" but really is not...he is part of WCKD and now he is with the kids they tested on? The only girl in the movie, Teresa, is weak and boring (she reminds me of Bella in Twilight). Why is she the only girl?! It never explains the note. Why does everything go wrong when Thomas comes? The only character that I have a connection to is Chuck, barely. There needs to be an emotional investment with the main characters. Speaking of main characters, I felt like they should have made more of the other guys more important. I have so many questions about this whole world and system and I was so mad that they barely answered them. I don't mean to attack the film, I just feel like this could have been a much stronger franchise, unfortunately it is not going to be unless they fix it in scorch trials.
5.0~Very little to do with maze running. duncan-gordon11 Sign in Permalink Agree with Mek Torres but rate this movie 5. Everything seemed rushed - character development, plot development, and final conflict. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Running Man did better with its title. As there is going to be a sequel, time isn't an issue. Definitely a movie for the younger gen. Simple, self explanatory, all questions answered immediately. Take a lesson from Cabin in the Woods and Aliens as far as suspense and baddies go. Having not watched The Hunger Games, I imagine this soon to be movie franchise will be similar. A darker version of Robin Williams' 'Hook' springs to mind with the never never boys in never never land.
2.0~A good idea turned into a 'mazed' movie alexander-rinderer Sign in Permalink Maybe I expect too much or I'm too old to understand these new kind of movies based on the concept of LOST. However I have the overwhelming impression that it helps not thinking too much when watching these kind of 'somebody is somewhere but nobody knows why and what is going to happen because nobody has a clue and there is something who kills them but again nobody has an idea why but least constantly there happens something illogical and that seems to be the plot of suspense' movies. Lord help me, I bought the movie and really do regret the decision. At least I only spent CHF 22.00. If I think of what could have been done with the USD 34 Mio. the movies cost... Attack of the killer tomatoes was much cheaper... or Amazon women on the moon... or Plan nine from outer space... I simply can't understand on what the 34 Mio. were spent if there are such plot holes...
6.0~Story leaks at many crucial points chrisei Sign in Permalink Just came home from watching this at the local cinema - i didn't expect much and didn't get disappointed...(sarcasm). /Spoiler but can read imo (if you watched the trailer you can read on imo): The story leaks , lie the "boys" have plenty of wood and ropes to built houses but aren't smart enough to use the same things to build a latter in 3 years - o cmon..(!) They only think about climbing up the plants growing on the wall but thats pointless "because the plants don't grow high enough..." Also what i didn like was that you see a group of boys and all are acting like adults - like they are imitating adult behaviour which makes the whole interactions sometimes pretty ridicoulosley unrealistic. Also the"rules" the group invented are plain stupid imo (and that one guy defending them by saying "the labyrinth is our home - stop talking about the outher world - i mean how unreal is that (and all that with only one girl available to a group of 50 boys ?! - yea great life if ur gay...) /Spoiler Summa summarum - i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody alltough the idea isn't that bad - 6/10
5.0~An ultimately hollow experience, which seems to solely serve as a conveyor for future entries in the series drjones0 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner' is the latest studio adaptation of a teen novel turned epic movie series. The film begins with Thomas, waking up in a foreign zone known as the 'Glade'. The Glade is a zone governed by a bunch of young men, entombed within a maze full of deadly, spider- like creatures known as 'Grievers'. Thomas struggles to remember who he is, or how he got there – apparently a common situation for the young men whom find themselves trapped within this mysterious zone. The 'Lord of the Flies-esque' colony of kids have learned to live within the confines of the zone over the past three years, living off the fat of the land and entering the maze when necessary. However, shortly after Thomas' arrival, things begin to change for the young men. Thomas enters the maze in a bid to save the leader of the group, Alby, and unlike others had, he survives the night, killing a griever in the process. Shortly after, a key is discovered in the carcass of the griever and a plan to escape the maze is set in motion. Boasting a cast primarily made up of teens, there will generally always be a few weak links, especially from the younger more inexperienced actors. Though on the whole, Director Wes Ball struggles to create anything more than one-dimensional, cardboard thin characters. The ham-fisted scenes where the audience are almost told to be moved are almost laughable. We are told to care, but we don't. In saying this, there were a few stand-out performances; Will Poulter as the huffy Gally, Ki Hong Lee as Minho, though Dylan O'Brian's portrayal of Thomas takes the cake. We are able to feel the character's confusion and frustration throughout the film, which can perhaps be seen as an allegory for the viewer and what they're experiencing. Bravo Ball? The pacing is one of the biggest flaws in the film. It plods and meanders for a larger portion of the film. A couple of encounters with the spider-like 'Grievers' within the maze create a small amount of on screen action to give you a break during the long down times, otherwise people sit around and talk, Gally huffs and puffs or questions are posed. Then just as the film begins to take off in the third act, it ends on a cliffhanger. There is no payoff to this near two-hour ride. Just a big 'see you next time if you want to find out what everything actually means'. The Maze Runner is nothing we haven't seen before; a straight forward, saccharine Hollywood tale that hits all the right beats and twists and turns. It's safe, it's dry and it's clunky; and when combined with its cliffhanger ending solely designed to allow for further installments down the road (which given the film earned over 100 million domestically off of its minuscule budget, we will almost certainly be seeing further installments), the film poses more questions than it answers. While it's always good to bow out and leave your audience wanting more, leaving them hanging is not, especially when everything had been riding on the climax. The Maze Runner may be an average rent, or great Netflix watch. If you're a patient person (and somewhat interested in the film), I would go as far to say that you should wait until the inevitable sequel is released before you watch it, otherwise, like me, you might find yourself aggrieved at the lack of answers and the somewhat lackluster experience.

1.0~It's a maze of bad preston_peace Sign in Permalink I know it's a sin to rate a movie a 1 because if someone really likes a movie, it ruins that person's day, but I hate this film. If you really love this movie, that's great, and I'm sorry about your day. Maze Runner is a mess of plot holes, unanswered questions, and themes that never amount to anything. I won't deny that the movie has both competent direction and good special effects. It looks good. But the movie suffers from trying to be more than it is. It makes all of the kids in the maze look small compared to the maze itself and shows how inferior the kids are to the power of the maze. It probably doesn't sound half bad. I mention this part first because it's one of the only reasons to see the film. If you're a harsh critic or even a person with standards for what movies you see, you'd come to the conclusion about thirty minutes in that the government has put them in the maze as a Hunger Games style test that to see how far we've come as a species. Or something. It's not. It's much, much, more disappointing. The reveal is stupid and not the movie's worst flaw. The other big flaw of the movie is it hints at themes of friendship, loyalty, and trust, and never bringing them up again. Almost half of the first part of the movie talks about how the one thing that must remain constant is the peaceful nature between the people of the maze. But when the epic battle where the inhabitance of the maze are assaulted by the monsters of the maze and more than half of their friends are brutally ripped to shreds and scream in pain for their other friends, the main protagonists suddenly say, "who cares about those guys? Those guys aren't on the cover of the movie. They were never MY friends."A lot of the movie is like that. It builds up these themes of mystery, endurance, and friendship but then tosses it out the window and slaps your hand for try to empathize with a person or theme. After watching the movie, I felt attacked. Not offended because this movie didn't even give me enough investment to be offended. I felt hurt because I was being punished for trying to see the movie as more than it truly was. It's pure, nonsensical, garbage.
3.0~Perhaps the sequel will be better mingsphinx Sign in Permalink Hollywood loves teenage movie franchises like "Twilight" and "Hunger Games". "The Maze Runner" is clearly intended to be a money maker with many more episodes to come. This is why audiences were basically left hanging with just the faintest clue of what might have happened before. Watching this film is not satisfying because you will have to watch the sequel to know what happens next. For the producers, that is probably the point. As a young person's film it is not that bad but you would be better off spending your money on a picture that is not just another take on plutocratic dystopia. The characters were undemanding and for most part the actors just had to be young, pretty and full of angst. There was nothing all that interesting being portrayed other than the usual teenage fantasy about changing the world and saving everyone.
8.0~Cube meets Lord of the Flies weejockxxx Sign in Permalink I actually enjoyed this movie. I was expecting a tedious boring book to film carve up like Divergent and instead got a well paced adventure with some pretty solid characters. OK, the story isn't totally original; kids put in a primitive setting left to survive or die is straight out of Lord of the Flies and the shifting maze is just like Cube but it kept up the pace and suspense just enough to hold my interest. I have just one question that maybe they didn't explain properly; what was the point of the runners? They couldn't escape through the maze, they had to return by nightfall but they got nothing out of it because their supplies came up from the pit so why run through it at all? Apart from that it wasn't a bad movie. Unlike Divergent(which was full of one dimensional pretty things) I am anticipating the sequel.
10.0~The Maze Runner endersgame1972 Sign in Permalink I got the book and had to see the film before I went ahead and Red the book. I have to say Was blown out of my seat from the first second to the last with non stop action sequences. And I saw No Continuity errors what so ever as I see in a lot of other films, this is a first rate bit of film making absolute U.S.D.A prime choice. I can,t wait for the next one this had me 'on on the edge of my seat with action and suspense and raw emotion. this is a great film for teenagers I would say Fifteen and above there is a lot of violence and suggestive material contained in this film younger children might not understand this film. I would take teenager to see this. but not anyone under 15. It leaves you in suspense at the end wanting more but as this is a series one has to wait with bated breath for the next grand adventure, like in our favorite TV sitcoms from the 70,s and Eighties when we would see To be Continued on the screen and sigh as our parent,s shooed us off to bed this is that kind of movie one where we all gasp and sigh.the boy who played Newt I have seen in Nanny Mcphee and and a film about a 8 year old boy with a brain tumor that was a true story. I would say this is a great film just use your judgement as to weather you think it would be appropriate for your son or daughter.
7.0~I loved it. rehor-masarova Sign in Permalink Maze runner is for me awesome movie because it has tension it has action and it has drama and it is also very interesting and original idea.The first maze scene was absolutely breath taking.Young Dylan O'Brien was fantastic for me.The graver's we're awesome too they were kind of scary,they were robotic.The running scenes we're great.The maze looked epic.Then the last scene from the chopper looked amazing too.The infection at the end of the movie in the TV looked totally creepy and scary,it looked like some kind of zombie.One of the things that bother me was that at the end the only thing you find out is that it was only one of the trials.I hope that it makes enough money so they can make second(third)movie.
6.0~Not much actual maze and running Snorreplop Sign in Permalink Every month a cargo lift arrives at a circular glade surrounded by walls. The lift contains provisions , animals and every month a boy with no memory of his past. Every day the walls open up to a maze, at dusk the maze is closed off. At night the maze is inhabited by unfriendly spider-like creatures called grievers. The film opens up following a new member of the all-male/boy community in the lift up to the glade. This turns out to be our protagonist Thomas. Thomas is initiated in the community by Alby, most senior and the first one to arrive at the glade. Thomas is soon drawn to the maze, but as it turn out only runners are allowed to enter and explore it. The coming of Thomas and the events he sets in motion are likely to divide the glade community in those who want to stay in the relative safety of the glade and the ones that want answers and unrestricted freedom. The movie is entertaining in its way but lacks depth and subtlety. Maybe that was not a necessity for the target audience, but it would have made a much better movie. The ending also could only have been less elegant by a cut to black and a full screen 'to be continued' message.
2.0~Bad Movie greatgibson Sign in Permalink I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 because of the visual effect. The story is good, but the writing is just bad and acting SOOOO poor which makes me feel offended. The director should take the biggest blame, because he is supposed to tell actors the right way to act and how to display each character. His low requirement or lack of taste allow such poor performance to be shown on the screen. And the writing of the story, the lines and details on each characters reaction (especially the main character) to what's happening is just plain, shallow and sometimes stupid. I really don't understand how such a movie got above 7 on IMDb. It is nowhere close to any other 7 plus movies.
8.0~Good movie to watch when you're having a night in benbell-240-409768 Sign in Permalink This a good movie, the story could have a couple tweaks here and there, but overall it is a good movie and I'll look forward to a second movie if they make one. However, the one bad thing about the movie are the dark scenes. It is very hard to see what is going on. I actually had to turn all my room lights out complete and even then, I still found it hard to see exactly what was happening. So if they make another movie, I strongly suggest they brighten up the dark scenes so we can actually see what is happening. So overall I do like this movie. I think its one for all to watch, yes there are bad bits, but there are good bits and the storyline is good.
5.0~Disappointing kgajic Sign in Permalink This movie was depicted to be an interesting, well paced, energetic thriller or at least I thought so. Coming into it I did not mind the fact that it bears resemblance to other dystopian movies, most of which I have quite enjoyed, but this one is definitely not like the others. The premise that the movie depicts during the opening and first part is excellent and the characters are fine, however it all goes downhill from there. The movie starts off excellently and leaves viewers on the edge, yearning for answers to the questions that have been posed; what's in the maze? why can't the glades small inhabitants remember anything? what are they even doing there? After which the answers that it delivers are not as profound or intelligent as originally thought. Such as when the 'griever' is revealed to be some sort of retarded mechanical spider with a human face or when Thomas' main opposer seems to have an aneurysm half way through, causing him to make some questionable decisions. Although I have many criticisms of this movie, I really liked the premise and hoped it would deliver the whole way through but seeing as there are a couple more installments, I remain hopeful that it may somehow still deliver. 5/10
7.0~Your typical YA dystopian movie littlegrids Sign in Permalink There is not much to say about this movie than that it's an extremely typical YA dystopian movie. And I get it, the creators of YA dystopias are making a ton of money off hormonal teenagers (and I'm saying this as a teenager myself) by casting attractive young actors to star in their movies so why not? Who cares if the plot is the same all the time? If I can see some hunks or some hot girls save the world, I'd love it so much I won't even notice that the actual plot, right? Now don't get me wrong, The Maze Runner wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't exactly a good one either. It simply falls into the cliché YA dystopian frames where the innocent teenagers (who are mostly played by actors in their 20s) are being, in some ways, tortured by some rich adults for no good reason. The further I analysed the plot, the less it made sense. Like, how is locking some kids (who are supposedly immune to some population-wiping disease) up in a maze going to save the human population? And why do they kill the kids who are trying to escape the maze? If their immune to a virus that pretty much has killed every human on Earth, shouldn't they protect every immune person there is to maintain the human race? The reason why I gave this a 7 is because I actually really liked the aesthetic parts of the film. The visuals, CGI and cinematography was beautiful and most of the actors were really good. I also really liked the soundtrack, although it's a bit too epic for the plot. And after all, in YA dystopian standards, The Maze Runner isn't THAT BAD. It apparently followed the book relatively well and even though the reason behind it made little sense, I still think the idea of locking people inside a maze is a nice element to make something epic.
4.0~Too generic Leofwine_draca Sign in Permalink Another day, another Hollywood blockbuster based on a young adult novel and featuring a teenage cast involved in a huge game while trying to stay alive. Yep, it's another film that's completely derivative of THE HUNGER GAMES and DIVERGENT, with little to make it stand out. This time around, a group of kids are randomly trapped inside a giant, shifting maze and must figure out a way to escape. Inevitably this is a film full of bland, CGI action scenes that always turn me off. There's just nothing exciting watching a couple of characters running from a CGI effect. The monsters in the maze are quite boring, a bit like the bugs in STARSHIP TOOPERS but partly mechanical. This film's saving grace is the quality of the acting, which is better than expected; the lead is quite likable and the supporting players have distinct characters which makes a change from the usual nonsense. I'll be catching the sequel at some point, but I don't expect much from it on the strength of this.
8.0~Surprisingly Good claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink A teenager (Dylan O'Brien) awakes in an underground cargo elevator with amnesia. He arrives at a primitive culture called The Glade with teenagers and boys, surrounded by huge walls, and he is welcomed by the leader Alby (Aml Ameen) that explains that his memory will return in a couple of days. Alby tells that all of them have passed by the same process and now they survive working in their own agriculture plus the supplies provided by the elevator once a month. Further, a new boy is always brought in the elevator. The teenager sees a breach on the wall and Alby explains that only runners succeed in crossing trying to find a means of escape since there is a maze around the walls and the dangerous Grievers that hunt them down. When Alby is stung by a Griver, he brings him back to the community. He is bullied by the strong Gally (Will Poulter) and they fight. He hits his head on the floor and recalls his name, Thomas. Soon Thomas becomes a runner with his partner Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and they explore the maze together and find a possible way out. Meanwhile a girl called Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives in the elevator with the note "she is the last one ever" and two syringes; further she knows him. Thomas decides to use one syringe in Alby and he recovers. However that night the breach on the wall is not closed and The Grivers invade The Glade killing the boys. Will Thomas and his friends survive? Will they find a way out from The Glade? Who is keeping them in that place? "Maze Runner" is a surprisingly good film, with mystery, action and sci-fi with wonderful special effects. The plot has many surprises and the young cast has great performance. Dylan O'Brien and the British- Brazilian Kaya Scodelario are excellent and show a perfect chemistry. The twists in the end are totally unexpected. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Maze Runner: Correr ou Morrer" ("Maze Runner: Run or Die")
7.0~The Maze Runner would have been a fun puzzle had it's main actor been a better performer. RforFilm Sign in Permalink Let's paint a familiar picture: your sitting at a diner, sipping on a Coke through a straw while mom and dad talk about plans for whos going to meet up with grandma. Your only eight years old with no cell phone; so how did you pass the time? You played with that paper placemat that every restaurant that was family orientated had. Some had that easy word search that hid easy messages like "fries" and gumball" and some had an unfunny cartoon that was printed with the hope that the child would laugh anyway. What most had was the classic maze. I myself have a couple of memories of holding a free crayon offered by the waitress and tracing my way though an uneven pattern that would lead me to the exit. These were easy, but I had fun solving them, giving me a sense of accomplishment before I dived into a hot dog. What makes the maze puzzle so unique is that I think this may be the first example of a virtual game. Despite only using a pen to guide the way, you were thrown into network where your only goal was to get out. Solve the maze and you feel like you could take on another to prove that you were such a master. Let's see you solve the death trap that is in The Maze Runner. Sixteen-year-old Thomas (played by Dylan O'Brian) wakes up to find himself in an ascending cage which opens to a lush field and several other boys around his age. They collect the other boxes that came with him and the second in command Newt (played by Thomas Brodie- Sangster) tells Thomas about the way of life and their positions. Most of the boys farm and gather but a few select venture into a large maze that surround them. They are called the runners. As Thomas begins to accept the community way of life, he accidentally gets left out in the maze when trying to save the others (the maze closes it's gates at night as monsters fill the track). He manages to survive the nightfall and save his friends life. This grants him status as a runner, to the dismay of the group's leader Gally (played by Will Poulter). As Thomas starts to learn about mapping the maze, a girl arrives in the cage along with a note that reads "the last one ever". This puts more pressure to find a way through the treacherous puzzle before they run out of food and time. The Maze Runner is another young adult novel getting it's turn at a movie adaptation. What certainly separates this from the others is that this one is more boy orientated. Sort of a cross between the lost boys of Peter Pan and The Prisoner TV series, The Maze Runner was a lot better then I thought it could have been. The situation is more interesting and easier to follow then this year's Divergent and it's cast of young men shape it to be a better performance piece. Exceptthere's only one problem with the characters and it's a major one; the main character. Thomas is really bland and forgettable and is just the generic nice hero. I don't know if the actor Dylan is the issue as he does have a regular role on MTV's Teen Wolf (I can't justify this as I've never seen the show); but you know it's a problem if the side characters are more memorable. As is, Thomas Brodie-Sangster makes for a good sidekick (so much so that I wish he were the focus) and Will Poulter is starting to show more acting skills (proven before in We're the Millers). I'll give this seven hard mazes out of ten. The Maze Runner could have been as good as The Hunger Games had it casted a better performer or simply had a better character to put the focus on, but for a fun Friday night at the movies, I'll take it for entertainment's sake. This could have been worse.
7.0~Good visualization. jacob-m-ford97 Sign in Permalink Around 2008-2010 all the people my age, teens and young adults, started on a craze of reading similar dystopian novels and series. There were countless ones: "The Hunger Games", "Divergent", "The Giver", "Ender's Game", etc. After "The Hunger Games" paved the way with huge success, we are now in the middle of the phase where all those books are being made into movies. "The Maze Runner" is an addition to that phase. Based on the novel by James Dashner, "The Maze Runner" is a film about a young man who suddenly wakes up in a strange place with no feasible mode of escape and no memory of who he is and how he got there. He gradually discovers more and more of the suspicious place he is forced to live in and the people he is forced to live with, and what chance he has of escaping the Maze with his life. Dylan O'Brien takes on the role of Thomas, our protagonist and a person who is about as average as you can get. O'Brien wasn't given much of a character to work with at the start, but he put little extra into this role which honestly made him rather boring to watch. Practically all the other characters in this film played the same way. Will Poulter's performance is by far the most noteworthy and Blake Cooper's character of Chuck was the most interesting character in the screenplay, but every character was hard to get attached to. That may be mostly on the screenwriters, but when it comes to personality a lot of weight is put on the shoulders of the actors. And here, they just didn't deliver. Ultimately, I think character development could have been the best choice to make this movie stand out. The story is set up where a large number of young men are thrown together, forced to live in an enclosed area. Freedom is not initially an option, so they have to learn to create a society and work together to survive. What I loved about this story is that this happened; they did work together and had peace before they tried to have freedom. This is an incredibly unique choice, so I wish it had been a major focus of the story. In order for that many young, hormone raging, teenage men to create such a society, many mature decisions had to be made by these characters, and we never got to see that happen. The Maze is cool, the action and killing giant robotic spiders was cool, but the coolest thing was these strong characters that were hidden behind the curtain for the whole movie. Clearly, a choice by director Wes Ball was made about what his focus would be. After he decided to make the recipe young adult action flick instead of this "Lord of the Flies" type story, he needed to make some changes from the story in the book. A book can succeed in having two such different types of stories survive, but a movie is sadly not capable of such a feat. His changes needed to be on what he wanted to do with his characters, specifically Will Poulter's Gally and Kaya Scoledario's Teresa. Teresa's purpose in the film was entirely unclear to me, and whether or not Gally was going to be a villain or the unlikely hero was a mystery to me until the final five minutes of the movie. Poulter really gave a good performance in this film, and Ball's poor character choices made that completely irrelevant. Had some decisions been made about what to do with the people on screen, the movie could have been much, much better. Perhaps the most impressive work done in this film was by Artistic Director Douglas Cumming. His visualization of the Maze and especially the Glade were superb and made the film both beautiful and mesmerizing. An intense score provided by John Paesano accompanied the film, which added to the awesomeness of the film's appearance. Some may suggest that Cumming's work was unoriginal, with many scenes appearing like other films. The film's main villains, robotic spiderlike creatures called Grievers, had an uncanny resemblance to the spider Shelob in "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King." However, with similarly choreographed chase scenes and shots identical to "The Return of the King," I think the responsibility falls more again on director Wes Ball. The end of the film also provides us with an escape almost identical to 2005's "The Island," along with other unoriginal frames. Overall, "The Maze Runner" was enjoyable. It had cool action scenes and was a really good idea for a story. As a young adult action flick, it meets the quota. It definitely doesn't go anywhere past that though. I just had a hard time getting into it because I didn't have reason to care about any of the characters. So as I walked out of the theater, I was ready for bed. I give "The Maze Runner" a 7.5/10. "The Maze Runner" is now showing at the Vermillion Coyote Twin.
1.0~This movie hopes you will see part 2, when part 1 sucks dex-18977 Sign in Permalink Seems like a lot of teenage filmstar movies are all about part 2 and 3 that they forget to make the first movie something to want to see more. This is where Maze Runner fits in. First there really is no maze to run. It's demolished cities filled with zombies. It's the usual things you see in everyday zombie apocalyptic movies. Nothing new Let me just fast forward to the last 5 minutes of the movie. OK, the kids escape then the bad guys come and wipe out their entire camp (which includes about 100 peopple) armed with guns, gernades, and heavy artillery. Then after the bad guys leave, one kid (the main character) says he is going back to defeat the person who just came and kicked their ass. The rest of the group says hes crazy, its a suicude, yada yada, but then they all agree to this idea. Remind you that this place is over 1000 miles away and the kids spent the whole movie leaving that place. Yes its cheesy. And yes its the way the movie ends. But here's the biggest problem. The first movie sucked! Why would anyone want to see part 2 when part 1 had nothing to reel you in? What a cure for a disease? A kid who lost his memory but helped others escaped back in the day? One friend who got captured and is worth saving? There just isn't any. If someone had said don't waste your time, there's not a movie out there to compare this to b/c its hard to compare a bad movie to good ones. If you watch it, don't say I didn't warn you
7.0~Far superior than rest of post-apocalyptic YA adapts ArchonCinemaReviews Sign in Permalink The film The Maze Runner is based off the three book series written by author James Dashner. As post-apocalyptic films adapted from YA novels go, and there have been many, The Maze Runner might be the most successful of the 2014 year. The film opens on a young teen, seemingly kidnapped against his will and unclear of what he is doing. His body, limp on the floor of a openly woven caged box, rises up to the sun and grass where he promptly meets a crowd of his peers, all male. Talking with them he discovers he is exactly like them, unknowingly in this location, his memory erased with only his name available to him, it is Thomas. He soon discovers the grassy area's perimeter is completely encapsulated by steeply high concrete walls, beyond which is a maze. The goal is to figure out the maze as it is the only way to freedom. The Maze Runner uses young up-and-comer actors and actresses rather than the obvious and nepotistic decision. Dylan O'Brien does a superb job as the newbie Thomas and Aml Ameen is especially captivating as the leader of the stranded survivors Alby. The primarily British young actors also do a splendid job of masking their native accents for a neutrally American vocal pattern. Further, Wes Ball's direction of The Maze Runner has a clear vision as it emulates a vastly PG-er Lord of the Flies vibe. The beauty of the film is its simplicity. Since the children and teens are locked in an experimental cage, there is no need for monotonous information delivery regarding the futuristic world. There's no futuristic dialect, class system, government changes or anything of the type.
8.0~A new spin on the teeny dystopia craze. incredible_malik Sign in Permalink It's a current trend in Hollywood for YA (young adult) dystopian novels getting the movie treatment. The Maze Runner is another one of those, except it's a new breed as it's instead set in a post-apocalyptic world, rather than a dystopian future. What gives this film such intrigue is its confusing and mysterious nature throughout the film. It has you asking questions from the beginning, as things occur on their own merit without explanation. You will scratch your head at times, while at the same time wait patiently to see what is actually going on. VERDICT: A new spin on the teeny dystopia craze, with an enthralling and captivating mysterious plot that will have you hooked till the very end. Overall Rating: 8.5/10 Full review by me here: http://www.mediahype101.com/2014/09/the-maze-runner-2014- film-review.html
8.0~Solid movie zachvalencia Sign in Permalink This was a pretty solid movie overall. I wasn't really sure what it was about but it was definitely a different plot. It had some resemblance to the hunger games but overall was pretty different. The movie was entertaining and kept me in the whole time. It got confusing at times but that was intriguing part about it. There is a solid amount if action and you will not get bored watching this movie. If you were debating whether or not to watch this or not i do recommend it. As far as the level of appropriateness for kids its not bad a few swears hear and there but not bad. Nothing really that inappropriate. This is a good film and i recommend watching it not like a o my god movie but good.
7.0~Enjoyable Film Until The Final Third RobTortureWright Sign in Permalink An excellent and surprisingly thrilling film that had me totally hooked for two thirds but very slightly faded towards the end with the outcome needing more big and loud performances from the actors and to have a few less inconsistencies. The film was truly a blue print for this genre and rivalled the first Hunger Games and bettered it in many areas. The actors played a superb part early on and the story was truly engrossing. The inconsistencies weren't truly major but had you questioning certain plot-lines and why the characters wouldn't question it themselves such as the helicopter that flies the group out at the end. Why wouldn't they have just flown directly into the camp and rescued them ? Overall a superb one time watch that almost became a keeper but dipped too much in the final third.
8.0~Another "Teenagers Save the World" Sequel; but Good TheNihalGursoyOfficial Sign in Permalink There are many works this adaptation can be compared to. The first one to pop up in my mind while watching this at the theater was The Lord of the Flies by William Golding. The all male group trying to survive on their own made me go back to the grandiose classic book. There is also The Hunger Games and Divergent both of them being adaptation of books like this movie The Maze Runner. However, the bigger comparison can be made in the idea of teenagers attempting to save a world that is corrupt and destroyed. In my opinion, each movie I listed above is original in its own way and The Maze Runner is here to compete with them. The idea is not new but the way the idea is conveyed in the movie is authentic. You feel every bit of action like you're there while watching this movie. The acting is also undeniable great. Hollywood definitely hit the spot with these entertaining sci-fi movies. So this movie is definitely a yes from me.
9.0~Good made film indeoriginal Sign in Permalink I just saw The Maze Ruuner, OMG!!!! It was so amazing, it's a good thriller action film. I read the whole saga, i'm a fan. But as every film adaptation, there are things that you can't put on screen for different reason, like runtime or the rhythm of the story. But, this was a great movie. The performances were right, the Maze is so complex and the Grievers are awful as hell! The film transmit all these feelings of suspense and danger. You don't have to read the book to get the story,if you don't want, of course there's gonna be little things that are gonna be left unanswered because it's a Big story of 3 books, but the film introduce the story to new people. It's male power and it's working!!!!!
7.0~Lord of the Flies Meets Lost stevendbeard Sign in Permalink I saw "The Maze Runner", starring Dylan O'Brien-Teen Wolf_tv, The Internship; Will Poulter-We're the Millers, Son of Rambow; Kaya Scodelario-The Truth About Emanuel, Clash of the Titans_2010 and Patricia Clarkson-Friends With Benefits, Blind Date. This is based on a series of young adults books by James Dashner-so you can look for a franchise. The story kind of reminded me of if you mixed the plots of the Lord of the Flies with the TV show Lost. The movie starts with Dylan as he wakes up in a moving elevator. When it stops, he is in the middle of an open field-which he finds out is called the glades-with a group of other young men standing around him. He has no memories of who he is or how he got there, just like the other boys before him-but after a few days, they do remember their own names-and once a month, a new boy arrives and the first boy that arrived there has been there for 3 years. Encircling the open field is a giant wall that Dylan later discovers is a maze. Every morning, an opening in the wall appears and then closes when the sun goes down. During this time, the boys send runners into the maze to try to find a way out, but if they do not make it out by sunset, they are never seen again. At night, strange noises are heard from the maze which is attributed to these sort of nighttime watchdogs called grievers, which are half robot, half scorpion monsters. Will is one of the earlier memory erased arrivals that does not like Dylan-he is always wanting to punish Dylan and gets disappointed when no one else agrees with him. Kaya is the first girl that arrives in the elevator-after Dylan-and she seems to know Dylan, if not much else. Patricia plays the person behind the curtain that seems to know exactly what is going on and why. The action is pretty good but the story left lots of questions unanswered, but I'm sure they are leaving them for the sequels. It ends like it is setting up the next installment. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.
9.0~The Maze Runner feae-72598 Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is one of the entertained movies I've ever seen. I take my breathe away because the content of it and an artistic works are so thrilling. Also unlike comedy, this film are not predictable and there are many challenges for main character. And the music make people who watch this movie so frightening. By these features, people definitely enjoy The Maze Runner. In this movie main character almost run and run away with severe, so people may feel refreshing and forget about daily life. Unlike other science fiction movies, its set and architecture are real and it doesn't have much CG. So people are not bored with it. I recommend to watch this movie.
7.0~Fun movie even with the shoddy plot line cheryl-77 Sign in Permalink Saw it tonight with my teen, who read the book. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole film. It was fast-paced and a LOT of fun to watch. The star was great. And I liked the whole setup. Toward the end, though, you felt like you needed a really good reason for them all to have been put in a big field in the middle of a maze, and I didn't feel like any explanation worked. Maybe they will explain it better in the next movie. I sure hope so, because I don't want to read the books. But my son tells me that it wasn't explained any better there. I mean: OK, so they are trying to find strong people to withstand a virus. But they already have the cure, so what's the point? And if the point was to study them with the virus in them, then why make it so difficult to GIVE them the virus? Very strange. The grievers --while fun and scary -- made no sense as a way to deliver the virus. So I was a bit lost at the end. BUT like I said, the movie was so fast-paced that you weren't given much time to think about all that stuff, so I enjoyed it.
9.0~How a movie based on a book should be made. milosjan-cekal Sign in Permalink First of all, I went to see this movie without really expecting or knowing anything about it. It just looked cool, like some kind of a mix between the The Hunger Games and The Lost. I did not even know it was based on a book. The movie is thrilling, nerve wrenching and very enjoyable by itself. I highly appreciated the new, fresh cast of "unknown" actors. The main characters did a great job of being close to their book counter-parts. The flow of the movie is another great thing about it. It simply glues you to your seat till the very end. The whole movie is intense from start to end. All of the surrounding are very well made and close to the books as well which is very appreciated. Now you may ask how can I even compare the book and the movie while I did not even know that there was a book in the first place. Its quite simple really, the movie made me really want to read the book and its sequels. Which is a great credit to the movie! So I read the book and I was amazed even more by The Maze Runner Movie. It stays close to the book representations of the Maze, the Glade and the dangers that lurk within the Maze. However, the movie also takes upon itself to explain some things completely differently, therefore presenting a new somewhat fresh experience for those who read the books beforehand. But in the end it all comes in the same result, the book and the movie. I really appreciated the approach that the director of The Maze Runner movie and I wish more directors of movies based on books would take this method. The Maze Runner perfectly balances authenticity to the book and taking its own course and it is simply perfect. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie (and the books as well)!
3.0~Not at all what it should have been elzikissel Sign in Permalink I was excited to see this movie. I loved the books and even hung in for the maze runner movie. yeah that one was a little off but the idea was the same, i mean the grievers were on bug-like legs instead of the slug-like appearance they were supposed to have, and the way they got to the control room was a bit different but it was smaller details. Scorch trials? a good way to make anyone who read the books hate it and anyone who didn't leave the theater with too many questions to even want to see the next. I saw this in theaters. I tried to keep an open mind. I knew from the previews that it was going to be a little different, i.e. the escaping from WCKD. But hey, I went to see it in hopes that it would be just a little setback. My god was i wrong. I went with my sister who had not read the books. She liked the movie, and I will agree, AS A MOVIE, it was good. Not fantastic, but watchable. When we left the theater, I was fuming, and she was in a confused daze. The first question she asked was why were there zombies in the sewers? GOOD QUESTION. yes the cranks were supposed to be crazy but not that. not by a long shot. The cranks were supposed to be people, they were supposed to have different stages in the levels of "gone-ness". Second question was what caused the virus? yeah that was not clear at all to anyone who hadn't read the books. i mean in the end of the maze runner they kind of said where the virus came from but that was about it. it didn't say that the virus made people lose all filters and more in their brains. In any movie, there is a point where you have a character explain something, usually to another character to prevent these kind of questions, but no. they dropped the gladers in the desert, told them there was a virus in the world and expected them to just run with it? Seriously? Next question was what caused the destruction of the world? another good question. Another part that should have been explained. The solar flares that cause the virus also caused the world destruction. now, as i said, i read the books. i tried to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. you know, watch it as a movie and try to see it's good points. no. if you are going to base a movie on a book, you do not cut out all the book, seriously. the only things that were kept the same was the scene where Brenda and Thomas got drugged at a rave and the lightning storm. little else followed. in maze runner, i was OK with them not keeping more of the gladers. there were supposed to be more than 10. but i will continue. the movie was not supposed to be escaping from wckd. the gladers were supposed to be told they were all infected and they had to survive the next trial to receive the cure. it is in the freaking title. The Scorch TRIALS. they were supposed to be shown that wckd controls a lot more than they let on, including manipulating reality. they were supposed to be tasked with going through a kind of transport-portal type thing to a pitch black tunnel. they were supposed to lose a person to these metal ball things and almost lose another but Thomas saves him. the scorch is not supposed to be survivable. at all. the kids are supposed to have a hard time walking in a straight line and to be covered from head to toe in cloth to block out the sun. oh and Theresa is not supposed to be with them. she is supposed to be taken before they go through the trans- flat thing. she is supposed to be seen in the scorch and Thomas is supposed to talk to her and see that wckd has some kind of control over her. not her flat out turning them in and expecting them to understand. honestly, I love the actor who played Jorge but i don't think he was a good fit for the character. that might be my own bias in seeing him in other things where he plays a spineless person but i digress. again with the cranks in the mall and sewers. they are not supposed to be zombies. and they have something growing in them? where the heck did that come from? in the book the group is only boys, the gladers and Aris, who is supposed to be someone no one but Thomas trusts. they were supposed to see tattoos on their necks and it is supposed to give an air of mystery, i mean Thomas' says "to be killed by b group" anyway, there are so many more things that i found wrong with this movie and i could talk about it for hours but i don't think anyone wants to hear that. i gave this a three because i love the actors and i do not blame them for this monstrosity of a film. they were the only good thing about it. oz
7.0~Compromises billygoat1071 Sign in Permalink The appeal of the The Maze Runner for its billion dollar genre is how straightforward everything it seems. It (thankfully) doesn't begin with a voice-over narration, because indeed it's another high concept that designs a world as a mind-bending game. The film already faults for spilling too much rules and details, but when things starts actually moving, the action becomes marvelous, with large scaled, suspense driven set pieces that easily makes it worth the price admission. The worst of it however is when it finally unfolds all of the hidden secrets, compromising much of the potential of this ride. Still, it's pretty hard to deny the excitement of the experience alone. Treating it as another solid action film might be enough for a while. Things are stronger at the first act when the hero is just picking up information even though the people around him are basically just over-explaining stuff rather than developing their characters. But it's great when it keeps the plot moving from one place to another. Once they get into the maze, the momentum becomes a heartbeat. It works like a certain video game that has its heroes risk through various obstacles, brimmed by conspicuous fortitude. It is a great example of a real action film that relies more on the matter of life and death thrills, even if you're already surrounded by nice production and special effects. There's also an hint of social analogy to fit the genre's trend of playing with politics, except the one here seems simple and intriguing to figure out what it is trying to pinpoint. Everything else is just more scattered clues for the mystery. But all of those growth suddenly gets bogged down once it hits to their biggest answers. It's obviously setting up for another young adult franchise, but it also hurts to whatever it has put together. At this point, it feels like we're left hanging with more questions, except it's much nonsensical. To be fair after this large disappointment, we're still given a totally fun cinematic experience. The direction is so energetic at its tension, it almost seems to have inspiration some of the greatest horror movie aesthetics and tricks: the ooze, the meat, the traps, the dark walls, and the singular angled chase scenes with the enemy coming closer to the hero. Those are some of its remarkable, well-shot bits that you don't always see in this dull genre. The acting is also good for outweighing what's written for the characters. Dylan O'Brien looks like a hero to root for and he does a fine job for it. Will Poulter also shines as his reasonably arrogant opposite. The best thing The Maze Runner could offer is the maze itself, though those spectacle couldn't help us ignore the final minutes of the film, but it still overpowers the overall experience. Personally, I would rather look forward more on a video-game adaptation (if it's even possible) than the sequels, but I don't know. It's pretty hard to see where this story is going. It instantly compromises some larger picture beneath the surfaces.for the sake of being another million dollar franchise, but this one has a direction of its own, despite that their destiny seems to lack the freshness. The cleverly constructed action just adds the value, otherwise.
10.0~Real good! Real amusing! Well done! StrayFeral Sign in Permalink I must admit I really missed the kind of movie where a bunch of kids go for an adventure and here it is, The Maze Runner. Well not really that the kids want to be there, they are put there. However still the movie satisfies me. To be precise, this is an adventure post-apocalyptic dystopian thriller (at least I would define it as such). And unlike Hunger Games, this one lacks all the political stuff (at least in this episode!) and instead focuses on the action and character development. The movie clearly points out in the end that there would be a sequel, but that's all. Everything the end teases with is that the next episode will focus on putting the kids into another big trouble and that's it. So no spoilers really. I will try to keep this out of any spoilers too, so will instead focus on only what the trailer suggests. And as the trailer shows, this movie is about a group of kids put into the centre of a maze which they have to explore and survive and meanwhile have to solve their own conflicts. None of the kids remembers anything, except in few days after they are put into the maze they remember just their name. From this point on starts the adventure. This is everything you will see in the trailer. Based on this alone, the movie flashed three things inside me immediately - "Labyrinth" (1986, David Bowie) - The Maze Runner is written in 2007, but who does not remembers "The Labyrinth"? That was such a huge movie from my childhood. I still own it on blu-ray and the soundtrack on original CD and listen to it often. And I am not the only one, I am sure. And I am sure James Dashner, the author of the Maze Runner books was heavily been inspired by this movie, just he decided to make it darker. Nothing wrong really. Yes, the movie is based on books, but I never read them. If you just watch the movie you will experience one well narrated story, enough dose of unknown to make you puzzled and wait for the answers to appear, nice effects and not bad music. The most disappointing for me was the absence of a teaser after the credits. But I can live with it. After all I really enjoyed the movie. Now as I said, the movie flashed three things inside me and "Labyrinth" (1986) was the first one. Okay, the difference was that in "Labyrinth" they put Jennifer Connelly in the outskirts of the maze, while here they put the kids in the centre. The other two things however were the kids themselves. The main actor, Dylan O'Brien looks exactly like a very young version of Jean-Claude Van Damme. I am sure he can't do the Van Damme split, but he really does look like him. Maybe a version of Van Damme before "Breakin" (Yes, Van Damme does appear in "Breakin" too). The other thing is, this movie really flashes back a resemblance to "The Goonies" (1985) to me, because of Blake Cooper. This kid really resembles Chunk from the Goonies (Jeff Cohen). I don't know why, but he is one of the most memorable characters to be from The Maze Runner. Maybe because he is so different from the others. As I said, I really enjoyed the movie. What I miss is just a little more character development, which I hope to see in the next episode. And I really want somehow Blake Cooper back in the team!! My final verdict - a very enjoyable teen movie!
8.0~Good Movie felixdonghallstrom Sign in Permalink This is a very good Movie. The acting is pretty solid and it´s very alike the book. (For those who read the book) you probably wonder: "Why are they not telepathic?!" i do that to, it´s a bit sad that it is not in the Movie but i would still give it a solid 8.
8.0~Really good movie! taisbaumannv Sign in Permalink If you're not looking at the logic things in this movie. It is actually really good, the story is really interesting. It makes me wanna know everything!
7.0~Left with a lot of questions ! someonesmart21 Sign in Permalink I've heard a lot of buzz about this movie so finally I watched it and to me it's good but I was expecting a lot better and it could have been but there are very silly mistakes that I can't just believe in and makes no sense although the starting was very good. We see the movie with the perspective of Thomas played by "Dylan O'Brien". The Maze Runner is about a guy who find himself in a maze (and thats where the movie starts) though he had no idea who he is and why is he here and afterwords the movie goes on, The good thing about this movie is that every scene holds you onto your breath and on the edge and like everyone you too want to know why ?? So I recommend this movie to everyone who likes thriller, mystery and some action.
7.0~Surprisingly gritty, and surprisingly good callum_burton Sign in Permalink My expectations of "The Maze Runner" were not particularly high if I must be honest. Walking in to the theater I was fearing another angst-driven teen movie; like a cheap take on the "Hunger Games" or "Divergent". Much to my surprise, however, "The Maze Runner" delivered. Fast paced, gritty, and supported by good characters and scripting, the movie went beyond just being entertaining; multiple scenes draw you in and immerse you. This was partially due to stunning effects that really emphasized the grand size of the maze, and partially due to the surprisingly dark nature of the film. It would have been easy here to 'gloss over' some of the nastier scenes much like other M-rated titles, but the film makers here decided to go for high impact and sometimes brutal imagery. While not gory by any standards, the dark tone of the film added atmosphere and made for quality viewing. For those who haven't read the books, the ending may have seemed abrupt, but you leave the cinema feeling like you've got your money's worth... and that's the main thing in this industry
6.0~Pretty good but totally irrelevant to the book. mariagogo13 Sign in Permalink (This is my first ever review so please do not judge me harshly) As a voracious reader who loves watching book-to-movie adaptations I have to say that the HUGE differences between the book and the movie got to my nerves. On the one hand,I liked the fact that they added some additional scenes that were not in the book,for instance the scene where they build a fire and had fun.Another thing I liked was the cast and I don't mean only Dylan O'Brien.I think that all of them were the perfect choices.Furthermore,I also believe they did a decent job at explaining concepts which may have confused people who had not read the books(Maze,Grievers etc) On the other hand,I hated the fact that they didn't develop the friendship between Newt and Alby because in the book they were like brothers.The same applies to Thomas and Chuck.Another thing that I would like to mention is the disappointing ending.They totally omit the scene where they get stuck in the glass room and then the "rebels" come to rescue them.Aside from this,we also have Chuck's death a few moments later which made me cry when reading the book whereas in the movie I did not feel that much compassion. Overall I enjoyed the movie,I think it compliments the book very well but I can't help but seeing the differences between the book version and the movie version.
1.0~DON'T WATCH IT IF YOU LIKED THE BOOK, IT'S Disappointing danitwetts Sign in Permalink This movie bothered me in many different levels, to the point I'm writing this review,if you read the book you won't like this one. I finished reading the book recently and I loved it, it's the best I've read by far this year. The plot/concept is great in the movie but it is very far from being exciting, not even to people who haven't read the book and just wanna watch the movie. I thought that City of Bones was the worst book adaptation. The writers gave a total twist to the story by "simplifying" it and making it "lighter" which makes the movie totally boring. It's a long list of the things they did wrong, I'm not even going to write all of them in here. I'm not a hater but I think that they ruined the book, what a shame. To summarize this movie is definitely disappointing, it let me down, I had big expectations. I don't even know how they are making a second one. Bye
7.0~Movie based on a YA Book RAW_Agent Sign in Permalink I see a couple reviews stating that the Movie is awful or that it's simply reusing plots that you are already familiar with. I'm going to say. It's a fine Movie. While it may not be a technological Wonder, or the NeXT Avatar. It's definitely not bad. It's obviously not meant for elder audience. Maybe 35-40+ men should just avoid Movies of this kind from now on? It's based on a YA book, what did you expect? It's about time People start to understand that some Movies are meant for a specific target audience. You can't expect to see deep drama on screen when you chose a Movie such as this one. The Movie kept me on the edge. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen for even a second. And I can't wait for the Next Movie. In fact, I'm so impatient to find out what comes NeXT, I'm just going to read the books first, and then watch the Movie.
8.0~A Better Than Average YA Film... ccponds Sign in Permalink As I have said/complained many times over the past few years, making a YA book into a film can be very repetitive. The movie may honestly be very well made, but it can also suffer from a seeming lack of creativity. The best example I can think of this year would be "The Giver." Thankfully, "The Maze Runner" was an above average YA film, for the most part. I thought the beginning was very good, the middle was good, and the ending was a little flat. I guess I would say that for everything that was awesome in this movie, there was sometimes was another element that would bring it down slightly. Right off the bat I want to say that the special effects in this film are very good. They are not so great that they stand out above everything else this year, but they certainly fit the film and the film's tone perfectly. From the way the maze is designed to the vicious creatures that lurk within, the effects will keep a viewer's attention. However, the very best effects were definitely applied to the creatures in the Maze. These monsters could have easily been the next "Alien." They are a perfect combination of awesome, fear, and disgust all blended into one nightmare. My one complaint about them would be that they give away the mystery surrounding them a little too early. I think they should have kept them a mystery for a bit longer than they did. Tying into the Maze's creatures, the best element of this film was undoubtedly the genre it played off of; the thriller genre. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and it kept the audience guessing as to what the purpose of the maze was. This thriller element is helped in a big way by the actors' performances throughout the film. There really was not a bad performance from any of the male characters, but there is a reason I have emphasized "male characters." I emphasize this point because unfortunately, the lead female role (one of about two females in the entire film) is really poor in her performance. Her character comes into the movie about halfway through, and really does not add much to the story, and she really did not offer much in terms of character skills. My sisters actually compared her to Bella from the Twilight series. As I stated earlier, I really did enjoy the beginning and middle portion of the film. Even the first part of the third act is fun, but the very, very end has been hated by many critics. I am personally on the fence with this ending myself. Half of me agrees with the critics in that ending was a very cheap way to end the film; it was predictable, lazy, and brought the movie down. However, my other half is telling me not to hate the ending because this film is based off of a book that is the first in a trilogy. Honestly, if you know this going into the movie, the ending will not be as bad as it has been made out to be. It is still annoying for sure, but it does not ruin the entire film just part of it. All in all, "The Maze Runner" is actually much better than I expected it to be. While it does have some key moments and elements that hold it back from being fantastic, it is still worth seeing. If you have not seen this film already, I would advise seeing it, preferably at a matinée showing. The cheaper you can get ticket for this movie the better, but it is still worth seeing on the big screen. I give "The Maze Runner" an 8.25/10.
7.0~Ehhh alimshujjat Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner, originally adapted from James Dashner's novel was released on 19 September 2014. I excepted a bit too much from the movie. It starred two actors i really like Dylan O'Brien, from MTV's Teen Wolf and Thomas Brodie- Sangster, from HBO's Game Of Thrones. I haven't read the book but i hear parts of the original novel were missing. But overall it was an okay movie, nothing too special. It's a good watch. The acting was okay. The movie was fast paced didn't drag much. A sequel is set to release,Maze Runner: Scorch Trials, on September 18, 2015.The Maze Runner sequel will include some of the most well known TV actors like Aiden Gillen of Game Of Thrones, Giancarlo Esposito of Breaking Bad and Barry Pepper of Kill The Messenger. Soo looking forward to that.
7.0~An entertaining joyride with a lackluster story. zaneage Sign in Permalink Before i start the review i would just like to say i have not read the book and i can not do a book to film analysis, sorry for any inconvenience. This is a spoiler free review. The Maze Runner is directed by Wes Ball and stars Dylan O'Brian, Kaya Scodelario, Will Poulter and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. The Maze Runner is based off of James Dashner's novel by the same name. The movie is about a boy named Thomas that wakes up in an elevator. Thomas's memory has been erased and the only thing he can remember is his name. Thomas wakes up in what is known by the local populace as The Glade. In The Glade the boys that live there (called Gladers) have created a home for themselves with structural rules and where everyone does their part to help out. The main people are the runners, these people are the ones that run out into the maze and try to find an escape route and attempt to map it out. But they soon begin to realize its more than a maze. The first two acts of this film were absolutely amazing, Wes Ball really knows how to bring tension into this film especially in the chase and Griever sequences were you feel a lot of awe and suspense as you watch the characters run in and around corners from the Grievers and the maze itself. The biggest problem about this film however is the last act, the last act was just absolutely terrible and totally ruined the experience for the entire movie. Another problem was all of the cliché's and predictability throughout the movie which took me out of the experience constantly. There are some really nice action scenes in this movie with great camera angles that truly capture the suspense and excel the experience, there is also unfortunately 3 scenes i noticed with shaky cam though which again took me out of the experience. Most of the actors are generally unknown but the acting was alright with no one really pulling an amazing performance or even something noteworthy, however Kaya Scodelario's character has this Kirsten Stewart look to her which was kinda annoying. The main character played by Dylan O'Brian was alright however in some parts of the film his acting became more like Shia LaBeouf's in transformers. Will Poulter's performance was probably the only good one in the entire movie as i truly felt that he portrayed his character really well. The VFX teams deserve some recognition for their work on capturing the shear size and terror of not only the giant walls but also the terrifying scary grievers. The walls are massive, frightening, unpredictable and scary. The grievers on the other hand are better left not talked about believe me the less you know the better. I would recommend you go see this film, its actually quite good maybe even a bit underrated. Its a fun and enjoyable film to watch but under the surface its an okay film with a high predictability/cliché rate. I'd recommend you see this film with a bunch of friends to possibly enjoy the experience more because when you look at it from an entertainment point of view this film defiantly delivers, but when you look at it from a critique point of view you'll slightly less enjoy the film for what it is. My score 7.5/10 or ★★★
5.0~Good concept but expected much more from the plot. aliciakohhies Sign in Permalink About 20minutes into the show, I was already anticipating and praising the movie for its interesting concept. However, near towards the end i got really confused and disappointed about how the ending turned out. The start of the movie was great, but it started to not make sense somewhere in the middle and there were a lot of questions in my head whenever something new came up. Like why they decided to push Ben into the maze but risk their lives saving Alby, why the girl was sent in with the cure/syringe thingy and then the monsters were sent in to destroy them after keeping them in for so long, why does Thomas remember everything and yet not know why they were in the maze, why does Gally still NOT want to leave even when he remembers everything, how can they destroy the monsters with a stick, the creator mentioned an epidemic or sth that the younger generation were immune to, but yet she survived herself, the ending part where they were showing buildings that were damaged and burnt so what happened actually, many things were to sudden and confusing. Now i'm just hoping part 2 tells us more details and all~~~
7.0~We are in the Dark srancourt-81034 Sign in Permalink This film was very Hunger Games-like, but definitely unique in its plot. The premise was interesting and kept my attention. I wasn't able to guess what was going to happen. I found myself questioning the entire time. There were a lot of novel ideas and new situations that keep the plot moving along. The most interesting feature of the movie was the dark cinematography, especially on the faces of the characters. I think it adds to the darkness of the situation and their loss of hope. It also speaks to the fact that all the characters are essentially "in the dark" about what is going on. At times the darkness was actually a strain on the eyes while watching and trying to figure out what is going on. In a way it puts the viewer a little more in the story because it is an obstacle to overcome like the many faced by the characters. Personally, I do not enjoy this feature, but I get its purpose.

5.0~Thrilling movie with an ending as bad as Lost (if not worse) masteroftofu Sign in Permalink ****THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS!**** I'll start this review by saying that the author of this story needs to take a basic 101 science class because this film/book was just insulting to our intelligence as human beings. I had heard good things about the book this movie was adapted from, and felt the concept would make an intense and awesome movie. So I went into this movie with nothing but good expectations. I'll even admit, i enjoyed 98% of the movie even though i had to turn my brain off a few times and ignore certain things. It was thrilling and had great special fx. But the biggest flaw to a film like this, is its reliance on having to explain the events that unfolded, and in that, the author of this story not only tanked, but made himself look like a complete idiot that has no clue how scientific methods work. 'were trying to find a cure for a virus, so we built this over elaborate maze and tortured you with cybernetic robots for 3 years' This is basically the half baked explanation we are force fed in the last 2 minutes of the movie. I'm sorry but why would scientists trying to develop and study a cure for a virus destroy their test subjects? What do giant cyborg spiders have to do with testing blood samples and reproducing a cure? Did this author do no research whatsoever into biological science, virus's, or the basic scientific method? None of these tests being done on these kids relate to anything. And in unveiling that the world is scorched by the sun, they opened up the biggest plothole of them all: HOW THE HELL WERE THEY LIVING IN A LUSCIOUS GREEN GRASSY TREE FILLED ENVIRONMENT AND NOT HOT AT ALL THE ENTIRE TIME, DESPITE BEING UNDER THAT SAME SCORCHING SUN THAT THEY SAID WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE UNDER?!?!?! The entire ending was like a giant horrific car wreck and one of the cars was full of baby puppies burning alive. I couldn't help but sit there gawking in horror and disbelief at what was happening before my eyes. And this was supposed to be a lead in to a sequel? All this ending made me want to do was get the same mind altering treatment they got to make me forget i ever even watched this one Heres what to expect from this film: -no explanation of why there were only guys in the maze -no explanation of why they suddenly introduced a girl at the end -no explanation of why they made the maze finally stop working after 3 years and allowed everyone to be slaughtered -no explanation of why the kids have a diagram of a maze that supposedly changes its layout every night (which they said was impossible to map out) -no character attachment whatsoever. when people die you seriously don't even care. even in the supposed-to-be-emotional ending scene the guy a couple reviews back pretty much broke the entire movie with his post 'why didn't they just build a ladder if they were there for 3 years and climb out' /entire trilogy done And from every source on the internet I've read, apparently the third book is even worse and the trilogy ending is beyond a car wreck, which means people should just avoid getting involved in this story at all
2.0~We don't need another one of these. santiagocosme Sign in Permalink I think when it comes to considering watching this movie you have to ask yourself a couple of questions: Am I an adult? Am I really into cinema? If you answered yes to either of these questions, or even more so, if you answered yes to both of them, you should honestly stay away from this. Unlike, some of the reviews I have read, I don't think the acting is particularly bad. The actors only do what they are requested by a script that honestly, didn't take years of brain picking. The film will remind you of hunger games, and other similar movies that seem to hook most teenagers and the sort of people who think Harry Potter or Lord Of the Rings are the best movies ever. And they are many out there... I am a fan of Haneke, Faith Hakin, Denis Villeneuve, Wong Kar Wai, Kim Ki Duk, and surely, the problem is that I should stick to my kind of cinema. It makes no sense watching this. Somehow though, I try to watch a movie a day, and when I read the plot I thought, it sounds interesting. 10 minutes into the movie, I knew it was "one of those". When it's not for you, it's not for you!
7.0~Not a perfect movie but entertaining agentagent Sign in Permalink Although this is not a perfect movie , it's still interesting . It will not waste your time by watching this film but for my opinion the book is better.
7.0~Surprisingly Fun and Provocative Teen SciFi matthewssilverhammer Sign in Permalink We are inundated with scifi young adult films based on books. Rarely do the terms "provocative" and "teen entertainment" fit in the same sentence with these movies. Maze Runner, however, with its Lord of the Flies inspired world and its "Lost" like mystery, overcomes its own muted tone and tired genre to be a surprisingly engaging outing. Would it be better if it had a more experienced and assured auteur behind the wheel? Absolutely, but the unique premise and twisting plot make for highly enjoyable fall movie-going. The film opens in fantastically bleak fashion, with our hero unknowingly stuck in a mysterious elevator which takes him to a land of other abandoned teenage boys, all enclosed by a giant dangerous maze. As he begins to learn what kind of world he is in, so do we, with the mystery and plot endlessly twisting and turning. Through some overly melodramatic but otherwise good performances, the movie takes us and our hero on a journey through scifi genres: the chosen one, zombie lore, Indiana Jones like action. It all culminates in some intense set-pieces and surprising story choices, which is more than we often get in this type of adolescent adventure. My affection for this film could be from my soft-spot for any scifi film that, at the very least, tries to be unique and surprising. The world is complete and well-realized, there is a believable premise, some cool insect-robot monsters, and even cool questions about the essence of identity. So even though much of the actual filmmaking is a bit by-the-numbers, the unraveling plot is a bunch of fun.
7.0~Nothing close to Katniss' Revolution, but Thrills Enough michael-sengwah Sign in Permalink Fox thinks that they might generate the same hype as what Lionsgate did for The Hunger Games, though it looks pretty decent, it never comes any closer to Katniss' revolution. It is properly story-driven and undeniable an intriguing young adaptation without any annoying unnecessary stuffs, changing the idea of Hunger Games with a maze and end the story just like Cabin in the Wood except that with some proper explanation do not really contribute to make the film looks brilliant, but more on recycling the same idea. When the film starts to break out to find an exit from the creepy and horrifying maze, the twisted ending is not really surprising but more to the mindset of the studio that they hint to produce more sequels. However, the performance of the young casts are good and the strong scores have actually made the adventure looks extremely thrilling.
9.0~Very exciting movie koheioguni Sign in Permalink This film makes me very excited since many characters face a lot of dangerous situations in order to save their life. The main character thomas is really suitable for main in this film in terms of his personality such as braveness, self confidence, and risk taker. If i get in this situation, I would not sacrifice myself in order to improve my life. This movie also depicts the deep human relationships through romance and fighting. I like the all character in this film and want to watch it again.
2.0~Don't waste your time. james-laurie Sign in Permalink Eye candy for teenage girls maybe. Otherwise forget it. I couldn't look at Will Poulter seriously after seeing We're The Millers anyway (now that is a film worth watching). Continually disappointing throughout. Plot is full of holes (not that I'll mention them, you can find out for yourself if you have the required time on your hands). I really would not bother. Another 'run of the mill' piece of garbage that will be forgotten before you can say "I wish I could get that time back in my life, I'd go and watch some grass grow". I don't understand how this is rated 7.4 Please people, come on now, really??? I rate this 2 out of ten.
8.0~It's good movie. sor_kimsear Sign in Permalink It's rare that an author who had written many novels since he starts his career and one of his novel was chosen to be a Hollywood movie and that 's really famous movie. The maze runner is a type of mystery, action, science-fiction movie. The movie starts and ends with the mystery, but it likely show us many clues to know what the mysteries are . Thomas is my favorite character in the movie. Thomas(main character) is a new comer of the glade. He is a curious man who wants to know the way to get out the glade ( is like a prison ). Even he met many obstacles while He was in the glade , he never gives up on finding the way to get out. Galley is one of Thomas obstacle. He always rejects Thomas's ideas and doesn't allow Thomase to be a runner and He wants to punish Thomas. But anyway, Thomas didn't give up and continued to find the way put until he got success. I have never meet this situation but it seems a bit real for me if we compare it to my real education life. It makes me to won't give up on anything. The mystery scenes are the scenes which are written particular well and all parts that have mystery scenes are my favorite parts. The movie makes me feel engaged with it. Even I have many positive points of this movie but it also has one point that make me feel dislike of it. The maze runner makes me feel so hard to care about the main the character because the grievers run more quickly than him. So i worry that how can he escape form the monsters. The movie definitely grip me to watch it again and again. I recommend this movie to all fan of mystery movie ans sci-fiction movie. You won't regret if You watch this movie .
5.0~An average ND predictable movie abhishek-naidu6 Sign in Permalink Nothing great nothing boring but it was an average movie without any explanation just boys running around ND fighting . It had the potential but it was lost throughout the movie no suspense no thrill . Kind of boring, rather predictable.its a 1 time watch
5.0~Light and fluffy agmoldham Sign in Permalink The Maze Runner is very much a film in the style of Hunger Games. Unfortunately there are no stand out actors such as Jennifer Lawrence to lift it into something more special. Having said that the movie is fairly entertaining and pretty decent way to spend a couple of hours on a flight which is where I watched it. The film tells the story of Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) who is dropped outdoors with his memory erased. It soon becomes apparent that they need to escape through the maze which is complete with an array of deadly obstacles. Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives as the sole female character. There isn't very much original material to be found in the Maze Runner, but if you are a fan of the Hunger Games you will probably find it a pretty entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.
4.0~What was the point of THAT? enojadacabra Sign in Permalink Though I credit the actors /actresses for their performances for the most part here. Time developing characters was poorly spent. And honestly, I defy anyone to leave a theater (home or commercial) after seeing such a movie without saying. "What was the point of THAT?". No back story, what storyline they DO provide is immediately proved fake (false suicide). So, there are just to many questions left unanswered to care about what's happening, or even consider seeing a sequel when odds are greatly in favor of it being the same waste of time this proved to be. Top this with a hundred holes in the plot. :/ Save your time and don't see this.
1.0~Don't watch this piece of trash, read the book jackedchicken Sign in Permalink I've recently read the book that this movie is based on, and I've got to say this this movie shucking sucks. (Get the reference ;);)) Why do I say this? Well, the two are COMPLETELY different. For a movie named after the book, I would not have thought that there would be as much difference as there was. The movie is like someone trying to create a movie out from only the summary of "The Maze Runner," only reading the names, the plot and so on, not getting anything right whatsoever. I could not make it 20 minutes into this movie, before I closed it and poured holy water over my laptop to surge out the defilement that I have caused it. If I hadn't read the book, then the movie would definitely be good, but as I have read the book, I thought this to be one of the worst book to film adaptations ever created. So, if you absolutely hated this piece of garbage as much as I did, and you didn't read the book, then please, read the book. It's better in every way possible.
