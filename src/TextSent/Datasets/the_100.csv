9.0~One of my faves samibeth Sign in Permalink I normally do not write reviews... and since it is now finals week for me I would count this as good. I remember seeing previews for The 100 here and there and wanted to watch it from them... but sadly since I do not have cable I could not and soon forgot about it. Then I noticed the first season on Netflix and it hooked me within the first episode. The characters are so unique in personality. There are some you love... some you hate then soon they flip flop! I am a big fan of how dark it is, because though it pushes the boundaries it does not break them. Just like a lot of other shows on The CW. Two of my other favorites being The Vampire Diaries and The Originals. I like how The 100 has a different view on the world and how it keeps you guessing through the episodes and seasons. You think one thing will happen and sometimes it does, but sometimes you are hit with a big turn around. Alright, though I could type more I am going to leave it at that.
1.0~Poor man's The Walking Dead! iegarry Sign in Permalink Innumerable plot holes, average acting, contrived at times, none of the leads that you get attached too. All in all an over rated series.
10.0~Definitely the best sci-fi show i have ever seen. And i have seen many. lukegllr Sign in Permalink This show has it all. Great characters, full of development, really impressive acting and writing (which only continues to get better with every season. In season 5 it is some of the best writing, specially acting on TV right now.), creative, exciting and unique storylines, and every one is different than the previous one. If you watch the 100, you definitely wont be bored. If you aren't watching the show, I recommend you go do that right now, and believe me, you wont regret it! It's a shame its as underrated as it is. And dont let the fact that its from the cw trick you... it is unlike any other show out there. No teen drama. There's a lot of action, great effects and awesome fight scenes. And so much more. IMPORTANT: Do not judge it on the first episode, I swear that it gets so, so much better. It really starts to come together on episode 3 or 4
2.0~Mass murderers emilianofuksas Sign in Permalink The body count starts with sending 100 kids to a presumed poisoned Earth, only to discover the planet is actually safe, OK, no killing there but the intention was clear. After a quick 'Lord of the Flies' prelude and a few occasional murders, executions and tortures, the gang lead by Clarke manage to kill about 400 'grounders'. A few more hundreds (or thousands) die in the crash of the landing ships. A brutal execution of unarmed grounders kills about 20. After discovering that the president of the 'not savage'(?) grounders intends to drop a missile on a camp hosting a meeting of the now allied 'sky-people' and 'grounders' tribes, nobody says anything and let thousands die - nice! The retribution comes soon after, a tricked and determined Clarke manages to sneak inside the Mount Weather compound where the remainder of the 'before the apocalypse' people live and ruthlessly SHE KILLS THEM ALL! So, basically in about 4-5 weeks they manage to kill what one can assume it's about half of the population of the area where the 100 kids landed. Not bad at all!
4.0~Good idea but this is the end of the "good" in this TV show dan_conde1982 Sign in Permalink The idea is not new , but is a nice idea for a SF TV Show. The story seems promising at the beginning but over the seasons nothing is changed in the plot. The same characters who just fight theoretically for salvation of the human race but they just kill itch other, over and over . They are all bad, you can't like no one in this TV shows. The leading characters are painted just like serial killers and nothing more ... good idea but a very lame TV show. The true is I was watching this show just to see when they killed the not so sexy and not so talented main character 😂 P.S. don't waste your time with this Show!!! ;)
1.0~bad acting, bad ploting flacaanonima Sign in Permalink Just that. I give this series almost half first season. There was no way that i consider this crap somewhat plausible to watch. The acting is deprorable, the plot is wasted. This can only be liked by teenagers that doesn't have any experience in good acting and good plot....
3.0~I never saw such a foolish story line TV show. ssohan-31689 Sign in Permalink First of all, every leader is a girl even wilder's leader. is it joke?
10.0~Surprise Great show Found by Accident sf_nicole Sign in Permalink So I am going through shows on Netflix looking for something to fill the gaps between Game of Throwns and The Walking Dead. I found this show by pure chance. I decided to start watching it and could not stop. Interesting plot line and compelling characters, it is actually a network show and I get that network but I never have seen a promo for it. It is another show I want to see go on for many more seasons.
3.0~Impressive... jack02 Sign in Permalink ...ly bad. I've watched five seasons and plan to continue, out of a sense of duty or habit more than anything. Series pros: There was one decent episode in the middle of season three, and it's the lowest rated one on this site! Fun to laugh at how dumb it is. Sometimes. Series cons: Characters never make logical decisions. Characters are wildly inconsistent. Consistently inconsistent, even. Even when you think you know what they would do based on what you've watched so far, they won't. Horrible corny dialogue, where one character will say something and you know the exact hokey line the other character will respond with. Giant, enormous, distracting false eyelashes on all the women. They're fighting for their lives with limited resources, but they always have time to put their lashes on, from their hidden, infinite supplies. Plot armour. Yes, main characters die occasionally, but never when they actually should, and less and less over time. Two main characters could have died at the end of season four and the show would have been better for it, but of course they don't. Countless characters survive the end of season five illogically, then the writers arbitrarily decide some other characters will leave the show instead. The two characters in my previous point then go on to create all the conflict in season five. One in particular is basically the villain of the season, but the writers don't treat her that way at all. Countless very poor creative decisions. At one point, a group of characters fight to the death in a sort of tournament. Do any of the somewhat interesting supporting characters survive, or just the most boring main characters? You can guess the answer. I could go on and on, all the more if I watched the show again from the start and took notes as I did so, but unless someone paid me to do that, there's no way that's happening.
10.0~Starts annoying, gets better and better with each episodes deschenes-phil Sign in Permalink In all honesty, after the two first episodes, me and my wife wanted to quit. The teen characters really got on our nerves. At this point, we would've given a 2/10 rating. We finally decided to give it another chance and from episode 3 to mid season 2 (where I'm at at the moment of this review), I can say that every episode gets better and better to the point that I cannot wait to see the next one. I understand now that the writers probably wanted to show the personality changes from brainless teen idiots to more complex, dark characters due to their environment. Yep, there are holes here and there in terms of realism, but the fact is that we are utterly entertained, and there are many "WTF!" moments. Extreme pace, great intertwined storyline (Grounders/Montain people/Reapers, etc.), many great characters, great overall environment design and costumes. Oh, and did I mention : VERY ENTERTAINING!!!
10.0~I think it's an amazing show, the first few episodes are pretty bad but if you give it a chance it'll get better :) kotypresents Sign in Permalink I started watching the show in 2015 and i still love it, there were some episodes that i didn't like but the show's still amazing. If someone wants to start watching it, it's worth it :) I love the characters in the show, they're very unique and developed. P.S:Sorry for my English :c
9.0~Great show! cdymally Sign in Permalink Season 1 took a while to find it's footing, but the site has been amazing since season 2. Clarke and Bellamy are the core of the show. There are no good guys and that's different and refreshing.
8.0~It's getting better with each episode zhenekas Sign in Permalink Should be ranked higher and deserves more attention. It does start with a bunch of plot holes and a few terrible episodes in the first season, but it's getting much better later on. Like some reviewers say just breeze through the first season and wait for awesome stuff to happen If you like the genre (post apocalyptic that is ) it's great and easy to get hooked on. Pretty good on violence. One thing is very annoying is that writers are holding on to the characters, but i guess we got spoiled by Game of thrones and Walking Dead being bold in this department. So if you into fantasy, apocalyptic stuff go ahead start watching it. I give it 8 out of 10.
8.0~If you like the Hunger Games you're going to love this adi-bac3 Sign in Permalink Seriously don't understand all the negative reviews- to the point where I'm starting to wonder if theres something wrong with my taste. I loved this show from the first episode- it's got a very cool lord of the flies/ hunger games vibe to it- it's not grusome or difficult to watch, the characters are very likable, it's got heart and tons of friendship, basically a bunch of teens trying to survive in nature (or rather nuked nature that changes the survival game a bit.) lots of actors that are easy on the eyes (Shallow I know... But it's the truth :) what's not to like?
7.0~Decent show that gets overwhelmed by teenage-drama subplots edhuang-toronto Sign in Permalink Watching this show, you have to understand that it's basically a YA or youth-oriented premise. The sets are very good, and there are some strong set pieces and basic plot lines. The drama and characters can, at times, shine in the stark reality that the characters must learn to live. However, what drags this show down from being an excellent sci-fi series for the ages, is the over-use of overly dramatic stand-offs. Characters will suddenly act a certain way or make decisions for no other purpose other than to create drama, or tension with another character later on. Almost all action sequences will be inter-cut by characters "pausing" to address these emotional drama issues that were obviously created just an episode before to set up such a confrontation. There isn't a single decision made that isn't also used to put characters against each other for future plot use. If this obvious soap-opera technique was not used as much, this show would be much much better. Basically, don't get too attached to any character because they will make decisions that contradict earlier traits or their established character just so the writers can create more dramatic conflict later. It's like every event in the story must be mixed with over the top betrayal and emotional conflict.
5.0~Flawed, but premise and plot twists kept me hanging on regardless tristanpronk Sign in Permalink Let me start off by saying I'm usually the type to hit the kill switch on any movie or show that reveals it's stupidity early on. In the 100, that moment comes pretty soon. But the premise appealed to me so I was willing to hang on for a little longer. Just long enough to be around for the plot to make it's first interesting twist. More were to follow. And although the whole (at least after the first three seasons, but that's a lot) has a bit of a shallow feel to it (the musical intermezzo's sure don't help) and the plot has some pretty big holes and cheap getaways on offer, I was entertained and am now waiting for the 4th season. If you are looking for something truly substantial, you won't find it here. But at the core, it tells a story that's worth hearing out. I can't say I'd recommend it, but I can't say I wouldn't either. If you're on a serious mission to kill some time and you don't know what to go for, I'd say it's worth it. Light, but definitely not completely bland.
1.0~who watches this? kopoko Sign in Permalink It's been 2 seasons, and to my shock it's up to episode 13. Who the hell watches this? teenagers? old people? I just don't get it. it's so awful it's ridiculous. It has a like 10 people on r e d d i t who follow it. 10 people. If one could get cancer from the TV then surely this would be a contender. Ebola, AIDS, West Nile fever all in one transmitted straight into your brains. It's been 2 seasons, and to my shock it's up to episode 13. Who the hell watches this? teenagers? old people?

2.0~OVERRATED... People need to know... the cast is a joke... pavanki-67595 Sign in Permalink The cast... the main characters, especially Clarke and Raven are a joke, to be honest they are not acting but over-acting... direction is amateur... 'Under the Dome' is far far better than this, the cast is strong, they know what they are doing and the story is strong too with a brilliant direction... I bet whoever has seen 'Under the Dome' would agree with me totally... GO WATCH 'Under the Dome', if you still dare to watch 'The 100' I am sure that you will start cursing the characters like you never did before...
10.0~In one word Entertaining! dyutijaha Sign in Permalink I was not at all into this genre of TV shows/movies, more into the comedies. So I was randomly browsing Netflix and started watching The 100, and what can I say...I got hooked to it. The show has a good plot to start with and now has multiple story lines (I'm talking about season 2 & I hope it's not a spoiler), which makes me more curious to know what's about to happen next. It might seem like it's a teen thing...but once you realize how all the characters grow with time and how they blend with the plot it's pretty entertaining. And I personally think the makers did a good casting and most of them are doing good at acting their roles. Though I feel Raven overacts at times. So in a nutshell, The 100 seems to be a on good start as they proceeded to season 2. I hope they will make their storyline more interesting and mature the characters further.
8.0~Keeps getting better season on season, dark post-apocalyptic science fiction drama mayank09876 Sign in Permalink The 100 is a post-apocalyptic science fiction drama, it got an interesting idea working for itself. The story revolves around on how humanity survives on a space station called the Ark after a nuclear war has made Earth inhabitable, the rules are strict, everything is rationed and there is less than four thousands of humanity left. After 97 years the Ark has run out of time so they decided to send a group of 100 juvenile criminals to Earth to see if it's survivable, their crimes are simple stuff like stealing food or getting drunk. (3/5) Season One: It was good, with lots of action and events happening both on the Ark and the ground. The episodes revolve around the question of leadership and survivability. On the ground there are the grounders hunting down the 100 and on the Ark there is a race against time with limited oxygen supply. All the characterizations are good, no straight good guy or bad guy, making for complex and compelling characters. The season was full of cheesy dialogues, poor script and some minor plot holes but it still manages to give us some gems and plenty of unexpected moments. The season ended on a high note with the introduction of the mountain man. (2/5) Season Two: The story revolves around the three distinct groups struggle with each other - Sky people (People from Ark) vs The Grounders vs The Mountain men. Alliances are made among them and how this brings internal divide among each of the individual group. The plot holes and character flip made me frustrated. In trying to surprise us they just threw storytelling and plot out of the equation. Yes, there are plenty of twist n turns, gritty scenes and many gems but overall I was annoyed. That didn't stop me from binge watching it, its entreating but vexing. (5/5) Season Three: I loved it, the AI A.L.I.E bought the craziness to a whole new level, we also get a lot of historical background on what actually happened to lead to the apocalypse. With a distinct central villain who is someone other than a human, we can blame all the mess and suffering on someone other than mankind for change. Also, the city of light brings in great world building to this dystopian world. This season is full of edge of seat situations, emotionally fuelled confrontations and central cast members getting killed. The plotting and pacing are extremely fast paced with plenty of well-crafted fight sequences and superb unexpected benders. I did feel some of the dialogues and question on moral boundaries was not needed this late in the series but they were just a few minutes of those. This was by far the best season for the series yet. (5/5) Season Four: The end of the world is here ones again, with it the race to save humanity with each clan trying to be the one to survive. Alliances are made and broken frequently, people drop to new lows to survive. Loved how they make these people turn into what they fought against in earlier seasons. The series keep growing on me, by now I have stopped vexing when a nice character takes questionable decision on matters of life or death. The ground rule is clear the creators of the show will keep throwing the question of moral dilemma, the human brain vs heart, the complexity of personal emotions and the conflict of what's the right decision, where to draw the line. This series had some popular one-liners one of them being "Maybe there are no good guys" which best describes everyone in the series. The season ends on a high with some crazy twist n turns.
1.0~DO NOT WATCH-This show is dangerously traumatic for oppressed communities. jskye-72308 Sign in Permalink This show needs to be removed from the Network. No should have to bare witness to the horrific third season. The racist and colonialist undertones become clear. A black man is shot at point blank rank execution style in the mud. They utilize incredibly harmful and quite frankly disgusting tropes such as, women in refrigerators, killing queer characters, specifically lesbians, and having bi characters suffer after every lover. This show had such potential after season two ended that I am simply appalled at the direction is has taken. It's use of religious stories and iconography is blatantly disrespectful. This form of story telling is gross and dangerous. To see a main character continue to be abusive both to his sister and his friend is contributing to the cycle of abuse that young women face. I used to be proud of the diversity on this show and of how feminist it was. I can't believe I was ever so blind as to put my trust in this industry. It is not a mistake I will make again. Please remove season 3 from international servers, and do not make season 3 available for anyone to see. I've hated to see the 1OO it become such a disturbing show. It's become pornographic in terms of shock value, senseless violence, and sexual assault. Don't ever watch or support this filth.
7.0~A joke of a sci-fi, completely unrealistic with questionable plot holes - but enjoyable if you get over the hump lorcanrees Sign in Permalink The first two episodes are are not only incomprehensibly unrealistic, (a recurring theme) but are also badly directed, with poor acting. If you persevere beyond that point, you're most likely to find it highly entertaining; the character pool is rather interesting, as well as the ways they develop and the clashing of personalities, as well as the inevitable action that the show entails due to the presence of Grounders. However, if you're a picky watcher who refuses to accept anything that contradicts the world of science, do not even bother. There are an uncountable number of things in this show that goes against what 'would' and 'should' happen in this particular scenario. To name a few: everyone, and I mean everyone has a Northern American accent There are 100 juveniles out of 4000, that are all roughly the same age After 96 years, they spontaneously decide to send 100 people down, all of which are young healthy people, something that would be vital for the preservation of the human race They don't send them down with any source of communication other than a wrist band that monitors their heart rate In season 3, the transmission of blood between those who are not affected by radiation and to those who are, would not have the effect of completely eradicating what radiation does to the tissue Blood types? The radiation level on the arc are very different to that on the ground that has undergone nuclear disasters. Its a bit of a stretch to assume they'd be immune. And if they were, why did no one think of this in 96 years. They talk about natural selection of the Grounders being responsible for their survival. Its been 96 years... Somehow, the only living people on earth are positioned directly next to where the 100 landed - oh and they have resided to prehistoric dressing and hunting styles. It seems as if whenever someone NEEDS to get to the ground, there is suddenly a giant revelation in which they devise a way to do so, as well as succeeding against the insurmountable odds. Every injury is healed within what seems like a number of days despite the blatant lack of equipment. And there are more, much much more. However, if that sort of stuff doesn't bother you, and you are looking for something that will entertain you with a combination of plot twists and action, then I'd recommend the show. Season 2 does a good job of continuing on from Season 1 which sets a strong enough setting, so there's a essence of fluidity. (Have not yet watched the third season so I can't comment on that)
6.0~a cheesy serial movies putraleo-79859 Sign in Permalink I think that this movies can do little better with the story line, every decisions the main characters choose sometimes make us thinking "is this the correct way to make a movies?". The things was this movies full of BS. I hope that the every ending of this serial season can be closed with perfectly and nicely job. In season 3 all of the people from the second spaceship can just say " If Farm Station don't want to listen then just walk out from this land."
10.0~The 100 kleemorgan Sign in Permalink I love this show. I hope the story line continues to hold me on the edge of my seat. I don't care if it is far fetched for some. Not for me. You would expect teenagers and kidults to be far more intelligent than we are now anyway. People this young will not get sick as their adult peers would, although I would expect babies to be popping out everywhere unless of course they have an automated birth control thing going on. Rampant jealousies that we are seeing on a low level would be typical for this environment. They need to elect specific jobs for the right people. We haven't seen this yet. They would have to do job interviews so that eventually we would get to meet ALL the survivors. Long reign "The 100". Nth Qld'er
1.0~Another low life, low budget series. pantazopdim Sign in Permalink 1 out of ten rating is just too much. So is watching the first five or six episodes of season one. I have to agree with all negative reviews. All in all, there is nothing realistic or even justifiable in the 100. It is clear that the series has no specific plot and is willing to follow whatever script path makes its primary target audience happy. And who that audience may be? Twelve to fifteen years old, no doubt. For the rest of us, there is nothing to be expected from the 100. Do the kids want black painted eye pilgrims from the medieval ages? No problem. Do they want invinsible, charming good guys with an inclination to rural sex? Sure. But apart from those two corner stones this series is nothing more than another low life, low budget, less than mediocre TV show that succeeds in one thing: to make angrier and angrier every time you watch the first few minutes of an episode. Sad.
9.0~I don't know why there are so many bad reviews. kittycatcaity Sign in Permalink I was hooked from episode one, I didn't think that this show would be amazing but now I am binge watching the whole series. People say that it has bad acting, plot holes and bad scripting, but I think that it's a pretty good series and that people should give it a chance. Not everyone will be hooked on episode one, but keep watching, I think it's worth it.
1.0~High school drama that wants to be a Sci-fi show citrus-istari Sign in Permalink The premise for the show is actually good, a great idea that could have been a great show, but "The 100" completely fails with the execution. It is nothing but a hormone infested high school drama masked as a Sci-fi show. 100 kids are sent to a previous radioactive unlivable Earth to determine if the planet is suitable for life again, great idea right? But what's the first thing these kids do when they get there? Separate into groups of who's cool and who isn't, while anyone speaking reason that they need to find shelter/food/anything else required to survive, are just bullied and threatened with their life. As well as the normal pointless "girl likes class clown guy who likes the girl that is serious and won't pay attention to him." It's a joke how silly this is, you're the first people to step foot on Earth in 100 years and you just want to fight amongst yourselves about who's cool and who gets the girl? Save yourself an hour and don't watch it.
7.0~More of the same marc_to Sign in Permalink It's the apocalypse people! The most important fact I learned from the pilot, all the script writers died in the blast. In the future, 12 nations are opening up space malls for the rich and famous, just in time for the end of the world! Phew... that was close. Good thing we stocked these things with enough urine filters to last generations. We also included enough space to house 100 inmates for the really scary crimes like littering. Then we give them crayons and let them vandalize their cells to their hearts content. This show is working the plot check list pretty hard. Love triangle in the making? Check, hell let's double down on that. Wonky bare bones scifi premise, no problem. How's that work? Science bitch! My personal favourite moment is the swim suit calendar they decide to shoot as they take a little dip in a pond. Sadly, we are interrupted by "river monster" who proceeds to hug attack one of the shows hotties before dropping her to go check out a rock. Do not fear, "river monsters" may appear to brutally murdering you, but they actually just want to play. Let's put a band-aid on that and pretend like nothing happened. Holding my breath for a non magic explanation for how the surface is not an irradiated wasteland. My theory about why all the 100 appear to be brain dead bumpkins? I think the Chancellor's been saving oxygen by cutting the supply going to the prison cells. It explains so much! Here's hoping the next few episodes turn my expectations around.
10.0~Love it! mjwebster-82148 Sign in Permalink This movie is truly amazing to get hooked on two. It's been two days and I am on season three and its jaw dropping, you will sweat and hide under your covers. The acting is cheesy though the adventure and the things the characters do is amazing. You will see the first couple episodes are a little bit cheesy and bad but once you work your way up the episodes you will find out things that will drop your jaw, and it gets so much better when you watch more then a couple episodes. I am hooked on it and I recommend watching this on Netflix 100 percent. --- (NOT Important THEYS EXTRA LINES)(NOT Important THEYS EXTRA LINES)(NOT Important THEYS EXTRA LINES)vvv(NOT Important THEYS EXTRA LINES)(NOT Important THEYS EXTRA LINES)(NOT Important THEYS EXTRA LINES)(NOT Important THEYS EXTRA LINES)
10.0~Post-apocalyptic science fiction done ... right? tomislav-nikolic000 Sign in Permalink As I described it to my gamer friend, "This show went from Far Cry Primal to Fallout 4 real floating fast", as in what he can expect from this show story-wise. Even after 4 seasons today, The 100 is a refreshment among TV shows filled with filler episodes and deus ex machina clichés. The 100 gives you everything you need to know about what is happening, on a nice silver platter supported by hours and hours of character development. And it is still shocking, touching, tense and immersive, keeping it's charm throughout every minute. I have never had to watch 1 or more episodes before a mystery in the previous episode was resolved (I'm looking at you "13 reasons why"), or gone through a filler episode where just one underdeveloped character was being worked on. For the post-apocalypse sci-fi side of the show; it's a little bit of both but in a big way. The 100 stands out from other shows in the same genre by constantly exploring and evolving, and when they do make a mistake, it's a viewers mistake, because you can easily forget that this is fiction. Well written, well executed fiction, to the point where you can lose yourself in it. The CGI doesn't help you notice it, but there is CGI, trust me. And all of it is supported by amazing acting. The way they can transmit emotions and thoughts through the camera is down-right insane. It's personal every time, and you will not be left out; whether it's a shocking revelation, a gut-wrenching moment, a sigh of relief or all of it together, you won't be able not to sympathize with the characters. TL;DR: It's one of those shows where you can genuinely be bummed out, smiling, and/or tearing up just from what has happened in the latest episode. And you'll come back for more.
9.0~Something different with a little bit of everything jasonsweat Sign in Permalink This show is not for everyone. It's more of an adult show in my opinion. I will start with a few of it's weaknesses. The writing is a bit flawed at times. Some things won't make much sense and some things will happen that will leave you puzzled in a bad way. Bits and pieces can be misconstrued at times leaving some of the plot to be confusing. The acting is a bit weak all around, provided that the show is mostly fresh or young actors. Some cheesy lines and moments will have you wanting the scene to hurry up and not be as drawn out. Now let's talk about all the good which leave me giving this show a solid 9 review. The show is just different all around. It combines a post-apocalyptic setting with sci-fi elements and adds a bit of suspense, action, even horror at times, mystery, and even some revolving love stories to keep the show humanized. The writing is great as far as the plot goes. Plenty of twists, tradgedies, and action to keep any viewer on the edge of their seat. I didn't give the acting much praise in the cons of the show but they still pull it off and make the effort to portray something realiatic in an unordinary setting. Isiah Washington was a great heel and really helped the show as one of it's very few main name actors. The show is consistent with the way the plot twists every season but changes enough to keep viewers thinking and interested. The show displays the proper amount of emotion but adds loss, pain, and gruesome feels on top of it to keep the show gripping and quite binge worthy. The characters are great and there is plenty to go around. All in all, if you're looking for something different, this show might be for you.
9.0~Its actually still good after 5 seasons most series drop off after s2-3 markthetntguys Sign in Permalink So id like to start by saying it had some downs but overall it has been great. But this series has the best Character growth and development: Murphy,Raven,Clarke. It may not be scientifically accurate, but its Fiction, you dont say Harry Potter couldnt do it because magic doesnt exist. so Season 1: The 100 reach the ground meet grounders they fight and it slowly leads into S2, the first few episodes are meh, but finally it starts rolling and is actually good, the emotions in it are feelable, and character development is one of the biggest in every series. S2: The 100 are locked and try to escape id rate this season the 2nd best S3: now ALIE this is perfect i loved it character growth, so much plot and its all fitting together S4: World is dying and its the best Season gotta say, all that development S5: I mean, this season was a little off. Clarke i mean she had so much change, obviously but her character was like trashed for me atleast then Octavia was about so rightly portrayed, because the power got into his head. So now to invidual characters I didnt like that Kane was shown like a villain in start of S1 and then randomly he does a 180* and changes totally he even tried killing Griffin but later they fall in love. Clarke i mean what he changed everything between S1-S2-S3 orientation, hair color and then in S5 her character did another 180* like her character has probably gone through most changes. Murphy-Well brilliant, he goes from what a bully who killed 2 people into a great survivor, i mean he knows what he wants and whats best for him, and he has become a great manipulator.

5.0~Not as good as I expected fixxx-informal Sign in Permalink From the very start it looked way too rushed, skipped through important story to end up in a high-school-like environment, just with lots of death. And that death is almost unnoticed alongside all the "drama". Shallow, under-thought and utterly boring. My expectation was that the characters could be adults or at least act like them but none have a serious bone inside. The production value is OK for me, but jeez-Louise its extremely cheesy. Was barely able to finish Season 1 with the finger on fast forward and sincerely hoped to find a few scenes of substance. If you like to watch teen age soap operas I can wholeheartedly recommend this.
10.0~One of the most entertaining television shows out there! jsanch Sign in Permalink After reading a barrage of negative user reviews, I felt compelled to defend what I consider one of the most entertaining television shows I've seen. Few series have had me as engaged and eager to continue watching as The 100. The only ones that come to mind are Game of Thrones, Firefly, Chuck and Breaking Bad. First, I'd like to point out that the acting and special effects in the first few episodes were dismal. They were difficult to watch and my wife and I came close to giving up on the series. Luckily, we didn't because the show progressively gets better in terms of acting, character development, special effects and plot. By the latter part of the first season the show is remarkably entertaining and well made. You see a great transformation in young and immature teenage characters that are faced with harsh realities on the ground and the need to move from anarchy to a more structured society that slowly starts to resemble that of the arc they left behind. The characters are multi-dimensional and flawed, which is something I truly enjoy in a show. The show explores questions of morality and what it means to be good and bad. People are faced with tough decisions and ethical dilemmas and its very entertaining to see how they face them. The show has unexpected plot twists. Important characters die (permanent deaths). Heroines don't always get away with their plans. There are trust dilemmas, power struggles and politics. The show has the just the right number of concurrent story lines. The latter is one of the things I particularly enjoy more about this series, especially when contrasted with a show like Game of Thrones where you have so many different story lines that the overall narrative progresses rather slowly. Episodes of The 100 progress at an excellent pace that leave you satisfied, yet eager to watch more. Most of the series critics point to scientific fallacies and some story flaws present in the show. I agree that the story contains fallacious science and some story flaws; however, given that this is a fictional television series I don't see why they are unable to see past those details and enjoy the show for what it is. Yes, you would be unable to generate 1G of gravity on the arc based on the technology we have today. Yes, it seems illogical that they have bracelets to measure vitals but lack a basic Geiger counter to measure radiation. Yes, people seem to heal rather quickly and well from all these stab and gun wounds. But who cares. This isn't a documentary. As with other fictional action shows I accept these points and lose myself in a thrilling world where great characters must overcome extraordinary challenges to survive. In summary, if you enjoy science fiction, multi-dimensional characters, post-apocalyptic story lines, action, moral/ethical dilemmas and/or great plot twists, I highly suggest you watch The 100. Get past the first few episodes and know that the show gets better and better as it progresses. By the end of the first season you will be hooked. At the end of the second season you'll see that this is one of the most underrated television series out there.
1.0~Unbelievable ( No, Really! ) Fun-Gus Sign in Permalink The premise for the movie is fairly good, but the sheer number of ludicrous actions and fallacies involving anything from fighting and hugging people while tripping on nuts, to grabbing a tiny 556mm round and stabbing a guy in the neck with it, etc... There are so many things wrong with every part of each episode that it just cannot hold up to any form of logic whatsoever. The people giving this show good ratings must have never read a book(non-fiction), read a newspaper, or went to school. They can have no understanding or even the slightest concept of what common sense is or means. I cannot believe this made into actual production. This is obviously aimed at the "New Society" created by Hollywood and the political left, i.e. a bunch of poverty stricken, dumber than a box of rocks, illiterate but somehow registered democrat voters. It is not even the slightest bit realistic! How is this happening?
7.0~Teenage Sci-fi itz_henry_jai Sign in Permalink There are a lot of nasty reviews only for the first episode of this new TV show. Keep in mind that majority of CW shows target young adults. Sure, the story, setting, characters may seem inaccurate as one reviewer mentioned - how everyone on the Arc is nicely groomed despite being confined and resources are near depletion or how the females all have the luxury of having makeup on their faces. I agree, it looks silly. But, personally speaking, I actually enjoyed the first episode. I am a huge sci-fi fan and when the main casts are teenagers my age (I am 23 years old), that is even better. The show takes place 97 years after planet Earth has been decimated by nuclear bombs. Growing up, I definitely can relate to the characters portrayed in this show. I'm not sure if those "nasty" reviewers are aware, but the show did mention that 100 DELINQUENT teenagers are sent back to Earth in hopes to repopulate and live there once again. The keyword is delinquent. Obviously you will see teenage riots, bullying the weak, fighting for alpha, attractive teenagers and more violence. Again, the target audience is young adults. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I don't think it's ideal to just base your judgment on a single episode. Hopefully the next episode will get better and give a chance for the actors/actresses to fit into their roles.
4.0~i believe the show has lost its way similiar to the walking dead. good grief! jckercher Sign in Permalink This season is dragging on. octavia is cracked. clark is obsessed with madi. people are being killed for no reason. friends become enemies, enemies become friends. it is stupid. i can't see how it could possibly end with a "Kum Ba Yah" moment. there will be no one left standing.
5.0~You might like it if you're a teenager or have really low standards aleminio Sign in Permalink I've been looking for a new show to watch and decided to go through the reviews here on IMDB. I decided to eventually watch it out of the curiosity to see why it gets so much hate even though it has a decent average score. I've seen two main reasons why people didn't like it. 1. Too many scientifically unrealistic parts 2. It's more of a "teen drama" than anything else. On the other hand, others were saying that the first few episodes are boring but then it gets better with some amazing story, and plot twists that won't shame "game of thrones". Eventually I was able to watch until about the middle of the second season and I couldn't watch it any more. Why do people watch movies/tv shows? Because it's a way to escape the reality for a while. We like to imagine a different world with a different set of rules or scenarios. A scenario can be something that is theoretically possible, like a nuclear war that ruins the world, or it can be something completely imaginary, like a Zombie Apocalypse or a world with Magic and Dragons. Once those rules are set, I want to see what would happen and how would people react in that given situation. In this show, we're talking about our world, 100 years from now. As a viewer, that's the world I am trying to imagine. But it's hard to do so when they are making up stuff that is absolutely unrealistic scientifically. Then I read excuses such as "It's a movie, it shouldn't be realistic, take it as it is". That's a silly excuse for a stupid script that nobody bothered to correct. If you're making up stuff that doesn't make sense in the "set of rules" that the story is based on, then you're completely ruining the entire experience. Instead of enjoying the thing, the viewer gets bothered with thoughts such as "that's not possible", "I can't imagine that", "that's stupid". It will happen to you every episode in this show. Most commonly the miraculous way everyone heal their critical wounds within a day or two. Personally I can ignore all the scientific issues and focus on the story and the characters, but here the "teen drama" comes to the picture. Yes, we're talking about 100 teens and we'll see drama, but that's not the issue. One problem is the banal and really stupid dialogues and actions of the "heroes". Everything looks so fake and exaggerated. "NO! You are going to die!" - "But I have to do it, he would", "Oh, ok, do it". That's the type of conversations you will see over and over and over again. How can you relate to any of the character when none of their behavior look natural? The acting isn't that good as well. So it isn't enough that the script is bad, but they also say it in a way that reminds me a play at school and not professional actors. It isn't just the dialogues, it's everything about the script and the way it was filmed that makes it so unrealistic, silly and exaggerated. Everything they do will be dramatic, always nearly a death experience. And if they die, you'll be asking yourself why didn't they duck, why didn't they run, why did they stand right in the middle of the road instead of hiding behind the trees. Why do 4 characters stand and watch their friend hanging with a rope which is tied to a tree but nobody's thinking to hold the rope just in case or at least check that the tie is safe. Some basic common sense. I'd give more examples but I don't want to give spoilers. And the plot? those people who talked about all the amazing twists. Are you kidding me?! what are you talking about?! The main characters seem to have 99 souls, you can be positive that they will find a way to survive anything even when it's impossible, over and over again. It's not a twist, it's just dumb. Same thing about the "mountain man", a perfect place which turns to be hiding a big secret. wow, haven't seen that coming... Some people were comparing the level of those "Plot Twists" to Game Of Thrones. I am not even a huge GoT fan, but comparing this banal plot to GoT is an insult to intelligence. It still earned the 5 from me because the story is still somehow entertaining. I am taking it more of a comedy than anything serious. But don't bother with it, you'll find better things to watch.
1.0~LOL stnci Sign in Permalink One of the dumbest shows I have ever seen. Some good actors, for Canadians. The core theme in this show is nobody remembers long enough to get revenge.
2.0~high-school teen "drama" for brainless idiots pitikuss-726-728627 Sign in Permalink ..first words from human landing on earth after 100 years of watching from orbit: "We're back bitcheeeeees!" ..that says it all.. ..it's so brainless it hurts... ...like is probably the intended audience... ..idiotic, egocentric, hormone-driven - overall brainless ... ..seriously..after 100 years of forced barely survival in space station the humans are not able to invent technology to check on earth status (but they have bracelets which they can track on earth without issues) ? Did you check how much we progressed in last 50 years ? How come (and why)they still have "old style" projectile-based guns ? ...looks like they all generally lost ability to think logically..strange...considering the few last humans saved on space stations must have been "the best earth wanted to save"... Hope they improve the show very fast, as the idea itself is not bad. If they don't, it will not last for new session.
1.0~Used to be good, but..... tstrelevitz Sign in Permalink This show used to be amazing. Well written, interesting plot, good characters.... then came season 3. Season 3 has completely destroyed the show. Deaths went from realistic (everyone dies, stuff happens) to shock value. The writers have alienated the LGBT+ and POC communities that used to follow the show because of the strong LGBT+ and POC characters by killing those characters in disgusting ways. Everyone may die, but they don't need to die in such a pathetic, meaningless way that sends a message that these people can't be happy. The manner of SPOILER Lincoln's death was very degrading (did the writer's not think that having a POC character kneeling in chains might produce a negative reaction from the community that suffered for years under slavery?) And Lexa's death following immediately after her one happy love scene just said that the LGBT+ community is not allowed to be happy, or to have any representation in the media that isn't killed off (Lesbian death trope anyone?) END SPOILER. I used to love this show. Its so sad that they ruined a show with such amazing potential by deaths harmful to the communities watching and writing that is becoming generally sh*ttier.
10.0~Just like Lost. Not Original livemoo1 Sign in Permalink This show reminds me of another show that came out about 11 years ago. It was called Lost. The 100 is just like it. A group of people are stranded and don't know where they really are and there is a group in the area and the main group are fighting them. This show takes it a little different because it's earth and also has a space station, but the show tries to hard to be different and original. The show has a young good looking man named Bellemy(Sawyer), and they seem close. Running from the law shooting a man. Except, Sawyer is cooler and much more interesting than this character. This show is alright and I will continue to watch it but it in unoriginal in the most part and will remind me of Lost every time I watch it.
10.0~Keeps me on the edge of my seat kaspercmhermans Sign in Permalink I'm not gonna pretend that the serie is flawless - it's not even close to that. But it is a show that has kept me on the edge of my seat for 4,5 seasons, with great action, some good dialogues (not all of them), a lot of twist and turns and lot's of other exciting elements. Funny thing is that I almost felt the need to turn it off, somewhere in the first 3-4 episodes. It felt too much like one of those teenager things. Untill Charlotte first killed Wells and jumped from the cliff just one episode later. 'Hang on', I said to myself. 'This might be interesting.' And yes, it has been! Now looking back on those first episodes it actually makes sense that they were a bit of Riverdale-like. I mean, what else would you espect from 101 young criminals? But they understood that they needed to mature if they wanted to survive and with them the series matured. With the highlight (so far) episode 5.13. I was expecting a big fight, but instead they gave us one of the most emotional goodbyes/deaths I've ever seen. Just amazing. One more thing: about the Lexa death. Yes, it wasn't memorable, I know. But in a way I think it is kinda cool. I mean in a serie like this you are always expecting that a character like Lexa will die in a heroic way. By doing it so sudden with a stray bullet, it kinda of gave an extra dimension to the show. That there doesn't need te be a built-up to someone's death. No matter who or what you are: It can happen anytime to anyone in any way. And I think in a way that is realy cool.
10.0~The 100 - Give it a shot! Nickelaus Sign in Permalink Going into The 100, I wasn't expecting much. I knew enough about the initial plot line to know that I probably wasn't interested in seeing the show. But, my sister and my niece watched the show together and couldn't quit telling me how much they enjoyed the show. So, I decided to give the show a shot. I went into it expecting a moderately enjoyable mediocre show....but I was wrong. I immensely enjoyed the show, and found myself marathoning the episodes because I didn't want to wait to find out what happens next. The writers are doing a good job weaving together cohesive plots that entertain and keep you on the edge of your seat. That said, there have been a few instances where there are plot holes, but if you can overlook those few instances you will not regret it. The direction is strong, and I enjoyed the set and costumes as well. The strongest draw to the show, however, is the cast. Most of the cast do a great job with their characters, and it is those characters that are the hook that keeps you watching. You care about the characters, and want to see what happens to them. Overall, I think it's a great show, one of the best that The CW has to offer.
10.0~Love the show and cast! Watch the first season and you will love it to hopefully! mandycoco Sign in Permalink This show is amazing and so is the cast, I love everything about the show and how much it continues to impress me! I started watching the show about half way through the first season, i was hooked after the first couple of episodes. The show starts out in space and there are 100 prisoners under the age of eighteen that get sent to the ground to see if it is survivable because the ark is running out of air. This show is action packed in my opinion,it involves so much space, earth, spears, guns, just so much happens i am not sure what to tell and what to keep a mystery. Even with all the action going on there is a huge amount of chemistry among the cast and i believe Bellamy and Clark has the most connection other than Clark and Lexa.
10.0~Stay with it, you will be rewarded skintone-38600 Sign in Permalink The reviewers who call this a "teen drama" and "90210" thing have obviously just watched one or two episodes. I understand this, because I thought the same thing after watching the first two episodes, and I actually gave up on the series. Then I read some of the reviews here, and THANK YOU to those reviewers who said to hang in there, it gets better. And BOY ! does it get better. I now have to say , having watched 3 seasons, I think this is probably one of the best SCI FI concepts on television. Truly surprised me, but the 100 is quite a complex and emotionally compelling TV series, with great suspense, action and brilliant concepts. Seasons 2 and 3 are so incredible, and the suspense and pacing keep you on the edge of your seat until the amazing finale each time. Brilliant!! I do admit that Season 4 drops off, and becomes more of a 90210 drama series, so that's a shame. But you must watch seasons 2 and 3 at least to see great sci fi.
2.0~It could have been better than Lost! stefanmalanca Sign in Permalink It has good script in general but the acting sucks and also the stupid decisions that the characters make put this show on slope towards awesome failure. I think that with a little bit of editing and inspiration (from other movies or video games that did a good job creating an apocalyptic world)it would have been a great show.
10.0~Don't give up! This show is AMAZING! amberhelenawriting Sign in Permalink It might start off as just another teen show with bad acting and plot lines, but it just keeps getting better and better. It won't be long until you're hooked. I ended up watching all episodes to date (season 5, episode 4) in about two weeks. I literally pulled all nighters because I had to know what was going to happen. Just when you think things can't get any sicker, it gets sicker. It's Lost meets Black Mirror meets Game of Thrones. I am one of those people bothered by scientifically incorrect sci-fi, but as soon as you accept the reality of the show as it is, it's awesome. It's absolutely brilliant. I can't wait for more!
5.0~Watch this like you would Riverdale (Don't take it seriously) shadeshadowknight Sign in Permalink I just started watching this because the plot seemed interesting, but I'm not taking this show seriously and neither should you. Like Riverdale (another show on the CW), I recommend watching this for pure entertainment and ignore continuity errors and holes just for the sake of your sanity. No use trying to make sense as to why the characters lack common sense, why basic science isn't a thing, etc. I do have several questions as to why the writers didn't take the time to build a plausible post-apocalyptic world, but I have read fanfiction worse than this, so I'm pretty used to nonsensical writing. Treat this show how you would with poorly written fanfics with an interesting enough plot that will barely convince you to read the next chapter, but you do anyway, and you should enjoy it. Apparently, this is based off a book series that also called the 100, but its synopsis makes a little more sense than the show's own. At least the time frame does. In the books, the space colony has been in space for 300 years instead of 97. (Have not read the books)
7.0~Good concept / Subpar acting marose-73048 Sign in Permalink While this series has lots of potential it fell short in my opinion with the acting and cinematography. There are a plethora of one liners that make you cringe. if this series had popular actors and better script it could easily be at the top of the charts.
4.0~100 flaws per episode but still entertaining shagen86 Sign in Permalink This show made me write my first review simply because of how it made me feel a gnawing pain in my gut, but kept me entertained at the same time. By pain i mean all the illogical scenes/tech and plot holes, weird "high-school" behavior and bad acting. I watched the first episode 6 months ago and let me tell you..i was barely able to finish it. I tried again with a very open mind last month and I just finished all episodes. When watching this show, just imagine that the show takes place in a different universe where everything is upside down and the laws of nature (and human nature) don't apply. Forget logic and try watching it as a child would. Give it a try. It's pretty entertaining/interesting if you shut your brain completely off.
1.0~In 2016 nickandtammy Sign in Permalink the show was very hard to watch before but know it unbearable. Cancel it and put it out of its misery. No one to root for and major flow problems. Everyone is out to kill each other and there is no trust or kindness. The major character that was killed displayed those feelings and was killed. Its 2016 and we are dealing with killing of a lesbian character for shock value and for ratings. Four other female characters were also killed. Its on a small network but its social media presence was huge and it reached a lot of people. Kids who are coming out and dealing with there sexuality and being harmed emotionally and physically for it. Those same kids whose parents cannot deal with their daughter or son being gay and turn them out on the street. A great deal of young people living on the streets are LBGT
2.0~Just bunch of teens making dumb decisions. samplekiranmail Sign in Permalink I was so excited about after watching the trailer as it had one of the unique concept of survival. Once you get into watching the series you come across one dumbest teens making dumbest decisions of their lives. And the lead Clarke(question her integrity on making decision on behalf of everyone and still comes up with dumb things) I just want punch her in the face after watching many intelligent and capturing series this comes off as a disappoint. Whole plot has a loophole the 100 are the one's who want to start a war and show writers try their hard to convince people that grounder's are cruel and vicious but the 100's are the one's who needs to get their mental state right. I would conclude the plot as Avatar the movie reverted its whole plot.
8.0~Great Show! erinouellette Sign in Permalink Some aspects of this show are very believable and although it started out kind of slow I am huge fan! From the torture and physical pain of the first season to the more emotional and psychological pain of the second season this series has you constantly thinking " if I was in their position would I do the same thing " the answer is almost always yes. However I find season 3 a little disappointing so far and with only 7 episodes left this season I really hope they can turn it around. I was completely shocked that they killed off 2 main characters within 3 episodes. I know characters unfortunately need to die in order for other story lines to move forward but I found it a very bold move on their part. Hopefully they can bring it back by the end of the season!
9.0~Seriously? Infraloop Sign in Permalink I am seriously not going to give it more than 2 stars. This script is badly written. And how come the writers had a big imagination to come up with this post-apocalyptic script but DID NOT include other nationalities! I wanted to see someone who doesn't speak English, or a member of the council who is NOT an American, No seriously, you're putting this much effort to produce this TV show, but you haven't made it credible enough for mediocre minds to buy it.. Also, i would like to mention some of the ridiculous contradictions, The show is called the 100 but in fact, they're 101 because when the Asian dude decides to put Bellamy on the ship heading to earth, it was only 20 minutes before the ship takes off, so they're actually 101.. Not to mention that a few died on the way, so they're still not a 100. One more important thing. Obviously, there are grounders, so all of this crappy talk that we have to hear at the beginning of every episode, is nonsense. Humans are doing okay, and they look fine to me, so why tell us that the arc was the only hope for the human race?! It's obviously a bunch of wealthy rich American families that built the arc to go live in the space and thought there will be something bad happening and it wasn't as bad as they thought it would be. And perhaps they took some slaves to serve them, which explains poor people existence on the arc. If you ask me, I would call it "the people who spend 97 years in space of nothing"
1.0~best character gone chiara-london-mancini Sign in Permalink lexa was the best character, she could have a whole new spin-off for how she's awesome and bada** but they decided to killed her off in the most cheapest way, really disappointing... i was aware that the actress had to go, so she could have died... but HOW they did that is complete bullshit... not gonna watch the show again (and i was a huge fan) since it was disrespectful to the fans... even if the story is cool (and engaging, the other characters are pretty much boring (the skykru are so dumb) and the grounders are the best thing (but lexa is gone so...) bye
10.0~What a possible future this could be TribalRoseProductions Sign in Permalink I love the cast. I love the whole story concept. It puts you in the mind set of "What if?" If humankind doesn't start treating our planet better, what disasters shouldn't we expect. And of course, though harsh, human communities would have to be expected to adhere to strict codes of conduct and resource control. I think we're about there now. This show keeps you constantly on the edge and shows the truest of human kinds core nature. When it comes to survival, what would we all do? Great show for intensity, unpredictability and thought provocation.
9.0~From bad to post apocalyptic bloodthirsty mushiki-59696 Sign in Permalink Im a big fan of sifi shows, this its not my favourite scifi show, and i dont usually write reviews not even for my all times favourites. (ex. firefly, bladerunner, etc, etc) But im doing it now because, i know, this show will repeal away any possible fan because of S1. Season 1 started with an annoying teen drama about annoying kids trying to survive, and i honestly still dont know HOW I SURVIVED season 1 without cutting my wrists open. And then this shows starts to get really brutal in a survival of the fittest kind of way. All characters facing an unexpected brutal reality, you see annoying teens adapting and getting drastically transformed to survive and some not beeing able to handle the pressure, commit suicide or try to look for answers elsewere like religion. (which in a world of tribal violence and remains of science doesnt bode well btw) The transformation of characters personalities its so HUGE, that after a couple seasons you will start to love "that annoying teen character" or start to hate "that previously kinda cool character", few will survive and i mean it... in every sense of the word.
1.0~THE 100 FACTS!!!! read this if will watch it or watched already i-04476 Sign in Permalink Why it 's is bad because 1. you lose hope for all the characters because of the violence 2. you will feel you don't care what happened to All of the characters 3.All of them betrayal each other family and friends 4.each episode they are in hurry 5.no happy moments at all 6. every ideas they manage to do they fail 7.you will feel all the time in tense and nerves till the last episode 8.you will feel the enemy characters are better then the good characters 9.to much blood 10.all the people stopped watching it because of season 2 I believe that tv show will not last long and be discontinued
5.0~Adults attention: The series does not overcome the status of a teen show chnutscher Sign in Permalink Adults attention: The series does not overcome the status of a teen show I gave a try with both seasons. The series has many serious weaknesses. In the first episodes of S1 you may ask yourself if you're watching a here so called "Kindersendung". A lot of attractive teens with mostly annoying pointless nagging. You're already tempted to leave, but there is also a somewhat adult part of the show with an adult crew of a space station with some more mature script that keeps you from doing so. But it doesn't help much. In season one in the main line almost nothing happens, in fact. There is a continuous succession of a kind of artificial drama, people just being killed in various variants without much sense. Too many overly blood blurred faces, too much pointless fighting. The main teen figures pretend to act as leaders while delivering wooden, dull, heroic shouting, which probably are meant to portrait determination, but this all does not convince. You will see natives in punky look with ever more wooden lines. Season 2 then has an improvement in the story line, the story diversifies in some quite original plots, more parts with adults, but overall IMO it still can't really save the show. IMO the main point is that the show is not able to overcome the status of a teen show. May work well for the young generation, over 30 my guess is you'll be more annoyed than entertained. A pity. The story line, specially with the different blood lines etc., also the settings still would have the potential for a good show, but instead it is wasted in an excessive pointless brutality and too much scripting suitable only for youngsters.
8.0~Do yourself a favor, watch it all... antonsenlarsen Sign in Permalink OK, so, the first few episodes qualified for a rating of no more than 3/10.. It was just too much of a teenage drama together with bad acting, bad writing, plot holes and a lot that didn't add up. It all felt damn unrealistic... But I kept on watching.... Mankind returning to a nuked earth after 100 years in space, SUCH POTENTIAL I thought.. I didn't want it to be bad. I was stubborn, and I really wanted the series to be something special. To my surprise, and huge relief, the series began changing course. They must have fired a few writers, or maybe they quit writing while drunk, because suddenly it all changed. It became darker, totally unpredictable, well written, and the acting improved along with it. From episode 6 and out, I experienced something I haven't since Battlestar Galactica, PURE JOY AND EXCITEMENT. I'd rate the series 10/10 if the first episodes weren't terrible. I highly recommend this show. I can't wait for season 2!!!!
10.0~Better season after season grivetseyvetom Sign in Permalink A fantastic series ! The first season is a bit cringy, we can see it starts as a low budget with clumsy acting and plot. However the season acts as the base for the show and isn't unpleasant to watch at all. The second season starts to prove how good this show becomes : a horrifying plot, incredible development in the characters, a tension that rises after each episode. The third season is amazing. Even more horrific than S2, a much better acting and even more character development. Then, season 4 is just something else. An incredible finale, a lot more emotional feeling and again, major characters developments ! I think the best thing about this show is how each character is unique and has an incredible development. I completely recommend you watching this !!
1.0~You Must Have A Really Boring Life If You Enjoy The 100! interestingfunstuff Sign in Permalink I stopped watching TV/Cable programs back in 2001 and I'm so glad I did! WoW! If you love blood and guts flying everywhere you will love The 100! The violence was shocking and way over the top. The 100 graphically shows someone severing the Carotid artery in a person's throat! A psychotic teen brutally murdering a totally unsuspecting and innocent teen by slicing his Carotid artery while calmly talking to him. But there's lots more: A graphic display of body parts from a crash scene. A teen shooting his elected leader at point blank range, People being executed over ridiculous crimes, Graphic scenes of death from a bombing. Mass death by suffocation. Gruesome wounds and lots and lots of blood. I realize most people's lives are incredibly boring and this kind of television is supposed to be exciting. I mean you never say hello to your neighbors. You're terrified of uttering a single word to a stranger out of fear they might actually want to say something back to you. You're too lazy to vote in most political elections. You don't even read except for what's required for work. So you race home, throw on the boob tube and get to feel how lucky you are by watching junk like The 100! At least my safe, self-imposed boring life is not dangerous or risky in the slightest! Or, maybe, you have become so numb and so desensitized that you could care less about the suffering of others. You actually enjoy seeing all this graphic violence and pain. It makes you feel alive because you don't feel alive in the real world! God forbid if the makers of The 100 had to leave anything to the imagination that doesn't have to do with sex or excrement! Our society for all it's technical advancement and incredible wealth is quite sick when such pessimistic television like The 100 has become the norm. I'm so glad that I watch programs, like Star Trek, which is actually optimistic about the future! I'd be all for shows like The 100 if it got people motivated to make the world a better place! Who in their right mind wants the future to turn out this way? But since titillation is all most people want then vote for people to go to an AA-type support group to deal with their addiction to violence, pessimism and titillation from watching other people's pain!
2.0~Polished Turd..... nomead-183-926394 Sign in Permalink Where can you start with this? Cheese on toast? So many questions without answers , so far fetched beyond any fairy tale. The usual all too pretty all too groomed actors/actresses with absolutely no depth of character whatsoever. Just a nice perfect smile teeth and clothing after 100 years living in space where there are no shops or dentists or schools or etc etc etc. Wooden acting average effects and childish story lines and characters. Almost expect a Justin Bieber track to be found and played as their mantra. Terrible vacuous crapola. Im not sure what they expect you to feel but my only wish was that someone would detonate another nuclear bomb to put us all out of our misery. BOOM!
10.0~One of my favorite shows lousi-18306 Sign in Permalink Watched seasons 1-5 three times love this show. I learn something new every time I watch it. Love the characters, can't wait for the season
10.0~Season 2 is a must watch lce2425 Sign in Permalink I never write reviews but felt I needed to for this series due to some of the bad rep it has on this site. If you just stick with it past the first few episodes of the 1st season you will not be disappointed. Season 1 was OK as we got to know the underlying plot and characters. Yes it started out a bit like a teenage drama series but it gets SO much better. Season 2 will absolutely blow your mind. Way more fast paced and more action and less of the teen drama. I don't know if they changed writers or what but season 2 is amazing, not quite Game of Thrones but amazing none the less. This series is definitely worth watching. Again just stick with it thru the first episodes of season 1and you will not regret it.
10.0~Here's the deal, scheme through season 1 kuashie Sign in Permalink From my title, this series is evolution personified. Season 1 was horrible so its not included in this review. Once you get past season 1 you would be in for a treat. The series turns into a very taught provoking one. From season 2 the story and its characters begins to mature into very genuine star act. Dull moments are less and everything moves very fast. The suspense never dwindle and every event begins adding up making for a complete addicting and entertaining series. Like I said before, if you are like me hate teen flicks just fast forward and endure most of season one, then prepare to be mesmerized from season 2 on-wards.
1.0~Another bad Netflix TV Show fatih_usta Sign in Permalink Here we go again, another Netflix show that involves a group of high tier top models that all have some superiority complex. The amount of acting is defined apperiantly on how beautiful the person is. It reminds me of Nickelodeon trying to milk out the childish kid shows but this time for Teenagers that don't know anything about movies and love to talk about the Expandables as a good movie.
6.0~Stop watching after 2nd season sallymoosa Sign in Permalink Let me start by saying this show is amazing. It has all the things you want in a tv show. The first and second season were amazing!!! I binge watched it for 3 days straight. After the second season, it just got weird and just pointless. The third season is where they speak grounder language more frequently. I'm Currently half way through season 3 and I lost my interest in watching it further. Season 2 finale would've been a perfect finale for the entire show.
9.0~One of the best shows on tv DesolationGod Sign in Permalink When I first saw this the first season, i thought it was interesting but not great, first season started a little slow, but im glad i stuck with this because 4 seasons later, this is one of the best shows on tv. The acting and writing is great. The way the characters grow over the course of the show make this that much more interesting. Definitely give this a shot, you will not be disappointed.
10.0~Wow! mrsjm-73944 Sign in Permalink I was really impressed after watching it. The story so interesting, every time during the episodes, you just want to know what's next?The lines of characters are amazing and I hope the next season will be as perfect as previous two! I looking forward to see what will be with Clarke and where she went. Also it will be so interesting to see what will do the people in Camp Jaha.What about Telonius, it was unexpected to see all that things in City of Lights. What about my favorite character - is Abby. She is very strong and kind and she never deviated from her principles and from those in what she believes. So, waiting for autumn and new season.
5.0~Descended into pettiness kthoma-90298 Sign in Permalink I used to love this show but it decends into hypocritical characters with no self realization or consequences. It feels at times like the writers actively do the opposite of what viewers want for no reason other than to do something absolutely no one could predict (because it makes no sense).
4.0~Initially intriguing, soon drops to generic teenage angst marathon thursdaysrecords Sign in Permalink The pilot episode of this post-apocalyptic sci-fi series promises a fresh and interesting story, but soon loses the initial luster. In a mixture of Logan's Run and Lord of the Flies, we end up with an unsophisticated version of Peter Pan. A floating space-city of only a few hundred human survivors of an Earthly atomic apocalypse depends on resources from Planet Earth in order to avoid extinction. A group of 100 juvenile delinquents are sent on a mission to Earth to explore whether 100 years after radioactive fallout the planet is fit again to sustain human life. The adults on the floating space colony meanwhile are trying to monitor the progress via electronic bracelets attached to each of the 100 human guinea pigs, and engage in various political infighting and back stabbing for leadership positions. The teens are also forming groups and have their own problems with who should be in charge. Lots of gratuitous action scenes and climactic moments where team work is required to come to the aid of peers in peril. - The story wears thin, and seems more like a never ending after-school special. The target audience is clearly high school level. The dialog is without much wit and requires minimal thought of the audience. It's a poor imitation of Star Trek, Lost in Space and similar been there/done that shows. Great pilot. Good first few episodes...after that forgettable.
10.0~Awesome series seascape-65833 Sign in Permalink Totally into this show. Friends recommended I check it out and I was hooked pretty quickly. Binged through all 3 seasons and cannot wait for the season 4. Btw - This series is gaining in popularity and has been confirmed renewed for 4th season too!! Yeah! Best I've seen on The CW channel in a while - Actors well chosen, excellent performances. There were two episodes that started to include political correctness, but looks like they realized error of their ways and moved away from it. Pass the word on, gain views, more seasons to come! :)
10.0~One of the best shows I've ever watched phlargne Sign in Permalink Okay so the premise was new and interesting so I decided to give it a try.. and even though it started out kinda like a new teen drama with some cringy acting moments... I am SOOOO glad I decided to keep watching. This show is up there with Game of Thrones.. the seasons keep getting better and better and better and it begins to turn into this very dark series with amazing writing. I could not stop binging this show because of how the story line kept keeping me on my toes. Yes it can be predictable at moments but the FINALE TO SEASON 5 pretty much made me poop my pants and now I cannot WAIT until season 6 comes out. The 100 is one of the best shows ever created, no question about it.
2.0~Looks too much like colonization tric-shi Sign in Permalink Regardless all the unbelievable details and stupid teenager plots (ok this is a teenage show), isn't anyone bothered that the war between grounders and the 100 look much like the one between natives and colonialists, while the natives are major pictured as cruel and merciless? The problem is also that it seems that the grounders are not newly developed intellectual species. They are human beings too. Then why there is such a huge gap of civilization between grounders and the 100? And I'm not even talking about ethics and values. Why they are only making cold weapons? Imagine you pick 4000 most elites of the world, are these who you think will be left, none engineers, scientists, artists, educators and only one doctor? Senseless.
1.0~It gets worse every season... EthanTheWolf Sign in Permalink My mom's a huge fan of this show, so I often kind of watch along to see what's she's raving about. The first season started out okay-ish. Of course there are many plotholes and the science is... lacking, or non-existent. The actors are okay, they seem convincing but their personalities seem bland. The script is poor. I think this series could have been quite enjoyable as a brainless popcorn-serie for after a long day of work, if it wasn't for their strange obsession with cutting their wrists, other seemingly suicidal acts and murdering like there's no tomorrow. I'm okay with gore - but that amount of wrist-cutting and harming oneself is extremely annoying and downright offensive. The series is original, yes, but if that's positive?
3.0~Starts out ok but deteriorates magicfrank-46902 Sign in Permalink You'll need to accept unrealistic details but the real issue is it gets dumber and dumber and eventually morphs from a space-themed drama into a bronze-age teen soap opera with unlimited black eye shadow and a stupid script.
10.0~I'll make this easy, don't read reviews from 2014 Hhcocal Sign in Permalink This is one of my favorite shows and even I have to admit that season 1 was pretty stupid. It's very slow and cheesy and has a lot of plot holes. Thankfully almost all of these get answered in the next seasons. If you see almost any bad review you will notice that they are from 2014 when only season 1 was out. The current season just made the show a million times better so don't let these old reviews turn you away! I feel bad for all of those people who gave up after the first few episodes and never came back, they are missing out on one of the best young adult shows in a long time. If you go back to most long running shows and watch their first season (especially the first episodes) you will see that the quality of all shows raises as the show goes on. If I judged every show by its first episodes then I would having nothing to watch.
3.0~They don't know how to make decision. ssohan-31689 Sign in Permalink They really made fking decision in fking moment. Most time they just try to protect their favorite person forgetting other.
8.0~It's good Sci-Fi wrigglyrodger Sign in Permalink I'm your average movie/TV enthusiast. I love Sci-Fi, and of course most of it is just fantasy. I watch it to be entertained and I'm not overly critical of every little plot hole. For me The 100 is great Sci-Fi TV, I look forward to it each week. I've read reviews where people have labeled this a 'teenagers' show. I'm in my mid 30's and think thats an unfair description. I enjoy imagining what life would be like to discover the world for the first time after an apocalypse. If you like Sci-Fi you might just enjoy this series as I have so far. It's entertaining.
10.0~I am shocked JBeck1116 Sign in Permalink I've never written a review for any show before and I never planned to, but this show deserves one. I am going to just going to say it and get it out of the way, this show was boring at the beginning. It was an interesting concept I'll admit, but it never gave me that wow factor that I look for in a good show. I saw it as more of a way to pass time than a must-watch and I only watched it when I had nothing else to do. Eventually I stopped watching it and I just let the episodes build up on my DVR. One weekend I was bored and I spent an entire day catching myself up, and as I'm nearing the end of the first season it started getting better and better. I started to feel a small wow factor that began to get me excited for the next episodes yet to come, then the season one finale came and I watched it the night it premiered and I was shocked by how my pass time had turned into an "I'm excited for next season." Still though, it was not completely a must-watch. Then season 2 came. At first the premiere episode bugged me and I thought Clarke was just being a crazy b*tch and needed to just calm down and relax. Then we saw what was REALLY going on in the Mountain, and from there things started going uphill. Within the first three episodes this show had grasped the title of must-watch and refused to let go. Each week before I started the episode I would think that maybe this would be the episode that broke the season, I just couldn't believe the turnaround this series had taken. By the mid-season I had accepted the truth, The 100 was going to stay on my must-watch list, and I am happy about it. With each episode things just got more and more tense, when a character died, even a small one, I was saddened. I watched as level-headed characters like Clarke and Jasper morphed into dangerous and scary killing machines who would do whatever they had to in order to survive and save their friends. I watched as peace-loving Finn went completely psycho and did something horrible, even Murphy was scared of what Finn had become. At least once per episode I would utter the words "What... the... f***..." and I didn't say them in an exasperated way, I said them with full awe and shock in my voice. I began to anticipate this show more than Arrow, which is my all-time favorite show. I am so happy to say that The 100 has earned itself a permanent position on my must watch list. I cannot wait for season 3.
10.0~Along the Lines of Earth 2, Deserves a Chance bartning Sign in Permalink The first two episodes have piqued my interest so far and are good sci-fi. It's a best series out there right now, and it's the only current one I've watched lately. I just hope it doesn't have too many moral twists in it, but going back to watch ones that do is the norm too. I'm also in my late 40s so that, contrary to those negative and even fallacious reviews of the show claiming it's a "90210 remake" or "reviews use poor grammar,' even "positive reviews are written by idiots or teenagers," _The 100_ has the potential to continue as good sci-fi, and good, positive reviews abound. You've got to populate your premise, and it's a new twist on an Adam and Eve or Genesis along the lines _Earth 2_, and it's a scenario that includes adult characters as well. Moreover, as at least one other review has said, _The 100_ even has some of the actors from _Lost_ in the cast.
10.0~It gets better! chavez-ashleigh Sign in Permalink Starts off pretty rocky but it slowly gets you hooked. By the 4 episode it gets completely addicting. I finished season 1 in one night! I definitely recommend it. 1. It's Sci-fi meets 2. 90210 meets 3. Lord of The Flies meets 4. Battlestar Galactica. The good looking people who are in the show also help. I recommend for 13 and up. Only complaint would probably be the someone crappy graphic here and there. The love triangles also get juicy and frustrating which makes you want to stay tuned. There could be better looking girls and guys but Its probably due to budget. So yeah in conclusion give the show a chance at least till episode 5. Then you can knock it all you want.
10.0~Really really good liisaalakivi Sign in Permalink Loved it! It was really emotional. The acting was really good too. In the middle it got little confusing but still really good.
6.0~Too Teen in the beginning, but be patient. (Not serious spoilers, please read) celinask Sign in Permalink In the beginning, the show may seem like a teenage show and a sci-fi show, kinda forced together. But I promise, you have to be patient. Season two is way better than the first season, there's way more serious and "adult" drama, and way less teen drama. The show gets more real and isn't afraid to take risks. There's new, exciting and talented actors/actresses. You also discover, "more" of the World. Please, give it a chance before you slam it down, because I see a lot of people, who I can see has only watched the first couple of episodes, being total jerks towards the show. Do not judge the show so quick. Me, giving it a 10/10 may seem, weird to some people, but for me it isn't, yeah, Lost is a better show, but when I watch The 100, it is definitely as perfect as can be.
1.0~I gave it a 1/10 because of the intriguing 1 minute opener, what an utter disappointment. chinic20 Sign in Permalink Simply not watchable. For a sci-fi show with a lot of potential, CW seems to be aiming for the lowest common denominator. It seems whoever makes the trailers for the shows is painfully aware of how terrible most of the show is, and actively avoids putting any of the clumsy teenage drama angst in the trailers. The show however, is littered with the what I can only describe as a grumpy man's view of what teenagers are. Teenagers are the ones that mainly fought in the Vietnam war. They are very capable when great things are demanded from them, but what we see in this show is petty squabbling and ridiculous silly one liners. The attempt at sex appeal is the most pathetic, once again reducing what should be a gritty survivor trek into Teenage Bachelor. The writing is terrible, the choice in cliché "song of the month" is terrible, and there seems to be little originality in any aspect of the show. The premise may have been interesting, but the execution makes the viewer wonder why he would sit through 35 minutes of agonizingly cringe worthy dialogue for 2 minutes of scenery and special effects. This looks to be less original and less successful than even 'No Ordinary Family'. Which is saying something that the most cliché superpower movie lacking any originality in thought process or execution has more substance than your show. I gave it a 1/10 because of the intriguing 1 minute opener, what an utter disappointment.
10.0~It goes increcendo rodrigo-salazar Sign in Permalink The beginning is ok same as first three episodes, then it grows and gains so much momentum. Second season is just addictive!
8.0~Pause-free entertainment pogopuggie Sign in Permalink It's a must-watch if you're a post-apocalypse entertainment chaser and are happy to go along with a 'Divergent' series maturity level, but those with no imagination for "science" fiction or tolerance for heavy-handed tropes are going to struggle. There is no pause. Something is always happening in the many connected stories and to date it has grown so much from origin that it is beyond recognition. It doesn't reiterate and a missed line can mean a confusing episode. Occasionally it will hiccup but it evolves in a very natural way and as the direction changes the characters are permitted to adapt. Wonderfully, it seems that gender is merely a detail. Leads are leads, strength is strength. It's refreshing to see so many leading female characters so active in a series that isn't preoccupied with being "about women", and to have a series observe bisexuality without the accompanying overt fixation. Unfortunately it looks as if the coming season will fall back on an egg-hunt device to propel story which may see the show in it's final days. It is a teen coming-of-age in the apocalypse drama and is everything you would expect of something matching that description, with added blood-lust. Enjoyable and entertaining television.
1.0~It's bad fredeschou Sign in Permalink I saw the first season, which is okay. You could maybe see it, if you don't know what to see, but if you don't love, like Really love the first season, don't begin seeing the next season, because it's so much worse and boring. Nothing new, just the same. I had to give up on it.
10.0~Stop Now! Best Live Show On beachjammer-45781 Sign in Permalink The 100! What can I say in my opinion this is the best live series. It is the only series live now that I am sitting on my couch 5 minutes before it starts. I am addicted. It is the best character building show maybe ever made, you fall in love and hate all characters throughout this wonderful ride. This show has left gaps in the story but, never leave you hanging. It might take a season or 2 but, they do fill those gaps. The Leads in this show are primarily female; they are powerful! This show has a perfect mix of everything: sci-fi, tons of action, love stories, tragedy, betrayal, mystery and most important great acting. If I had to some up The 100, it's about the conscious choices that we make and how we live with those choices. THIS SHOW HAS GIVEN SCI-FI A GOOD NAME AGAIN.
5.0~telescope cristinelo Sign in Permalink Silly plot. Does it takes a genius to liok through a telescope and see if there's life on Earth?
8.0~Goes from a bad teen drama to a well-written, violent sci-fi. Highly recommended! Xiphoner Sign in Permalink The 100 starts out pretty bad; A good portion of the first season is a poorly written, bad teen drama in a sci-fi setting. But there are glimpses of brilliance and it's immediately evident that this show has a lot of potential. And, thanks to the showrunner/writers', it evolved & improved massively from S1 moving forward! Season 2 of The 100 is some of the best television I've seen in a while, and I'm extremely hard to please. They dropped most, if not all of the cheesy "chick-flick" elements and just the overall teen drama feel went down. At this point, The 100 is just a well-written, solid sci-fi/drama and is easily the second best CW show. (although that might not be much of an accomplishment, but still..) Currently 4 episodes into Season 5, it looks even better than ever! I highly recommend everyone to watch this show, as getting through the crappy first half of S1 is well worth it! A solid 8.5/10.
8.0~A unforgettable journey Black2White Sign in Permalink Never read the book, just was excited the first time I saw the trailer announcing this TV series. It seemingly had everything I was looking for in a TV series. It had an post apocalyptic world, it had danger, moral struggles, romance, betrayal and deeper story than one can guess at first glance. This series has grown on me from day one. Sure it has been a bumpy ride, but so far it was worth it and it still is worth it. The cast although new, have lived up to my expectations... Most of them at least. I've been surprised, disappointed, grown found of some characters and lost interest in others. But still the series keeps holding me. And it holds me because it is that good. Long are the days when all the characters had to worry about, was surviving a unknown environment and each other. Alliances have been forged and broken. Love has been found and lost. Loyalty has also seen its fare share of tests. But the greatest test has been this show capacity to endure. To hold the viewer. It grew from something that could've gone wrong in a hundred ways, but through it all it has persevered.
8.0~Not bad at all Jonstoni Sign in Permalink Spoiler free. When I originally learned about the show I thought it'd be too YA for me. Not at all a fan of the genre. Then I read some reviews here, reviews bashing the show. But then I finally gave it a shot after some friends kept telling me to and I'm so glad I did. The show is in no way just some teen drama, from very early on it has some very heavy scenes and strong emotions. The production is very fine to say the least, unlike some say it doesn't look or feel low-budget at all. The actors do their jobs well (great character development) and the story develops and progresses very smoothly. The mysterious parts keep you interested and there are well written story lines and twists. If this type of genre is at all your cup of tee I'd strongly suggest giving it a go. The pilot might not convince you but after a few episodes it all starts to build up very nicely. Overall it's a good show, 8/10
8.0~Great show emmathornston Sign in Permalink This show is pretty good it gets better every season. It's a mashup of all the good shows and films, Passengers, Game of Thrones, The Hunger Games, Divergent and The Walking Dead. It starts quite slow at first then once you get past the first season you'll really get into it.
1.0~Really really bad kmhinman Sign in Permalink I started watching this show on Netflix per a friends request and good grief it's bad. The original premise was somewhat intriguing but just gets worse and worse as the seasons go. I think I only continued watching out of boredom and a strange curiosity to see how they'd wrap it up. Just a few things, but there are plenty of examples to why this is beyond ridiculous... (1) So the world ends and we send a bunch of people to space. Somehow they managed to pick only the most attractive citizens who then miraculously spawn genetically perfect offspring. Ok. Then we send down a bunch of teenagers to see if everything is ok. Right. Then they immediately start killing each other? Sure (2) Most of the world is completely regrown, but random houses and buildings that are perfectly intact, some even still have electricity. You mean NO ONE found this stuff before? Sure, I'll buy it (3) Somehow people managed to live through a nuclear war and now they're all warlike. They create a NEW language, but retain English? Why would people be compelled to create a new language if they have a perfectly good language. Also only English remains. Yeah take that French, German, Russian, Spanish, et. al. (4) In 100 years with some random buildings and such remaining, these people who did survive STILL live like savages? No one rebuilt what was left? (5) Oh wait there are people who survived and live in an underground bunker with no windows yet they are all quite healthy looking. No sun for generations, but no one seems to be bothered by this. They have technology and resources, yet couldn't figure out a way to clean up the nuclear waste and inhabit the earth again? (6) Killing. Constant killing. At the rate they kill people how is anyone alive? (7) Now we're going to cannibalism? Sure. 100 years and NOW we start eating each other even though there is clearly vegetation and such everywhere. Ok I could go on and on about every ridiculous storyline, plot hole, and bad acting, but I think you get the drift. Don't bother unless you've exhausted all other hope on Netflix and just don't have anything else to do.
8.0~Not perfect but a good nail biter of a series bannedguybe-94944 Sign in Permalink *Spoiler alert* I was a huge fan of Lost, so seeing Desmond again... uh i mean Marcus Kane, i started watching a week ago, I'm already at season 2, the series keeps u going and you always wanna know what will happen next. This series tells the story of 100 'kids' who the arc (a spaceship) sends down to earth, to investigate if earth if habitable after a nuclear war, once on earth they learn that they are not alone on earth, the first few episodes are kinda boring sometimes, its get more exciting after a while, and season 2 looks promising to excite me even more.
10.0~The CW strikes again! barendbkj Sign in Permalink Well, well what do we have here...I would say absolute genius. I can see it now, war, love, betrayal and hope. That is what's in store for us in this, not always well executed, but extremely addictive and well acted series. It's been a long time since I've been this hooked on a series, not since the Vampire Diaries, and I am over that. The 100 is a breath of fresh air in my horizon and my Wednesdays. It's the story of 100 juveniles being sent to earth to see if it's inhabitable after almost a 100 years of being labeled as radioactive. What the 100 find on earth is way more than they bargained for, and they get tested in each episode. The chemistry on the show is amazing, especially between Bellamy (Bob Morley) and Clarke (Eliza Taylor). Me and a bunch of other people are just waiting for that tension to snap. It will be a glorious episode. The CW is know for making top-notch entertainment and they work with what they have and their doing a damn good job of it. I am so excited to see what the writers have in store for us, because they keep you guessing, your favorite character is never safe and that keeps us watching. We're 8 episodes in the first season and I am anxiously counting down the days to the next episode!
1.0~Worst Season 5 Vinaysmart2 Sign in Permalink I am Great fan of The 100 and was waiting for season 5 but what comes, Nothing New just keep trying to run the show with nonsense story this time, nothing connected, just added HOW TO RUN THE SHOW, NOTHING ELSE I am not hater just not expected this
1.0~Pull your head out g-herm66 Sign in Permalink Are you serious writers? How old are you, 14? The concept is awesome. Some of the acting is very good. 10% of the writing is good. We are not all 9 year olds watching your show!
10.0~The Survivor of 100 Youth who returned to Earth hootohtudia Sign in Permalink The 100 tells the story of some group of people succeeding to escape after the earth nearly destroyed by the impression of a nuclear war prevail. Most human is a human colony living in space Station called Ark. Over time, Station Space Ark is no longer able to accommodate population Kaloni Humans in space. In the year to 97 at the Ark, 100 adolescents were relegated to the planet Earth from space Station the grounds as punishment for their mistakes in the Station. How to live 100 teen first venture back into the earth. Is there still is no other life on Earth after Nuklear destroyed by war. Everything is answered in the TV - Series The 100.
2.0~target audience: braindead rdvljunk Sign in Permalink Are you serious 7+/10??? I made it to ep 6 of S1 and could't stop laughing, what a joke. The dialogues are pompus, pseudo dramtic and idiotic. Totally unbelieveable plots and storylines...make up all ok after weeks in the jungle, dropship contains radio controlled model car, a 9y old is part of the group teenagers and kills someone. I could predict to the smallest detail what the grounders would looked like. Radiation levels can not be measured from the ark, the best thing they can up with is the send down some "criminal" teenagers to test if radiation is ok. Oh, get real...I could continue for a long list of stupit things in a mere 6 episodes....why did it make 5 seasons????? edit: ok, made it to ep 7.....I gets worse...the make a half-working radio so Clarke can contact her mother to aid in getting a knife out of someone....so in the ark they are able to build a 3D model from the knife in the body and determine it is 3mm from a vital part.....oh f* *ff, how did they do that?

3.0~Scifi version of your average high school show ah-apache Sign in Permalink The 100 Not overly bad, but it's just a Sci-Fi version of Lord of the flies. But off course since this is made for teenagers and mostly girls, they are all handsome looking like models, and you got your stereo types the rebel, the stoners, the smart guy/girl The acting is okay. Not gonna win any Oscars but certainly what you can expect from a show like this Think of the show as Small Ville( or your average teen high school teen drama) meets lost, meets lord of the flies with a good dash of Sci-Fi, just to reach everyone you have the usual stereotypes the pretty girl with a brain, the rebel with all body, and so far no brain, the stoner, the geek. I will watch ep 2 and see if the show raises above the whole teen drama level, but I'm not holding my breath ************************Warning spoilers************************** Its predictable, not weary realistic, but than again Sci-Fi is never meant to be. There are however some plot holes that are big even for Sci-Fi . For instance you hear again and again, how all the information they should have on the trip to earth is gone. Yet when they finally land on earth, they are not surprised by anything, even though they have never been on earth before. Since they've been born in orbit, they should have some problems coping with some of the things on earth, not just adapt fresh out of the spacecraft Also leaving the weak link behind with a hostile group of kids was just tragically predictable. One thing that struck me as strange, was that nearly all the kids took the bad guys side immediately after they landed. There were no back and forward no dividing into groups or voting fore or against. That seemed to me highly illogical especially since the so called leader didn't have anything to show as reason to follow him. Speaking in general, humans usually need some kind of incentive to follow someone. They rarely follow blindly just because you say so, even religious fanatics get some sort off carrot dangling over their head, 70 virgins, or a place in paradise or something..
10.0~One of the toughest and more intelligent (sci-fi or any) tv shows i watched dharmax Sign in Permalink I just finished season 5. i watched 3 episodes in a row which i do quite rarely, especially being a family man and everything. Now, let me tell you this: 1. if you thought GoT made you anguished and bitter because of the hash situations it foretold - this is worse. 2. But in GoT, with all due respect, it was shallow. It wasn't worse than the dark corners in human realities, indeed, but here, in the 100, they exceed it. 3. But not with gore. With the decisions. Almost every episode contains nearly impossible decisions between the bad to the worse. The characters are never simple, never a purely good or bad or any clearly or constant dichotomous would portray them or even the situations. 4. It is a constant thrill and suspense. No moment of peace. It is hard to watch. I almost gave up because it was too sad, the constant fight for survival and the constant need to sacrifice, to cut into the living flesh of the last of the human race in order to make it and to make terrible mistakes again and again and still go on. 5. Even many heros become villeins and vice versa, and it is. 6. Some episode, especially at the 1st seasons, i think, aren't as good as others, just give it a chance. It would be worth it. i think that's the first 10 i ever gave....
5.0~The series where no females die, only kick butt. drummerticmusic Sign in Permalink This show will keep you engaged but a little annoyed at some of the exaggerated performances. It aint no Game of Thrones.
10.0~Just a review Szeguspowa Sign in Permalink Hello. My English so bad so sorry :( This series has awesome. I really like sci-fi movies or series. if any movie or series can show me a close future i want view and watch it. this series close to best for me. Not better than Stargate or Battlestar Galactica but i think close to compare . I really impressed a first if i seen from the space. How to want survive this accident? How can survive without oxygen? Why need kill every criminal. Why don't kill him before 18. birthday? And how survive grounders this radioactive air. Why only 100 kid get a Chance for go to earth? Why now? That is a lot of question without answer. and i need watch more for get it . Thank you for read my first review!
1.0~this show is why IMDb needs an option for negative ratings Reviewer746 Sign in Permalink This show is unimaginably stupid. The only thing that amazes me more than the fact that it was renewed for a second season is the fact that some people actually consider this science fiction. With their laughable portrayal of conditional gravity in orbit and magic radiation on the surface of the planet, the writers appear to harbor not only ignorance but an active disdain for basic science. The list of plot holes in this show is unending. The writers seem to delight in throwing them out there just to see if the audience is even paying enough attention to catch them or is too distracted by Paige Turco's holographic eye mascara. The character development can best be described as "schizophrenic". The writers' idea of depth of character is turning antagonists into protagonists and back again sometimes within the span of single episodes. Half the actors appear embarrassed to be part of such an illogical piece of teen-drama crap and the other half are just excited to have a job. But what more do you expect from CW? There is nothing to like about this show. I fear for the intelligence of reviewers who advise turning a blind eye to plot holes and terrible writing. You have to be a certain type easily entertained simpleton to find The 100 a show worth watching. For your benefit (and as a response to the naive positive reviews) I've listed just a few of the most glaring holes and general problems with the plot below. Unless you're particularly skilled at suspending disbelief to the point of completely shutting off your brain, this show is not for you. 1) Portions of the Ark are rotating presumably to provide artificial gravity, a concept the artists at least peripherally understood but the script writers do not. One scene in S2E8 even involves turning gravity on and off like a light bulb. 2) Solar radiation in low Earth orbit is not the same as nuclear radiation from thermonuclear weapons detonations. Nuclear radiation from weapons detonations dissipates over the course of weeks (which is why Nagasaki is currently inhabited by half a million people, for example). 3) Even with exposure to the most intense radiation at Chernobyl, the type of instantaneous tissue damage and death from fallout radiation shown in the series isn't even close to being realistic. It is apparent that the writers have absolutely no idea what radiation actually is. 4) Blood transfusions are not going to magically protect tissue from nuclear radiation. 5) 97 years is not long enough for natural selection to evolve a population of humans 4,000 strong which is 100% resistant to anything. 6) If there's still enough magic radiation on the surface to instantly kill people, why did the Ark decide to wait almost 100 years before sending people down since it wouldn't have made a difference either way? 7) They seem to do just fine consistently treating stab wounds, broken bones, concussions, etc. without any medical supplies or training to speak of and with a 100% success rate and an average recovery time of a day or so. 8) How could a nuclear war have succeeded in destroying not only all traces of technology but all traces of written language on the surface of the planet such that the majority of surviving humanity would be reverted some tens of thousands of years? That's right, tens of thousands. We've had agriculture for the last 12,000 years. 9) The 100 happens upon a cache of automatic weapons after having been on the ground for what, a week? Meanwhile, the people who've been living on the ground for the last century have given up on technology and are throwing spears at one another and riding horses around. 10) Why did the "grounders" (stupid name) bother to invent a new Pidgin English language if they all still speak common English fluently and without even so much as an accent?
8.0~The Griffin family kisada-47911 Sign in Permalink I believe this family is the reason why the world should ends.
10.0~Best serie ever philipp_fcz Sign in Permalink I watched so many series but this one is the best i've ever seen. Interesting, good acting and emotional scenes. Great!
2.0~90210 meets Lost or some other Sci-Fi show akashawhisperer Sign in Permalink I am in my 40's so this show does not appear to be marketed to my generation, unless of course I desperately miss 90210! The storyline seemed to have potential - but the execution of the set, wardrobe and flawless make-up on these young, stranded, actors didn't help me to take anything "seriously" at all. There were several things about the first show that just did not seem to jive. Sending all these young people back to earth without an adult? Even if they ARE expected to die? The loosely written power struggle of the adults in the sky? ehhhhh... Too many leaps and not enough back story to really make me want to make this a part of my regular viewing routine. I may watch one more episode - but so far - I can't see me routing for any of these Twilight-y age characters!
1.0~A Cheesy Fantasy Good For Pre-School Children, Maybe. dontfightagainstthetruth Sign in Permalink I remember I downloaded the first three seasons of this show some years ago, thinking it could be good enough to keep me hooked into it. What I expected it to be was the opposite of what it actually was. The whole concept was not original, the acting was amateurish and it made you feel it was created for children only, not adults. After a few episodes of the first season I stopped taking it seriously and preferred to fast-forward it till it becomes worth-watching, but it didn't. I did the same with the second season and after I lost my entire hope, I deleted all the seasons without even watching the third one. This show doesn't deserve 7 stars, 5 is a fair point.
2.0~Idiotic teen show for idiotic teens rachelmatty Sign in Permalink I think my title sums it up! Which means my review is perhaps arguably unfair since I am not a teen; nor I hope, an idiot. I'm bothering to write this to help aid any person reading through these reviews on whether to watch this show or not. Don't, just don't. There are numerous other helpful reviews already pointing out the many and I do mean MANY glaring scientific and plot problems. I won't go into that other than to say science fiction is not about suspending science. Instead I am going to complain about the makeup/hair/typical American fakery on display so much. The casting is generic beyond belief, it seems only American people with the kind of boring "good looks" that society seems to celebrate were allowed to survive thus far. Where are the normal people? For that matter, where are the actual teens? Not the people my own age pretending to be gormless (oh, or not, maybe that is the only good acting we see because it isn't acting?) teenagers who spend countless hours styling their hair, putting on makeup and wearing clothes that hardly look out of place if you dropped them on any American city in this time. I think it is this that bothers me even more than the idiotic lack of science. One could almost overlook that if the show had any merit in being original and engaging on some other level of creativity! But it doesn't. There is nothing original or even well done about the casting, acting, sets, costume, language or anything at all. They don't even try to be anything other than what they are: a show with modern D grade actors. I'm baffled as to why there are only Americans left who speak modern American, wear modern American clothing (made of things they'd not have in space like cotton or leather), use modern make up in a modern style, wear their hair in modern hairstyles and seem totally confident in the natural world when they'd literally never even stepped on some dirt before coming to Earth. There is about as much depth or vision in this show as there is in 90210 or Baywatch. Or any other American junk. I could list so many other shows that are awful for similar reasons of hideous generic American fakery, but instead I'll make a suggestion. Go watch the show The Detectorists by the BBC. There is a piece of programming that doesn't rape your soul but instead leaves you smiling. I'm going to be kind and give this 2 stars instead of the one my brain is longing to award it. This is because it seems perhaps unfair to review a show meant for teens without the mind of one; and the premise is a pretty fun and HAD such potential. A shame.
7.0~A few mistakes here and there, but surprisingly good melgarcia40 Sign in Permalink Let's be honest first: the Pilot sucks. Seriously, it is full of clichés, bad acting, clunky exposition dialog, characters are one dimensional and pretty much all insufferable. So why bother? Because, after 3 episodes, it starts to get far better: characters get are developed and get more complex as the show goes, the plot definitely tightens, and it stops being predictable, on the contrary, it generally goes places you wouldn't expect it to go. After the fifth episode, the lines are blurred, characters moralities reveal themselves far grayer than anticipated, and the show raises good questions with difficult answers: what is the price of survival? are we define by what we do when we try to survive? What is the cost of doing bad deeds when the intentions are good? What is the price of being a leader? By the end of the first season, the show has proved that it should by no means be reduced to teenage drama, and the second season currently reinforces the show as one to be fully considered as good. Don't be fooled by its CW tag: it is a fast-paced, high stakes engaging show. Apart from a few members here and there, the cast is generally good, some might recognize the familiar faces of Isaiah Washington (Grey's anatomy), Henry Ian Cusik (Lost) amongst the adults, but props must go to the younger cast, with notably Eliza Taylor as Clarke, Bob Morley as Bellamy and Lindsay Morgan as Raven who stand out (plus Richard Harmond as Murphy who manages to make you feel bad for a guy you should hate with a fury) There are still missteps (like the obligatory love triangle which was the lowest point of the first season), but the writers managed to keep this aspect minimal. If you are quite versed into post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi shows, I highly recommend it, is spite of its awful first episodes.
6.0~Season 1 & 2 Are Silly But Fun, Nevertheless, Season 3 Is Just Daft LouieInLove Sign in Permalink I enjoyed season 1 & 2 as a silly bit of Sci-fi pop, nevertheless, having just watched the debut of season 3, they have clearly decided to take the show into a One Direction sci-fi nightmare. Here's a list of what's wrong: The Gibberish - We know that the English language has barely changed in 400yrs. There are indeed various colloquial adaptations, nevertheless, standard English has barely changed in that time. Basically, without too much trouble, you could understand someone form 1620 London. Therefore, why in 100 yrs has a gibberish language come into use alongside the continued ability (by all it would appear) to speak & understand English? It's just daft. Sexuality - Apparently in 100 yrs that's no longer a result of genetics but a choice. The bigots of now will be happy. I'll say no more on that. BIG BAD BLACK MARK! Boy-Banders - Apparently they hang around thrift markets where they rock-up on a piano & start belting out dreadful songs. Let the hearts of 13yr old girls' begin to melt (better stick some Violent Femmes in there to keep the miserable kids happy). WTF? This show could of been really good & was verging on being so (never did reach that potential), but now it's just daft. You went too far in trying to appease & ended up patronising. The only way I'll start watching again is if Jasper completely loses his mind & takes to copulating with mutated pig-humans......or becomes a habitual public masturbator, whose habit the others have to embarrassingly ignore. EG. Jasper going for it, stood in a corner, manically glaring at the cute mechanic one with the dodgy hip (I don't know her name). Anyway, that is what I need to happen before I start watching again.
1.0~Bad Dialogue xen-13 Sign in Permalink Dialogue sucks. That is why they have to play background music louder than the character's dialogue. Characters whisper even though they are the only people around. Only time they speak up is when they are speaking in the made-up language. They need to hire some new writers that can come up with something worth my time, I'll watch a foreign program if I wanted to read a show!
10.0~This is the best show I have ever watched rboehm-17348 Sign in Permalink The 100 is the best show I have watched in my life, and I have watched some pretty great shows. This show has it all: action, emotion, drama, suspense and they all work together to make this show amazing. The plot is so well thought out it baffles me and the best part about it is that it's unpredictable, you never know what's coming next. The 100 is a high quality, intense show that every person needs to see. Each episode is something spectacular and I am so happy I decided to watch it.
1.0~100 Ways to Ruin A Good Show JibaraNinja Sign in Permalink This series had a lot of potential. The first season got good eventually, the second season was rather fantastic actually. Then the third season was a major disappointment. Breakdown (Spoilers ahead): - Plot: What a mess. They spend the first half of the season building up some showdown between different factions of the grounders and then tossed that aside to focus completely on the half baked AI plot. If they had devoted one season to each plot it would have worked out better, seeing as the focus on Mt. Weather is one of the reasons season 2 was so good. Instead we got a lot of set up for one story line that never happened and another that ended up being a major disappointment because it was a watered down, cliché rehash of the same AI/virtual reality story line that has been done 20 times before. Characters: Not only did they unnecessarily kill off two of the most like able characters in the show, Lexa and Lincoln (yes, unnecessary, Lexa's actress has 5 months of vacation while the 100 is filming and Lincoln's actor was outright bullied out of the show by the executive producer), but they also ruined the character development and like ability of others like Clarke, Bellamy, Jasper and Octavia. Jasper's PTSD story line fell horribly flat when he was shouting and blaming others that had gone through the same as him or worse. Bellamy had had some of the best development in the show, but this was all thrown out the window for purposes of the plot. Clarke spent half the season getting blamed for everything and just sucking it up, only to eventually save their ungrateful asses by pulling a lever (as always). Villains: Pike was too one dimensional to be interesting and his decisions were objectively idiotic (in what world was murdering an entire peace keeping army and antagonizing the entire coalition against them a good idea?). They tried to make him more sympathetic later on in the season but it was too little too late, his death was one of the few satisfying moments in the finale. ALIE was very well acted, I'll give her that, but you can tell from her cringy and cliché dialogue that the writers think they were delivering thought provoking content when it clearly was ripped off better sci fi material. Nia COULD have been an interesting villain and foil to other characters, but they apparently saw fit to toss her aside after two episodes. Filler: Given how much they tried to jam into this season it's amazing how slow some episodes felt. There were episodes where it truly felt like nothing of any significance had happened, notably Demons and Red Sky at Morning. The first was a frankly laughable imitation of a B horror movie and the second was the very underwhelming introduction to a character that had been built up over the previous seasons (and ultimately served no purpose whatsoever). Themes: I've already gone into this, but the thematic elements of this season were all over the place and felt like a seventh grader trying to write their own take on Terminator/virtual reality story lines. The writers seem to do fine when they focus on survival and character development, as was the case over the first two seasons: unfortunately, this season they chose to sacrifice character development in order to facilitate what they thought was a high concept sci fi plot. It wasn't, especially in a year where you have shows like West World and Black Mirror executing similar concepts in a much better manner. Season 4: The set up for season 4 is so confusing. How come nobody notice all those nuclear plants were in the middle of having meltdowns (when did this start, did the Arkers not notice anything from up in space?)? WHY is this happening now? Overall: Major disappointment. This show has always been bloody, gritty and dark, but this season all of it became much more gratuitous because the creators clearly wanted to become the CW equivalent to Game of Thrones. The difference is that Game of Thrones at least has better story lines, world building, action and character development to offer to those that have no interest in senseless violence. The 100 no longer has any of those. It has become purely a poor man's Game of Thrones, all the shock value - but none of the good writing.
9.0~Don't judge just yet dahlintontabe Sign in Permalink Started 1st season, i was like whattttt? Felt like a bunch of kids playing hide and what nots. However with patience, i pushed to season 2. Goddamn it! It was miraculously fantastic. Oh ladies and gentlemen, it gets better by the season. So yeah, don't judge just yet
10.0~Surprise, surprise rblument-1 Sign in Permalink Great writing, great characters. I cannot believe I am actually writing this. I needed a show to entertain and distract me while on the treadmill for 40 minutes and I decided, after much waffling, to give this one a go. I watched the pilot episode and was not impressed much at all. Everyone is gorgeous and too Hollywood perfect for my taste. It seemed to be a science fiction version of a mediocre CW teen drama. The writing was a bit trite and the acting seemed a bit self-conscious and forced. Apparently there was enough there to give the 2nd episode a go. It was much better, and I decided to take the full plunge into the series. What I have liked so much about the series is the characters and how they are developed. I especially like Eliza Taylor as Clarke, who becomes a very dynamic and complex individual, forced into a leadership role that she is not sure she is prepared for. I also love the dynamics between her and her mother, Abby, played by Paige Turco. There is a lot of interesting parent/child dynamics explored, as well as the wonderful brother/sister relationship between Bellamy and Octavia. In addition, the writers create a rather interesting and somewhat complex tale that was much better than I ever thought capable. And they employ a technique that I consider the anti-Star Trek countdown. In Star Trek, there always seems to be a moment towards the end of the show where a timer is counting down, and with somewhere around 4 seconds to go, the day is saved. I hope this isn't a spoiler to report that The 100 is careful at various times to avoid this somewhat trite technique. Be forewarned, this show gets pretty intense--there is much bloodshed and brutal torture. One of the codes of a group called The Grounders is Blood must have blood. It can be somewhat hard to watch and times. Also, there is little break in the survival tension. There always seems to be some threat out there that needs to be defeated. This can be a little wearying at times. I am towards the end of the 3rd season now, and my feeling is that the show just gets better and better. I am very happy that a 5th season is being produced.
10.0~Great show...for most people kafoster-39928 Sign in Permalink This is a great show, it's always interesting and thought-provoking. That said, however, it is not for everybody, as it can be very violent and danger is a constant theme. But despite these, it continues to be a great show.
1.0~Far below average vladp6 Sign in Permalink I've recently watched 2 episodes of Star-Crossed and dropped it. Now I've watched 5 episodes of The 100, and it's all the same. The series are for naive teenagers spoiled with the very low quality Hollywood production last years. To be objective, I must admit that the series started not bad, although having some flaws but at least without all those snivel and clichés. Initially, I thought it would be more or less in the style of the Lord of the Flies, which is a great book. And the series should follow that style. Unfortunately, it has never happened. After watching the 5th episode, I quit with The 100. Modern Hollywood producers prefer money-wise to turn to the brainless audience swallowing everything that they are fed than to make smart movies that the majority of the audience won't understand and won't watch. O tempora o mores! Anyway, if your main objective of watching movies/series is to finish two packs of popcorn with coke and nice colourful background pictures, than you may found The 100 enjoyable.
10.0~Perfectly processed jankapet Sign in Permalink Amazing serial ! I look forward to the next parts! Love this. ♥
10.0~Best series ever made randyjurasek Sign in Permalink Best Sci-fi plot film that i have ever seen!! Each episode keeps you on your toes and wondering how the outcome will be .
10.0~JUST THE BEST stavrulakisc Sign in Permalink Just the best Series i have ever seen by far even the plot twist goes on another level.I believe that you should spend a little of your spare time to watchi this its seriously undoubtfully thes best series that has ever existed
10.0~Its a great show jasonjam-93420 Sign in Permalink I started watching the show from Netflix and watched all the episodes in 3 weeks. It's a very addicting TV show. I have read some of the critics reviews of the show and all I can say to the critics is that it is a TV show. Not everything in the show can be perfect, and fit perfectly into the timeline and time frame. Yes it has flaws with the basis but it's still a TV show. If all you have time in life to do is watch shows and pick them apart about their flaws then you are all totally missing the point of watching a show, so since you are all too smart to realize it, the show is entertaining. It's not going to be perfect in every way. So get over it. To those that haven't seen the show, I would say watch it, and give it your own thoughts. Its not horrible and it has some very new and young actors/actresses who I hope to see in bigger and better tv shows and movies. CW thank you for bringing it back for the 5th season.
6.0~Guilty Pleasure tmendler Sign in Permalink I cant stop watching this show, it has to be one of the dumbest shows I've ever seen though. If you don't question anything in the show than you can enjoy it. But, there are a lot of issues you will easily notice. they seem to cauterize every wound they get (no matter the severity), they always seem dirty yet they obviously must have access to water, their wounds never seem to heal, people die yet they don't seem to scavenge their clothes even though they will be wearing rags. they have advanced technology yet no one can sew? I mean for gods sake there is a scene where a grounder bites a microchip out of her arm... I feel guilty that I keep watching it every week.
9.0~This show is awesome thetruth45 Sign in Permalink Really not much else to say. Its super creative with passable acting, and a decent production value. Only two things that annoying me- every characters face is covered in blood, scratches, mud, and/or bruises literally every second of the show. AND two, the Octavia character is an absolute train Wreck. Terrible actress, a weird storyline, confusion about what the show wants her to be, etc. Show would be a 10 without her in it. However even with her the show is definitely an awesome watch. Spacr, suspense, war, cool enemies, and nuclear apocalypse, mutated freaks, a mountain society that has a An army of drugs addicts who fight so they can get their next high. Awesome.
10.0~There are holes, but it's an easy show to get addicted to, if you give it a chance. funeral-inmybrain Sign in Permalink I've read a couple of these reviews, both negative and positive. I agree with both. Yes, there are definitely holes and I too believe it has a slow start. That being said, it wasn't slow enough to make me not watch the second episode, or the one after that. You have to appreciate it for what it is. It has an allure, the concept is what makes it interesting. I can poke holes in every well liked show, as i'm sure many others can. I kept watching because I felt the show had potential, no matter what route it took. There are still things that irk me about this show, but the things i enjoy outweigh the things I don't. I rated it a 10 because I went in watching it without huge expectations, and became hooked. I watched episode after episode and finished the first season in 3 days (this is watching back to back episodes after 10 hour work days). I love this show because it left me wanting more and I enjoyed watching it. They made some bold choices by deciding to show certain things as well which made it more realistic (regarding human behavior). I can definitely say it gets more exciting. I felt myself predicting things that might happen, but expecting them not too because it seemed too daring for TV, but I was pleasantly surprised. My overall advice is that you don't go in watching it with this grand idea of it (not to say it isn't grand, but romanticizing it in your head can easily turn into disappointment), and just give it the chance it deserves.
9.0~It's totally like a fall out game!!! Lajenz Sign in Permalink To all of the people that think this is a bad sci-fi TV series, let them think what they like. At the start i thought i was a little slow and there was a lot of teen love over it. BUT that changes quickly all the time in fact! Every element changes with every new episode there is something new out there too see! it's totally like playing a Fall Out Game that is now a TV series, and it's AWESOME !! So if you like a sci-fi that is in Space , about human survival, on a post apocalyptic earth. and the love that the humans get for their fellow travelers then this show is worth giving a chance in my book! so all the way from Denmark, i say enjoy and let's hope this TV series stays on air for a good long while!
1.0~garbage TV at its worst peterfaure Sign in Permalink The premise is, however unscientific, rather interesting. Then the show starts and, if your IQ is above that of a chimpanzee and you're past the hormonal storms of teenage-hood, it's time to reach for the remote control and turn the television off. It tries to be serious and yet it starts with behavior so patently dumb and illogical that everything that follows is pathetic at best. It's poorly thought out, poorly written, poorly acted and only suited to the kind of teenage crowd that forgets we have a brain in our head if some cute girls and handsome boys grace the screen with their presence. Saying anything else would be a waste of time almost as bad as watching this ridiculous excuse for a show. You were warned.
7.0~the 100 gaz50500 Sign in Permalink the show is about a bunch of human criminals that are expendable and are sent to earth to test weather it is safe for humans to live there again, 100 criminals to be exact but as they land on the earth and explore they find out there is other reasons for them being sent to see if the earth was safe i think just by seeing the first episode there's going to be a few story lines I'm sure thers going to be some of the cast getting killed on the show however there is 100 of them and an arch which is basically 12 space stations joined together and I'm not sure how many of the group have family on it which leads to another story which i won't ramble on about. Im not going to say anymore apart from its a good show i think it will get better, Im already excited for the next episode.
10.0~Slow start, excellent continuation, overall great show. malandere Sign in Permalink everyone who rated this show 1 star only watched the 1st two episodes. The show uses this time for exposition and setup and seems a little fruity. But midway through the season it hits its stride. The acting is pretty good overall. Some characters do a great job and give it their all on stage. I think its b.s. people rate it one star when they only watch the first episode. Its No breaking bad, game of thrones, or the shield, but its a good show and its about the only one i watch now other then game of thrones. Just watch last episode 4. If your not interested by then, maybe the show isn't for you. But at least give it until episode 4
9.0~Amazing ninahajian Sign in Permalink I watched all 5 seasons in 3 weeks,im obsessed with this show.The saddest thing is that all of the things happening in this show is not far from mind,its sad watching what may happen to earth.If you have free time this show will not disappoint you!
9.0~So good ghaliahbaalbaki Sign in Permalink Such an amazing plot and great storyline . Character development is amazing and so interesting. The way the characters grow and change after experiencing the horrors they've been through is a good way to show how much a person can change and how much an act can affect someone . It always finds a way to keep people in suspense and waiting for more .
9.0~Bumpy start but the best thing since Battlestar Galactica nicolerg Sign in Permalink When I first saw the show it looked like yet another teenage show on the CW and I thought it was going to contain a lot of teen drama and romance and it wasn't something I was really excited to watch. I gave it a shot and I barely made it through the first 2 episodes before quitting. Eventually the internet and a couple of friends and family members convinced me to give it another go and the show has surprised me on so many levels. The show goes to dark and surprising places and isn't at all what it seemed at the beginning. The acting is brilliant and the stories are fantastic, the evolution of all of the characters and their stories blows my mind and its one of the best shows I have seen since Battlestar Galactica. Moral ambiguity is a constant and you will find yourself struggling to decide which characters you should really be supporting. The show is a breath of fresh air and has rejuvenated my love for television. Overall it has a bumpy start but eventually finds its footing and gets better and better each episode so give it a chance because it will surprise you. :)
10.0~great TV ocaak Sign in Permalink This show has only gotten better and better..its a shame its getting such poor reviews from its fans..this episode was incredible, from the massacre that led to the new heda to the bullet to Lincoln. .thats good TV..and great writing!..I understand fans want there favorite characters to live on but hey..lexa was great but the 100 has great character development n just about anyone can be a fan favorite. ..this whole season is great, keep it up...n for the fans who gave the last few episodes a poor rating because there "disgusted they killed the lesbo or because its "racist"COME ON GUYS REALLY, get a grip..I've seen worst its channel 11 for godsakes..
10.0~Excellent cscbrooks Sign in Permalink I thought the pilot was great. I'm glad the CW decided to air a sci-fi thriller. The young cast is hot and a pleasure to watch and the show had plenty of action to keep me entertained. Add in a few twist to keep me guessing and I was more than satisfied. The pilot gave the feeling I got when I first watched the LOST pilot. I'm not saying this is the next LOST but I like it and will definitely be watching this first season. I especially like that the show is setup to tell two stories at once. The 100 story of the kids sent to Earth to determine if its fit for life and the Ark story which tells the story of the politicians on the space station that are responsible for sending the kids to Earth. Both elements have the potential to tell great stories and look forward to seeing where the story goes.
7.0~Something I would never see coming from CW tinusa007 Sign in Permalink Right from the start I have to admit that my biggest obsession is to read the worst reviews. The ones that got 1 star and if I see any valid points I might reevaluate my views on the shows. Not really how I feel about it, I will still like the show if I did before I read the bad reviews. I would just maybe pay more attention to some details. But with this particular show I did that from the very first episode. And yes there are some things that lack detail. But we still have to take into count that it is a CW show and that they usually are more concentrated on the characters than the plot itself. It's like the plot is there so that the interactions between characters make sense. And yes there has been many things that were not the most logical. Like sending those kids on earth without any radio. But you can't really know what would it be like to be on the Ark and how would you act, what you could and couldn't do, what you would be able to build and how and how efficient. They needed to know if they could survive on the planet, so they thought that sending those bracelets will be enough. I can't defend their decision, but it made sense for the show and it's script. If they had radio on earth the show would be a different show with different plots. In my eyes they knew how they want the story to develop so they surrounded their decisions around that. Now let's move on from the fact that the show has few illogical stuff in the plot. There was a lot of remark why do they send 100 kids to earth. Kids who are healthy and can have more children. You have to understand that they only have oxygen for 4 months, so they are sending them there in hope that all of the others can follow and if they would not be able to, they would have to kill a lot of people anyway as they did. So the 100 had a chance at life while people on the Ark would have to fight for it. Because you maybe didn't see it to that point, but after they knew they can go to earth, they had only one ship that could carry 700 people. So either way they would have to kill or sacrifice some people. So having more children on that ship in that moment was not even a possibility at that point. I have to say this is the first show that I gave a second chance to and it worked. I saw some scenes or whatever from the first season way back when the show started and didn't like it. Now I have quite few friends who posted on fb how great it is so I gave it another shot. I have to say I don't remember a show I liked, loved this much. From the plot, to the characters. It is definitely not a typical CW show. I mean they have some graphic scenes in Supernatural and The Arrow, but I never saw such an animalistic characters. So my opinion based on what I saw and what I read remains the same. This show has a great depth to it about the way the characters develop and how they have to use they primal almost primitive instincts to survive. Yes there are some characters who do what they do because their involvement with someone, but still it is a situation they have to act on. Nobody can say what is the right or wrong decision. They have their own laws and rules and ways. So you can not say what they should or shouldn't do. Because sky people are raised one way, the grounders another way and The Mountain Men are just crazy. I can't wait what new characters will be in the next season, because I am pretty sure Java is gonna start something even more crazy. I just don't want them to kill: Bellamy, Clarke, Octavia, Lincoln and Raven. They can do whatever with the rest. I hope we will have no scenes such as Finn's. That was heart breaking.
10.0~Enlightenment rezabahmanzad Sign in Permalink I would like to thank the all crew and Jason Rothenberg that created this great series! it's one of the best series I have seen these years, all situations have a meaning and are designed in detail. If you want to get enlightenment watch this movie! there is no angel and devil in this movie, it shows us that such a concept is just our thinking and labeling. You accept what is and life goes on and you love what is, even if it's losing your love ones. This movie can change lives and deserves several golden globes! it's very well designed movie with very good played roles. The story of the movie doesn't really matter, it's about relations between different people and how they respond to different situations. I recommend to watch this movie and get enlightenment. 10/10
10.0~One of the Best Sci-fi Series Ever shoaibmuhammad-76162 Sign in Permalink It's getting interesting day by day.Worth seeing this series.Just Breath takin.Every Sci-fi lovers should watch this.Everything is in here.Hope for a better next season ☺
7.0~Has its problems but getting better jellric Sign in Permalink The show does have some problems but has been getting better as of late. Yes, it is mainly from a teen angle, but there are also adults on the show. Adults who get more on screen time as the show moves along. One thing I've noticed about the reviews that slam the show is saying how unlikely they'd send 100 young, healthy people to the surface to "evaluate" the situation. Why not send the old and sick instead? They must not know anything about human nature. Folks, the 100 weren't sent to "evaluate" the planet. They were sent to die! It's just like any society. The old people run things. They know only a limited number can survive. Some must die. They just don't want it to be THEM. So who do you think they're sending? Someone at the polar opposite of the IN group -- the juvenile delinquents. The 100 are either guinea pigs or sacrificial lambs, depending upon what they find on the surface. A rational society would probably do things differently, but since when were people or societies rational? They're political. There's a periodic thinning of the herd they instigate, while the core group stays safe.
4.0~This is science fiction? ngoziburgess Sign in Permalink The incessant tribal theme smeared all over this series is to disgusting to bear. I swear if I had a dollar for every time I hear "my people." The story is bland, there are so many cliche lines and story arcs. The main characters are not likeable, and are too unbelievable to feel human. How can Finn go from peacemaker and execution objectior to a mindless mass murder? Psychopaths like that take months of death, pain and hurt to become, not a few days of a loved one going missing. It's so bad that the secondary characters are more real. How can Clarke go from a murder condemning to a murder condoning person? Such fundamental character changes are too artificial; that convenient acid fog feels just as artificial. In my humble opinion, The 100 isn't science fiction, it's pure fiction. Bellamy, Finn, Clarke, Murphy, Thelonious, Clarke's mum... They are all very unlikeable characters which is why my emotions are with the grounders. They have maintained morality even though they're savages; Finn should die. Finding our people and murdering innocent people who were mostly complying by the way is no excuse for murder. And to see Clarke do a complete 180: from scolding a child for murdering 1 but sympathizing completely with Finn who murdered 18 innocent people, including children is just evil. Clarke went from selfless to selfish. Again, characters don't fundamentally change so quickly. So much doesn't make sense. It's too fake to feel like any science even went into this. Pure science fantasy.
7.0~Good show if you take it for what it is. bigsky_87 Sign in Permalink First, I'm 41 years old and watch the show with my teenage daughter. So I'm not in the demographic that the writers are trying to impress. It's a show from the CW network, and it follows the same formula as all of their shows, beautiful young people in some kind of situation. There are the obligatory romance and relationship issues that are meant to please the 18-25 crowd, and of course some plot holes. With that being said it's actually entertaining and fairly serious at times. The glaring problem for me as an adult is that the show is supposedly set only 97 years after a global holocaust, but for some reason the planet they return to looks as if 10,000 years have passed. The "grounders" have their own language, Washington DC is buried and covered in a lush pine forest, pristine rivers, and there are even mountains everywhere (looks a little like British Columbia?) Anyway it's a fun show to watch with my daughter and the fact that I can actually enjoy a CW show warrants a 7 out of 10.
8.0~Lord of the Flies meets Earth 2 cyberpilot Sign in Permalink I'm a 42 year old male, and have enjoyed sci-fi since I was a kid. I'm a sucker for any kind of sci-fi I can get my hands on and when I saw the premise for this show my interest was peaked. It is the CW so I was a bit leery, and the first couple of episodes I rolled my eyes and sighed because it felt so much like a teen drama more than sci-fi. It then quickly turned into a Lord of the Flies kind of show with a bunch of kids fending for themselves and killing each other. I continued watching though because they threw enough plot twists and suspense and special effects to make it interesting. There are some really confusing or confounding reasons for doing what they do on the "arc" station. The strict rules, which one can somewhat understand considering limited supplies, etc, but to throw young kids (even though they are 18) in jail when they could be put to work is really dumb. I won't go into the rest. They add enough shocking moments to keep you interested, but the problem is they use those same tactics time and again. Lots of "saved at the last minute" situations too. Impossible situations and here jumps out that same person or that expected person to save the day, especially when it comes to main characters. Sure there are a few main characters that get offed, but it's not enough to make you think anyone else could go at any second. I made it through the whole 1.5 seasons in a weekend (had flu nothing else to do), so maybe watching them together makes my ideas skewed a little bit. In the end though if you take it for what it's worth and roll past a lot of the scientific and physics inaccuracies, you'll do just fine. I enjoyed it, just wish they tried a bit harder to not make the people so dumb. I don't want them to be the future of the human race.
7.0~Poorly thought out premise DonB-5 Sign in Permalink Not really spoilers per se - not disclosing anything thats really part of an episode, but I am discussing some of the overall concepts from the show. 1. When the human race is down to just a few thousand - every life is precious as you need a diverse genetic pool to repopulate the species. "Floating" people for minor crimes is moronic. 2. The last thing you want to do is send 100 criminals down to earth without supervision. Why would anyone expect these people who have been imprisoned and, in many cases, seen family killed, to actually cooperate? 3. Sending youth down to the planet - stupid. You'd send a science team with gear needed to eval the conditions. 4. Sending 100 your people who are of breeding age down to what may be their death - stupid. See point #1. 5. Kids going Lord of the Flies immediately ... apparently most are psycho... 6. Apparently there are a lack of "drop ships" available on the station... so by all means waste a previous resource on a fools errand 7. When in doubt and bad stuff is happening around you - start making out or having sex... yeah, being in mortal danger always gets me in the mood... 8. The O2 system is breaking down and CO2 scrubbers... and they've been in orbit for 97 years.... Has no one ever heard of hydroponics? FFS - food supply, O2 supply, nature's CO2 scrubbers... 7. By all means - when you have already seen a 2-faced critter in a pasture - jump into a pond without knowing there is something nasty in it and not bothering to scout it out first 8. Little psycho kids with knives - oh goodie... 9. Psycho leadership on the station with the #2 guy ready to kill hundreds without a reasonable plan for the rest - dumb I had high hopes for a good sci-fi show... sadly this show is very flawed
3.0~Good idea, but really badly executed elena091 Sign in Permalink So I was very excited for this show and I thought the concept was really good. Sadly the show gave away very fast and revealed itself to be a teenage drama. I am only writing this review because of misleading ratings on imdb. It is not worthy the ratings it gets! When the last episode of season 4 gets 9,4 rating, you know there is only a few teen fans who actually rate. Please stop. At least give it a 7, instead of 10 or 9. I have seen all 4 season because I need something to binge watch while I eat my dinner and wait for the good shows to be back on again, like Better Call Saul, Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley ect. But I have many times quit the show because of how insulting it is to peoples intelligence. The show is so annoying and all its characters are beyond stupid. They never seem to learn anything and they always mess up. But this is what drives the show I guess, mixed with some stupid battles and new threats. It does reflect humanity at its finest though, considering how everyone is always concerned with their own people instead of humanity surviving. This is what humans do. I really admire the fact that they don't have any nudity in the show despite the sexual action. That is actually a nice decision on their part, maybe because they know the audience is pre-teen / teen. What I dislike the most is how quick everything happens. It all happens so fast! I thought they would go a whole season before they actually meet other people on earth. That didn't happen. They met people instantly and for some odd reason many of these grounders speak perfect English. At the end of season 4 I thought, "Ok, now we get to see what happens in space and we can see how Clarke survives alone after Praimfaya". Nope. They jumped to 6 years later and she suddenly had i kid? Who looks like he's 8 years old? And there is an unknown spacecraft? I have no idea anymore... I bet this spacecraft is alien even though it has English writings. Fits perfectly into the nonsense of this show.
5.0~A Post Apocalyptic Soap Opera allanwallace-171-669345 Sign in Permalink The basic idea is good, so i struggled through the first few episodes, mainly due to boredom, and the promise of IMDB that it would get better, and it does, at least a little bit. The issue is that its tremendously American and so is everyone in it (despite the main characters descending from 12 International Space Stations) and because we all know everyone from that country is tall, thin and attractive, so is the entire cast. Then we get to the 100 themselves, a group of "juvenile delinquents" abandoned to their fate on the Earths surface in a bid to a) see if the ground is habitable again and b) to buy a dying space station a few extra weeks of supplies. Seriously, these people are in a survival of the species situation, so they decide to get rid of a hundred "kids"? Brilliant idea. Fortunately though, due to the complete lack of actual teenage actors in the US, these "kids" are all about 25 so handle themselves just fine. Now it does get better, or at least the action does with a visible increase in gore, which im led to believe makes it better, but the acting stays poor, the dialogue not much better and general writing quite week. But its a soap opera, and can therefor be quite addictive despite its obvious faults, so be wary, you may end up watching it all , despite knowing your wasting your time......a solid 6
6.0~Cliché yet entertaining dille_family1983 Sign in Permalink The first few episodes were difficult to get through because the dialogue and characters were so cliché and uninteresting. Angsty but attractive teens that thrive on drama at odds with out of touch and overbearing adults for example. However, there was just enough intrigue that I decided to give it a chance. Although I am rather entertained by the series I still find myself rolling my eyes at most of the characters and their dialogue and I find myself getting distracted thinking about the many gaping plot holes. There is just enough character development from most of the characters and plenty of action to keep me interested so If you're looking for mindless entertainment you can't go wrong with this show.
9.0~Awesome show, but... duble_j Sign in Permalink This has been and still is, one of my favorite shows since the beginning. I love shows with story lines that make you look forward to next week to see what happens. This show is one of them. Great cast of characters with new and interesting additions as the seasons progress. Just an all around awesome show! However, I don't understand why they've turned Clark gay or bisexual. Other than trying too hard to pander to a broader audience, I don't see the point? If the story lines are great, and you have interesting characters, everyone interested in that kind of entertainment will watch it regardless of their sexuality. Anyway, looking forward to the future of The 100!
10.0~One Of My Best TV Shows ShanoHepworth Sign in Permalink First of all id just like to state that in my opinion The 100 is a great survival tv show all the actors that had been casted are exceptionally brilliant. One of the things I love about the show is throughout all 5 seasons you see the characters develop and they are far different from the season 1 pilot episode. I would describe The 100 as its own unique show this is because yeah its sort of a earth radiated storyline but there are things like Acid Fog, Acid Rain things like that and ive never seen these type of things in many other tv shows.
9.0~A thoroughly brilliant series jamiebrighty Sign in Permalink Now I only started watching this series earlier this year and I've only got up to the end of the first season and I have to say that 'The 100' is definitely my favourite series for a while. Although the first season started slow, it gradually got better and with every episode, it held my interest. I'm not normally a fan of these sorts of dramas, but the acting and writing held my interest. I haven't seen the second season yet, but as soon as I get the DVD, I shall be watching it. From what I have seen, the second season looks to be just as good, if not, as better than the first. If anybody hasn't seen the series so far, then you have to. Eliza Taylor is definitely well-casted into the role of Clarke Griffin, along with Bob Morley as Bellamy Blake. The 'leaders' of the camp. I'm looking forward to the second season when I eventually watch it and to the third season when it airs here in the UK soon. Brilliant series.
1.0~Do not watch if you have the slightest sense of rationality. jackedchicken Sign in Permalink I was only able to sit through episode 1 and 10 minutes of episode 2, before I stopped watching it altogether. Not only is there plenty of scientific illiteracy and general bad writing, which is what most reviewers seem to have caught on to, there are also plenty of inconsistencies in the story. I will mainly focus on the story part, as I can see plenty have pointed out the flaws in the aforementioned; 1) They apparently only thought of one way of communication from earth to the space station which is, conveniently enough, destroyed on the way down to the earth. This was obviously forced for the progression of the story, otherwise they would've equipped them with multiple ways of communication. 2) "I want to save mankind through all means possible." Kane says this as he deems a doctor, who also happens to be one of the leaders of the "100" operation that has the purpose of saving mankind, the sentence of "floating," I.e. death by expulsion through the airlock. 3) The first thing the juveniles do when they come down to earth, is throwing a party. *slowly claps.* The counselor told them on the video that they would be landing at Mount Weather, where there was food for 300 people. They don't land there, yet no one gives a sh*t about whether or not they survive. 4) In addition to this, the first episode spans over a day. How is no one hungry? 5) Also, why are they all wearing casual clothes. They are juveniles, so one would think they would wear clothes that required minimal resources. They even stress the point in the first episode that they are short on resources on the space station. 6) *Takes off clothes* *Jumps into a river on a supposedly irradiated planet, where they even saw a two-headed deer.* Which leads me to point number; 7) "I'm not swimming." *stands up to reveal that the water only reaches to waist level.* "Get out of the water! Something is coming." The water apparently got deeper as the creature dragged her to the shore. -_- 8) Everyone starts taking of their bracelets in attempt to fool the people on the space station into believing they are dying. A lot of ideas are thrown around about what is happening because of inconsistencies in how they are dying YET NO ONE THINKS "OH. THEY MIGHT BE TAKING THEM OFF TO TRICK US. THEY ARE JUVENILES WHO DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RULES RIGHT!" There are many more, but I am running out of space. This show is really bad. Don't watch it if you have any rationality. Only watch it if you are OK with throwing away every sense of logic.
10.0~This series is great! chokolatte_13 Sign in Permalink People need to start doing their research better. This series is based out of a book, and if you ask me, they did a hell of a good job passing it to a TV series. I LOVE IT! It's the first Drama TV series that I really enjoy and wait patiently for every week. I think more people should be watching this show. It's a pretty good example of what humanity really is. I really want it to be a really recognizable series. I hope that people will star watching it more. The actors are great and the characters even more so. Yes the story sometime goes of a little, but we have to take in consideration that the books are really weird written. In my opinion, they are doing a very good job. Fan for life.
10.0~Best show ever leathers_sn Sign in Permalink I love every season of this show. It's really the only show I look forward to watching.
6.0~Good start but gets a little worse as the show goes melissa-goulet Sign in Permalink I watched 4 seasons and every season I just started disliking it more and more and it became a background show, it turned into some weird scifi show and really was not digging it anymore at first I loved it then not so much
10.0~Are you all serious? hopefulguy Sign in Permalink I really like this show, but then again i really like anything that seems interesting and has good aesthetics. Can someone truthfully tell me that they expected this to not have underlain (probably a but more than underlain, but whatever) of a teenage hierarchy? THEY ARE ALL TEENS, WHAT ELSE WOULD THEY DO? Although, i don't see it. I see them defining the main characters, relationships, and back story. I think it is a bit early to deem this as a Si-Fi high school drama. there have been two episodes so far. Two. Maybe i don't see it because i am a teen, or maybe most of you just want something to argue against and something to bash. I honestly don't know, but i think it is much too soon to write off this show. Give it some time, and if it doesn't change then go alone and spread the slander! I really like it, and hope to see more seasons! so, again, give it a chance!
5.0~Overall commenting (no spoilers) gazimend Sign in Permalink Ok the serie overall was good, the storyline epic and I loved it all and while the characters suck at everything. The most used phrases were "I had no choice", "I did it for my people", "I had to do it", "I had no other choice" and so on. All phrases were indicated to oneself which sucks at this marvelous serie. I believe killing the character Clark and remove the "no choices" and "I mentioning" the serie would be even better than anything that existed so far.
2.0~Run I say, RUN! mistervagoo Sign in Permalink Having read several of the good reviews I did start to notice a trend, "It gets better after Ep.4/Ep.5" is common and seems contrived. Did they get everyone who's on the show to write reviews, because this is bad story telling. Don't get me wrong, bad TV can be fun. This show is not. Most of the bad reviews seemed to be about the 'Pilot'. Not fair really so I watched the entire first season. Hmm... this show is a fail. It's so bad I had to write this review. I suggest the writers research their material by reading some Sci-Fi books by Asimov and others from the Golden Age. Maybe watch a TEDx talk about space and stuff. Simple stories exploring the human condition shouldn't be so had for professional writers, should they? The writers are human, right? If you need logic and reason, a thought provoking story, then you'll probably rage at your screen and break something. However, if you like pretty shiny things you might like this. The Grounders had a more compelling story arc, how did they survive a dead dyeing world for 97 years? Besides the uncountable plot holes, the rope vine in the pilot was just one of the many hang-able offences this show commits. I must stop now as I can feel the rage building. Thanks for reading. Love MV
10.0~Can't wait for Season 3 mikebrunton70 Sign in Permalink I just binge watched Seasons 1 and 2 over the last week, and I can honestly say I'm hooked. Season 1 got off to a slow start but got better and more interesting. Season 2 was a complete blast, for the first time in ages, when the evil leader of the mountain men was killed by Lincoln at the end of series 2, I punched my fist in the air, and high fived myself. I was so rooting for the 100 to come out of there alive. Actually, out of the 100, there are only around 50 left, the rest have perished on Earth. I think the acting has gotten better, the plot twists and turns are enthralling, they are not scared to kill off major characters, so you start worrying about everyone. I don't know if Season 3 can be as good as Season 2, it was just epic. I'm really glad though Season 3 is starting next week !! Give it a try, it's a good mixture of genres.
3.0~So cheesy I suffered instant gas issue goldiecalf Sign in Permalink This has got to be the cheesiest science fiction on TV. Somebody must think teens are bunch of sex-and-status obsessed idiots with petty concerns. EVEN after they have evolved to living on space stations. All the kids talk about are? Their parents. "My dad..." "my mom..." "Mom..." "Dad"..." "my parents". Either that or "my brother" "my sister" "My family". Gee. Apparently without referencing their parents and siblings they don't know what else to do with themselves. Even when they are about to kill the other, they never fail to mention their VIP parents. What's with these new science fictions? Imagine if Katniss of The Hunger Games mention her mom to her team mate or rivals every other scene. And far lamer looking male cast and far sluttier supporting female cast. That's The 100 for you. Avoid this like a cheesy plague.
7.0~Entertaining yet Lost thankyoudadu Sign in Permalink When i watched first episode last year, i watched rest of the 4-5 in a row. SciFi and life after apocalypse is more often than not a bulls-eye hit formula and that ingredient worked for this show as well. No doubt it is quite an entertaining series but does not live up to its synopsis. Sending bunch of youngster to earth and find out if humankind can survive and populate rings a bell though the further show goes, seems they are loosing the plot. In second season, there are twists and turns though its always been there with this show but it could have been gone to totally other way! Today when i watch the episode, i don't know the motive of people! Because it is survivable, people are there living so now what is the next juncture show would like it to reach? I like the characters, setups, scenes and relations they are building. The show could have been way too better than it is now had the writing been a little sharper! Not a must watch show but nothing wrong in giving a shot!
10.0~Amazing, Revolutionary and yet Dark stessfield Sign in Permalink The show is outstanding, unlike any I've seen before. Strong, independent female leads, diversity, realistic arguements and responsibilities. It touches on disabilities, mental illness, addiction, stress and combines all of these into one jaw dropping series of plot twists and heartfelt moments. I do recommend.
7.0~Not mind-blowing, but it grew on me. nomen_meltdown Sign in Permalink I'm not going to rave about "The 100," but I do feel it's earned some credit. When my partner started watching it and I 'tagged along' I was ripping on it pretty hard. I said it was "awful teen-romance melodrama," and thought it was sinking under the weight of its tropes, and I thought it had a lot of potential it was failing to fulfil. I found the two main antagonist characters unlikable, hackneyed clichés of dumb villainy and was annoyed at the stupidity of the very notion that anyone should follow them. But, while I still find many of the plot turns predictable, I've gotta say that I grew to like it specifically because I saw growth in the characters. Specifically in the antagonists-- both went from two- dimensional 'bad guys' to characters I could relate to, with motives I could understand, transformed for the better by their experiences and interactions. And that surprised me. I like being surprised by television-- it doesn't seem to happen that often anymore-- so I have to give credit where it's due. I'm not wowed by much of the acting, or the performance of most of the dumb angsty teen drama material, but there are characters with admirable moral qualities, competently portrayed, and backed up with decent production work (though it's never been explained to my satisfaction why everything in the forest stopped glowing after the first couple episodes-- in retrospect, as a one-off "wow" thing, it cheapens the 'wonder' of the characters when it isn't consistent). By the end of the season, I found myself actually wanting more. I mean I wouldn't drop what I was doing to see it at first-airing on TV, but for something to watch on Netflix with the bf when we're both a little bored, it's alright.
4.0~I want to like it.... sdevet-79388 Sign in Permalink The story is OK and the idea of the setting is good to. But that is where it stops for me. Way too many things don't or shouldn't work. Some examples will be given.. obviously, spoilers.. So the series start quick. Out of nowhere you're already at the part where they get shot to earth. Kids.. rule breaking kids.. that don't all like the people on the arc. The arc is running out of oxygen, so the kids are supposed to help and provide information to the arc so that they can survive.. again.. kids.. rule breaking kids... in their puberty.. that don't all like the people on the arc.. sent to help the people on the arc.... can you see the problem there? the reason they are being sent is because they are expendable, as they broke the law which in a way is fair enough.. but it's any law no matter how small gives you the death penalty (except for when you're under aged, then they put you in prison until your'e 18 and then most likely get the death penalty) this is all happening on a spaceship which only purpose is to survive multiple generations, A ship where people live, breed and die in order for the generation to keep moving and survive until it's time to go to earth. So the LAST people you want to think are expendable are the newest generation.... the adults that already had a child are the ones that are expendable.. they have done their duty to the ship and are basically expendable. But for some reason they aren't considered expendable, but 2 episodes later they happily kill 320 people in order to keep more oxygen to survive for the others. All of which are adults, all of which WAY more suitable to be sent to earth and probably do a better job at actually doing something good on earth. Because the 100 kids that are on earth just do things wrong and the things that go wrong during the time on earth are because the kids don't know what they're doing and because of puberty drama, which is just annoying at points. For example, one (instead of looking for food) jumps into the water for a swim and nearly gets killed by a giant radioactive water snake thing. 2 episodes later they're back in the water swimming again... sorry but haven't you learned???? Only about 4 of the people there are actually trying to find solutions to problems and are thankfully moving the story forward while the rest just do nothing and seem to be completely pointless to the entire story. And there are other things that just aren't correct. Flaws in logic that take away from the experience of the series. Example; The "grounders" also speak English, however.. for some reason developed their own language that's pretty far from English.. which isn't likely at all on an English speaking continent after 97 years.. there is no logical reason for the main language to die out in less then 2 generations. I want to like the series, i really do.. but there are too many logical flaws in it that are just frustrating to watch. Hence the lower score.
3.0~Great start and first 3 seasons, now basically dead intuitions-26485 Sign in Permalink This was a unique and reasonably well-written and acted series. But by the fourth season, it has become a piece of trash! The acting is stiff and forced, without any depth. It's basically a who will win the war and who'll kill who first computer-game-like garbage! The plot offers nothing fascinating like the fantastic scenarios of the first three seasons. The actors play as if they are dead and just going through the motions and display no depth at all! They are like robots opening and closing their mouths. Yes, the series has become THAT boring! So boring in fact, that I stopped the recording of "Damocles part 1" partway, erased it on my PVR, erased "Damocles part 2" without watching, AND cancelled my future scheduled recordings! I have had enough of the trash! It smells worse and worse with each episode!
10.0~Very Good coolkatsy Sign in Permalink This TV series called the 100 contains flaws like all other shows, it progresses somewhat fast in certain areas, but that's just because the writer is trying to fit so much story in each episode while trying to keep you engaged. I quite like this show a lot, if you put the reality aside and instead of thinking "that would not happen in real life", "they would never do that" or "that's so unrealistic" think about the show, what it does have and engage yourself with the characters. The writer obviously tries to keep you engaged with some twist and turns, some dramatic moments and of course there's always teen drama, but any show would be boring without any of it. This show has a great idea, some great characters and i'm excited to see where it goes. Give this show a chance.
10.0~10/10 wow trugaaa Sign in Permalink I enjoyed this serial in every episode, every episode was interesting, season 1 10/10 ,seasons 2-3 were 11/10 , season 4 10/10, season 5 9/10 just sitting and waitinh next seasons
1.0~Suffers from massive internal contradictions diekiste233 Sign in Permalink The premise is already bad. It's post-apocalyptic SciFi getting the Young Adult treatment. The show is yet another attempt to cash in on the Twilight formula of taking what used to be nerd-fodder (fantasy, horror, sci-fi) and turning it into teenage/highschool drama nonsense. In addition to that, the show asks us to ignore massive internal contradictions that turn the whole premise into a joke pretty much. It's bad writing in addition to bad acting. 1. We are supposed to believe that the powers-to-be that preside over the last remnants of humanity (4000 people) would willingly send a sizable number of healthy, attractive breeding age females to almost certain death. That does not appear to be a particularly good idea if the survival of the species is the goal. 2. We are supposed to believe that they would send their young and healthy to Earth, i.e. into mortal danger, because of resource constraints, rather than the old and sick or other non-essential persons. 3. We are supposed to believe that, unless you're a minor, even small infractions carry a death sentence, even though it would be highly likely that virtually everyone on such a space station would need to have very specific tasks requiring a very specific skill set - making such a scenario highly unlikely. 4. We are supposed to believe that, after 3 generations on a resource-constrained space station, there is still plenty of shaving supplies, eyeliner, mascara and so on so that everyone can look like a perfectly groomed fashion catalog model. 5. We are supposed to believe that out of a total population of 4000 there are 100 juvenile delinquents. 6. We are supposed to believe that they have the technology to monitor life signs in real-time from space but they don't even have a single Geiger counter to measure radioactive radiation. 7. We are supposed to believe that the "delinquents", after growing up in what one must assume to be a HIGHLY reglemented society, would go Lord of the Flies pretty much the very minute they touch down on Earth. I could continue this list, but it's pointless. The whole thing is a complete mess.
8.0~Bad start, but it gets way better jogasol Sign in Permalink Half of first season could be labeled as terrible, as some people say in the other reviews, it seeks to please the same public that enjoys "Twilight", teenagers mostly. By the second part of first season the plot starts advancing very well and reveals a newer arc that seems to be interesting, but the season ends before anything happens. With this premise, I found myself curious about what would happen in next season, so I gave it a second chance, otherwise I would've abandoned it. I definitely did well, second season is way more mature, it gets rid of characters that really do nothing interesting, indeed it falls into some of the same mistakes the first season: a few characters have a personality with no contrast and there's too much love, but it's still way better since they gave more depth to the world, the plot, and finally action. The creators have learned from the mistakes of the first season, and if I was you, I would give it a chance.
10.0~The100.. a favorite from the start that just keeps getting better! n-08599 Sign in Permalink Many Thanks to everyone involved in the creation and execution of this show... Please keep up the execlent work, I will be watching !
1.0~Don't Waste Your Time - The 100 is the Worst Show on The CW Network leahmythical Sign in Permalink For a show that touted itself as progressive and diverse The 100 keeps shooting itself in the foot by killing off its minority characters/fan favorites in culturally/socially insensitive ways. How do you sit in a writers room and okay the decision to kill off the peaceful black man by taking him out back, shackled, on his knees, to be put down by an authority figure as everyone watches while we currently see this happening right now in the real world. Black Lives Matter Movement anyone? Do not even get me started on how they killed off the lesbian two minutes after she had sex with her female love interest via her father figure shooting her, a man who constantly disapproved of her relationship, claiming their love was inappropriate...that is some dangerously homophobic storytelling right there. Perhaps the reason why I'm so disappointed in this show most of all is because on any other show, this stuff could have happened and I probably wouldn't be slighted by it enough to come write a review, but on The 100, when the show runner & writers keep stroking themselves in interviews and on social media for how great they are at being progressive and inclusive, it's such a goddamn disappointment to find out they're actually quite regressive, politically unaware, and worst of all, too high up their own asses to realize it. The latest episode (3x09) had little kids being slaughtered in their sleep. Violence is cool I guess so maybe it's considered edgy and gritty, but sometimes, it's just gratuitous and that's what the 100 has become, goddamn gratuitous. What happened to plot and character development? I don't need to take a writing class to know these things drive a story and without them, the soul of the show vanishes. On top of the garbage that is season 3, I'm hearing the show runner censors his cast & bullied one of them to the point of quitting the show...eh, kind of the icing on the cake to make me quit watching. Pretty disappointed the CW Network lets this guy abuse his power over a cast that seems pretty nice and are all kinds of talented. But I guess that's what nepotism gets you when you know the top dog, Mark Pedowitz and he doesn't really give two shits if your show is racist af.
1.0~Worst SF on TV in a long time aivas33 Sign in Permalink Whoever is writing this obviously has no clue how to write good SF, let alone a good story. The premise has merit, but the follow-through is worse than dreadful. Lets see, where do I start . . . 1. 4000 people left in civilization, and they are being executed right and left, for just about any reason. Works for me! 2. Dwindling resources and people, but let's kill off a doctor. Another great idea! 3. 4 months of resources left. Shouldn't this have been looked at somewhat earlier, and a rational approach arrived at as to possibly sending a team to the surface, assuming they don't have the capability to send a robotic probe of some kind to monitor current surface conditions? 4. The future of humanity is in the balance, but let's send 100 kids with no training or tools to assess the situation, let alone request volunteers and impress upon them just how important the mission is to the future of humanity. Oh, and assume they'll land exactly where they've been pointed, and walk right in the front door of Mt Weather. 5. Also, let's not have them check the atmosphere and radiation levels before leaving the lander, and then have them run around like a bunch of college kids at Ft Liquordale once they're outside, with no concern that there might be something toxic or lethal out there. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. The concept has a lot of merit, but the writing and details are horrible. Kill this series off ASAP!
8.0~Season 5 though jrvillebrun Sign in Permalink The only reason I am giving it a 8/10 is because of season 5. I really enjoyed seasons 1-2 until it got to season 3-4. It's like they just made it up as they went which I didn't like. I am really enjoying season 5 though. It's a twist I can stand by. I'm more into the space part of the series than I am into the grounders but its a good different.
9.0~Has my interest!! tpfpar3-695-262707 Sign in Permalink I have read the reviews here and overall I find most of them to be far too harsh and nit-picky. I write sci-fi and I will tell you that it is not easy - often times you feel like an overburdened orchestra conductor, trying to manage numerous aspects all at once: 1. Accurate time lines. 2. Words spoken/behaviors performed must be fitting for each character. 3. Though sci-fi, the science incorporated into the story should be as close to scientifically plausible as possible - not always easy! 4. CANNOT be boring, so intensity and action levels must stay elevated. 5. The story must make sense, logically, or it will crumble. 6. The writing must flow and be readable and encourage the reader to keep reading. 7. The story must have appeal - however, not every reader will like the story and this should be kept in mind to prevent discouragement, which could hinder the story's completion. And there are many more. My point is before you criticize, imagine that you (or you and a group of other people) are writing a sci-fi story. Could you pull it off successfully? It's MUCH harder than you think. But it's very easy to sit back and judge someone else's work. I would say, look - don't be so critical - cut an author/producer some slack, please, since it just ain't easy putting a great story together. That said, I have to say that lately, this show has really captured my interest, and quite a bit. I seldom watch anything on TV, so that should tell you a lot right there! I have found with each episode the story is getting better and hooking me in to keep watching it even more so. True, the beginning of the show had too much teen romance angst (and some was downright ridiculous and didn't fit considering the dangerous Earth conditions) for me, but there's less now. Two main occurrences have me really curious and captivated - Octavia and the grounder (he obviously really likes her and she cares for him...what will happen next??) AND the preparations for those orbiting above to arrive on Earth. Can't wait to see more!! So, hopefully CW won't cancel this show. I would really like to keep watching it...hint, hint :-)
10.0~Awesome show. robynt1881 Sign in Permalink This show, despite having somehow negative reviews, honestly has a lot of potential, attractive and talented actors, and an interesting and captivating plot. In the first seasons first couple episodes I admit to being a little unsure about how good this show would be... but trust me, GIVE IT A CHANCE and you will not regret it. By season two, I was so hooked and its become one of my favorite shows. The effects and editing are awesome and there's tons of different perspectives and themes in all aspects. Characters are mostly not annoying but actually pretty cool. Nothing is predictable. Overall, give this show a genuine try, its worth it.
7.0~Disappointing in 3rd season gogga1011 Sign in Permalink After the first two very good seasons, authors of this Sci-fi adventure (Rothenberg, yet another Jew) decided to bombard us with lesbianism of Clarke. Interestingly, this is present lately in almost all series, although a lot of people increasingly complain about such scenes. Personally, I have nothing against what each should do in it's own bed, but I think that these long scenes are absolutely redundant and unnecessary. Too much of this lately, too much blood and pornography in the series that even supposed to be for kids (!?). It seems that the plan on which we are told by Dr. Richard Day works great in the American series. Violence and sexual perversion, all the time. I personally follow this series from the beginning and while the first two seasons were good and interesting, this third recycles old action and slowly develops a new, which revolves around an artificial intelligence. The script is wordy and actress Eliza Taylor (Clarke) just really bad plays. All in all, it would be OK show, only if there is less sexual perversion and violence. We have it enough in the real world.
10.0~What Can I Say? ayshaorouge Sign in Permalink IT'S A DAMN GOOD SHOW. The intensity of the plot line mixed with the different groups and characters, makes for an epic dystopian fusion. It's a great one to binge and even one that my ASD brother enjoys. Watch it, ya won't regret it.
10.0~the 100 raedali-67287 Sign in Permalink Fantastic story.I love it im big fan for the 100 .thanks the 100 crew
9.0~Earth's new future? scgmama Sign in Permalink The CW has come out with a lot of pretty good shows since they revamped, one of them being The 100. The title of the show alone sounds interesting and intriguing and when I read the synopsis, I knew I had to give it a try. I'm a big fan of sci-fi and dystopian-like future and The 100 is a show that takes place in the distant future - both on Earth and in orbit. The 100 is about 100 chosen "criminals" sent to new Earth after a devastating nuclear fall out ruined the planet and made it inhabitable. The show centers around several main characters both on the Ark which is a floating city for the escapees of Earth and on new Earth. Now, I really like the main characters especially the antagonist Clarke, who is also the daughter of the lead doctor/scientist on the show. She is head-strong, brave, and a natural leader and although wrongly accused, like many of the other 100 thrown on new Earth, she and several of her friends try to find out if new Earth is livable. Of course there are tons of conflict, danger, and a bit of romance thrown in and the main characters on new Earth has to also find a way to get information back to the Ark. The Ark is slowly loosing all of its resources since it's floating in space so everyone is desperate to find out if new Earth is safe. I hope this show continues as I'm curious to find out of course, if the new Earth is indeed livable and if the Ark survives or if all the people on there will eventually end up on new Earth. I'm sure along the way there will be A LOT of things happening so that's where it gets interesting.
10.0~Engaging, unique and suspenseful breenachaput-90355 Sign in Permalink Alright heres a rundown of what to expect from this series. So to start I will say that this is easily one of my favourite shows. I find it super easy to get in to, it keeps me interested and there are smart and thought provoking plot twists that keep me coming back for more. After reading some of the other reviews for this show and rewatching the series (for probably the fifth time lol) I do understand where people are coming from when they say "it's all teenage drama" the first season includes a good amount of juicy drama since the young characters and the adults are in separate environments however come season two, the series takes a turn and includes much more dynamic character development and a variety of cliff hangers and surprising plot twists. Like any show, as seasons go on more material is needed to keep people interested and the 100 is no exception. Although the material in seasons 3 and 4 are a little more far fetched, it's interest and you're not going to find something like it anywhere else. Although the science isn't always exact, you're either going to love it or hate it and for me at least, I love it!
10.0~Not your typical CW show... inthemiks Sign in Permalink This is the my second CW show, after LA Complex, that feels like I am watching some HBO production without all the unnecessary sex and language. I was afraid that the usual CW audience will not understand it and ratings will fall like it did with LA Complex back in the day. I am glad it didn't, although TV ratings seem like a really outdated measurement since no one really watches shows on TV's anymore. The series starts slow. There is no instant gratification since characters are learning who they are as well since they are so young and clueless about what happened to them in the beginning. Then the roller-coaster begins. For 3 seasons I have not seen any clichés or predictability that you would expect from a typical CW line up. There is a bland Sci-Fi channel feel to it sometimes, but it is quickly overpowered with heart wrenching dramatic twists and turns in the storyline. The 3rd season was complicated, very Sci-Fi, very high paced, and probably had the most extreme emotional ups and downs on the show so far. I have to admit that I had to rewatch the 3rd season to fully understand what's going on. This series is not for everyone. If you like most shows from CW, this show is not for you. If you like HBO or Netflix stuff, this may not work for you either, cause you will not get your doze of nudity and language here. Still, the plot is pretty dark to qualify for a teen TV show, and it only gets darker with every episode. This is a series about irredeemable flawed heroes, their weaknesses, and their sacrifices. The accent in almost every episode is made on pushing the boundaries of humanity in times of total hopelessness. Everything through out the series is a matter of life and death, so there are no division between races, sexual orientations, or even family, but rather a division between those who you trust and those who you don't. There is lots of death and graphic violence that I normally would not like if it was out of context, but a few episodes in, you may find yourself even rooting for it, believe it or not. I wish the show had more episodes in season 3, because the storyline has gotten so saturated with Sci-Fi, that now I have to keep a really close attention to details. Otherwise I love the show. It is one of my all time favorites, even though I don't usually watch Sci-Fi or violent action shows. The 100 is definitely not what I expected it to be. It turned out to be one of the best series I ever watched. The sound effects, however, could be improved. Sometimes they are just so off and don't highlight the emotional tension of what's really going on. It needs that Stranger Things sound to highlight the sadness, hopelessness, and mystery of the situations that the show has. The current played out sound effects and even more played out top 40 songs that are simultaniously used in other show and commercials are ruining the unique nature of the show. It need s a good spacey/ trancy/ or 80's style sound effects, or maybe something from the current EDM with sad undertones, but not some cliché sounds from a mindless action thriller blockbuster and played out top 40 that every other is using.
10.0~People should give this more of a chance. zsappenfield Sign in Permalink I've been watching since the first episode, i even had an interest in it just from the previews. The idea of the show is solid, and the plot, as much as other reviewers or forums are saying, is pretty damn solid too. If people would just give it a chance and let it go threw its steps, i have high hopes that this show will only get better. There are a lot of shows out there that start out "weird, or hard to understand, maybe they don't make sense, or people are just picky about stuff" ...but for the other people who like the different and the interesting ideas on TV ... this show is one of those, it is very different and has its ups and downs. Give it a chance, i personally have liked it more and more after each episode i watch... as of right now were on episode 5... out of a ( no clue how many) amount of episodes. its to close to tell how the show is going to do, but i will continue to watch it and be involved in the show.
1.0~Worst series... pidde123 Sign in Permalink First...Why is it only Americans that survived? Second...Why are those few who survived on earth evil? Third...Why is it only American teenagers? and only good looking ones.. Fourth..Why are all speaking American? fifth... Where there no other countries who fled up to space? 6'th...All American weapons... 7...There are other better, smarter bigger country's than America..America is on its brink off economic disaster..Look at Detroit..So please! Stop making theses shitty ''Amerika is best'' series.. Last one...Will the murikans take over the world in this series? propaganda.... This series sucks big time..
10.0~Awwesome aurrianna Sign in Permalink Love the story line for this show. Been waiting for it to start the next season.
1.0~A thousand logic failures and teen angst! templarart Sign in Permalink Look through the reviews... look through them. You have so many reviews with lists of severe logical failures - more than I have ever seen and on the other hand you have long, professionally written reviews with ten stars. Which are the paid-for reviews? No, this horribly written, terribly plotted pile of juvenile junk cannot be watched without screaming at the screen. I certainly did I must've screamed... 'Are you kidding me?!!' at least a hundred times. There are so many logical failures that I could write several lists myself but let me concentrate on the premise. First I have to hit this one... the first scene you'll see in this abortion: A doctor is about to be killed for some minor offense. Seriously, the doctor working on the President is about to be killed by the 'Chancellor'. Already my mind is doing backflips about how stupid this is! A doctor?!!! The President's doctor?!! Okay, the President awakens to stop it but does he shove the Chancellor into the escape hatch and push the button? Does he demote him to janitor or put him in jail? No? The villain remains Chancellor!! Crazy! Later on the President practically commits suicide in order to hand the command over to this evil moron! WOW! Premise: So now we're at the really stupid part... the whole premise.... oh GOD this is STUPID! This should be an IQ test. Tell someone the premise and see if he immediately sees the mistake. Life support is failing and we need to find out if the Earth is still habitable. Sighhh.... send 100 teenagers to the surface to check it out. Teens are wearing life bracelets so the station knows if they're alive or not. NOTHING else is sent with them. A) Communication. The most important thing here is what? INFORMATION! And YET, they are sent with no radios, nothing at all to communicate back with the ship. In the severely unlikely event that the ship can only take in a binary 'bracelet on/off' signal then that can be used to send information using old-fashioned Morse code. Programming a computer to send and receive the binary signal would allow texting back and forth. No form of communication is ever established or hinted at despite the fact that communication is absolutely the primary, most important part of this whole situation. B) Command structure. Without a command structure the whole group will break down into warring mobs decimating the group's efficiency and jeopardizing everyone's survival. Giving one person 'the con' so to speak and making two others his 2nd and 3rd in command will provide the command structure necessary to keep order and get things done. C) Supplies. You're sending down a research team.... with no communications or command structure or even... supplies? Let's say the Earth isn't 100% hospitable but livable in some barely survivable way. Your landing team won't have the supplies to survive long enough to establish or keep a base until the next wave shows up. Crazy! D) Amnesty. "Hey guys, if you survive... amnesty!" Give them a reason to try to survive and to work with you! Duh! E) In a survival situation you simply do NOT put women of breedable age in danger and you certainly would not kill them. The landing team would be all male but that wouldn't be much fun would it? Solution: DIFFERENT PREMISE! 'They thought the teens were going to die!'... well then just kill them if you don't want to even try to make this work. If, however, you're actually trying to find out if the planet is survivable... you need to set up communications, command structure and supplies... AT THE VERY LEAST. Seriously, anyone with an IQ in the mid double digits would know this. To me, this show looks like someone just pulled a premise out of his buttocks in order to find an excuse to throw a lot of teenagers together in a survival situation. It might have taken a mediocre writer maybe an afternoon to come up with a better, more logical premise but then.... they'd have to care that the premise was actually logical.
10.0~It's Unique, Underrated and One of the best shows that i watch! busstofess Sign in Permalink The 100, despite what some reviews say, this show is excellent. It's different, it's unpredictable and just a damn great ride. So great, I'm even shocked that's it's underrated. Give it time and you'll come to love the show. I watch quite a number of series. Walking Dead, GOT, Suits, Daredevil, Ray Donovan and the list goes on and I'm really happy I gave The 100 a chance and I love it. Can't wait for Season 5 and the others that follow!
9.0~Getting better each season! NikitaHoog Sign in Permalink With season 1 i had my doubts. Si-Fi isn't really my thing and overall the series are always with the same lame space story. They hit the ground and it got a little bit more interesting. Then came season 2 &3... Again sometimes the doubts came. But the twist where good, still adictive enough! Season 4 hit the freaking nail on it's head. I literally could not stand that i needed to wait for the next season. But now... Season 5 is freaking me out. This had a whole lot of twists, spins and turns. Unlike a lot of other shows, The 100 is nailing it. Every season is better then the previous one. A lot of the best series are not so thrilling after 4 seasons. The story is kinda fades out. Then comes a quick final or worse, they cancel in the middle of the show with a big twist at the end. Like Vampire Diaries, Pretty Little Liars, Dexter... The 100 is more like Game of thrones. People die random, twist everywhere and the Finals are Big and freaking mind breaking. I cannot wait for season 6!!
3.0~Never-ending nausea ad1962-834-233404 Sign in Permalink Tedious beyond belief - paint drying rubbish. I can not believe this drivel made it past a pilot. This is a children's programme - it is not sci-fi. High school teen angst - yawn, yawn, yawn. Same old, same old - boring middle class America - poor script, poor acting and very dubious moral platitudes. Utter Rubbish
8.0~Some people doesn't seem to understand this great series! persa_97 Sign in Permalink I read a lot of the reviews on this before i started watching the series and because of that I thought it would be terrible but it's not! The people who are writing most of these reviews doesn't seem to be thinking about what the series is actually about. It is a Drama | Sci-Fi and a very clear one. There is a lot of drama (but that's pretty obvious when you put 100 young delinquents together without supervision) but the main idea is built around the Sci-fi! Many are complaining about how the teenagers are acting so stupid but maybe that's because the Earth is nothing like they've been taught it was, and because they've been living on a spaceship for their entire lives! Also most of them are rule-breakers so you should expect some fairly weird and stupid things to happen. Many people seem to get angry about the system that everyone over the age of 18 will be killed for any crime but that is obviously because they didn't have room for that many people and in a small space-station you can't afford to have thieves! Please give this series a chance! If you look at the reviews most of them are 1/10 but this series right now has an average of 7,5 so...there has to be a large majority who really likes it like me! A perfect balance of Drama and Sci-fi (coming from a guy who usually hates Drama :P )
1.0~Not worth it. karla-canzon Sign in Permalink They're trying wayyy too hard to be like game of thrones. They go for shock value that really is not worth it and is just plain annoying. It was good for the first 2 seasons though.
1.0~this is the worst show ever rjeeh-02036 Sign in Permalink This show sucks sooo bad. It is a complete ripoff from LOST in every single freaking scene. There are others, there's a quarantine, crash of a spaceship, EVEN THE SOUNDS ARE STOLEN when something supposedly 'exciting' is happening. The rest of the show is stolen from Avatar. The actors are possibly the worst I've seen in my life (and I've watched many TV shows); worst of all is Jasper, my god I was so glad he got speared through-and-through in the second episode, but it turned out he was OK after some potion was put on his chest by the others. Why was he hung in a tree next? Second is Octavia; who (and, again, I was glad this happened) got bitten by a HUGE monster in the water and drowned. OH NO SHE HAD ONLY A SMALL SCRATCH AND WAS FINE WITHIN THE HOUR! Third is Murphy's, who's face is just so punch-able. The only one who could actually act was Wells, who got KNIFED IN THE NECK BY A LITTLE GIRL FOR NO APPARENT REASON. It seems that every actor is reading the lines from the script in their head, which, in my view, is the first thing you learn in theater no to do. I'd be willing to pay for acting lessons for some of these 'actors', my god, how did Clarke get the lead role in this, and Bellamy?? The whole story line is so completely unrealistic, and full of wholes everywhere. Why would they send 100 wannabe rebel kids to earth to check if it's survivable in the first place, instead of 3 scientists who can actually run some tests? I don't understand what's wrong with the director of this show, everyone can see that it completely sucks. Same goes for the casting director.
8.0~Love-hate Dave_douell Sign in Permalink First, the show is very enjoyable, excellent plot and great cinematography. However, there are only a couple of characters that are half way likeable. Everyone else is very easy to hate. Of course the characters make the usual stupid mistakes, such as standing around talking or kissing when they should be moving and not picking up weapons or ammo from the dead when they really need them. I would definitely recommend this show to others though, definitely worth the time. Lots of hot girls too!
8.0~Wait until the later seasons phjames-henrique Sign in Permalink Starts off slow, but gets really "ruthless - everyone fighting for each other type of thing" later in seasons 3-5 . If you give this a chance, you will enjoy it!
1.0~Dumbest most stupid show ever lovettstough Sign in Permalink I watched this show just out of curiosity and from beginning to end it is terrible. You have these totally ignorant laws that no matter how great or small the crim it is punishable by death and you have the guards or whatever they are who choose to enforce such stupid laws and punishments even when somebody is doing the right thing to help save a life or something good like that and then you have the crazy kids back on the ground on earth with the worst of the worst ones trying to establish themselves as leaders in control not caring about any unknown dangers that might be on earth now and there not listening to good intelligent reasoning of the blonde and the chancellors son in the beginning of the series. The rest of them of them are just doing what they are doing out of revenge or out of spite. Personally and now I am a U.S. MARINE and if I had a bunch of kids like that and the die hard rebellious one I would start killing or just kill all of them right away as soon as I seen the power struggle coming because they would end up just being a major hurdle that just gets in the way of doing what needs to be done in order for everybody to survive. The rebellious ones are just way to selfish and greedy and angry about stuff that was done on the space station that has already been done and there is nothing they can do to change that.
6.0~It's a Miracle goniometer Sign in Permalink It beggars belief that these people have lasted so long after making so many bad decisions. Another show where the writers depend on stupidity rather than creativity to produce drama.
2.0~NO common Sense lloyd150 Sign in Permalink I thought this had promise but half an hour in I started to realise my error. Without listing all that is wrong with this here are a few of my gripes re common sense that none of the characters seem to have and 'strong' characters that would never exist: 1) Lets send 100 youngsters on a risky mission without any adult/mature guidance - have the adults in this advanced world not read Lord of the Flies etc, 2) Both of the leaders on the Ark allow their only children to go on this suicide mission - really, 3) The Dr, whose daughter has gone, also lost her engineer husband through internal politics yet still works with the people who executed him and imprisoned her daughter, 4) The Dr is in the leadership committee but can drop everything to perform surgery on the main man at the drop of a hat, 5) Dr is then about to by executed herself but has the forethought to issue orders seconds before she is about to die, 6) Dr is rescued by leader, walking into room to save her, who she operated on - even though he would be incapacitated, then she does not thank him tells him off for getting out of bed and then goes back to work - What??????- is she a robot?, 7) 'Children' on earth have no experienced engineers (tend to get executed for the least thing, etc to help them), 8) They make as much noise as a bus load of children even though they are in an unknown, to them at least, world, 9) The world is radioactive so if we believe they survive as there is no gamma and beta radiation then there must be some residual alpha which will be on the ground and in the water - so why when they see a river do they take off the clothes and go for a swim - digesting radiation through water is a risk worth taking for a swim? 10) No common sense to check there is anything nasty I the water (they have just seem a two headed deer on a planet they thought was absent of all wildlife), surprise there is something in the water and it is not the shark they have jumped several plot lines ago , 11) The snake/worm like thing in the water grabs a main character and I thought maybe this how will break the mould and kill off the 'pretty'/'strong' characters as well as the peripheral ones (see above re Dr) - but not the snake lets her go inflicting such a small graze that a garden worm would be embarrassed about, so all the main characters are guaranteed to live -what a surprise, 12) Why is every strong character related to members of the leadership team - who were only too happy to let them go on this suicide mission? 13) Then to cap it all we are expected to believe they have no weapons, water, food, backpacks and only one map and no compass (my scout pack had more than they did and we only went two mile down the road), This show has not only jumped the shark it drowned it, stuffed it and hung it in the space ship's control room and each etched facial expression is an attempt by all the actors trying to gloss over what they have done. This show could have been be different but is not.
10.0~The 100 has become one of my favorite shows. Llgoumba Sign in Permalink Let me clear up some reviews you might of read about the 100 that aren't even close to being accurate. 1) first off this is not even close to being any type of teenage drama of a show and this isn't close to being twilight were you have a women in a love triangle pining over boys who you mommy and daddy wouldn't approve of. Theirs actually only 1 or 2 relationships on the show as of right now. This show isn't even close to being gossip girl. It relies on its thrilling action packed story. Not who's paring up with who! TVD this is not. 2) could we one day develop technology to live in outer space for a 100 years. I believe we could. We already have a space station. Granted it ain't the arc. But this is set in the future. 3) It's not so far fetched to have only 100 delinquents when your punishment as an adult is to be floated into outer space! They would float people for stealing food and medicine. So it's safe to say nobody would risk being a criminal to go through a terrifying death of being tossed into outer space. I'll get in line with their rules! 4) not all the characters are good looking and glamored up. My wife's a makeup artist and I know when a girl is wearing a lot of makeup. These girls got very basic makeup on. Plus I think it was important for them to look clean and pretty in the beginning to show the drastic change from when they lived on the arc to now on earth. If you watched to show up until now. It looks like hey haven't bathed since landing on earth. Have you seen clack, raven, Octavia, Abby, john, Bellamy, etc! The only characters that are clean right now are the ones in the mountain. 5) strong female characters that are not busy chasing boys and relying on men all the time. Women form Raven, Clark, Octavia and Abby have made huge differences in their survival. In fact Clark and Raven are the reason they survived against the grounders attacking them in season one. Abby almost sacrificed herself for Raven to escape. Raven risked her life to come to earth. Octavia has saved lives as well. She just save two adults Abby and Kane. Bottom line this a strong female cast that not even the walking dead can equal. Which is a tough comparison. Love that show too. 6) Teenage drama! Hmmmm Clark just made a decision to sacrifice 100s of lives to keep Bellamy safe. Clark killed Finn to save him from being tortured to death. Clark and Abby keeping butting heads over how to survive against the mountain men. Its not a typical mother daughter relationship. Raven watched her closest friend die. Belamy committed a crime to be with his sister. yeah this is typical teenage drama. lol these teenagers have had to grow up fast and have had to make really tough decisions. I love watching them being put into these tough situations and seeing the out come. In this show theirs repercussions for every decision they make. 7) people keep saying the kids were sent down to earth as the arcs only hope. They were sent as an experiment. Abby had inside info that the arc was dying and so did its leaders. So she frames Clark because she believes she has a better chance to live on earth. Than the arc that's dying. Why would you send your best to earth first with resources if you think their chance of survival is 50/50. No you wouldn't.. They sent their sacrifice first. 8) another thing people question is why don't we have the technology to monitor earths radiation. Well the earths radiation wouldn't make a difference. Because growing up on the arc exposed them to more radiation then the average person on earth prewar. They talked about it later on in the show. That's why the mountain men need the arc people's bone marrow to survive. So if they calculated the radiation and found the earth unlivable by their tests. They would never of sent the kids down to earth. But the scientist on the arc didn't think the kids would survive because they new it was to early to go to earth. So they were right. But They didn't factor in that they weren't living on earth. This is such a great show that deserves much higher ratings. Even though it is 4th highest rated show on the cw. Smart move for the cw to renew the 100 for a 3rd season.
1.0~Bad bad bad evedunkel Sign in Permalink My god this show so bad. Full of plotholes, the writing is lazy and the whole story is so absurd.
10.0~Love it jnn-45833 Sign in Permalink If I can make a plea to the producers please bring the show The 100 back another season.Enjoying the show a little concerned hoping they will bring the show back for another season I will defiantly watch it if they do just the right amount of drama to keep me interested coming back for more. I also like the fact that the show doesn't have to much violence or sexual content hard to find good shows to watch without to much details showing in them. Yes it was a little slow starting but on the other hand hard to start out fast paced considering the show started out in space there had to be a story line or else it would not make since. People would lose interest with when a show doesn't make since just the way it is.
1.0~Awfully written teenage drama drivel pretending to be sci-fi marc5477 Sign in Permalink Awful action. Awful teenage drama. Awful sci-fi. No redeeming qualities to be found anywhere. 1st, to those asking viewers to turn off their brain, you can shove your opinions where the sun don't shine which in your case, there is no sun shining anywhere. Smart folks cant turn off their brain. They can enjoy humor if a show is deliberately trying to be funny about science, but this show is very serious and is intended to be taken seriously thus, you are supposed to use your brain. This turning off the brain idea is a terrible precedent for all aspects of life including enjoyment of art. Bottom line, just because you don't have a brain does not mean everyone else needs to turn theirs off. This hopefully summarizes the 1st problem; this show is NOT science-fiction. It is pure fiction with a side of action. Next problem, if you remove the science part, you are left with a teenage action drama. Now, since the writers of this show have no brain, they also cannot write action scenes that make any sense. Which means that you also need to suspend your belief in war strategy and interpersonal combat because this show has some of the dumbest action and combat scenes I have ever seen and again, they are not trying to be funny. They are serious and they expect you to take these things seriously. How can you when none of it makes any sense? Okay, so lets suspend belief in science and combat, what is left? A teenage drama is what is left and it is also terrible beyond words because, again, they are trying to make the drama believable yet the characters are doorknobs and none of the drama makes any sense, not even to teens. Imagine a show like Friends or Saved by the Bell, minus humor. How can anyone enjoy such a thing? The answer is you have to be as dumb as the characters and writers themselves otherwise there is no way you could enjoy such drivel.
10.0~This is good stuff!! motomom-97313 Sign in Permalink I'll admit it took me the first two full seasons to really get into this show, but by season three I was hooked and mind blown. Seasons three and four for me were crazy but awesome, and I have never before watched a show before where I say, "Um, okay. That just happened." So many times! Lol. It keeps me on my toes that's for sure. So much intensity, action, plot twists, it's definitely an emotional roller coaster. I love the premise and concept of the show and the acting is very well done! Highly recommend.
10.0~great program for teens and addictive decii-15353 Sign in Permalink it is a great program for teenagers that are into the kind of setting it is the actors and actress's have the best acting in the world which they never fail when it comes to a hard task even when the grounders wanted Finn in season 2 and Clarke didn't want him to suffer so she stabbed him when she said bye to him does sound harsh but if you watch it you can see that she done it out of kindness to him when i watched the 1st episode i thought it was a bit boring but as weeks went on and episodes went by it got a lot more addictive and i couldn't stop watching it i watch every episode and i can't wait till season 4 starts GREATEST TV SERIES EVER!!!! only one problem is when you have to wait one year for the next season to come on which is annoying
10.0~I am more like confused alcompnaion Sign in Permalink It is not the best series at first. I mean I watched all episodes and still watching and acting is not good, dialogues are meh, characters are not impressive, and list goes on. Normally, If it is a good day for me I would give it a 7 at most. I mean it is not better than revolution and we know what happened to that series. But there is something that amaze me. Whenever I watch this series I feel like I am reading a book. This feeling did not go away all these episodes long. I always wonder what is going to happen next, and I don't really know why I do feel like this. For this reason, this series (in my opinion) deserves a 10 and can be a really role model for a lot of other series out there.
1.0~irrational garbage gorbig Sign in Permalink *spoilers ahead* Yet another show with a "good idea" that doesn't hold up due to terrible writing. 1. The MOST precious resource in space is breathable air. They are running out of breathable air. Yet they execute people by "floating" them - aka ejecting them into space. And what are they ejecting with them? by the look of the airlocks, about 7-10 cubic meters of breathable air. 2. They didn't send any radio or other form of communication device with the 100? 3. no Geiger counters are available to them? 4. the radiation storms look pretty large, yet they can't see them from the space station? 5. have they been using the same razors to shave for 97 years? or maybe someone brought a few thousand with them initially.... 6. the "flares" they launch to let the people in orbit know they are alive. No way those fly in any sort of a strait trajectory. Ever launch a model rocket without fins?!?!? 7. a re-entry craft capable of holding 100 people was available? 8. After the radiation storm passes, which appeared to last for hours, none of the vegetation was harmed? And a 100 year old car was adequate shielding? I can't go on, and hopefully neither does this show.
1.0~Tried to give it a chance petegreendc Sign in Permalink Watched first several episodes in season 1 and realized this was Sci-Fi lite, with massive plot holes and mediocre acting. The show fully evolves into a feminist socially engineering vehicle by season 2 with the storyline and the insignificant male characters becoming a distant afterthought. No thanks.
10.0~Wow poriakiani Sign in Permalink The movie is really awesome and challenging, I hope it continues
10.0~Finally Engaging Sci Fi! bbriddell Sign in Permalink Finally Engaging Sci Fi! What I like about the show: Writing, directing, acting, flow of ideas (narrative). Engaging: I actually watch the show without getting distracted or pausing show to walk off and do something else. I look forward to the next episode. What I didn't like: I watched the first three episodes and was bored. It seemed disjointed. I decided to give it a try again and picked up at the 6th episode of season 1. I'm glad I did. I read a little of the reviews and the input about the technical specifics and/or physics. I can respect the technical point of view and this is SCI FI. Just imagine Star Trek back in 1966. Communicators, cell phone technology wasn't even around the corner. Using Velcro. The cultural diversity of the crew. Also, about Lord of the Flies. There were four children in my household. It was Lord of the Flies from the time the children came home from school to when I arrived home from a relaxing stress free 12 to 16 hour day at work. So, Lord of the Flies from my limited experience can happen in four to five hours. The show has an original premise. Bottom line most shows are unoriginal; hack writing, bad acting, lame fight scenes. I haven't had the pleasure of writing a good review for a while. If you are uncertain and love Sci Fi, then try the show out. If you like to watch from the beginning and it seems a little slow, then jump forward a couple of episodes. I hope you enjoy this show as much as others and I do. If not, then it was at least worth a try.
4.0~Just not worth it nickvankollenburg Sign in Permalink This series has so many amazing aspects and yet they keep putting Clarke in most of the scenes. I find her to be extremely annoying, she's meddlesome, thinking highly of herself and assuming what she does is in everyone's best interest while it's obvious she only thinks about herself. I get that the creators of this show have to add annoying people but do not give them a lead.. Bellamy, Raven, Jasper, Jaha, all characters who I consider to be quite interesting and yet I hardly get to see anything about them. I gave up halfway through season 2, yes the fighting is awesome, yes there are a lot of cool aspects but then I have to watch another annoying Clarke scene and find myself wondering why do I watch this. I watched an interview with Clarke realising it's not acting what she does, in real life she's exactly the same annoying person. I would've rated this an 8 but came down to a 4 due to the amount of Clarke scenes I had to bear.
9.0~I'm really enjoying the show! er_ouz Sign in Permalink I'll start with the bad: Sci Fi shows have a couple of big problems to overcome, among which is that they have to be believable and the actions the characters make have to be compelling. As a viewer you don't want to continually ask "why didn't they just do that instead"? And if there's one thing that's still problematic with The 100, is that they don't always overcome this issue. But apart from that, this is a really good show, with plenty of wonderful, unexpected and intelligent twists and turns, a very engaging story, lots of interesting and (mostly) believable and complex characters, and tons of exciting new realms to discover and explore. I really didn't expect to like it as much as I am! But by now, I am in the middle of season 3 and can't wait for the next episode to come. Season 2 was particularly good! Highly recommended.
9.0~I love cheesey -- I enjoyed hiphopchic9991 Sign in Permalink Although I know it isn't the best, I enjoyed it! I'm excited for season 5. Lots of plot holes and other flaws, but I'm.ooay with that. I'm not perfect either. :)
3.0~It's ok but looks like ground hog day dan-14-87767 Sign in Permalink Starts good but very repetitive, plot doesn't move on! Needs a continuing to the story, something different...
1.0~killed off lgbt character for no real reason degdegspraypaint Sign in Permalink Killed off an important lgbt character by a stray bullet because her actor was on another show, right after a love scene. I can't lie about how filled with rage I am, but I'll keep this civil despite my painful urge to turn this into a ten page rant on the importance of lgbt representation, because that's only one reason I am angry. Ignoring the distasteful and tackily wrote death straight from the tragic lesbians trope, an amazing character was killed because her actor was on another show, and I would be fine with that if it wasn't for the fact that it was done so terribly. A stray bullet killed off one of the most amazing female characters I have ever became cripplingly emotionally attached to, so the fandom and I riot. Not for our ship. But for Lexa. Blood must have blood.
1.0~Not worth the time bharatiitrstar Sign in Permalink Watched and couldn't bear it. Expected the storyline to be interesting but was disappointed. Poorly written characters behaving randomly just for the sake of plot. Main characters are well protected just for the sake of keeping them alive. Majority of the characters hardly show any acting skills and one with the skills are not given major roles. Silly teenage romance drama mixed with game of thrones.
9.0~Exciting! kcquail Sign in Permalink This show is great. Every episode brings in new exciting things and makes me keep wanting more and more. You never know what to expect. The reason I gave it a 8 was because the acting isn't the strongest and could be a bit stronger. I am a huge fan of post- apocalyptic movies and this is a perfect series to watch if you are also a fan. It didn't take 3 episodes for it to get exciting, it was interesting right from the first episode. The show also makes you feel very connected to all of the characters and they all have very unique personalities. The only problem is I don't know how many more ideas they can come up with to continue making a great show. I wouldn't be surprised if it only lasted 3 or 4 seasons. Not because its bad but because the plot might not allow it to go very long. I hope that it does continue on for a very long time so I can keep watching this series that I absolutely love.
6.0~Season one (3 out of 10) - Season 2 (8 out of 10) pjmf1975 Sign in Permalink This is my personal opinion. First Season ... I hated. Interesting story but that was it. I kinda agree with most of the I hated reviews!! Poor acting, silly dialogues, mediocre scripters easily like a bad cable movie. Second Season ... I love it, I cant wait for the next episode, and it's definitely on my Top 5, it's a completely new show, more credible, darker, interesting. I am truly impressed and definitely a fan. there are still space to improve, some lines and reactions are not credible enough, its not what normal people would in my opinion do or say in those circumstances but its getting there. Well done. I can see a bright future for this show.
3.0~juvenile subplot bbibikov Sign in Permalink The idea is original, the premise is great, but the plot is crappy because it is peppered with too many juvenile subplots; you know characters running around the forest constantly getting lost, getting saved, then lost again, then saved again, on and on it goes to no end. Do they ever learn to just stay and wait? The subplots takes away from the big picture, shifts our focus away from the main plot. What are some of these subplots? For example: constantly going back in time to learn why the character is who he is. Constant unnecessary misunderstanding, fighting, and love and hate relationships.When you focus on these things too much you are not informing watchers of what is going on in the main plot. Look, I understand this is science fiction, but in order for this science fiction to be good, it needs to be believable, and it is missing this ingredient because too many characters are miracles because they keep NOT DYING after getting way too many chances to die. They just don't die, it's like they were destined not to die, when in the real world they would be dead already. So stuff like that piles up and it drags the whole series to a big disappointment. Oh, and don't get me started on them getting bruised all the time and healing a day later. The amount of bruising they've all taken, they should have so many scars you would not recognize them by season 3.
10.0~AHH barkerchelsey Sign in Permalink Just found out there is more than 2 seasons LOL! I'm SO excited now!
10.0~Great Character Development nikolinadrum Sign in Permalink The character development is the best and strongest I have ever seen in a TV series for this target/age group. It's realistic, while in many other shows it feels like everything is really rushed... I can tell every actor/actress knows their character by heart and as a viewer it's easy to fall in love with their work and what they deliver on the TV screen. The writing and directing of each episode is well thought and the whole idea (and I would like to mention that I am very thankful for Kass Morgan's books) is very interesting to follow and after each episode I want to know what happens next, what new problems will arise and how life on earth changes. I am a huge fan and very grateful that I decided to give this show a go. Some quality content, I can tell. :)
5.0~Strictly for rabid fans of the sub-genre listval Sign in Permalink Poorly-written and acted (which is surprising because there are many good actors in it), but an interesting premise. If post-apocalyptic is your favorite sub-genre, you might like this. I watch it because I'll put up with a lot of bad writing and acting to watch an interesting post-apocalyptic premise develop. If you, for instance, watch a new episode of The Walking Dead, then watch Talking Dead, then go back and re-watch the TWD episode again immediately because you want to watch it again with the insights you gained from Talking Dead, this show might be for you. Otherwise, meh.
7.0~It's not good, but it's addicting: The cocaine of TV dramas jhuang523 Sign in Permalink Look, this show just isn't good. For starters, before even getting into the story, let's start with the effects; they look like they're out of a video game. Unrealistic. Then, the writing; although the premise is interesting, its realization was disappointing. There are too many plot holes and inaccuracies to count. Next, the acting is mediocre at best. How come the girls manage to keep their eyebrows waxed and legs shaved? Where are they getting make-up from? Why is the majority of the space station white, with people of color only sprinkled in the background to give the illusion of diversity! And then there's character development. They do a decent job of developing the guys' characters, making them complex, and, well, human. But I feel the females seem somewhat flat. They're used for sex scenes and dull, rushed relationships. Overall, though, they did seem to capture human nature relatively well with the Lord of the Flies-esque dynamic. The whole "plan- everything-neat-freak girl meets carefree-adventurous-charming guy and falls in love and changes" trope (hint, hint; Finn and Clarke) is SO overdone. Same goes for the love triangle. However bad this show may be, it's got me hooked. You really can't expect much from a TV drama from CW. I don't know what it is about this show, but I can't stop watching. (Actually, I'm probably only still here because of Finn). I can point out everything wrong with the show, but I just can't put my finger on what they're doing right. The bottom line is this: you can't go into this show with high expectations. You won't make it past the first 20 minutes of the pilot. Give it a try, though. I certainly didn't believe I would last this long.
5.0~Some interesting ideas but extremely cheap writing tricks make it unbearable. michaeloansalow Sign in Permalink This had promise to be interesting but it turned into "let's see how many times we can make characters do incredibly stupid things to create dramatic tension". If you like dark bad teen drama with some potential for decent sci-fi that it doesn't quite manage to reach then this is for you.
3.0~Season 3 is a disaster Sennara Sign in Permalink When I started watching the series it was getting better and better and the second season was superb. Then came the much anticipated season 3 and it unfortunately is a disappointing flop. There's no more reasonable plots going on. It's just full of cruel and stupid people in every camp of the story. Lots of stupid people now only keep setting up, killing, misleading, hating and hurting each other. And some of the very few adorable character such as Lincoln and Lexa were just wasted for no any meaningful reason. I can't even bear or have the patience to watch this crap any more. It's simply disastrous. I'm feeling very disappointed that such a used-to-be-good series spirals down so badly.
1.0~The 100 airs episode about massive shootings of innocent children/adults? Disgusting! nikkinak003 Sign in Permalink I recently watched the The 100 series on Netflix. I will say that at first I did like this show. On November 19th 2014 a new episode premiered on television. I was eager to watch the show and it ended so horribly I have been having night mares ever since. The end showed a great character loose his mind and start to kill a village of innocent people/children thinking his girlfriend was there. Its hard for me to understand. I did not know before watching the show that I would be watching children being gunned down. Then to top it off the girlfriend shows up and he is just standing there like, what did I do? Why didn't they just show they guy killing himself then? My goodness! Poor show. Come on now! At this delicate time with all the school shootings across the United States why would the writers @100writersroom make this come across as if this was just an easy thing to do? Great example The 100! (sarcasm)
10.0~one of my favorite TV-shows crico_italiano Sign in Permalink this show is amazing. all the acting is great! it's a great story and you will be hooked ! my favorite Alycia Debnam Carey is such a talent. as the story goes on you will love someone and hate someone and suddenly those you love you end up hating and those you hated you will love! you will go insane such fantastic characters, great storyline, and nice looking scenes. this show is going be a legend one! I like the way the story goes after the first 5 episodes ,they start off slow and then they hit you with a wave of elegance,mystery and performances that you will remember for ever. you never now what is going to happened,this show gets better and better. whatever choice the characters make, there will be consequences Awesome !!! I'm thrilled and can't wait for the next episode !!! thank you!
8.0~The 100, BigGringo Sign in Permalink Show is not that bad, pretty good actually. Not as fantastic as the Kartrashians, as I am sure many of the bad reviewers of this show prefer, but all in all it is pretty darn good. Seriously, in comparison to the other shows that are on TV or have been on TV in the past, this show rates pretty high in my book. It is a decent show in the mix of so many lame reality shows, that are not really reality but scripted pap... I would prefer to watch this over Kate plus x, Boogers, Kartrashians, Survivor, Idol any day, all day long. So yes it can be better I rank it a solid 8 in comparison to the other crap on TV
1.0~It had such potential! jowyzy Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed the first two seasons but the show went off the rails in season three and just never seemed to recover. I don't know if it's because certain writers left or exactly why it seemed to go off course. I enjoyed the concept of good intentioned people having to make impossible decisions to survive. It just seemed to turn into torture porn with characters making decisions that weren't in line with their development. They do have several talented actors and guest stars that made it watchable. However even that no longer was enough to hold my interest.
7.0~A Strong 7/10 jarl-lundstrom Sign in Permalink Only reason to why i wanted to check out this was because of Henry Ian Cusick who played Desmond Hume in LOST. I started to watch season 1 and thought that it was not so good at first. In my opinion it was a bit slow and there was not enough happening to catch my attention. But after i almost gave up at episode 4 or 5 it started to get better and better so i ended up watching it to the end of season 1. Season 2 gets better then season one so i will keep watching it. The acting is not so good but it is OK and if you got nothing else or better to watch then this is pretty good in my own opinion. Would recommend this to anyone who like apocalyptic events or futuristic stuff :)
1.0~Horrible isn't a strong enough word webbie3000 Sign in Permalink When A TV show has an awful Pilot, I tell myself that it doesn't necessarily mean the entire series is horrible. however in this case it does. Whats bad about this series? well lemmee tell you! -music: Apparently the people who chose the music thought the show would be made better by throwing tons of currently-popular-pop-music in the background. I have nothing against pop music. But when its being shoved down your throat like that, just to imply "hey we got this good song in here so that makes our TV show good too amiright?" then I don't enjoy it. -acting: I know that teenagers aren't always good actors, so I'd be willing to cut them a little slack in that regard. But none of them are good, and I mean none, you'd think at least the actors for the main characters would have a little more thought put into them casting- wise. "but here at the cw, all we care about is money!" Also all the conflict between them seems really forced, like they try to jump into some lord-of-the- flies type crap as soon as they get off the spaceship. -plot: The plot is stupid, which usually I can overlook. For example, "snowpiercer", a movie about a train that goes around the entire world. That's just plain dumb. But I accepted it for what it was and managed to enjoy the rest of the movie. but with this crap right here.....Don't even get me started on plot holes... Example: All the kids sent to earth have wristbands that send their vitals back to a space station. but when the kids start taking them off, since their is no signal going to the space-station, the Adults up there assume they're dead. so you're telling me you can design A fancy futuristic wristband that monitors vital signs....but can't determine the difference between taking it off, or the person just getting killed? that's just stupid right there. -pacing: It felt like originally each episode of this show was suppose to be twice as long, but at the last minuet they had to edit it down to 45 minuets. Everybody is constantly spewing exposition in your face. And when they aren't spewing exposition.....they're talking.....and talking....You need some gosh darn silence every once in a while, but apparently ain't nobody got time fo' dat'
3.0~Why my rating has dropped from an 8 to a 3 jabel-93009 Sign in Permalink I want to start out by saying that I used to really enjoy this show. It was just plain cool- I loved the premise that a bunch of people who have lived through nuclear Armageddon by going to space, return to earth, and find that there's people who have survived and have a new culture all their own. Language, towns, rites and rituals- all fascinating. In season five, it was decided to do a do-over, having killed off almost everyone, by having yet another nuclear storm that I guess was world wide. A new group from space lands, and total chaos erupts. A lot of very positive reviews are being posted. But, count me out. I'm finding the new season tedious, dark- literally too- I often can't see what's going on, and so hopeless.
6.0~Full of Potential but Suffering from Identity Crisis poetictank Sign in Permalink Firstly, I was hesitant in picking up this show after reading the reviews and seeing some trailers on the internet.It took me several weeks to hurdle past the first 4 or 5 episodes, but then I was hooked. Season 1 had some truly great character developments and left you wondering, "What next?". The story line was fairly predictable from the beginning, but some of the betrayals and plots had significant enough twists that kept you questioning the sky people's next move. In Season 2, a lot of the surviving characters, both main and secondary presences, felt dragged along and more of an annoyance than an actual pinpoint for the show. At times, I've felt that the writers took away and added characters simply to fill-in gaps and it tended to lead towards sloppier writing. However, I did appreciate some unexpected betrayals and the well-written main plot of the show that led the sky people to their final achievement at the end of the season. Thirdly, Season 3 feels very loose and unpolished. It feels like the character development is dry and that all of the great twists, plots and changes in the show were bled dry towards the mid-end of Seasons 1 and 2. All-in-all, the show has potential but doesn't feel like the either the producers/writers/directors are in sync in terms of what the show's identity truly is. Actually, that's a perfect way to describe the lacking parks of this show: an identity crisis. Some actors seem to have adopted different styles of portraying their roles, some more convincing and easier to watch than others. Sometimes, the show feels like it's being maturely written on par with a show by the likes of Game of Thrones, Vikings or Breaking Bad, but then suffers from a case of still wanting to be a teenager with cringe-worthy scenes and character developments. I truly believe that this show could've been a one of a kind if it just decided to steer far away from some of the casting that's more pleasing to the eyes than the heart and some of cheesiest writing that you'll witness in a while.
7.0~Pretty cool concept michaelcook-43025 Sign in Permalink Although the first few episodes were cheesy, the concept intrigued me enough to continue watching. It did get better, but there are so many things about the show that just don't make sense. They send a group of 'criminals' down to Earth to see if it's inhabitable, but just let 300 people die on the ark in order to save resources - why not just send those people down too; at least they would have a chance for survival. They use terms that, over the course of 100 years, would probably not be used so much; in particular, they use the word "hanged" when referencing the attempted hanging of one of their own instead of "floated," which is the term they use every other time they talk about killing somebody. The moment the group lands on Earth, they realize they are 20 miles from the place they should be, and make it the whole way and back in a day...um, this is their first day EVER on Earth...they have never walked in nature before, and there is no way their lungs/bodies could hold up to 40 miles of walking in a day...or even a week. The acting started out awful, but has continuously gotten better through each episode. Special effects are decent for a TV show. In episode one, mention is made to several other arks...it would be interesting to see these arks join in on the show...one last thing; the "grounders" have survived for 100 years after nuclear war...it seems unlikely that they would be 'savages' or idiots who never tried to communicate with the ark. Yes, this is a pretty bad review, but somehow, the concept of the show intrigues me enough to say it's better than average!
10.0~Awesome show! xenimuspowerup Sign in Permalink In my opinion this show is alot better and alot more realistic than game of thrones. Definately worth watching 10/10!
1.0~Way too much drama. eveolinerules222 Sign in Permalink I have seen shows add in extra unnecessary drama to make it seem more appealing and to make the show last but, just, wow. This show takes the cake on unnecessary drama awards. From start to finish just constant little drama scenes for no reason. Stuff that could easily have been avoided or has nothing to do with the plot other then just adding in drama happens ever few mins, its ridiculous. Not only that, they send a bunch of teen kids who seem to be the only prisoners anymore to a plant without any training or warning and let them do whatever they like. I do however like the concept of the show of all humans dieing out and the ship coming back to repopulate it. Just the implementation of it turns it into a teen drama for no reason what so ever.
10.0~best show giuliageus Sign in Permalink I've read a lot of negative and positive reviews, a lot of people mentioned holes, which a lot of them are answered in the show! just watch it first, then write a review! this is one of the best shows to come out, i watched the first season in one day! i was hooked! don't judge it by the first episode, you got to give it time for the story to unfold. i look forward to Wednesday so i can watch a new episode, i think this show is great, its got a bit of everything, action,romance, attractive characters, and a good storyline, i do think that end of season 1 and season 2 is the best, but overall this show is great give it a chance! 10/10
6.0~Narcissistic, selfish, calculative and unlikable main characters user-895-587379 Sign in Permalink The show really is brainless in the sense that the characters exhibit all the negative teenager traits. I actually was starting to enjoy the show but as the episodes kept coming and characters kept developing I begun to realize that none of them were likable. For me this ruins the show since it's all about the characters and politics. The least likable for me is the main character Clarke, every time she opens her mouth I just want to cringe. A narcissistic selfish calculative character, yet they try to sell her as a leader and hero. I think the concept of the show is good, but the me against the world selfish narcissistic characters they develop are stress inducing to watch.
3.0~Written by a 10-year-old? johntwatterson Sign in Permalink Written by a 10-year-old?How anyone survived a nuclear Armageddon on the show boggles the mind of anybody with a double digit in IQ. Every single person in the show displays nothing but savagery stupidity and speciesism. You can count on every episode for at least one of the characters mostly more than one to make a stupid decision one that affects everybody. In an actual situation most of these people wouldn't even have the proper Position to make most of the decisions that are made in this ridiculous series. It's my view that it's a total failure, but it is watchable if you like to watch Bruce Willis films, which are equally stupid.
5.0~Great start but continue decrease - from season to season mail-92229 Sign in Permalink For seasons 1&2 my rating would have been (at least a) 9! But thereafter storyline, behavior of characters... started to change and not in a favorable manner Season 5 was overall a disappointment (at max good for 2 stars). Thus 5/10 is a quite kind average
2.0~Some very good questions jessicafiddler-76-140269 Sign in Permalink It's really unfortunate and was apparent even after a few minutes of watching that they just didn't put in enough time introducing the situation and characters. We can't feel for people we don't know or care about an earth that no one knows anything about. Aside from the writing and acting being just too fast so far, this show does offer a teenager friendly alternative to the apocalyptic "Walking Dead" kind of entertainment we see on TV lately. Human race being wiped out, earth in jeopardy, etc. The real problem I have with this is that it's cheap. They are relying on a few CGI tricks to keep people's attention away from bad development. Who taught the second generation engineering, physics, construction, medicine and every branch of these fields? How much of people's days are spent trying to keep an aging space station up to speed? How did they keep plates, spoons, forks, shoes, cloth, plastic, and every piece of glass for 100 years? Do they have iron smelts? Do they have any raw materials? What fuel do they burn? I don't know about you guys but I need to buy new underwear at least every 6 months. Where are the sheep? The cotton plants? the cows? How did they keep sewing machines operational without manufacturing replacement parts? What about agriculture? It takes approximately 1 acre to feed one person. An acre is the size of a soccer field. 4,000 acres? and how have they maintained the quality of the soil with the depletion of nutrients? Like I said, this is just cheap. I took a few minutes with Google to come up with so many problems this show has. There are just too many better shows going right now. But if the time slot doesn't coincide with something better, I can see teenagers watching it. For me, I'd rather watch random Youtube vids or listen to a pod cast.
4.0~All production no personality or plot egwardo84 Sign in Permalink This had potential, but sloppy writing and poor acting results in standard American teen dross! The first episode suggests that after 97 years in space they send 100 people down to earth to see if it is safe because there are only 4 months of resources left in space. If they haven't come up with any other options than return to earth in the 97 years they have to think about it, what other options do they think they are going to find in 4 months, so why wouldn't they take the whole spaceship back to earth? They haven't got any other options! Not to mention the fact that it would probably take months to get the thousands of people to re-enter the atmosphere safely. Setting that aside they send 100, what they consider criminals to Earth and don't seems to have considered the possibility that they may go AWOL. I have only seen 1 episode and I could go on, but what's the point, the series ain't worth in more ways than one.
8.0~Low-budget but awesome mroq Sign in Permalink When I first saw this production, I said immediately that it is something like "Twilight" but with time came that I was wrong. It turned out that this is one of the best post apocalyptic series. The story itself attracts the viewer and makes it hard to walk away from the TV. The advantage of this production are characteristically heroes. The main character of the show is a teenage Clarke who has many faces, from episode to episode we get to know it from the other side, but despite that she is a main character, it remains in the shadow of secondary characters. Bellamy, Octavia, Jasper, Kane, Raven and Monty - the actors who played them managed to create such a colorful and distinctive characters, that for a long time after watching, has to be kept in mind. Each of them gradually develops and makes never be too many of them on the screen. In addition, the show has a lot of great actors who have appeared only episodically and still managed to grab the viewer's heart e.g Alycia Debnam-Carey, who despite the fact that she looks like a sweet girl - plays one of the toughest women in the show. Another advantage are the obstacles in the way of heroes. They have to deal with the Grounders, fiercely defending their territory, mutated animals and psychopaths who want everything for themselves. In the world of "The 100" practically everything that moves, it is deadly and that is just beautiful. The series has one, but very visible, and for some people, annoying minus - special effects. Through them, you will see how low the budget is this series. Summarizing. "The 100" proved to be one of the best science fiction series in recent years. The creators have already announced the next season and I hope that the show will maintain its own climate, because it is awesome. Sorry for my bad English D: doing my best :)
9.0~not as bad as all these reviews say chanelmacd Sign in Permalink this is actually a pretty good show. a lot of people will be turned off by the first few episodes because everything seems pretty implausible, the characters pretty shallow, and the whole premise kind of ridiculous. however, this changes about halfway through!! if you're just watching the show to pick apart its scientific accuracy, then you'll be satisfied. but if you're watching this show because of the intriguing premise and just looking for some entertainment, then you'll find it's not bad at all. the characters will start to have actual depth. the plot twists will actually surprise you. it's one of the better sci-fi shows of today. people keep calling it a useless teen drama, but it doesn't stay that way for long. these kids are criminals, not high schoolers. there are some pretty good plot points and moral dilemmas that leave you wondering which characters are good and which are bad. you might not like all of them, but you're not supposed to. liking all of them would be boring. watch it when you're bored and you might start liking it, especially the last few episodes. don't let the attractive faces turn you off, because the acting ain't all that bad.
7.0~It's a great show after all. ric-brasacchio Sign in Permalink When I started watching The 100 I thought it was the stereotypical teen drama series, and for most of its first season I was right. In 1st season the plot was focusing mainly on the teens' relationships and even though it was enjoyable it seemed a little boring after awhile. The only exciting plot line was the one focusing on Wells Jaha, Murphy and Charlotte, but they killed Wells and Charlotte pretty soon in the season. Second season was a totally different thing, the Mountain Men introduction and the alliance between Arkers and Grounders took the show in a darker direction, I love what they have done to the show, they have transformed a Vampire Diaries type of show into one bad- ass show. Still there are technical problems sometimes, like the day/night continuum (that's not always followed) or the medical skills and equipment not always following real anatomy and procedures. In conclusion I suggest to everyone who want to watch something enjoyable to start watching this show, but I wouldn't recommend it to sci-fi geeks.
1.0~A show for morons, by morons jhk655 Sign in Permalink I saw the title on Netflix and thought the premise was interesting. I decided to give it a try. I made it five minutes before I felt like throwing up and I closed the browser window. Unless you're an idiot kid, don't waste your time. Bad writing, bad directing, bad editing. It's just bad.The only people who would think this schlock is good would be sixteen year- olds. Nothing more to say. It's just a fantastically bad show. I felt obligated to try and warn people away so that they do not make the same mistake I did. I cannot get that five minutes back, not ever. So here it is. My warning. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA BS, YOU WILL REGRET IT.
10.0~I am obsessed Headstrong827 Sign in Permalink I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews on here. Speaking as a working 23 yr old, It's not all just "high school drama" like the other reviews have it listed as. Sure, if you're going to be nit-picky with every detail you will find inconsistencies. (Seriously? To the review that wrote that they wore makeup) You will fall in love with Clarke's character. This isn't your typical show. It's different and exciting and will constantly be surprising you. I absolutely love this show. I've been recommending it to all of my friends and they've loved it as well. This show is definitely worth giving a try. And when you fall in love with it, recommend it to others. I'd hate for this become another canceled show just because not enough people knew about it.
1.0~Season 5 it,s became boring alexf-38559 Sign in Permalink They have to let the story continue with the child ( the new comander) not brake it all the time, That,s what the serie it,s all about "comander,s and wild people. To much betrail and drama. To much running and Clark she make a really bad caracter on this season with no point .They have to Make this more intersting, The season it,s get really boring .
1.0~Shallow Teenage Drama mjleppan Sign in Permalink As others have said the premise holds a lot of potential but the final product is just another teenage drama. The show focuses on a group of kids who end up in a forest trying to survive, while that might sound like a good story, in reality it means watching teens doing things other teens would find entertaining. As a sci-fi you might wonder why the drop ship didn't land in a more post apocalyptic setting? Instead it's just a forest. I guess they did this to bring budget costs down. The show might have a few gems here and there, but they're so few and far between the predominant teenage drama that it's not worth watching. The overall soap opera "bold and beautiful" cheese can be found everywhere. The kids too aren't that entertaining, most of the show plays out in cliché plot lines brought on by mindless teens doing stupid things. They should kill this show off fast.
9.0~perfect haider-87244 Sign in Permalink Best ever tv series i hope they will produce more seasons
9.0~Really good series! taisbaumannv Sign in Permalink The first season of this series ate me so much. I loved it and i couldn't stop. The story is so interesting, making me wanna know what's in that world? Characters are cool, and interesting. Nice fighting scenes and nice drama!
9.0~very under-rated dwoolfe99 Sign in Permalink This is probably the most under-rated show on television. Few professional critics reviewed it. Those who did based their opinions on the first few episodes of season 1. Early on, the show seemed to have a good premise, but the execution was in question. It seemed a typical CW show - teenagers stranded in a post-apocalyptic future earth form cliques and develop love triangles, etc. The characters seemed like the expected pretty boys and girls with flat personalities - generic "hero" types. However, as the series progresses through season 1, to the remarkable conclusion of season 2, this show becomes more and more gripping until it is impossible to wait for another episode. It's best to watch it all once you have it taped, rather than week by week. The plotting and pacing are outstanding. The characters develop depth over time. And it is unexpectedly dark and edgy for a CW show - very dark. In this post-apocalypse environment, the characters must make hard choices. Their is no sugar coating the consequences of those choices as you would expect. The ending of season 2 is like a punch in the gut. I won't say any more. You just have to see it for yourself. The acting on this show is generally average, though it improves as the series goes on and the actors become accustomed to their roles. Special mention goes to Eliza Taylor who plays "Clark," a natural born but reluctant leader who must make the most difficult choices to save her people. The arc of this character is impressive. The actress brings some depth to the role, even as the dialogue is not always up to snuff. She is one to watch for in the future. What is impressive about this show - aside from the incredible suspense it generates, is that it fits into the "young adult fiction" genre - teenagers in a post-apocalyptic environment (i.e. Hunger Games and Divergent) but is ultimately far more adult than you would ever expect. If you enjoy science fiction, this one is not to be missed. Don't be fooled by the tone that is set in the first few episodes. Stick with it - you won't be disappointed.
10.0~Overall really good chehbounka Sign in Permalink The 100 starts off very slow, and I must admit, I didn't want to keep watching it after a few minutes of the first episode, and after the second episode, I had given up. A few weeks later, I had nothing to watch, and I randomly decided to start watching episode 3. As I noticed it started getting better, I kept on watching. The show got great, exciting with lots of blood (but not too much), very interesting characters and the actors really got better and made us feel their characters. At first, I had thought that the show was just poorly casted, but the actors really entered their characters better with time. I must say, this is the second show I entirely watched without skipping - not even one episode, or one minute! Every scene feels important and nothing ever bores you. I could go as far as to say the 100 is a great show; not only for typical CW viewers, but also for adults. To be honest, I wouldn't expect this show to have realistic, brilliantly written sci-fi. This one is a great way to escape from reality, and it really is entertaining. Just try it out and judge it for yourself. I wouldn't rely on the comments because you may think differently. Only thing is, give it at least 5 episodes because the 3 first are not the best, and I see that people tend to judge the show on its pace or the fact that its "science" is not realistic. Yes, the girls are very healthy and pretty, wear "natural" type makeup, have relatively good hair and somehow manage to shave their armpits. Because it's the CW, and as you may know, everyone needs to be pretty to be on a CW show. The 100 was originally a book by Kass Morgan, which tells us pretty much the same story in the beginning, except for some character details. I was surprised to see that this show's ratings on IMDb, it's really underrated and I was mostly surprised to see that shows like Riverdale have higher ratings. Just readjust your expectations before watching it. Don't expect the science to make sense.
8.0~It's far deeper than the average show that it takes a while to get it unparagoned-342-643540 Sign in Permalink I had it on in the background for the first two seasons. I thought it was terrible unrealistic trash. All the characters acted as if they were crazy bipolar animals. It was soo unrealistic it was hard to watch. But actually it's the most accurate and realistic portrait of mankind I've ever seen. "The difference between reality and fiction is that fiction has to make sense". In good fiction the motives, actions, etc of people follow some kind of logic, even if it is some kind of extreme morality. The problem with this show is that it's too realistic. So quite a bit of the stupid and silly stuff in the first two seasons turns out to be the foundations for an incredibly realistic, complex story-line and characters. It's far more nuanced and in depth than you normally expect but once you understand that it raises it to another level.
10.0~One of my favorite tv-shows! andreasvfriberg Sign in Permalink I've followed this show since there was one season and have been looking forward to the next season every year. The evolving in every season is great and never leaves you bored, season 1 is like the intro but from season 2 and forward you are never bored. Deffiantly worth a chance. I like the comparison to Game of Thrones, since.. characters are going to die. You can only get hooked on the series if you watch season 1! "Jus drein jus daun."
7.0~First episodes DON'T do it justice... chabs_232 Sign in Permalink Well, it is to be expected really: Pilots are sometimes NOT representative of the quality of a show. There's half a dozen examples that come to mind, suffice to say, this show shouldn't be judged by it's "cover". What starts of as a full fledged "teenage drama" ends up delivering the most griping sci-fi drama. Honestly, the people who put in their review the fact that the show is essentially a teenage drama are DEAD wrong. They corrected that mistake quickly, and thankfully the whole show isn't tainted. These people just didn't bother finishing it up, really. This show is NOT perfect, it certainly is no Game of Thrones (which has books to back it up), but it does well on it's own, despite some inconsistencies that I've noted and your regular "I'm a hero" and "I'm a total dumb-dumb" archetypes. That and the multiple times characters just seem to find each other in that dense forest where the majority of the show has taken place so far, are the only things that still makes me cringe now and then while watching. I somehow got hooked and made it past the first 2-3 episodes of doom, but I can guarantee you that it'll pump your jam once you're past that point! Sure, you'll be like "What the HECK is this crap" once in a while, but it's all worth it.
3.0~Huge potential, terrible outcome burebista Sign in Permalink The basic idea behind the show promised great entertainment, but the outcome is depressing. So 97 years after a nuclear holocaust, 100 young-ens are sent back to Earth, in a desperate attempt to save the human race from extinction. They land and start Project X... and by that I do not mean some secretive plan to save everyone, but Project X the teen movie. They start drinking, fighting, f*cking, drinking some more, occasionally dying, like idiots. The show is a cliché fest, the love triangle, the bad boy that turns good, the clown who saves the day, the asshole with a good heart, you've got them all. You get even sexy aborigines, that speak English, some trying to kill them, some saving the sexy chick. And then you would expect the adults (back in space) to be more mature. No chance, they're worse. They finally find out they could live on Earth and what do they do? They start killing, blowing things up and generally adding all sort of pathetic schemes to an already lame plot.
10.0~Awesome Show angel_baby_1447 Sign in Permalink I went into this show being skeptical because I am not a huge fan of shows like this and let me say, I am extremely impressed! This show is by far some of the best television I have seen in awhile, ever since Breaking Bad ended. I hope that people are not turned off this show because some people don't like it. I know that not everyone will enjoy this show, I think it is largely a younger generation show because everyone I have talked to that is my age, genuinely enjoys this show. Yes there are a few things that I could say they could have done better but, I love that they used a cast of mostly unknown actors/actresses because I think it gives a certain feeling to the show knowing that these actors weren't picked based on popularity but because they were truly right for the part. Needless to say I hope that this show does not get canceled because it is truly amazing work.
4.0~We can do whaever the hell we want pavlinaarx Sign in Permalink "Hundred" is one of the most viewed serials. Why? Exciting plot, atmosphere of danger, fear. You feel something bad has to happen. People on the Arx are struggling to survive. Officials declared all cases capital to decrease population. Strong agitation was made to prevent rebels. But old ship is falling apart so they sent hundred to Earth. The hundred are free to do whatever it wants without any rules. Power is the only way to rule. They were parting till the moment they realized rules are needed. Brilliant plot, isn't it? But creators managed to screw it up. Why? Because one can be murdered by one shot and another can be beaten by crowd and still be able to fight. It is unfair and ridiculous. There are holes in plot in each episode. Serial can be good if you can close eyes on plot holes. It is exciting after all. If you are a perfectionist (like me) it is prohibitted to watch this serial.
10.0~10/10 ahmedmohh-56345 Sign in Permalink Very recommended 9.2/10 at least you must be watching this
9.0~Don't know what your got theknownames Sign in Permalink Til it's gone. I stumbled across this early on and binged watched it, now I know there is nothing else like it. Rich story telling, tons of content. I miss it. At the time I thought it was good but now that I know what else is out there wow it was better then good and I compare much to The 100 to not much avail
8.0~Great show...only one issue lunahalo Sign in Permalink I love this show. My only issue is that no one on the show EVER has any sense of urgency. Your life is in danger, let's talk and say goodbye for 3 minutes. The alarm is going and guards are coming, now it's time for some exposition.
7.0~Good but not great aronsteel Sign in Permalink Really thought it might be something to get hooked on to but when I started watching it turned out not so great. It was good but not good enough.
2.0~Enough holes to fly a spaceship thru Red5ddp Sign in Permalink It's very pretty, the effects are good, acting so so. But the things that don't make sense! Any crime gets you tossed out the airlock? And everyone is ok with this? No revolt, no resistance? Episode 1 they sentence a doctor to death. Really? The ark is so abundant with medical professionals that they can just willy nilly chuck them into the void? They sent 100 kids to earth with...no supplies at all? No tents, backpacks, axes, matches, first aid, Geiger counters, water, nothing? The girl who is attacked by some sea creature that merely pushes her from one of the pond to the other...on the surface? And when they rescue her all she has is some scrapes and cuts? Hey, we're on a planet where we know nothing about conditions, where or how to find food and water only one girl can read a map, so what should we do? Dance like Party Boy from Jackass of course!
2.0~acting? ryanbrode Sign in Permalink The story is cool and the flashbacks are kinda interesting but the acting really does kill the show. this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen in a TV show. it feels like they just found the best looking and youngest looking people they could find, without giving a single f**k about their actually acting skills. it is really hard to relate with these characters and, because of that, really hard to become attached to these characters. you can tell the writers worked very hard to try and make you feel for the main girl but because of the way the actor portrays the character it just feels lazy and unoriginal. however, i watch and love this show anyway. it has an immense amount of entertainment value because of how much it sucks. i cant explain it but this show is amazing.
10.0~Interesting story peytonbgraham Sign in Permalink This show is amazing! It is so different from other shows, bringing a new and different story. First episode didn't really interest me that much but after I watched the second episode I just got so hooked on the show that I couldn't stop watching it. The actors are amazing, and the story is really interesting. When you read it's summary it might not seem that interesting, the whole 'nuclear war and spaceship' thing but give it a try, you won't regret it. So if the first or second doesn't seem interesting to you, just give it another chance because you just have to get properly into the story. The characters develop in a realistic way
1.0~Why? rufsetufshesten Sign in Permalink OK, I know expecting rational decisions from TV characters is demanding a lot, but sending a 100 untrained juvenile criminals to see if earth is safe? Come on. And the kids themselves couldn't be stupider if they tried. They are, quite literally, to dumb to survive. Only a couple of them are even remotely likable, and one of them is a tiny girl who kills one of the others to sleep better at night. You get the totalitarian anarchist dude("I don't want any rules, just do everything I tell you!"), the absurdly liberal girl and, of course, the maverick rule-breaker. The token black main character gets offed in the third episode, and he's all the better for it. I have wasted about two hours of my life on this crap, and I would suggest that you guys don't. Do something better with your time, like recreational cat herding, or DIY scrotum-piercing. Both will be more rewarding and less painful.
7.0~Flawed but entertaining Windsun33 Sign in Permalink This is not the worst SF TV drama ever, as some have said. Neither is the best (that would probably be Firefly). There are numerous really dumb plot devices, such as the over the top teen angst and Lord of the Flies trope. And you have to wonder how a bunch of kids who have never even seen a plant bigger than a hydroponic tomato all of a sudden have l33t survival and forestry skills. But even with all the flaws I find the show entertaining, perhaps partly because I am a disaster/apocalypse movie freak. I find the overall premise and plot line interesting in spite of it's errors. Network nearly always does SF badly (such as Under the Dome, one of the worst), so it is perhaps just that this is better than most that makes it watchable.
9.0~The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078 Tss5078 Sign in Permalink From the beginning of the series, the 100 had three strikes against it, making its success seem almost miraculous. This show is based on a trilogy of novels, in most cases the show/film is never as good as the books, but in this case it's better. Second, the show was a mid-summer replacement, something that almost never makes it passed it's first season, and finally it's on the CW, so most people assume it's just another teen drama, but the 100 is a lot more than that. The reason this show has survived and the reason it's been named one of the best shows on television that you're not watching, is because of it's terrific story lines, deep characters, and unique make up. When Entertainment Weekly said it's the most underrated shows on television they weren't kidding. 150 years in the future, Earth has been all but destroyed by World War 3, and the remains of the human race, the lucky decedents of people who escaped the cataclysm, live on a space station called the Ark. Resources on the Ark are extremely limited and for that reason, crime is met with death, unless you're under the age of eighteen, in that case the punishment is imprisonment. After nearly 100 years in space, the Ark is dying and the leaders know their only hope for survival is to return to Earth, but can they withstand the radiation? In order to test this, they decide to send 100 of the least violent juvenile offenders down to the planet as test subjects. As the kids set up camp and learn to live on the planet, their accomplishments quickly take a backseat when they learn, they are not alone. Most TV shows that are based on books, never seem to be able to capture the essence of the main characters and for that reason people never really get a complete look at what the author intended. In the 100 saga, the skilled actors and the tremendous writing allow you to connect to characters in a way that goes above and beyond the original story. This is a show that also has many sub-plots, it's not simply about the kids on earth, the people in space, and the survivors on the planet. the viewer learns backstory through flashbacks and knows every character and their history intimately. As I watched this show, I really felt as though I was a member of this camp and I knew everybody, only a great show can accomplish this. This is a show that is so much more than just another CW teen drama, it is a look into the new direction the network is taking with shows like Arrow & The Flash. The 100 is a continuous story that you will not be able to stop watching. It is intense, exciting, and has more depth to the story than any show I've seen in a long time. If you can get over the fact that its a CW show and prominently features a group of teenagers, you will see one of the most interesting and dynamic science fiction shows to air on network television in years.
10.0~This show Creeps up on you. madigan0895 Sign in Permalink I'm a 50 year old SciFi, Fantasy enthusiast always looking to fill my entertainment needs, so i'll always give a show a chance. I can Honestly say that after watching a few episodes of this show, I was ready to throw in the towel. Finding good SciFi and Fantasy shows these days is not an easy thing and when you do the networks pull the plug and you are left hanging. It can be quite frustrating for those who favor this genre of show. Needless to say that due to a lack of SciFi/Fantasy type shows available I decided to stick with it. I'm not sure exactly what point I realized that i began liking this show, probably around the 6th or 7th episode and then by seasons end I was quite satisfied with the way things were developing. I was quite surprised and delighted to see that they were going to have a 2nd season and somehow the show avoided cancellation. The 1st season ended with a solid 6.5 grade imo. Onto the Second season where it picked up where it left off and I noticed immediately the quality of the intro and sets had been upgraded significantly and as I got a few episodes into it I realized this show was becoming downright outstanding and it continued throughout the rest of the Season. Don't give up on this show even if the temptation to do so is difficult to resist because you patience will be thoroughly rewarded with a unique and intriguing completely original story line with a fantastically immersive world and great character development. This is my current favorite show just behind GOT and that says a lot. Do not be fooled by anyone calling this a SciFi, It is not, It is a Fantasy show with SciFi elements and a darn good one. This old timer that couldn't stomach shows like 90210 can tell you this isn't just a teen show, It's pure entertainment and shouldn't be missed.
1.0~The ideology is worrying ChrisOlliYo Sign in Permalink As an audience, one has to review a show by its overall storyline, the plots, the actors' acting skills, the development of characters, the consistency and so on. Considering the issues mentioned above are well covered, I'll focus on what's relatively more important and yet rarely being written: what message a show conveys to its audience; what is the moral of the story and what the said message could affect its audience. That being said, I have to review the show with a serious approach. This show begins with the conflict between the sky crew and the grounders due to the territory scrambling. Then, as the show progresses, more groups are involved and therefore, it creates more drama. Drama is essential for tv shows, but the problem is how the drama is initiated and how it plays out. This is where I have to take the writers to task for the bad writing. The scenarios often start off "shoot first" nonsense. Whenever you see strangers, kill first without confirming their intentions. Far-fetched scenarios over and over again, which challenges viewers intelligence and common sense. It's absurd when you think about in an apocalytic world where there're not many people left, people would tend to seek out their kind and rely on each other more. There's not much basic human interactions between people of different groups, let alone diplomacy. Endless circles of violence which lead to seemingly unavoidable bloodshed is actual product of lack of communication. The show runners try their hardest to make everything morally blur by creating sticky situations to confuse audience about what's right and what's wrong. This problem manifests when it comes to certain points where certain characters don't have to face justice after killing a person or a group of people. So, in general, in order to make the characters' (usually the main characters) killing excusable, the characters always kill in the name of survival. It has to be "either us or them" situations. The logic works like a charm in most of the scenarios until the innocent people are also killed as collateral damage. This shows goes too far that even the main characters are morally bankrupt. And it gets worse, in season 3, one of the main character massacred 300 grounders without facing consequences. This mindset behind the writing is horrying; as long as the characters struggle a bit between right and wrong and it's okay to do the wrong; as long as the characters shows signs of remorse, then thou should be forgiven. Justice doesn't work like that in any reality as far as I'm concerned. It becomes more and more clear the show doesn't take human lives seriously. The only lives that matter are the main characters. Because the main characters are members of Sky Crew, the grounders (or any other group of people) as a whole are vilified as lesser human beings who don't deserve to live. It's a very dangerous undertone message of the show subconsciously affecting its audience. The belief of inequality among human beings and the supremacy of a group of people is the root of evil. The value system of the show is fundamentally wrong. The show runners fail to deal with sensitive issues with discreetness, hence this show is unwatchable.
1.0~No mercy, No humanity, No morale, Not funny either, No logic ravishjain Sign in Permalink I have never seen a more repelling show errr i did see Game of thrones though. I hated game of thrones but this is another level. There is no logic in the show. One moment a person wants peace the other he kills innocents, kids, women for no reason whatsoever. I am from India so yes i am not unknown to content without logic but this is a masterpiece. There are no good guys in the show, and the show admits it in the end. Civilizations are killed and the director tries to justify it. Every time someone does something crazy like killing children and innocent men and women, they start regretting it the next second so that viewers could forgive them. And right in the very next moment they repeat it just exponentially worse and guess what they regret it again) A kid becomes the leader of a group of people while they are fighting for survival .. no one challenges ) This kid is willing to get all of them killed for one guy .. no one challenges her authority. This kid gets killed 300 odd people in a missile attack, but they seem to accept it. Grounders .. more like common man here gets killed murdered nobody seems to care A scared little 12 yr old girl one moment .. kills a guy next moment I am not gonna watch past season 2 if director wants to justify all this bs in further seasons but i do feel sorry that shows like these are popular while real content is missing out on tele. I guess what they say is right ... what you get is what you deserve.
8.0~Better than the rating salva-ds Sign in Permalink It's at least a 8.0-8.3 series, sure, the first half of the first season was awful, it seemed like a teenager plot with awful acting. But it became much much better, it has had some amazing episode Tough this last season had some dull moments too. But all i'll say is give it a shot and at least finish the 1st season before deciding. Now spoilers.. Some people need to be removed from the cast tough.. Bellamy, Jaha... Clarke's character is great I loved they got rid of the worst part of the show wish was Finn Maybe less episodes wouldn't be a bad idea .
6.0~Needs work on quality and continuity earthdancergrrl Sign in Permalink I really like the idea of this show, but the writing could be better. Would civilization on their last leg send a bunch of unsupervised, unschooled teens who hadn't been the least prepared on what they might find or how to deal with nuclear remnants or survivors that might exist? I'm frustrated they use violence as first response to every situation that occurs. Studying the past history of Earth, as occurred on the Ark, these people should know not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Really, fighting, blowing up things and killing before trying peaceful resolution makes for "good" TV but not for very practical survival. And then the "grownups" arrive and don't even listen to the experiences the "kids" have weathered and keep making rules and policies based on old laws. Aaaarrrrgggghhhh I sincerely hope the writers will listen to the fans' responses and make a cohesive, meaningful, educated show that could be Great.
3.0~bad acting justinraphaelm Sign in Permalink Bad acting. I watched the first 20 minutes of episode 1 and turned it off. You might think I was jumping the gun, and maybe I was, but with acting that bad to start, you can only be hoping that people will continue to watch...For god sake, build the characters up a little before you attempt to drop any sentimental evocation... Just too cheesy to continue after 20 minutes.
1.0~its a CW show .. m-dybdal Sign in Permalink brainless .. and model actors with like any other CW show , its like watching old time day time "soap " actors trying to play real actors ... and thats just painful to me..and i cant believe the ones that like this show at all but there u go .. some like soap and crap and others like actors that have something to do on TV or movies .. when some or this actors talk .. it sounds like they are reading from the scrip .. but my wife likes it so -.- thats why i have " seen " a more of this TV show and it makes me wanna PUKE.. if your looking for a good show " and i HOPE u are " then look somewhere else "and this rule that i need to type 10 lines about a show this bad is silly too when there is nothing more to say about it .. in fact i can do a review about this show in one word ..its that BAD !
10.0~My new binge additction! rickochetkat Sign in Permalink I just binged the latest 5 seasons of this awesome series! I want more! It starts off feeling like a teen drama, (although most actors are in their middle 20's-50's) but soon becomes far more. The concept is superb and story telling at a nice fast pace. A mix of GOT meets Space, meets end of world, meets humanity at it's worst and at it's best! As the seasons go on the actors become cemented within their character roles and are obviously very committed. Award winning performances for many of them hands down! A top fave show I look forward too next season! Give it a try! Give it time to get going like any show starting off! Each season is better then the last, and all connect so well with a continued story line.
9.0~Amazing and Engrossing arindams1 Sign in Permalink One of the best series, watched on Netflix. Though sometimes it slows down, overall keeps your engrossed in the events in our beloved earth. The characters are well written and portrayed by the actors, with Bellamy and Octavia being my favorite.
1.0~The lack of any logic dents human knowledge beyond repair. bourke001 Sign in Permalink The plot is so very skewed from anything real or even for a fantasy flick. Especially Clarke, the actor is pathetic, just as the noob actors (for all the producer could afford). The character Clarke makes countless decisions that are wrong / bad / incorrect / unethical and with no consequence or remorse. Reasonable basis for ranks and leadership is skewed. Each episode is goofed up at least 20 times. A pathetic flick trying hard to be a post apocalyptic version of GoT, with teens as main theme, and survival being the other. Logic is dead; you will want to break your head and cry out loud. The concept could may been intended well; but on-screen execution = extremely bad and poorly directed. Good points: acceptance and normalising of actors of all races, both genders and Lesb* people for various roles and relationships on screen.
10.0~bllod must have blood bornlegend-brunobarcelos Sign in Permalink This series is about a group send to the ground years later a nuclear apocalypse. Leaving on the Arc, the remaining survivors must face terrible decisions in order to survive. On the ground, the 100 discover that the earth is survivable and start a new journey to seek for supplies. What they didn't knew was that they were not alone. Series full of action, drama, romance and for what i know they are filming it in real places. I fully advice you to watch it. BorNLeGEND
3.0~3rd season is a train wreck folks . the first two seasons were great bsofakind Sign in Permalink The third season is a train wreck. A show that had so much promise and great scripts has now been turned into a lesbian fan fair for the comic con festivals. What a disaster. Count me out until the screen writers get off their gay driven agenda Poor dialogue Poor acting Lost killed off strong leaders in the series And now you enlist Thane from Black Sails and relegate him to a minor role as a wimp. I gave you three stars and I was being generous. My first thoughts were to give you 1 star for ruining a great TV series
10.0~New favorite show kevin_chens Sign in Permalink This show is just spectacular. The thrill and suspense leaves you wanting more and more.
8.0~Lord of the Flies with no science henrykipp65 Sign in Permalink There are only so many premises that Hollywood seems capable of adapting, so if we look to using a rating that is additive without ever dividing for a weighted average, I would say science as a ZERO, medical and physical reality as a ZERO, and the plot devices of "wow, would people of any age when faced with questions of common sense, morality, and ethics actually behave in such a fashion?" as an EIGHT. then you still get an overall score of EIGHT. Just being skillful enough to make me tune in repeatedly, to and if not to particularly care about the characters, but to actually cringe at the situations in which they are placed, that is enough for my good rating.
1.0~Is it stupidest twilight version ... moneyhi06 Sign in Permalink I cant believe that they can such a stupid drama on such a good topic. All main stars are kids.. feels like i am watching twilight, where they have too many romantic scenes than the real life nature horrors if there is a nuclear bomb on the earth. No suspense, no nuclear related issues, just some teenagers mocking around. .. i felt LOST AND Battlestar Galactica is much much better than this. Where the acting was realistic, concepts were there, suspense was there. I am surprised how come they renew the season 2. Don't even bother to watch this.. its just a waste of time.
8.0~Worth watching! olofbrannfjord Sign in Permalink The begging is pretty slow but still interesting and then season 3 is kind of wierd but it's ok. The rest is fantastic, They have created a fantastic world with closest comparison to GOT. The acting is not the best at times but it does not get you frustrated. A good series worth watching all day
7.0~Action and drama... but a little heavy on the drama part... ericnhall Sign in Permalink Overall, this is a good series. The acting is generally good, and the overall story is good. There are plot holes and inconsistencies that do bother. It also requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief. It is speculative fiction and it is not trying to be accurate science fiction, so you have to allow for that. If you can't get past them using hand-wavium and techno-babble to explain certain things, then don't bother watching this show, or any other show like it. But, if you can allow yourself a little imagination and creative license, then it's a fun show with a lot of drama. The drama is a bit much. It's a bit more like a high-school clique war than anything at times. The "Commander" claims to make decisions with her intelligence rather than her heart, but often the decisions she makes are just plain tactically and strategically stupid. Clarke suffers from making emotional decisions, and then turning around and doing the really hard things at the same time. To an extent, she's overly sure of herself and her abilities, and at other times, she's is so self- recriminating that it's sickening. I'm making this show sound bad, but that's not really my intent. The bad parts are easily overcome by the good parts. There is good intrigue, and good people do really despicable things at times and bad people do the same. We do see some redemption, especially in Bellamy. Bellamy turns into the most interesting character so far, although Clarke is obviously the protagonist. The complaints I've seen about the show being unrealistic are a bit insane. Sure, it's unrealistic. Do you really think that 4000 people could survive on a space station for 97 years? Do you really think that Grounders could really survive the radiation due to natural selection where the Mountain Men melt at the first hint of exposure? No, these things are not realistic based on what we know. But who cares? To nitpick on minutia and your opinion on how selection processes on the station are done for who lives and dies as shown in a few cases is to totally miss the meaning of the rest of the show.
7.0~Homophobia emrebilgili Sign in Permalink at the beginning it was good. i loved it, sometimes so many nonsense scenes but i loved it. for example when they arrive to world, there is no side effect by sunlight or oxygen. they lived in spaceship many years and no sunlight-fastness or not to be be liverish by oxygen but i was wonder no one is gay for thousands people. At the 2nd season Nathan was came out, and 3rd season he had a boy friend. finally there was a LGBT people, Clark was bisexual woman, Lexa is lesbian and Nathan and Bryan are gay. Clark get laid many times with different women but (for show only) gay couple never kiss each other because as we know lesbian sex is straight guy fantasy and the men kissing each other is disgusting. right?
9.0~Good Entertaining Show blink-always-167-970141 Sign in Permalink I understand that there may be some issues, but if you're not a high maintenance director but a person with an open mind, this is a really good show. Sure it's not perfect but look at all the other stuff they put on TV these days (Jersey Shore is one example). I'm just saying, give it a try and you'll probably end up liking it as long as you're not looking for things to hate instead of actually trying to enjoy the show. There's betrayal and bloodshed, and sure, there's romance, but what TV show doesn't have romance in it? I don't think it's juvenile, and maybe it's not for everyone, but I'd like to see this get a fair chance at a few good seasons. I've found it hard to find anything on TV that I like lately, so keep this one up! :)
3.0~Very bad but entertaining eevanz Sign in Permalink After watching the second season, I decided to write a short review. The first episodes were really bad, nothing made sense. And then things started to be interesting...until the end of the second season. End of the second season is really badly written that now I really have no interest in watching the third season. The biggest drawback is that they do not have the technology to examine the status of planet Earth, but they have enough technology to sustain life in space station for many many years. We viewers are not so stupid: how much energy is needed to maintain life in a space station 100 years (including oxygen, heating, lighting etc..). It requires HUGE amounts of energy. Lexxa commander? Blood must have blood? She let 500 warriors to die to get back 50 weak people, betrayed an ally and she retreated on the brink of success (all at the same time). Failure like this is rare. This would not have done even a feeble-minded man. The story is full of holes, and critics are mostly mentioned many, so I will not write the same. This series had potential, but many holes in the script, too predictable as well as poor end of the second season, make "The 100" unworthy to watch the continuing series.
6.0~They can do better. spirit_totem Sign in Permalink The 100 is offering the people a post-apocalyptic sci-fi drama show where 100 minors are sent to the earth to discover if the earth is survivable. Good idea yeah? The first season was bad but I endured and moved on to the second season where things start to get better and interesting. In every episode there is something that will happen that is somewhat related to the story. But the story will get revealed more on season 3 and 4. I know that this TV Show is a drama and that you need to be worried about your favorite side, but after 2 seasons you can easily predict what will happen because they exaggerated about the bad events in every episode. They did that so bad that I don't really care about the characters anymore and I focus on the story. I start with the mindset that something (mostly bad) will happen and they will find a solution and so on. The classic Hollywood scheme. I've had enough of that. They use it to keep the "drama" but they use it so much that it has no more effect on the viewer. The actors are low-budget and the scenes are not really impressing at all. I only watch this TV Show because I need to satisfy my nuclear post- apocalyptic needs. I think this genre needs more attention.
1.0~You Can't Unsee It... graysonemile Sign in Permalink The 100 is based on a YA dystopian, romance novel...Stop right there. If I tell you nothing else in this review, I would've set the appropriate expectations for you and also explained why you might've hated the pilot. From the trailer, 'The 100' was billed, or could've easily been misconstrued, as a big sci-fi in the spirit of 'The Hunger Games' mixed with a side of 'The Lord of the Files'. Well, it's not. And to make the comparison to either of these novels is an embarrassment. If you are a sci-fi fan, or anything resembling one, you probably won't enjoy this unless you are ultimately looking for the central theme that is at the heart of every CW show: A love story and usually a love triangle of some sorts. Think I'm wrong? Just look at the statistics here on IMDb. The lowest ratings are from viewers over 30 and most often male, while Females under 18 really, really love this show. I have nothing against tweens, young girls, young people, romances, or even love triangles/love squares/love pentagons??? o_O. I don't think books, TV shows or movies are inherently bad simply because the protagonist hasn't reach puberty or is just coming into there own. There are many fine examples of YA stories out there. One of the most successful sci-fi stories of all time, 'Ender's Game', was a YA classic before YA fiction became buzzworthy and all the rage. The author of 'Ender's Game', Orson Scott Card, wrote a well- known book on how to write sci-fi and fantasy, but I doubt either Kass Morgan or Jason Rothenberg, the people responsible for 'The 100' book and TV-show ever read it as it appears that they might have missed a few key sections. World building (and common sense logic, and basic science) are necessary components to any believable sci-fi/fantasy story. There are so many illogical missteps that could've been rectified without much fuzz that I'm left to concluded that Morgan and Rothenberg consider me (and their viewing audience) barely sentient beings. A better pilot would've been 45 minutes of training featuring battle- hardened teens, consuming copious hours of 'Man vs. Wild'. Where is Bear Grylls when humanity really needs him??? So what's wrong with 'The 100'? Nothing, if you're willing to power through yet another iteration of The CW's business strategy dressed up in post-apocalyptic combat boots, or if your "thing" is watching unsatisfying snuff films with no pay off since the character you probably want to die the most won't. On a final note...I've read all the reviews from IMDb users and I've seen the pilot. The CW network sent the first 6 episodes of this 13 episode series to "pro reviewers" who overwhelming loved what they saw with only a few exceptions. For the life of me, I can't figure out why. At worst, I'm guessing it's 'the soft bigotry of low expectations', but I my expectations were pretty low. The other possibility is that the reviewers all received compensation in exchange for an early thumbs up. Otherwise, I'll have to give up hope of ever trusting any of these reviewers' opinions on anything. But perhaps I'm being too harsh. I suppose if I were forced to watch 6 episodes anywhere remotely similar to the pilot, I would be comatose enough to co-sign this poor man's rehash of Twilight masquerading as several literary classics.
1.0~This show is insulting my intelligence marius-florin-cojocaru Sign in Permalink The title should do but since I have to actually write 10 lines, here we go : Totally unrealistic. The idea is not bad for a sci-fi but the story is really bad. You can see they invested quite some money in the show but the money can never guarantee the quality. I guess the show was meant for the kids up to 12-14 years old. The only reason I could watch more than one episode was for the beautiful Marie Avgeropoulos. Bad. Bad. Bad. Really bad.
7.0~Entertaining if a bit too gory and has many holes in the plot gortsch Sign in Permalink In any TV series, there are usually 8 to 10 main characters who are in every episode. In this series, toward the end of the 2nd season, they kill off one of the main characters. This didn't have to happen. There were many different ways that it could have been avoided. This was very disappointing to me. I stopped watching the series after that, and now I am occasionally watching an episode. There are too many scenes where nobody wins, and the good guys very seldom seem to win. It's not very uplifting.
10.0~Amazing a-m-w-5401 Sign in Permalink This show so so so good, it makes your feEl all the feels. It is absolutely great.
10.0~More Commander Lexa!! gogogazetakalavrita Sign in Permalink She amazing, Alycia Debnam Carey play's the Commander's role SO freaking amazing. I wish to see more of her in season 3. The Heda's life is one of the show that i really wanna see on screen. I don't care about Clexa (witch is a good ship, i love every ship on the show i don't like ship wars. ) BUT ALYCIA MUST STAY ON THE SHOW. Lexa is amazing without Clarke too, i really love her character. Her character is strong, and the TV needs strong females. So more action for her please. I hope the CW & the AMC will find out what are they going to do when Fear The Walking Dead starts filming for their season 2! Because i hope Lexa is going to survive season 3, and to see her on season 4 (if that S4 happens)
10.0~Dramatic, and Amazing!!! georgiabesty Sign in Permalink The 100 is very addictive, I suggest that you watch it, even though there is blood, and violence. I love the relationships between the characters as well. The 100 has a feeling of the TV Show Lost, and some of the actors in the 100, love lost and they also think that it's a bit like lost which they love and I love. I also love the books of the 100 (which was made first) by Kass Morgan, which I also suggest. The actors in the 100 are very talented.Eliza Taylor was an excellent choice for Clarke and also Paige Turco who plays Abby, Clarke's Mother. Some people have taken sides for relationships (girlfriend and boyfriend), there is Bellarke (Bellamy and Clarke), Clexa (Clarke and Lexa), and Kabby (Kane and Abby). I also suggest you watch the TV Show first.
9.0~Please Lexa come back fsigno Sign in Permalink I can't longer go on without Lexa. I can't understand why they made the best character die.
1.0~The Story Plot is very very Poor!! arlexander-36064 Sign in Permalink I think they Brought up this idea After watching LOST serial which was pretty much better than this ... What will i say about this Badly written plot?? 1. The Characters are badly Written. The Characters of the leaders..does not match. 2. How can you believe that People who survive on the earth for 97 years after the attack does not have any ammunition accept spears and they speak English?? 3.Worst thing is that there are stuffs and Machine guns and everything to start a civilization..?? And they are living like a Tribe ?? 4. Lets stop about those. How do you think think that after 97 yrs in Sapceship 4000 people would survive without bring plants and soil to grow up?? 5.Can you believe that they have everything accept oxygen when there are bioengineers,engineers,biologist ,doctors..who can come up with a solution to extract oxygen..or make oxygen 6. They can make 140 yrs old Pod run in 9 days and cant bring up with a solution?? 7. They are sending Young Productive teenagers to Earth for testing if earth is livable when human race about to extinct?? While old and retired people are there?? 8. There is no judgement in everything?? What is wrong?? People will die for a silly mistake?? There is so much to add up in this list but i m tired... so jus in short its a waste to watch this..t
3.0~Uninspired teen adventure series derbo73 Sign in Permalink To me this is just another series that wants to hop on the young adults train in the wake of Mocking Bird and similar. What you get: low budget sci fi (good CGI space station and animals, awful real scenes and props) a cast of young models, always looking good and with fresh make up 5-6 characters out of 100 youths, the rest is just cannon fodder or props terribly simplistic and boring stereotypes, presented within the very first 15 minutes by bitching at each other to show who is white and who is dark an unbelievable repressive regime aboard the last space station centered around a single dictator like person (council president) a laughable attempt to find out if humanity can go back to Earth that has been poisoned by a nuclear catastrophe only a hundred years ago, so severe that almost all of humanity died...surely the planet is now habitable again... and to find out they send down a bunch of youthful inmates (totally reliable and perfectly fit for the task) without any equipment even food, not even an active way to communicate back to the station. This is only a setup knack nothing more: isolate the teens to start their story... nothing else like the arenas in the Hunger Games. lots of talking, bullying, languishing, envy and blah blah about oh so mysterious backgrounds or pasts half of the main characters are children of major figures aboard the space station, what a coincidence and how very realistic The pilot was a real downer and even if the series gets better later (I doubt that) I am done with it. If you screw up the pilot how can you shine on the series... maybe interesting for young people that don't care about sci fi or any believable setting and only go for the romantic and competitive teen stuff.
10.0~The 100 - Best Post Apocalyptic Show tzarr0 Sign in Permalink I found this show ... to be really good from the very beginning. I don't understand why people are bashing the first episodes or the entire first season. I have no bias for or against CW network or shows, i didn't even knew this was a CW show until later, so i was unbiased and objective from the beginning ... it is the same writing team that wrote season 1 to 4 ... that's why i care for ... not the network who airs or funds it. I thought the show ... started pretty strong, and pretty fast paced ... if i'm not mistaken ... in the pilot ... The 100 Crew it already gets on Earth, with a fair amount of Ark adult drama going around, so no teenage drama. So interacting with an old / new planet for the first time ... it is one of the highlights of the series ... a 'hail mary' moment. I cannot possibly understand what you like about this show ... if you hate so much the pilot, which painted the premise the entire show is based upon. I just think that you are going in circles of your own preconceptions and biases. If you dismiss shows because of the age of the casting or the network which is on ... creating unreasonable level of expectations and when a masterpiece as The 100 come up ... you dismiss it out of hand. I liked the Pilot as much as the entire series. And at the moment the first 2 seasons of The 100 aired ... there wasn't a single sci-fi or post-apocalyptic show ... that either stand up. Later on we got ... Dark Matter and The Expanse, which are fairly decent stock. Now ... considering you are a ... fair reviewer and a fan of this genere (you could be always a TWD's fan or dropout ... which is not about survival it's just an elimination game ... in a fantasy universe with black humour) ... The 100 is very classy sci-fi ... it is about survival and adaptation to a new planetary and situational set-up ... not keeping strong on the illusion that apocalypse ... never happened ... and trying to recreate pieces of former life ... just to have the writers bringing them down, in the most violent ways possible (that's TWD btw). The 100 is story-driven ... the deaths are realistic, believable, they are not happening artificially even mathematically ... on quota / season ... one season can die more characters than other, or more important characters ... or no one can die ... it is not set in stone ... this make the show unpredictable ... and the story flowing naturally. So you won't have a character waking up one episode and saying 'today i will make something really stupid, that will either kill me or make the writers look really bad for not killing me'. You won't have either 'everyone survive no matter what' or 'everyone must die' type of concept with this show ... The 100 found a proper balance, the death are situational, making them inspirational at the same time ... and moving the story forward, not in circles. What The 100 have and very few shows on the market have ... is artistic value, right? First ... the story is conceptualized for at least 5 season ... they don't just make up stuff as they go. And they don't augment the story as they go along ... for commercial purposes ... the show remained true to its artistic concept and integrity ... staying out of fans' drama ... for losing characters, down-voting ... bashing the show at time. I like that ... it is so rare! In parallel we have two shows TWD and GOT ... that have ZERO story, HUGE budgets and are COMMERCIAL at heart ... they fancy themselves ... in promoting extreme visual violence, realism (despite having no realistic or scientific facts to based on). As for the fact that ... the main casting is mostly teenagers ... they stopped being teenagers since they landed on the ground ... that was the whole point (i guess that was missed ... somehow?). Their childhood and teenagery remained on the Ark ... on the Ground they were forced to make adult and very hard decision ... in order to survive the new environment. Replace that with more adult characters ... and you won't get the same effect. Having a bunch of adults making the same decision that The 100 did'n in the first 4 seasons ... would not be either so interesting or dramatic. Having them sent on Earth in the first place ... is science-based ... being born in space ... on several generation ... they body was better suited to survive the irradiated earth ... they had better chances ... than an previous generation ... and they were delinquents ... too young to be SPACED. The Adults were required to run the ark ... they couldn't had send adults one way trip to the ground ... on a recon mission, a probe! I found the science facts of the show to be fairly well written, but they cannot only focus on those ... they had to develop the story and characters at the same time. That's the only way to keep people addicted ... if you focus only on the science facts or the relationships ... you will only end up with a niche audience in toe.
2.0~8/10 if you remove all the characters and story points haris_manda Sign in Permalink I watched 'The 100' for reasons I long have forgotten, but I remember visiting its IMDb page when 3-4 episodes were out. It had a decent enough of a rating so I figured I'd give it a shot. Nope. Since I can't possibly fathom thinking about this show any more, I won't write a full-fledged review, but just point out things that make no sense. 1. Upon descending, teenagers try to establish a chain of command, which is quite normal for any settling group/society since that's how civilizations function. The problem here is that certain people are warranted certain "power" without any reason. A group of five, mid-point through the season, is waging a vote against 80+ people, which they lose, but they still get to carry out their judgment. This makes the whole "democracy" aspect bull, and, more to the point, reflects writer's dumb understanding of the teenagers. 2. Instead of sending 100 completely average people, who had already contributed their fair share to the human preservation, "the smart people" of the future send 100 perfectly healthy, young adults to scout out potentially lethal planet with a small ounce of hope that life is sustainable. No. 3. PG-13 rating; you can't have 100 angsty, rebellious teenagers left alone without any adult supervision and expect them to behave under the guidelines of 'PG-13 rating'. Nope. 4. Think of a stereotypical character. You did? This show has it. And they go nowhere. 5. The very idea that a 100 juveniles are capable of creating self- sustaining and self-preserving society is not only insane and impossible, but even the show itself has to come up with massive plot devices to make it work. '80 people don't rebel because 3 of the bad guys have weapons'. '80 rebellious teenagers listen to 5 other rebellious teenagers'. Come on... at least try. 6. Given that the humans were capable of sustaining life IN SPACE, on a SPACE STATION, for a healthy time, it's virtually impossible that they've failed to create a scouting drone of sorts that would be capable of determining whether life on Earth is possible. 7. They used 'Radioactive'. 8. It got beyond season 1. 9. Dialogue, aside from the fact that it's full of PG-13 cuss words, is something any sane human, with even an ounce of critical- thinking, will laugh at the moment the characters start speaking. 10. It's like Lost, except there are no interesting characters or dialogue, intrigue is non-existent, and it's full of teenager troops like 'Instead of thinking how to survive, let's f*** s*** up and try having sex and making out' or 'You can't possibly understand how I feel even though both of us were thrust into the exact same situation under the same circumstances with no prior knowledge of said situation'. 11. Please let's not go beyond season 2. Please.
5.0~It's... fine. kcrawley-89138 Sign in Permalink First off, I have to say, never believe anyone that gives a show a 10 out of 10. Especially when their review doesn't match the rating. If the show is not actually perfect (and no show is), then a 10 is NOT the appropriate score. Also, a score of 1 or 2 is clearly from a hater that has probably seen one episode. This is a very watchable show. Yes, it follows the same CW formula of having teenagers ruling the world. Yes, it has a strong female lead and there are very few capable male characters. Yes, there are obligatory same sex relationships (mostly actually). Yes, minority actors/characters take a back seat and are basically token supporting characters. If you go into this show knowing these things, you can quickly move past it and enjoy the mostly compelling story arcs. The action is pretty good and the storyline keeps getting better up to a certain point even though the show is unrecognizable from the pilot episode. I care about many of the main characters. I just fear it will end up like Lost in that the show runners don't really know what the endgame is and they are writing themselves into a corner. I used to catch this show live but now I'm a season behind because it becomes less interesting with every season. I would like to see the introduction of more capable and prominent male leads. The society is very much matriarchal, and it is hammered in season after season. I wish it would stop trying to be so diverse because it ends up following the same diversity checklist and becomes just like every other show doing the same things. The show has so much potential, I just think they need new direction going forward. Get the show back on track by returning to it's roots.
6.0~Not the best... Not the worst. lourienolan Sign in Permalink First of all... I want to say I HAVE watched the entire first season of this show and am going to start the 2nd season tonight. As to the negative reviews... They are factually accurate. There are enough plot holes to keep an analytical such as myself rolling her eyes for years to come. My top 10 are below. 1. Teen criminals chosen for this mission... Bad idea in any situation. 2. The air situation on the ARC leaves one with the impression that "working fans = oxygen" 3. Everyone is having sex... no one is getting pregnant. 4. Cool hi-tech wrist bands have no ability to detect radiation and no voice or text communication capabilities. 5. People already on Earth have never discovered areas that these kids found in just a few short walks from their landing site. (Bunkers, Guns, Blankets, etc.) 6. Loss of most human life, One 2-headed deer, and a large slug or eel appear to be the only negative environmental effects of a full scale global nuclear holocaust. Air is clean, fish and other animals are perfectly safe to eat, and water is as fresh as Perrier. (Perhaps nuclear holocaust is what we need) 7. A girl who has spent her whole life either under the floorboards of her small space-condo... or in a small prison cell... has few if any mental or emotional consequences and upon her first venture into a space that is over 10 feet wide... is ready to become the daredevil explorer and take on the world. 8. Characters exist for no reason other than to kill off other characters. They are introduced. They kill someone or destroy something... they die. It's magic. 9. There are times that it appears they have killed someone off... ( the good Dr.) then change their minds and bring characters back with no plausible explanation as to how the person survived the incident.... just "You're here! We thought you were on the ship!" Etc. 10. In a time when most of humanity on earth has reverted back to the stone ages... a woman is in charge of a civilization of burly, warrior men and a civilization of mostly male criminal teenagers also has a woman in charge.... because cave men and criminal men are all "equal rights" and feminism and stuff. All of that being said... I ENJOY the show. It's better than most of the other garbage on TV right now. It's better than Terra Nova was (doesn't take much... I know) and once you turn off your 'reality' filter and accept that it's just not going to be a realistic or plausible portrayal of a post-apocalyptic society... then settle in to be entertained... You will find it worth watching.
6.0~High school teen drama dressed up as post-apocalyptic sci-fi igor-antunov Sign in Permalink For an adult that enjoys sci-fi, this is impossible to recommend. It is clearly aimed at young teens, in terms of script and narrative complexity. It never seems to rise above that. Characters are well dressed in expensive clothes with extensive makeup and grooming, preposterous given the premise-a bunch of juvenile delinquents from some space station that is running out of resources stranded in wilderness on earth. The reckless, counter-intuitive behaviour of the characters given their perilous/urgent situation is comical and further emphasises the target audience. For a 2014 show it also has some questionable special effects, below what one would expect of even a budget production. This further highlights that this is a low-brow teen drama dressed up to be something else.
7.0~May be better than it looks costagomez Sign in Permalink Actual science is mostly ignored, everybody looks extremely good and lots of stupid drama is going on to top it off.. so I can understand anyone who wants to stay clear. But it's not completely screwed up. For example they actually cut some holes into most clothes to give them a used look. It helps a bit, but of course the hair styling department couldn't be persuaded to lay off a little.. So - it has been done better, but also far worse, especially lately. Story. Not much to say yet, but I am interested enough to watch the next episode. Characters. Most people are acting pretty stupid. But that's to be expected from a bunch of teenagers dumped on a strange planet and a bunch of adults holed up in a **SPOILER** failing space station. And they actually kill two of the teenagers for being stupid. I would give in an 8 if they had killed the stupid girl too, but I am afraid she is part of the main cast and has a free pass on being stupid. The show doesn't appear to have a super huge budget and and I think they used it quiet well. It may not be perfect, but it beats most current pseudo science fiction shows. So watch it, fight through the stupid parts and hope they keep the good stuff up.
9.0~you don't point your gun to you're friend. menanti Sign in Permalink I really hate to see clarke action in season 5. so unreasonable and blind. they are you're friend that you have missing and saved all the time. that's not how a human works. this season are so messy between friend and foes,
3.0~PC Overload wigzynz-91849 Sign in Permalink This would be so much better if they weren't trying so hard to prove how tough woman are. It feels so forced that it feels like is is the only purpose for the show. Lighten up already. There is nothing to prove. Other than that it is an entertaining watch that can only get better (I hope).
8.0~Surprisingly Entertaining and Addictive with Room to Expand elliott78212 Sign in Permalink My partner and I often disagree but this show we wait for every week and to dispel the "this is a tweeners show" we are in our 50's. The cast has good chemistry, the pacing is good yes their are plot holes and scripts could be tighter but it remains compelling. A mix of themes come to mind from past classics Lord of the Flies, Earth 2, political intrigue as in BSG. This is what gives the show so much potential Survivors of an apocalyptic event on earth, a colony of young adults setdown on that earth who grew up on a space station, meanwhile the shall we say adult mature leaders dealing with other life or death choices on the station, truly every choice is about survival and who we become to do so. The potential for a great show is here let's see where it goes.
7.0~Why, "The 100" doesn't necessarily suck minnaar-k Sign in Permalink Right off the bat we have to realize that, yes, the 100 is a bit of a teen drama because the entire hundred does consist of 100 juvenile delinquents. This doesn't have to be a negative thing, as all you have to do is ask yourself whether you, as the audience, can relate to a teenage mind or not. If not, it's like reviewing a crime drama when you hate crime dramas. All the adults aren't absent from the show however, they are on the spaceship and, I think, it will be interesting to watch as the adult story unfolds on the spaceship along side the teen story on earth. As a necessity of the dire situation which caused humanity to be confined to a single spaceship the remaining humans have enacted some pretty inhumane and strict laws. These laws, while understandable given the circumstances, are what forms the basis of the discontent and rebellious nature of the bulk of the 100. The teens do split into various groups upon landing on earth and, yes, they don't necessarily make only the most calculated and intelligent of choices but the reasoning behind what they do isn't just teen hormones. Many of them are delinquents and are, in effect, staging a rebellion against the remaining human population back on the ship. The presence of mysterious threats on earth, power struggles back on the spaceship and the relations between various characters all following different motivations should make for a show deserving of, at least, one hour of your hectic life per week.
9.0~Oh To Be An Overly Attractive Delinquent. elizabeth_rose324 Sign in Permalink Okay, so I gave this show a 6 out of 10 simply to be kind. It is the future. 97 years into the future, to be specific. A large group of humans have managed to survive on a spaceship called the Ark. However, it is dying. So to fix this issue, the leader of the humans, the Chancellor, decides to send down 100 underage delinquents to a radiation ravaged wasteland. Oops. Did I say wasteland? No, sorry. More like a tropical paradise. Or a beautiful woodland area that seems to resemble Canada. Either way, it is not how I expected land that has been damaged by radiation to look. Now to focus on the horror that takes place on the ground. My biggest issue with show like this is that every single person who is a main character is too young, unnaturally gorgeous, and terrible at acting. Can we get an average looking person who is stupendous at being on camera? And don't even get me started on the characters. You begin the episodes with the cliché bossy girl who thinks she knows everything. Then the jerk who tries to take over, followed by the town slut who loves to take her pants off. Oh, and don't forget the love triangles! First it's two guys and a girl. However, now it has evolved into two girls fighting over one guy. Come on! Can't anyone focus on something that doesn't include sex? And since when did an adult decide that it was a smart decision to send down a bunch of children and think they weren't either going to kill one another or sleep with one another? Good gosh, this show is pretty much Lord of the Flies, just less conch shells. Oh, and the people that apparently already inhabit the "radiation filled land" look completely normal. No weird deformities or any strange appearance. They just dress weird. The writers should take a page from "The Hills Have Eyes". Not the greatest movie, but at least they knew how to make people look like they had been affected by radiation poisoning. Overall, this show isn't heart stopping. I don't prep myself every week waiting for it. If there was a little bit more meat to it, and perhaps less unnecessary sex scenes, I would be excited. But hey, the big picture idea behind the show is really interesting. Maybe we should send down functional, non-horny adults that don't want to kill each other, next time though.
4.0~character development is very poor and don't really a science fiction series muzahidashraf Sign in Permalink They build a arc that rotate a planet and they don't have enough technology to see earth is habitable or not. also they send some kid without any survival training when only 800 can can land out of 2200.i saw two season and i end up by hating every single character.
10.0~The 100 is new and fun! Dean_Sab72 Sign in Permalink I watched the pilot and Loved it! I was hooked after 5 minutes! The story line is awesome. The acting is better than average. Any actors who were in LOST instantly make it worth at least a look. The storyline is loaded with potential! The end of the pilot goes exactly in the direction anyone would want it to. So what more do you need? PLEASE, continue making this show! To those who need some kind of explanation for every little detail... RELAX it's a TV show not the real world! Get over your little minds that aren't even finish growing yet, sit back and enjoy or shut it off and shut up so those who actually like it can enjoy it! From someone who loved Lost, The X Files, The 4400, Kyle XY and yes I will admit it The walking Dead.
10.0~Underrated saitanooj-87469 Sign in Permalink Best screen play this series gets better season by season . Especially season 2 was epic . Definitely worth watching I binged whole series in 5 days .
10.0~The best TV Series out there. savvth Sign in Permalink I wont wright much here to not waste your time and go see the series.. its plot goes to another level anyone has seen from season 2 + personally i have seen 15 + tv series (completed) and i had never seen such a great show up until this one.bear with season 1 it might seem a bit boring when you see teenagers having to survive thats what i said at least my self,when i first saw the trailer/the first episodes.but trust me it gets better.good luck farming these episodes
10.0~It gets better! I promise! fallingveils Sign in Permalink The first couple of episodes left me a little unsure, but I'm glad I got hooked and continued watching the series. The first 2 episodes had some really cheesy lines and whatnot, but the show improved significantly. There is a lot of great character development and the characters learn to mature quickly. Season 2 is definitely even better than season 1. The show seams to get darker and darker as it goes along. This peaks my interest since I'm usually a fan of dark TV shows. The writers always surprise me. Sometimes you think something won't be brought up again and then the writers find interesting ways of incorporating it. Please don't judge the show based off the beginning of season 1. It gets really good, I promise! Even some of the characters I thought I wouldn't like turned out to be some of my favorite characters. Some people have been comparing it to typical teen drama type of shows. I understand that if you only watched the beginning of the first season but if the rest of the show was like that I can promise I wouldn't be watching it, because I don't like those type of shows. I actually wasn't sure about watching it at first since I am not usually a sci-fi fan, but my friend convinced me to watch it with her. I'm glad she did! I really love this show. I highly recommend it!
7.0~overview btrjonaslovergal Sign in Permalink I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT I REALLY ENJOY THIS SHOW . the reason i am giving the series a 7 out of 10 is for the following reasons . i am a fan of this show , season 1 and 2 where really captivating and made me want to watch every week . i sadly can not say the same about season 3. After Season 2, I felt they waited to long to air season 3 , i had semi forgotten about the storyline, and now that it has started airing again i feel the story line is lagging a bit compared to its previous seasons.I am finding it hard to continue watching this season. don't get me wrong i love the show but i think the writing needs some spice to it , the actors are great and super talented .
9.0~Everybody is Overreacting! Its not too bad! Please Read!! acohen203 Sign in Permalink For the fourth season: Guys, it is not fair to the show to insult it just for being rated badly. Just because it says TV-14, doesn't make the writing, acting, or directing better or worse. Now on to the parts that matter. The writing has faltered a bit. I do agree that Bellany needs to have some purpose to his actions, but there is a purpose. He isn't given any direction. Pike came to him in a moment of weakness and Pike took advantage of him. Though it isn't really shown that to be his purpose I must admit. The acting is on point as per usual and the directing is fine. So I don't understand why everyone is overreacting about this whole season. I think it maybe one of the best seasons yet. The TV-14 rating might want to go up, but the edginess of the show is what makes it great!
8.0~Quite Entertaining jbenante-388-963917 Sign in Permalink To all the "morons" calling other people who might like this show "morons," let me remind you of something. It's a SHOW. It's science fiction. Suspension of disbelief is a must, and I don't care how "classy" or "clunky" a particular sci-fi movie or series is. Probably 80% of movies ever made have plot holes in them. So? Give it a break already. I liked the premise. I found the first couple of episodes interesting enough that I wanted to keep watching. I felt, like some others who have commented, that the vibe was a bit "teeny-bopper," but I didn't let that become a deal-breaker. As I got to the 4th episode and beyond, I became more impressed. Political themes, instances of different people trying to do good in different ways but managing to screw things up nonetheless - you know, kind of like the real world. And while some plot points were predictable, many were not. I won't go so far as to say the story line is profound (and if I did, to some of the dweebs who post here, that would simply mean that it is "pretentious"), but it is thought-provoking, and in parts, quite moving. Not all of the actors fit exactly. Clarke tends to come off as a high school "pretty girl," and it is kind of hard to imagine her being taken seriously as Bellamy's co-leader. But she is passable overall; this just seems like the wrong vehicle for the actress. I am able to suspend disbelief and allow myself to enjoy something that has moments of intrigue and keeps me guessing, as this series has done. I don't feel the need to over-analyze the "science" and nitpick plot holes. It is obvious that at least some of the negative commentators here already had negative feelings before they even tried watching - because it's a "CW show" and because it features "teenagers" that they don't feel act realistically enough. Well, know what? Real teenagers often act in boring and miserable ways. Those who want to see that behavior can go back to high school - or just make sure never to leave high school.
10.0~Perfect for the Hunger Games fans or any fan of Dystopia regancool Sign in Permalink You don't see successful Sci-Fi TV shows like this everyday. I highly advise you to give it a chance, even if Season 3 is kind of a drag. Nothing stopped me from giving up on this show. It's being renewed for more seasons for a reason. So if you need a new show to binge, or some action (even romance), and science in your life, click play.
1.0~This is very awful labeatkryeziu Sign in Permalink Im watching this show its kinda interesting and i want to know what happens . So far so good . The thing is that even if you turn your blind eye to people sending all their youth (16-18) year old to die in earth that is just the start What i cant understand is why at every episode the kids are fighting for their life but everyone survives always A girl who lived 16 years in one room like in the movie ( room 2015 ) kills trained fighters in the forrest like she is rambo , i mean really who wrote the script Its like cartoons they get hurt with a knife nearly dying after half a day they are ready to kill trained soldiers again like nothing happened The last thing is like imagine Clarke with 2 weeks at earth already killed hundreds of grounders , what would happen if she was trained for 2 or 3 years ... She probably could take on isis on her own without breaking a sweat
7.0~A decent series if you can just stick through the teen drama of first few episodes user-196-766417 Sign in Permalink I was initially very hesitant in watching this show. I read the books by Kass Morgan and absolutely hated them - they were just another young adult romance series thinly disguised as dystopian science fiction. Like we need more of those. So it was with low expectations that I started the show. The pros: "The 100"'s biggest strength is in its characters. The main characters are beautifully written, complex and diverse. Their character development arcs are almost flawless. The cast is fairly good, each of them suiting their characters amazingly. The storyline starts off weakly, but by season 2 is captivating and less episodic in structure. There's tension and suspense and even a bit of horror, with moral and ethical quandaries along the way. The action is decent - the show's not overloaded with it, and it's equal parts gory and intense. The cons: The first few episodes were extremely disappointing. I swear the writers pulled out every cliché in the book - girls fighting over a guy, teenagers forming cliques, love triangles, the whole dumb party animal stereotype. The intelligent ones who want to find food and shelter are ignored and looked down on. There's already blind prejudice and murder. Riveting entertainment, right? Don't worry, it gets better. I'm sorry to say that you're going to have to suffer from inaccurate science the whole way through. To all the people going, "You have to suspend your disbelief! Of course there's going to mistakes! It's just fiction!" Yeah, well, there's only so far I can suspend my disbelief. Clearly, these writers have never set foot in a high school science classroom. There's things like the sound of explosions in space, someone's blood being circulated through someone else's body, and people wearing gas masks to protect from radiation. 97 years is way too short a time period to develop an entirely new culture and language. I'm pretty sure that humanity's first impulse, upon discovering their ravaged planet, would NOT to be to abandon technology and civilisation and create an entirely new society based on hand-to-hand combat and tribal culture. Look, if you're expecting a deep insight into the nature of humanity like "Lord of the Flies" or an exploration into the advancements of science like "Alien" or "2001: A Space Odyssey", then this series is not for you. But if you want to watch a series that's addictive and entertaining, and you can survive some teen drama and a load of scientific inaccuracy, just sit tight.
3.0~"Lord of the Flies" and "House of Cards" with scifi setting rob-796-129105 Sign in Permalink Basically a bunch of rebellious 17 year olds forming cliques and acting out stranded on a future post-apocalyptic Earth while the adults in orbit are making power plays against each other. Not really impressed.
10.0~Amazing parastoosalah Sign in Permalink I am disappointed of human beings again but dont wanna be like the good characters who are disappointed :)))
8.0~Stick with the show.... gamermaw20 Sign in Permalink I will admit the show starts off slow......veeeeerry slow but after about 7 episodes it gets really dark really fast....right now it is so intense....they are not afraid to kill important characters and they are not afraid to show some blood. It's season 2.....I have seen someone stabbed with a harpoon, knife to the face, jump off a cliff to kill themselves, burn from radiation poisoning, shot dead, drugged, I could go on and on....the special effects are hit or miss....mostly hits but when it misses it misses bad....if you go into this show expecting low quality crap you will see low quality crap but with an open mind you will appreciate it. Yes there are tons of plot holes.....yes it does take too long to get going but once it does...you will be hooked. The of season one is jaw dropping.....so far season 2 hasn't disappointed....the episode that ended today involved one of the main characters massacring almost half a village...even killing a kid in the village even though they weren't the perpetrators of the crime he accused them off so this main character is about to be shunned. And yes it does show the bullets going through the bodies.....so to those people writing it off as a teen drama....it isn't. Yes the first few episodes are just the kids that were in prison rebelling and hooking up and partying and yelling at each other very stupid stuff but by the end of season one....when you see the whole camp incinerated. Then you will be hooked. My advice stick with it until the character called "Lincoln" shows up. That's when it gets dark...those kids, squabbling about nothing, start torturing people. If the production values where better, it would get. 9/10 but since it suffers from that and a few huge plot holes like how the space station leader does not die mind boggles me. That is why the show gets a 8/10.....not a 1 because it seems childish in the beginning...but an 8/10 Example of how gruesome it gets...this is actually a decent fight scene...not the best one but up there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QExI527yrUY Again this is not a petty teen drama like how early reviewers said.
10.0~Season 3 Ali-hamza-re Sign in Permalink I am writing this review because don't know why people has given season 3 episode so much low rating after their favorite LGBT what so ever character die.

If you are into Teenage sci Fiction show then Yes this show is made for just watch it
10.0~My Favorite Show sumansaha-41731 Sign in Permalink Really enjoy the way the story proceeds. Feel very realistic as well as adventurous. The introduction of Space travel has added some more spice in the latest session.
9.0~Go For it if ur a Sci-fi Lover and for thrill😍 dipakthosar-77964 Sign in Permalink The100 Just completed watching All 5seasons it's the best thing that keeps the audience on the edge of the seat. Nustaa thrill 😎 bang On John Murfy is love Legend The BobMorley
10.0~I created an account just to say how much I love this show! aradiahall Sign in Permalink I absolutely love this show! I can't get enough of it. Everyone is so good at portraying their role I feel like I'm in the show. Everything happens at the exact right time and makes me feel so hard for them. I cried at the last episode. So emotional. I'd give more stars if I could. I haven't seen a show quite like this in a long long time. High praises.
1.0~1 gem in the sewer roytech85 Sign in Permalink Every single episode i am forced to swallow so many flaws in the story, i mean i'm not expecting reality, but don't push it for the love of god! Here you have a small example: - Advanced enough to have an "arch" but not a simple drone for data collection on earth?!? - I know they are college kids, but they lack the base intelligence for survival and cooperation when all is upon them?!? - First episode, the 2 floating guy's in the shuttle, let's call that raising stupidity to the next level. - Last episode after the wrist bands fried, one couple gives a kiss and the other makes sex, lets call that post traumatic hormone syndrome. I only see one thing worth the value in this series and it's called Marie Avgeropoulos. Nuff said.
8.0~Averaging 7/10 despite bad reviews? Hmmm... jonathancolley-885-704860 Sign in Permalink OK, so I'm not going to waffle on about how bad the script is and how many plot holes there are to this show as I think from a run through of a number of reviews on this site... That bit is covered! It's not great but what I am starting to see coming through is a fairly sincere interlacing storyline between what is happening on the Ark (the big space station with the last of the humans on it) and those dumped back on Earth. Bottom line is that it's entertaining! And it is getting better too, there are even moments which remind me of Battlestar Galactica (the remade series, not the original) as resources on the Ark start to dwindle and decisions have to be made. I'm enjoying it, and I think that anyone else who likes to watch throw away TV and just be entertained will enjoy it too! If I have any concerns about this show it's that it's a little bit too "high school" to start with and I don't see how this is going to last beyond a single series as the current plot (barring any miracles) pretty much means anyone left in space after a few months is dead? I'm just going to enjoy this for as long as it lasts and ignore the haters of which there appear to be many...
7.0~At the end of Episode 4, you are left asking why can't The 100 behave better? sally-dickson Sign in Permalink Series Pilot and Episode 1 Earth Skills The Series Pilot for The 100 has perhaps the most brilliant exhilarating five minute opening section I have seen for a long time. The writers have to be given credit for establishing the premise, setting our sympathies firmly with the heroine Clarke player by Eliza Taylor , building a love-hate relationship with her mother Abby player by Paige Turco, then throwing Clarke into jeopardy, namely forcing her into a pod and throwing her off a space shuttle down on a radio-active planet below. Not just jeopardy, but double jeopardy since it is the mother Abby who is sending the pod in desperate hope against hope survival bid, all the time knowing she might sending her only child to her death. So a great set-up with mother and daughter established and imperiled With this pace of action and sheer quality of the writing I was hooked. The story starts strong and then keeps you interested with two plot lines telling the story of mother and daughter. The mother on the spaceship called the Ark where the last human survivors of the apocalypse live and the daughter trying to find a new home on the surface of the planet. I liked the politics on the space station, more than the posturing of young people vying for position on the surface. By episode 1, the series is starting to show its true YA adult credentials as the story takes time to establish some couples amongst the youngsters and also some potential broken hearts to come. The show also has echoes of Star Trek when the two heroes 'Princess' Clarke, 'Tarzan' Finn (played by Thomas McDonell) and anti-hero 'Bad Girl' Olivia played by Marie Avgeropoulos are accompanied into the woods by 'Sidekick' Jasper (player by Devon Bostick.) Because Jasper is so obviously the sidekick, you know he is dispensable to the plot. When he gets to kiss the rather gorgeously bad Olivia, you start counting down Jasper's life expectancy in seconds. I won't spoil the story, because it is fast and it will still surprise you. And Jasper was so compelling played by Devon Bostick, that I will be sticking around to see what happens next. Another reference to Star Trek is the technical food and communications specialist Monty (played by Christopher Larkin , this likable character has more than a passing resemblance to Mr Sulu the Star Trek navigator and captain. Still these references to other Science Fiction series, including in the last moments of Episode 1, a visual references to both Mad Max and Planet of the Apes, all this reassures the viewer, and with this series we are clearly in capable hands. One to watch I think, at least for now. Episode 3 Earth Kills and 4 Murphys Law Earth Kills is a tense episode where Jasper who inexplicably has been healed by the Grounders (people who still live on the planet) but is dying slowly and in agony. With more than a passing reference to The Beach (2000), the newly arrived youngsters decide they cannot bear to listen to Jasper die, and a huge wrangle starts as to whether to kill him quickly or see him saved. This is very tedious, but leads to lots of screaming and bickering, but you do start to wonder about the moral compass of the writers and characters. I won't say much more except we get two hints the Grounders are more sophisticated than you might think, they have medicine and an advance warning systems. Also as in Lost (2004), the actors now start to find things underground, in this episode a car, which provides a handy hiding place. At this point I was starting to groan, at one the rather infantile arguments the characters were having, and the easy get-out-of -jail free tickets the writers were giving themselves to sort out difficult plot lines. Episode 3 ends with an unexpected murder and Episode 4, starts with heroine Clarke kneeling at a freshly dug grave. meanwhile the youngsters convinced the grounders are to blame are building incredible walls, for which you have to give them much credit. We have still to see the grounders, and they are much missed. The Episode then degenerates into silliness when the real murderER is found, and the youngsters seem to tip between crowd hangings or sentimental protectiveness of the cutesy killer. (Again the writers give themselves an easy get-out instead of sorting out this problem - but I'll let you watch and see.) At this stage, I am waiting to see what the Grounders look like, but these two episodes are a bit disappointing. I guess I would just like to think that 100 young people given a second chance would behave better than this. But that's me being hopeful.
10.0~Great show, give it a chance! drchiverz Sign in Permalink This is a amazing TV show, sure it started out a bit bad but gradually it just gets better and better. I don't see why there are so many bad shows, it's obviously not too bad because it kept it's viewers and a season 2 is on the way in October, which means obviously people must like it, and part of the reason they cancelled the tomorrow people was because this was getting a much better response. The tomorrow people basically got worse by the episode, but this just got better. The reason people don't like it because to start with it's all about kids having fun, and that's what I'm seeing in most reviews "It's bad because all the kids are doing is having sex with each other!" which makes it clear to me that you haven't watched more then the first episode. Sure it starts off with them having fun, but slowly they start having to make the decisions, and that's when the fun ends they start thinking about things and making decisions, that are needed to be made. Sure a few of the kids are backstabbing and sadistic, but what do you expect they are a bunch of convicts, and some of them were in for murder.
1.0~Awful... just awful justinyoder1312 Sign in Permalink The reason I can't stand this show is Clarke the main "protaginist". she was never elected as leader but some how she supersedes all elected officials. and she constantly gets her own killed in the name of Skyclan surviving... and ALL the people that died because of Clarke, no one ever questions her authority or removes her from this self proclaimed power she appointed herself. I had high hopes built up from the first 2 seasons. then it nose dives into this absolute mess of Clarke's poor me attitude, while making all the other main characters who are good characters, pay the price. I Hate Clarke....
7.0~good. roelhessels Sign in Permalink Tell me, how does a baby get born, without umb... cord and smiling, looking like it's a couple of months old? it may be the future but you can't change biology like THAT. anyway, fun series.
5.0~Give the show a break marcuswilliams100 Sign in Permalink Hey, lets give this new show a break. OK, a bunch of teens trying to survive. Lord of the Flies and Roswell come to my mind. There is much room for improvement here. But I feel given time it can develop in a show the can run for about three seasons. The writing has to get better. However, the youthfulness of this show should be maintained. Because it appeals to a certain generation.The actors are OK. Their young and there new. They do play their parts. Now, we can only speculate what can happen if we really had to live on a spaceship for an extended period of time. Also, someone has to go down to the new planet to find out if we can survive. So who do you send? The youngest seem to always go to war. So. Why not to colonize a new world. Earth has become a new world in this series. I say keep trying.
7.0~5 seasons in 11.5 days natcalgary Sign in Permalink That's right. i watched 5 seasons inn 11 and one half days. the show wasnt amazing but it was good enough to keep me watching the next episode. 7.1
10.0~Quelle Surprise mastik8 Sign in Permalink My first review - Bored one afternoon, defaulted to Netflix then addicted to The 100. Two seasons in three days - a holiday weekend. I agree what everyone says about the slow start but stick with it, the pay off is worth it. I am absolutely not the demographic of this show but ended up hooked. They've also given themselves a hugely rich vein of stories to explore. A small connected earth has become an enormous playground for the writers to develop. Nothing more compelling than a dystopian future. Once they start moving around Earth the sky is the limit on what they can encounter. I hope the writers are excited at this great prospect they have to play in and develop. I like all the story lines. Will be curious to see how they develop them. Oddly I had NEVER heard of the show until stumbling upon them on Netflix. We need more press on the actors and the show to create more buzz. Certainly more advertising. Why go to all the trouble of creating it but not promoting it? Could we arrange a sex scandal or some sort of incident that gets a few of them in the news? lol.
5.0~The best laid plans of mice and sky people... rkt-57338 Sign in Permalink I've binge watched up until Season 3, Episode 15, but it's become (much) less about "will this plan work?" and more about "how will this plan fail?" Devise plan, fail, rinse, repeat. If the plot of Season 3 carries over to Season 4, I'm hitting the kill switch.
8.0~Worse as it goes on jeromeslegacy Sign in Permalink I love this show but as it goes on and on it gets worst and worst.
2.0~Twillight meets Battlestar Galactica but in a bad way vdemetli Sign in Permalink Where to begin: the characters are despicable, almost all of them - the story is like Swiss cheese, full of holes - the amount of cruelty in some scenes is way off for a teen show - and almost every scene has those "nice" lens flares that we see in the new Star Trek movies, completely unnecessary - kinda reminds me of new PC/PS4/XBOX games that have no soul,plot but look very very nice! - it lacks that subtle moral line that most sci-fi shows have, and it lacks humor which is a problem with many shows today The few positive things I can say are the visual effects which are great for a TV show and the acting is not bad considering the lacking plot and script All in all the CW has some better shows that are more worth of your time
8.0~justifcation/apologiests? Rob-O-Cop Sign in Permalink **** updated I'm only through 1 and a half seasons of this but it all seems to be one long justification for violence, where everyone else is fuel for the meat grinder and we're set up to root for the home team and overlook their brutality because redemption is reserved for our side only, gun loving, capital punishment excusing, hard response to everything. All about climates of fear, and impulsive responses, and how that is the rational irrational response. I'm hoping this a long game fable for the crimes of our fathers and ourselves but it hasn't made anything but token gestures to moralising on the atrocities committed in the name of saving 'our team'. There are many parallels to how the west has played out their last 600 years of conquest and colonisation, and team ark are the invaders here, the colonisers armed up with advanced weaponry and a kill them all mindset randomly flipping to compassion if it's not massacre during 'war', cos that's ok to get a full head of steam and kill kill kill. The problem is there are no good guys left on team Ark, if there ever was, but we're supposed to see them as just good people trying to find their way and doing what the have to to survive, but they've always come from a place of fear and anger, violence and death, and they just bring that down into the mix with them. People say this series is really good, but I've yet to see the insight into humanity, just excuses for violence. They made me do it. I hope it changes and the writers have a long game planned to show us all the error in being the biggest bull on the planet. Update So I'm through to the end of series 5 now and the it appears there was some semblance of a long game plan. They did indeed engage with the dark themes of world police and who is the good guy any more. There was a lot of violence as entertainment on the way (which is possibly part of the problem that got us here in the first place), but full marks for keeping the story twisting and turning in unexpected ways. I wouldn't want any of the characters in it as my friends or family, but luckily they're only on the screen,...... The show is addictive, the characters mostly well rendered, some standout performance moments for quite a few of the central actors. You can see everyone working hard to render a solid series.
1.0~Not just bad but gets worse. assweasel-05623 Sign in Permalink The worst part of this show is the filming. It is always dark. even During the day. At night you may as well be listening to a radio because there is nothing to see. Same thing with every fight scene. Black screen with a few flashes of an angry face or weapon. The storyline does not even have a simple premise. Every character is weak and annoying and vacillates between being an angel and then being the devil incarnate. All the while berating another character for the same such behaviours. Not hard to tell why always filmed in the dark any time there is light enough to see anything at all you see the sad sets and even poorer props. Don't waste your time. Get the audio book probably be a better watch for you than this crap.
10.0~So Disappointed rd626 Sign in Permalink Only watched first episode but was absolutely disgusted. Such a good concept but ruined by the obvious goal of making it into a teenage drama. Not to mention all the flaws like how after 100 years of living on a space station with the serious issue of dwindling resources, everyone has perfect hair, make up and shaved faces. Toss in the typical bad boy likes smart girl who ignores him, but really likes him story line and it lost me before the half way point of episode one. Could have been much more and I was hoping it was as there isn't much in the way of true Sci Fi on these days (I don't count vampires and werewolves as Sci Fi). Unless you are mentally under the age of 14 don't even bother with this garbage. Save your DVR space.
2.0~Good premise, Horrible execution. saphelon Sign in Permalink I watched 3 seasons of this, before I came to the conclusion it just was not going to get better. The premise is good, the last humans surviving a Holocaust, believing they are the only survivors. Sent down to earth to begin again.... all good solid sci-fi stuff. But from the moment the '100' touch the ground, the story goes no where. The character development seems to cycle and is the same for every character: Person is good person, person is put in tricky situation, person makes bad decision, person blames themselves or someone else, person seeks redemption. In the first season, the writers seemed to be obsessed with finding different ways that young adults can wander around a forest with firearms, often with no logic or reason to their approach. Each character has the same personality. The only exception was killed off early in the first season. No character has reasonable judgment, and all are quick to jump to conclusions, blame others and wander off. The most reasonable of characters will eventually make rash decisions completely void of their character. Enough about the horrible characterization, lets look at the plot. There is an abundance of violence. Its basically a Science-fiction without much science fiction elements. Sure there is the tribes, and the mountain men, but it always seems that the writers were strained to find a new enemy for the Ark survivors to be pitted against, another reason to have people tot around the forest with guns. Later in the series you find out that the place they landed was close to present day Washington DC, which I found surprising, as after a nuclear attack, you would imagine The Eastern Seaboard of US would probably likely to be one of the highest fallout regions in the world. The more I watched it the more I could pick wholes in the whole plot. The writers just did not think it through. For instance, apparently there were 100 youth who had committed crimes, in a population of a couple of thousand on the ark. Apart from Raven, there does not seem to be evidence of any other youth which were not incarcerated. The '100' is really not realistic in anyway, but if you like people wandering around finding reasons to pick fights and shoot people, with a very small amount of science fiction elements, then it may work for you.
1.0~Wrong Fiction qasdert-67939 Sign in Permalink They orbit Earth for 100 years and don't notice that planet is swarming with people? They send 100 young people with no adults, no supervisor? Octavia is attacked and dragged in the water by a snake like thing for several minutes, and the girl has only a scratch afterwards? After Acid Fog passes, all trees are still alive? I had enough of this rubbish.
9.0~the difference that makes a difference parrishka Sign in Permalink It's the end of the world as we know it, and apocalypse stories are proliferating like an airborne disease. It's not surprising that many of them share similar themes and tropes. AIs realize that humans are the parasite of the earth and so the logical solution is to destroy them. Limited resources mean some people will have to die so others may live and it's the 1% who decides. Prisoners are used for human experiments in order to survive. I can name at least 3 popular shows or movies that explore each of these ideas. And so does the 100. They're logical narrative tropes given our fears about the condition of the human race. Out of all of them, I think The 100 is the best. At the beginning, I thought it was going to be a Lord of the Flies rip-off, but I was quickly proven wrong. And those who called it a "teen drama" ignored how much time was given to the critical situation of the adults still aboard the Arc. The acting and directing and writing is excellent. Look at the credits. This is clearly a Vancouver production, but so was Battlestar Gallactica. They employed Liz Phair as part of their music team. Who else does something like that? For two exceptional scenes involving music, first, I direct your attention to the last episode of season 1. I will try to avoid spoilers. Someone makes it to the ground. And as she sees Earth for the first time, Radiohead's Exit Music For a Film plays. I didn't think that song could move me again; I've heard it too often. But in that context, it devastated me. And it seemed liked the song was written for just that scene. Second, I will try my best to do this without spoilers. S3 ep1. A group goes out as a search party in a tank-like vehicle and one of the 100 is charging along side them on a horse. They start playing Violent Femmes' Add it up. And the song... it may not heal them but it... well it does what music does. But the real difference that makes a difference in this show is gender, sexuality, race and class. Clarke is the new Buffy. She's 17 and has to make all of the hard decisions as she grows into leadership. But on the ground, again, I'm trying to avoid spoilers, leaders may be men or women. There is no talk of women being weaker. And you soon see why. The show features openly gay couples, and people who are exploring their sexuality. On the Arc, this would probably be more welcome because it wouldn't increase the population. But on the ground, sexuality seems to be based on desire, and there are no laws against anything sexual. When the series begins, the leader is a black man, and no, he's not the first to die. People of all races have major roles. I will concede this, as I watch season 5, it's grown paler. And I hope they rectify this. But season 5 has just started, and women are the ones in position of power. And that is the difference that makes a difference. R.I.P. Octavia Butler
10.0~BEST TV SHOWS EVER EVER EVER! gymaesthetic Sign in Permalink When i finished to watch Season 1-4, i restarted from season 1 again, and this for 5 time. Never happen with other TV Series. There is no other show similar to The 100! From best to bad Tv Series in my point of view: The 100, The Last Ship, Terra Nova, The Walking Dead, Lost, Zoo, The Strain, The Rain, The Mist, Z Nation, Fear the walking dead. Soon i will watch Jericho, Survivors, Under the dome, Falling skies, Revolution, The returned, ecc.
10.0~Freaking Amazing!! bensfer Sign in Permalink I was actually very concerned about this show at first. Then I kept hearing how good it was and how much attention it was getting on social media, so I decided to give it a go. Honestly, it blew me away. The first few episodes are bit slow to go through, but you will get the hang of the characters, and the back story. I thought this was going to be another lovesick "High School" drama with plot holes up the butt, but I was very surprised. The most interesting part in this series was The Ark. It showed how much the adults had to take care of the ship while the The 100 were on the ground. The character development in The Ark, is worth looking into. This show reminds me a lot of Fallout, and Battlestar Galactica. This show is about survival and I'm so glad that they cut away from most teen dramas. This show continues to surprise, and the CW might have a winner. It caught my interest, and I'm so glad it had. It made me cry, laugh, and make me jump from my seat. Trust me when I say its good, it's freaking good.
9.0~The 100!!!! joshuabrown-81614 Sign in Permalink I enjoyed the TV show from the moment I started watching it but as I went further in, some of the main characters started dying. In Season 2 Episode 8 one of the main characters, 'Finn' dies. Now after seeing that, it kind of makes me want to stop watching it but I won't. Even though I think that by Finn dying the show won't be as interesting, I'll keep watching to see if Finn dying made a good or a bad change to the show. I will make another review after I have been up to date and will let everyone know if it's still worth watching. Anyhow, don't let this stop you from watching, as you might have a different view. It's still a great TV show and I hope no more main characters further into the series leaves.
10.0~Every honor to the developers goshenikolov Sign in Permalink As everyone who has watched the show says, if you want to watch this epic drama, you have to exceed the specificity of the first few (three or four) episodes. As it develops, every episode is greater and much more exciting than the previous (the same is true for the seasons). It's true. At first, you will feel like 'What the hell is going on there?!'. You have to be sure that all obscure things and questions, will be cleared and answered starting with the second season. All mysteries will be resolved. EVERY WHY - HAS A WHEREFORE. Nothing stays mystery - everything is explained now, or 1-2 episodes later. That is what makes the show ADDICTIVE , EXCITING, and BEAUTIFUL. I have never watched a show like this before. Whit season 3, it became my favorite TV Show of all time (though, I haven't watched Game of Thrones, I think watching it won't change my top 1). I cannot find words that can describe how admirable the development of the events is. While watching it, you just feel the tension and the fear of the situations like you are there with them. I have to admit, I was under influence of the events in 'The 100' for a long time after watching all 4 seasons. Season 3 is definitely the best for now. Every honor to the developers of the show.
8.0~Teenage Post-Apocalypse done right. tankace Sign in Permalink The 100 is not by no means an original idea : A team of teenagers in a post apocalyptic world and the lead role has a girl. Bomber ,after the Hunger Games (2012) I had my belly full of the scenario(!) ,but after finishing the third season ,I change somewhat my mind for this project at least. Firstly the standard clichés are no-existed or are "deleted" from the show pretty quickly and the setting is more Bear Grills meets Lord of the Flies and less Divergent, Hunger Game on a repeat! Another thing that gives quality points to the series is the really good casting the characters in it are portrait well from the actors and they made me care about them. And here we get to what I believe is the core for any media, weather is movies, TV series, video games, books, comics whatever, is to get invested to the characters in it, the rest genre, setting, ideals, philosophy etc.. are the cherry on top. No the series is by no means perfect, especially the third season is in the middle all over the place but by the end it gets better so no major issues here. Finally here unlike HUNGER Games or Divergent or Maze Runner (man there are a lot) there is no 100% good or bad ,for everyone is trying to do his or her best in order for his or her people to survive this world ,so go and think for yourself who has right and not been spoon feed by it, like with Catnis in the last two films. All in all it worth check it out if you are interested in that kid of genre ,but done good ,watch it. Have an awesome binge watching guys and girls.
7.0~Post apocalyptic earth, space station over populated, disgruntled teens mollidew Sign in Permalink I haven't seen enough of this show to review it properly in my opinion but I will try. First I have to say, science fiction is not based on science fact and what someone might do in real life or projected future. You have to be willing to suspend credibility for entertainment. The CW tends to cater to a younger audience and I have to say I am weary of shows that showcase large numbers of teens. The doctor that is mentioned in one review was not killed. She was pardoned before they were going to put her out of the airlock. Given all these things the show may fail because of the audience they have chosen instead of something much wider. One particular thing that I didn't like was seeing Richard Harmon as an angry teenager on this show. He is being typecast and when I see him I know he will be a troublemaker. He has also been cast on too many TV series of this type. I don't care for him at all so that turns me off on watching this show but I'm not apart of their target audience anyway. If they step out of the typical formula for shows like this it might fly. The idea there was a nuclear holocaust on the planet and the only survivors were those on a number of space stations is interesting. The fact they linked them all together to form the Ark very inventive. What I didn't like was the typical slaughter of people randomly to cut down the population. This is not a new idea and a pretty predictable activity in a story like this one. Eventually they are going to have to send adults to the Earth's surface. I see no other way to keep the storyline going. It would be nice to see perhaps aliens living there who know how to adapt to radiation exposure. As for anything else, that would be based on real science, hey, its for entertainment and is not a what if type of documentary. It doesn't have to be accurate and it doesn't have to follow the way the audience would like. One has to watch enough because a show has to have time to grow and evolve. It looks to be a very good series if people will give it a chance.
1.0~Such a waste of time... sean-weems Sign in Permalink This show had so much promise from the pilot but wasted all of its potential on, not just one, but TWO love triangles, a slew of teenage angst and drama riddled all throughout, and ridiculous plot pushing devices that no one should buy. The main characters can't seem to maintain the same personalities or convictions through each episode and no one seems to be able to think rationally. I don't know why I expected this show to be any less than a teenage drama with some scifi sprinkled on top. The show plays on many movie misconceptions: shooting gunpowder makes it go boom, you can establish a solid and clear radio connection with any electronic device that uses radio and that is just one small step away from a 2way video feed that also comes in pretty clearly. Not to mention the fact that this mechanic wouldn't be allowed the knowledge of the radio frequency that their council operates on, and since they don't have an rf scanner I refuse to believe she just stumbled upon it. It runs on clichés like that of the war- hungry leader being incapable of listening to reason. And somehow there are only 5 or 6 people who know anything useful out of these 100 and they manage to kill one off early in the first season. Long story short: unconvincing plot and characters, far too much drama, and science fiction that tries to be more science but is much more fiction.
10.0~why oatsart54 Sign in Permalink I have watched this series from the beginning and it has been an action type from the start so my question is why do need to add gay, lesbian to it.don't get me wrong I have nothing against sexual preference but every TV series feels it is needed to sell the show.can't you just make it about the 100 who got dropped on earth and face dangers of all kinds and leave all sex out of it.very small minded thinkers and writers.go with what works not what politically correct.morons
8.0~Amazing until the fourth season lauraavello Sign in Permalink As soon as I started to watch the serie, I felt in love with it, and I finish all of it in days. It's a really good serie until the major plot is "solved", then the serie starts to go in a direction I'm not really fun of, it becomes too much futuristic in a sense that the plot some times stops making sense. To add up, the serie is amazing but the last season for me let's the serie down.
8.0~i know my review is a bit long but PLEASE read it if you have already given up hope on the show because of pointlessly negative reviews!! mohammadjavadsiahkamari Sign in Permalink i have been reading these reviews and i can think of nothing but to say totally wrong and unfair!!!negative reviews come from those who haven't watched the show entirely.so i'm going to clear up all the so called "contradictions" on behalf of the show!! 1:why would they send 100 of young teens to a certain death while their goal is species survival?the Ark is running low on oxygen supplies and it can't afford the high population of human race survivors.so,it actually is one stone and two birds!!they send delinquents(who are already sentenced to death) down to earth to both reduce the population and take their chances to see if human race is ready to be back on earth or not. 2:Why would they send young and strong girls and boys to face the potential danger of radiation instead of old and sick people?As i mention before,the Ark is running low on oxygen so the survivors are already looking for a new place to continue living or suffocate in the space ship.So,this is their one and ONLY chance to evaluate Earth's condition for living so they should send a group to start a new life on earth not just be lab rats for testing radiation level.so if they send some sick old people they can not survive the rough problems of Earth(you know what i mean if you have watched season 1 to the very end).and old people are needed on the Ark because they can have responsibilities but the delinquents are sentenced to death but on earth they can have an other chance to help both themselves and human race. 3:why would they execute people for even minor crimes?for 3 generations the Ark has supported human life but now the filters which convert exhale's carbon dioxide to oxygen are broken so the rulers of the Ark have developed a new project.they execute criminals no matter what in order to control population and save human race. 4:why are there only 100 juvenile delinquents out of a population of 4000?2 reasons:first comparing to Earth,Ark is small,there are strict rules and there isn't a variety of crimes to commit!!(most of delinquents in jail have done something like punching a guard!!)so there isn't enough freedom to commit crimes.2:According to population control law people on Ark are not allowed to have more than 1 child so the young population is low let alone the young criminals. 5:How could the 100 become lord of the flies on Earth,after living in a highly controlled society?First of all there is something wrong with the question!!!the Ark is a limited society with strict rules but people on Ark aren't type of those who have a strict discipline like robots,they actually live pretty much like the time when people were still on Earth.Secondly the 100 are basically out laws and are dissatisfied with the law system of the Ark so of course!!when you put them on Earth it's a new chance for them to be freed and they certainly start experiencing a life of no rules!! At last i have to admit there are a few flaws i agree with like:they shouldn't seem so perfectly handsome shaved and etc after 3 generations of limitation which isn't a great deal comparing to all advantage points. As some guy who has been watching all kinds of TV series,i assure you you won't regret watching this great show!!
1.0~The 100 Reasons Not to Watch This Show wahoo8888 Sign in Permalink Actually there are probably far more than 100 reasons and I'm not going to list them all here. I'm sure many more will follow in other reviews. But, just to get started, the setup for this show is so preposterous I don't know where to begin. The survivors of a future apocalypse escape an irradiated Earth and live in space stations, where the punishment for any crime "no matter how small" is death (apparently mostly Republicans survived the Apocalypse). Except if you are under 18, then you get to live in prison until you are 18, then reviewed, and then presumably, put to death. However, the compassionate adults of the future have decided to send 100 teenagers approaching 18 to the Earth as guinea pigs to monitor their survival. If they die, so what, they were going to be killed anyway. And, as we all know, teenagers would certainly represent the best option for the survival of humanity. So as not to disappoint, the teenagers are self-centered, arrogant, idiots who are completely unaware of what is going on; and completely incapable of any kindness or compassion (who knows, maybe this will change as time goes by, but, this group does not give me any hope for the future). Immediately the kids start to bicker and congregate into uncooperative groups (a sure sign of maturity). So far, the show seems to be about a typical trip to the mall. On the bright side, the adults in this show do not fare much better. Apparently there are no schools on that space station (and from the feel of it, maybe just mind-numbing reruns of reality shows as entertainment). Apparently, and according to all TV shows and movies, the future human race no longer evolves, but devolves into a species of ultra-violent racists, hellbent on annihilation. It does make sense though, that spending a couple years in prison as a teenager would prepare you for immediate expulsion to the surface of a planet that was recently decimated by nuclear war. Oh, and there must be great hair stylists in that prison because The 100 all look like they just stepped out of a salon.
1.0~Politically correct iceman88869 Sign in Permalink The first episode says it all. According to this show, all white men are evil or side kicks to the ultra-smart females of the show. Most of the lead white males are seriously the evil doers trying to bring everyone else down. One white guy is the lead females sidekick/obvious love interest in a high school way. The lead girl is obviously suppose to be way smarter than everyone else. All I have to say to the creators of this show is, thanks for putting those token white guys in there even though they are either evil or lesser than women in every way. You cannot get anymore unrealistic than this show. Is it possible to create a show without promoting a political agenda these days? Most shows/movies made now are trash because they push some left wing political agenda. Show me a 90 lbs woman in a movie/TV show that is throwing around 230 lbs men and I will show you in real life a 90 lbs woman in great shape that can NOT throw around a 230 lbs man. Sure, women can be smarter than men, but this show goes to the extreme unrealistic left.
9.0~Give it a chance, and you'll be hooked! stefdgagne Sign in Permalink Everyone is so negative about this show, yes the first episodes were not that great, however, roughly around episode 4-6 that's where I started to get hooked. Slowly the show began to escalate to whole new levels with unpredictable cliff hangers. Sure the characters are young but it really opens your mind on how a young generation would act under these circumstances. Everyone is saying it's all "high school drama" at the beginning yeah it kind of was but now it's not even close! How are concepts of war even close to high school drama? You begin to love the characters, the situations they go through are well written and the plot twists are so well done. If you ask me you can't judge a show by the first three episodes. In my opinion any show I have watched I had to watch at least 6 to give it a fair chance. After watching the season finale last night I can't wait for season 2! In summary, MIND BLOWN!
10.0~Nothing like CW. charelkins-13669 Sign in Permalink By far the best show on CW, and at the same time one of the best shows on television. I obsess over this show as much as I do Game of Thrones, and that's saying something. The first few episodes suck...essentially, they are meant to pull in the typical CW viewer. It works for them, but it also managed to turn off people who just throw it on on Netflix. However, if people can trudge through the first few episodes, magic happens. Romance is shattered, brutal deaths, crazy twists, impossible choices. God it's amazing. Just give it a try, and I swear you will not regret it.
10.0~Genius Series cool_mino Sign in Permalink An amazing series ! The Characters are deeply described with their old backgrounds this make you feel attached to the characters and understand their reactions. The series changed the concept of good and evil humans ! The characters do what they see always correct from their point of view to save themselves and the world. which is always not the full pictures and may look evil for others. The series elaborates this idea in a very good way. The idea of the communication between the Grounders and Ski-crew. elaborates how a 100 years of no interactions between parts of the human race caused evolution of different cultures on both sides that made communication and mutual trust very hard. I really wonder how hard survival will be throughout the series and with these very low technology and supplies available.
9.0~Adventure pradeepchoudharyhoney Sign in Permalink Super series with super story, adventures Epic and realistic fights screen play also too good
6.0~Inconsistent across seasons faithfulgrace-330-50991 Sign in Permalink It took me a minute to get passed some of the original concepts of the show. It did get pretty good for a few seasons before the writers ran out of ideas and the story just became slight twists on the same plot. The last season was soooo terrible it was almost unwatchable. Characters get stuck in sudden and wildly different personalities. Absolutely ridiculous decisions made my numerous characters that no one would ever do, they do things that make sense only to create conflict in the plot. It's either bad or lazy writing. Everything feels forced. Even the good ideas are drawn out to the point where they get stupid. Bloodryana was a cool concept...but they took it so far and to such a ridiculous place...it's sad to see a decent show become trash.
10.0~Love the Idiocy!!!! im-571-764326 Sign in Permalink This show drives my family NUTS!!! I'm the outcast watching it because everyone finds it too stupid! "OMG, it's so lame". It seems to either be getting better (now at episode 11) or I'm getting numb and dumb? I think it's the latter :-) The show has so many inconsistency that I gave up on them after the first few shows. People who have already posted a ton of them missed a bunch. Every episodes has dozens that it's fully expected now. The editors of this show much be smokin some of the BC bud! I LOVE the reviews on this site, so my 10/10 is really for the show's ability to generate so many really funny reviews! ;-) The nonsensical rating matches the show! If you expect anything else, you're in the wrong world... The logic matches. Horrible reviews with a great rating (7+), makes perfect sense in the context of this show. It's filmed in North Vancouver. This saves the show a TON of money, they don't need to add any moss anywhere to the forest, it's full of the stuff around here! Great way to save on special effects.
6.0~Good concept but below par execution futureishere Sign in Permalink I started watching this series because I was intrigued by the plot. But unfortunately, the series is ruined by below par acting and cringe-worthy dialog.
1.0~Oh no. Marauder_Of_Mayhem Sign in Permalink What a crock of sh!t. It's basically a popularity contest between a bunch of immature idiots and I was wishing they were all killed by the end of the first episode. Instead of an intelligent script/plot about mortality and existentialism, we have a bunch of teenagers throwing hissy fits and acting like they have a lack of brain cells. You would think humanity might have advanced seen as they are living in space and this is set in the future, surely they are reasonable enough to send a small group of highly skilled people to scout ahead for whatever their plan is? Of course not, send in kids to fight over who's cool and what kind of stupid sh!t they should do, that will help humanity. Avoid this crap like the plague.
2.0~Getting worse with each season candamilla Sign in Permalink The first 2 seasons were almost great, however main characters changed courses several times: good guys become bad guys and vice versa several times. But from season 3 onward every episode is just a copy of one of the previous ones, you feel you have seen this before at least 3 times already - concerning decisions, kill or not to kill, revenge or not revenge, long emotional conversations instead of running for their lives. People are painfully unable to make a difference between revenge and justice. Either killing everyone or nobody. Not even when they should to save their own lives. In season 4 you can't help hating all the main characters for their stupid decisions. I gave up on season 5 altogether.
2.0~I really wanted to like this cowch33 Sign in Permalink One night, while looking for a new TV show to watch, I stumbled upon this show on Netflix. I thought to myself, "I like sci-fi, I even fall victim to mindless teen dramas." Needless to say, I watched the first 3 episodes and laughed at just how bad it was. Fast-forward a few months and my sister discovered this show and fell in love. So I made a deal: I watch The 100, and she will finally watch Game of Thrones. To say I got the raw deal is a massive understatement. In the beginning of the show, everyone is angry and fighting with each other-I am instantly rooting for every character to die. Since I made this deal with my sister, I am stuck watching this, but hey, at least I can root for many deaths. As most of the positive reviews of this show state, it truly does get better overall, but having watched the beginning of this show....well, how can I truly enjoy a good story when I'm already annoyed by every main character? Skipping the first half of the first season could possibly be this series saving-grace, but I will never know that joy. I could go on and on about the sub-par acting, bad script/writing, predictable plot-lines, pacing issues, filling airtime with pointless scenes because the "big event" in the season can't happen until a certain episode, knowing for a fact that certain characters are "safe", forcing relationships between people who logically would have no interest in each other, and everyone being "too pretty", but there are many other negative reviews that do the job just fine. I would somewhat begrudgingly recommend this show to someone who is under 16, a feminist (here come the down votes, but the feminist undertones really are quite strong), or just likes either looking at pretty people or watching mindless television. I would NOT recommend this show if you're into your 20's, understand science well, actually enjoy sci-fi (it's just NOT sci-fi, okay?), or simply have better options to watch.
2.0~Just registered as I had to do write this down. netsmile Sign in Permalink My initial impressions: Nice-ish trailer, good starting story, young actress shows some skin, mutant creatures show some skin...so I watched first episode and OMG did it hurt. 1. Props and Costumes : The interior and exterior of the 'landing craft' was pathetic level low-budget. (What space station would have a landing module for 100 persons anyway?) All prisoners have better quality clothing than the wannabe emperor's all-holes shirt. I would bet that I was hearing a WindowsXP system sound playing during the operation scene, not kidding. Babylon 5 props/costumes seems like a millenia ago but still a millenia ahead of "The 100". Summary: 2/10 Oh, and The Rope, the tree tendril that is so obviously a frakin ROPE...Seriously? http://imgur.com/Ftqmm70 2. Acting: The only actor was stabbed with a pike/lance during the pilot. Models don't like competition. Summary: 2/10 3. Animation: space station looked cool, as did the mutant deer. Landing scene is alright too. Summary: 6/10 4. Story: Dumb, simply dumb. A very good starting/background story that is simply ruined by big holes in consistency and logic. It doesn't feel realistic at all. Cause and effect ignored. I could list 20 of those after watching a 40 minute show. Thats roughly a plot mistake for every 2 minutes. Summary: 1/10 This would have been a good PC game...in 1998. ( Oh wait Its called Unreal and it was released in 1998.)
10.0~Love it!!!! brittanybailey-84561 Sign in Permalink Amazing show! The acting is good and I love the characters! Keep the seasons coming!
9.0~absolutely amazing grazzdude Sign in Permalink i discovered the book at the same time i needed a new TV show so when the cover said there's a TV show about this i watched the first episode and man this was the best decision i could have made its fun loose happy with a bit of drama mystery a nice dystopian sci-fi just like i like em i gotta say it got my attention I'm curious to where the plot will go and how the characters will develop i was kinda happy with the ending of episode one it had a nice dramatic ending what i also like is that the series is based on the concept they changed a lot of things like in the book her mother is dead and they got supplies with them
2.0~Okay, I've watched five episodes and I want to know.... davidfurlotte Sign in Permalink I really had hope for the show but it seems the scriptwriters are a team of 14 year old honour students that skipped their science classes. *****Spoilers Here****** Here's what I want to know. 1. Let's send 100 prisoners down to check out the planet and see if it's inhabitable because we don't have any probes that can check things out. Let's hook them all up with these nifty wristbands that will tell us their vital signs but WHY did they not give them ONE single radio or some device to simply TEXT something like, "We made it and we're still breathing?" 2. EVERY living creature was supposedly destroyed through radiation but miraculously we have animals and even humans "re-spawning" on the planet within 100 years? Did I miss something that showed us how evolution re-booted and somehow sped up so things that took hundreds of thousands of years could happen overnight? 3. When astronauts and cosmonauts go onto the ISS and stay for more than a month they have to take time to adapt to our gravity on their return to simply be able to walk again. How, after 100 years in space with minimal gravity, these kids are able to deal with Earth's gravity as though it was nothing? 4. When ever crime is a supposed death sentence, why would you even have a prison system? 5. Obviously there are multiple drop ships to enable the full 4000 people to return to Earth so why not do your "culling" of the herd by sending them back to a planet that MAY or MAY NOT allow them to live? "Floating" them or killing them off with gas means they definitely die. 6. Why are the "4000" people being the "best hope for humanity" all from North America? To say those are just a few of the questions I have is an understatement, however, I really don't hold a lot of hope in seeing some rational answers to this. Oh, and BTW, we have now exchanged one love triangle for another.
10.0~loved it samantha-ann-connor Sign in Permalink I enjoyed it rather a lot can't believe I've got to wait until October until the next episode! (BIG SPOILER) I did wonder why the sent the kids down without any food or medical supplies, or even a form of contact to the ark when they had landed but them I suppose if they thought they was going to the mountain where there would be them supplies then they didn't need to but then there would always be a suspicion that there wouldn't be anything there! So you'd still supply them with things just in case. And the fact that there was only one drop ship,and one master drop ship was stupid. Plus the random one escape pod that could be modified to land was confusing, but hey I still enjoyed watching and got impatient waiting for the next one to be released!
1.0~Another horrendous Young Adult film kriahnna_18 Sign in Permalink Very awful series. Okay, let's say that we disregard all the scientific inaccuracies and just focus on the ordinary stuff. First off, there's the bad acting. Notice that when the actors are in the grip of a fierce emotion and they're supposed to be crying, no tears are falling. They're just making howling noises. It's so annoying to watch. Second of all, the writing's crappy. Even the speeches that are supposed to encourage people are not so inspiring. Third, the 100 didn't have weapons or food or any experience at all about fighting, but when they landed on earth, they've mysteriously become warriors, hunters, and trackers. And how do they stay so clean and have perfect make up? I mean, even their eyelashes are curled. And those eyebrows! Wow! They're cleaner than mine and I clean mine twice a week! Lastly, I hate Clarke. She's such a know it all and always piping about doing the right thing. But when push came to shove, she was okay with torturing a person and using violence to solve her problems. She doesn't listen to any opinion but hers. Her acting is so bad. She holds a grudge and so unforgiving. Also, she's the most pessimistic person in the film. "We can't do it. Something's wrong. We can't make it. We're going to die." When told that she should at least take a minute to enjoy being alive, she pauses with no expression on her face and said, "Okay, I enjoyed it. Now, let's go." Simply put, she's a bitchy character, but they have no choice but to make her look like she's a good person because she's supposed to be the heroine. VERY BAD TELEVISION!
9.0~Addicting, totally awesome! Savannahbrann Sign in Permalink This show is totally addicting, especially if you like Sci-fi. But it's so much more than that. It's heart breaking and wonderful, pulls on your heart strings and makes you second guess the decisions you'd make if you were in the characters shoes. There's 2 sides to every story and you may find yourself on a different side than your friends! I would have given it 10 stars a few episodes ago. Unfortunately they added a lesbian scene this season. I'm against that. But the main character is supposedly bisexuality. Other than that though, I love everything about it. Prepare to cry, laugh and jump on the edge of your seat! It's a Must see.
5.0~The worst ever gazimend Sign in Permalink If one wants to waste time and watch the most feminist, decision based on emotions and losing the sense of what's right and what's wrong than please watch the serie to the end.
9.0~Probably the best Sci-Fi show at the moment ... lightningsrl Sign in Permalink The show started a bit slow and I was thinking it wont last but it seems I was wrong. The second season is clearly better than the first and the plot potential is wide open creating a whole new bunch of possibilities to continue the story. The last episode so far (season 2 ep. 16) was the best in every way, let's hope the continuity of the story will take full advantage of the great potential it has to continue at this point. If that will be done right the show should be able to continue for many seasons. There's a very big hole in today's TV Sci-Fi series, the biggest one being a (long run) space opera kind of a show but I really can say that this show helped me to satisfy my need for Sci-Fi in the absence of good space opera show. Well above average acting from most characters, good plot twists and good story line with great potential at this point. Congratulations and keep it up. For all the negative reviewers ... keep in mind there's actually no good Sci-Fi show at this time and nothing is perfect, never was and it will never be, if you try to get over the things you think you don't like or ignore them you will see it's a very good entertaining Sci- Fi show.
1.0~Its Twilight meets One tree hill, Result = nuclear disaster. maxbrt-155-905276 Sign in Permalink This show is an insult to my intelligence, its clear that people that like this show are young, dumb, or will watch anything. I will just start listing. 1. Bad, CGI. They have so much tech but cant measure radiation. 2. They sent a bunch of clueless teens (the future of man kind) that spent their life on a space station to their death or possibly save man. 3. The teens that were imprisoned all their life on a space station know how to craft weapons, tools, shelters, SWIM!, and start fires????! 4. That vine thing in ep1 that hung from mid air and was clearly a rope! 5. Clarke griffin, knows everything! And walks the earth like she's lived there for years, knows medicine, how to read maps, how to track, there's just no reason and no way, and her acting is terrible. 6. Everyone looks like a twilight character, lets get real, if they lived on a space station they wouldn't all look like fashionistas. 7. The tool leader kid says "take your freedom but obey my every command" and everyone says hell yeah! 8. The main reason i cant watch this show, The writing and the plot holes its all TERRIBLE!!!! I really could go on forever but ill stop, if you like this show, then you have really low standards for entertainment.
3.0~Lacks character and scientific maturity riasat-iceman Sign in Permalink Full of high school drama, immature acting, and lacks common sense and scientific depth.
8.0~Generally a good series, with unnecessary flaws. edphahn Sign in Permalink It's a good show, but there are flaws that shouldn't have been, and more reasonable ways the story could have been. For instance. That ridiculous knife episode, where the knife was clearly not at the angle they said it was. Simply pulling the knife out would have been the easy part. Preventing bleeding and maybe, if needed, stitching up damage to intestines would have been the hard part. The story makes the ark thinkers look foolish from the outset. The 100 should have had basic survival training, and many ways to communicate with the ark. Weapons and medical supplies should have been sent with them, even though there were violent prisoners included (maybe they shouldn't have been). As part of the plan, 700 volunteers should have been readied for the exodus ship to follow them, and other drop ships should have been constructed to take everyone down. They had a 97yrs to prepare. Their planning seems impulsive. Silly things happened. For instance when Lincoln wrapped the chain around Octavia's wrists and then locked it onto a fixture. The chain obviously wasn't locked onto her wrists. She could have easily slipped it off. The glowing woods are never seen after that first episode. Why didn't someone, Bellamy, tell Murphy to stop mistreating the workers. Water wasn't in short supply. He was just being a sadistic ass. Why didn't someone say no one minded hanging him because he treated everyone like crap; he behaved like a sadistic ass. Why wasn't the possibility that the monkey tracks found were from a escaped zoo animal mentioned, and the possibility that other unexpected predatory animals might be encountered? Why wasn't a comparison made between the gunpowder that smelled acidic and the 'good' gun powder compared to be sure they were selecting the 'good' propellant? Why didn't Raven think to try a drop or two of hydrazine in a shell? The primer would have ignited it. The problem with the defective bullets seemed to have been in the primers. The obviously don't fire. We only hear a click from the firing pin. Why weren't grenades made from hydrazine and a bullet, using the primer to ignite the hydrazine. There are lots of missed opportunities to have made this into a good sci-fi, instead of a soap opera. They really blew it. The series should be re-made as a sci-fi. It would be a really interesting show, without the easily avoided flaws.
4.0~Promising Premise, but Panned Production... goshin34 Sign in Permalink It was an interesting idea, and it had promise... but that promise goes largely unfulfilled. Oh it isn't the worst, there are some interesting story lines... but the production values and sense that the writers/producer/director/actors CARE is simply missing. Right from the beginning, these teenagers do not ACT like people who have grown up in space; people who have never once been outdoors or touched a tree or felt a breeze on their face. They're used to walking on smooth floors; they should have been stumbling every five seconds walking on uneven ground at first. They should have been unnerved by the vast open spaces; frightened of the deep river water; terrified by the first downpour of rain, even if only for a few minutes. Instead, they act like contemporary High School kids on spring break... they don't even seem overly put out by having hardly anything to eat for days at a time. The girl who was allegedly hidden "under the floor" for sixteen years should have been socially awkward and hesitant, not outgoing-and-bold-bordering-on-slutty. It is more like 90210 meets Lord of the Flies and there is little Science Fiction involved, other than the makeshift and shoddily presented premise. Nonetheless there are a few interesting elements that make it somewhat worth watching, so I give it an overly generous four...
10.0~Awesome Series ! jacobwest-57888 Sign in Permalink MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! I really don't get why this series has not reached a higher rating yet. I have seen other series which is not nearly as excellent as this with higher rating. Series in general get higher ratings than movies i think. Anyways, this series is a must see ! If you are into Science Fiction and movies that is about surving in the wild you should definitely watch this. series. The first season is a bit slow but still very interesting, but season 2 is just simply phenomenal. I think it is up there with Game Of Thrones. In Season 2 you will start following different stories in the series about diffenrent groups with missions of their own, which will only keep you even more curious about what is gonna happen. Essentially there are 3 mayor factions: the ark people(called the sky people, which are the ones who has been living in space since the atomic bombs fell), the Grounders(those who lived aboved ground all the time and survived the radioactive fallout) and lastly the Mountain Men(people who took shelter in a huge facility in the mountain to escape the fallout since the nuclear war 100 years ago). So these factions are really getting intertwined in this series, every faction with their own agenda. Mainly we follow the Ark people in the series so far.
5.0~It started okay but now it's downhill deloudelouvain Sign in Permalink I read in the reviews that you had to give this series a bit of time. That after season one it would get better and things like that. Because of it's high ratings I gave it a shot. I write this review after watching the first three seasons. I thought the first season was okay and even the second one. Even though it's clearly made for a younger audience. All the actors and actresses could go modeling if they would not succeed in their acting career. It is kind of bothering me. Of course it's not their fault they're good looking but it's just not a correct view of the actual society. I don't see any overweight actors in there while America is full of morbidly obese people. Anyways, the first two seasons are okay to watch. I would score it a seven for the first seasons but after watching the third one it went down. The story is going nowhere, with almost all the different groups at least being betrayed by another group and becoming allies a couple episodes further. It's really annoying those clan forming friendships all the time. Then this crew is friends with that crew but hates another crew. Three episodes later it's the complete opposite and so it goes on and on. There are also a couple really annoying actors, like Eliza Taylor, Lindsey Morgan and Paige Turco. I don't know why but the more I see them the lesser I want to continue watching this show. I saw there was going to be a fourth season but that's going to be without me watching it.
10.0~This Show is Tantalizing! mdreese Sign in Permalink This show is so amazing it is unreal. It is a perfect blend of a drama,apocalypse, action, adventure, romance, sci-fi, future, and mystery. I get goosebumps at least ten times per episode and get shivers whenever I hear the intro music. To me it is a must watch, and is appealing for all ages over ten, all genders, races, and even likes and dislikes. Give it a try and I am praying that it is renewed for season five, it seems likely but you never know.
1.0~S-F for kids, with all the S wrong roska-posti Sign in Permalink This must be the worst Science-Fiction show I ever saw. All the main characters are irrational or lunatics and completely unlikeable. Well, not quite all. Monty and Lincoln are decent, and Octavia was irritating mostly in the beginning, not so much later on. All the others are anti-heroes, people you would hate in real life. How anyone can enjoy watching a TV-show populated with such characters, monsters, wretched people, is beyond me. Another thing, the science is so full of stupidities that you have to laugh, and lose the immersion. Three generations, and there are no cities, no roads, all the steel and concrete gone? People in North America talk a new language? Other people die in radiation in seconds, while others, adapted people and animals, suffer not even radiation sickness, only some newborns have birth-defects? And giant unkillable carnivore gorilla? Oh yeah and the typical connect the wires Star Trek -miracle technicians and password hackers, but those I'm used to from other silly TV-series. I mean, who writes this crap? Who believes this crap? Kids? Un-freaking believable. Truly, unbelievable.
5.0~Should have ended after 1-2 seasons imlindaheart Sign in Permalink I haven't seen all of it, I just got bored after 4 seasons. The plot started making less and less sense and became rather ridiculous. They should have stopped making it after 1-2 seasons and it would have received a 8-9 star rating from me.
8.0~This is worth it poroz Sign in Permalink I am man enough to admit my mistakes. When i saw all the bad reviews, i was wondering what was wrong with this show. I watched the first episode and is intellectually insulted by it. For about a year and a half i told everyone i knew how bad this show was. THEN. Countless of my friend watching it telling me they liked it. I gave it a second shot. Which you should do. This show has about the deepest character evolution i have ever seen on a TV show. It start on episode one as a jersey shore syfy to a 24 meet revolution later on. Well, let's put it in words, i watch metric ton of show and i've watched all first 2 season in 3 days. If you like TV shows, if you like syfy, watch this. Give it an episode of two or ten. It is worth it i am telling you.
1.0~Why is this show still on? dimimagno Sign in Permalink 97 years after a nuclear destruction the whole world (or just Washington DC I guess)is in ruins and mostly covered by vast forests that would normally take centuries to grow. In only a century, the remaining American people/survivors, seem to have forgotten their mother tongue and have developed a different language out of the blue. Mindless and silly children are sent like lab rats to explore the hostile environment, of the surface of a nuked planet Earth, and then they act like stoned and drunk fraternity spoiled children causing death and destruction... Why is this series still running? Is the acting good? No. Is the script breathtaking? Not even close. Then why, one would wonder, and they'd be right. The plot of The 100 is so lame, that it makes daily soap operas look like epic fantasy masterpieces. Are you looking for a bunch of pretty people mumbling and running around for no reason? Then this is your show, but if you are a person who has more than the average brain activity of a coma patient, then no, please save your precious time for something that is actually worth watching.
1.0~100 epic fails seularts Sign in Permalink What a great way to take a smart idea and stain it with rubbish from 100 underage kids that have no clue how to act. First of all, the future of the human race should not stay in American hands, since They American culture and mentality is the worst in the world. While watching this catastrophe of an episode, I did see between the lines a book concept, but whoever stole that idea executed it miserably. Having 3rd grade actors from other Sci-FY series won't make this any better. There are so many flaws that it would take an entire season to describe them all. Radiation goes away after at least 50.000 years and not just after 100. The rest of the episode stands out in cheap CGI, lots of flares and retarded dialogues. The only hope this series have, is if they reboot the pilot and add experience and mature actors and then rewrite the entire script dialogues. I can survive with the 90's CGI and other pathetic effects, but with ugly college kids that have apples for brains, I can't look at this series ever again! Avoid this garbage at all cost, it is a waste of time and intellect. I rate only 1 star out of respect for the main stolen concept that stands behind this atrocity.
10.0~My favourite show Chunks45621 Sign in Permalink Well, where do I start? I've only just started watching this about a month ago, and just finished Season 5 last night. The character chemistry and consistency is amazing. Characters just don't forgive and forget after just an episode, and I like that. Give it a reality feeling, like they have to proper redeem themselves first. The amount of betrayal you see in this show, you can't trust anyone. Sometimes not even family. The story of Octavia and Bellamy is just outstanding. Always a twist and turn of events that keeps you entertained each and every episode. I would highly recommend this show. At first I didn't know what to think of it, but now, in my opinion I truly amazing. The writers are amazing, all credit to them. On to Season 6!!!
8.0~Original and fresh! darren-wiesner Sign in Permalink I tuned into this show last night for the first time. I was glued to my TV from beginning to end. Luckily it's on Netflix, so I was able to watch another episode immediately after the pilot. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of every episode I watched. It's Star Trek meets Lost. I don't watch much TV because there isn't much that interests me that's currently on...but this show hit all the marks for me. A show with strong personalities, twists, discovery, science and the underlying message that we have destroyed the earth with nuclear holocaust is compelling enough to keep me watching. I would think that there would be wide appeal for interest in a show like this. Great writing, great characters, great plot! Definitely a fan! Darren
10.0~Very great serie ! ousssammmmamagic Sign in Permalink Great story , great actors , great end This serie is the most underratted serie ever
10.0~Amazing show chrisrw-85377 Sign in Permalink Awesome plot and it's very story driven and isn't shy of violence and action. There are some romances in the show, but nothing over done I believe. It's natural for people to seek love in hard times, I just think the show is realistic in that aspect. Season 3 was a little slow but Season 4 easily makes The 100 my favorite show again.
10.0~The 100 is one of the most invative and interestingly epic shows of our time. adam_man Sign in Permalink No doubt anyone who's seen the 100 the cw's new hit TV show agrees that it is one of the best shows of our time with the arch of each character and the back story that is associated with them makes the character interactions that happens every episode so great the way the shows writers incorporate what you want to happen 2 characters being In a relationship for instance with things you really did t want to happen and make your stomach drop I can say for myself season 2 had allot of moments that gave me butterflies if you haven't already checked out the 100 I recommend you do because there's has never been anything like the 100 on TV and nor will there ever be beside the 100 make sure to check it out on Netflix or the cw on Wednesday nights check the Internet for times in your area.
10.0~Amazing serie The 100 barbarosuzunlar Sign in Permalink This series is best series in the world for me. Simply Great. I would recommend watching everyone...
4.0~Great concept, poor long term delivery. kenrockz Sign in Permalink Great hook, interesting characters and concepts. ....severely let down by poor lazy and downright poor writing (copy and paste plots). By season 3 the same plot has been regurgitated how many times? I really like the characters though, although the weird Heroes season 2 good guy/bad guy flip makes little sense and still doesn't work. I believe they put these in the for the critics and not the fans (please correct me if I'm wrong). The plot line is strong, without giving away any spoilers its very much a blend of star trek, lost and the walking dead. Nice twists which sadly very quickly become predictable because they are the same as season 1 and 2 in season 3. Yawn.... next TV show please, done with this lazy effort.
9.0~Love it. kcquail Sign in Permalink Was very interesting and exciting in the first season. I felt it started to lose my interest in the following seasons but it hooked me again in the 5th season. Well written, interesting and likeable characters. It's a binge-worthy show so give it a shot.
9.0~A fantastic SCI-FI Tv show! eldrimezini Sign in Permalink I loved it.For the fans of sci-fi this is the best show you can ask for.A special thing about this show is that the actors that play are not popular but they are really promising.The plot was special and the special effects were good.The best of seasons was season 4 but anyway the other seasons were great.Another thing that makes this Tv show great is that is based on a book.I don't say that movies or shows based on novels are always perfect but this show is . You can say that The 100 is one of the best sci-fi shows.
8.0~More Than Meets the Eye johnsonwords Sign in Permalink If you only saw the first few episodes and then tuned out...you're missing something great! This show wears a "teen drama" mask, but there's a lot of deeper things going on. It's all about people, the relationships we make & break, and the raw power of human emotion. The teenage mask it wears allows it to shake off all that "adult" etiquette and really gets down to how we think and feel (but often don't act upon). Plus, I'm a fan of the post-apocalyptic niche, and this show does it beautifully. The set, the costumes, the effects, all really great for television! And there are a particular few actors in the bunch that REALLY do a killer job.
4.0~Over time disappointing ddurbano Sign in Permalink Loved how it started. Was great until season 3. Began rotting at season 4. Became unbeatable over season 5. Its kindergarden drama filled with bad decision making characters (except for a few ones) really turned this show into a laughable farce.
10.0~Good Series with Potential misi_sevele07 Sign in Permalink I've read some reviews and mostly bad except for the good ones, but i don't know why they are so negative about the show just from the pilot, most of them are negatives because its about teenagers. Just because its about teenagers doesn't mean its going to be a horrible show, there are some good shows which are mainly just about teenagers, like Twisted, Pretty Little liars, Teen Wolf etc.. and has good cast and characters. So the show is about a bunch of 17 year old teenage criminals who are expandable that are sent to earth to determine if it is safe for humans to live in, but the teens soon discovers they are not alone. I thought the pilot was actually interesting, there are good actors and characters the show and will get better in the upcoming episodes. So overall I think the series has some potential to be really good and its only the first episode, so I don't know why some people are so negative about the show, its about survival, with action, romance and corruption. Also the show is not for idiots, it shows how some normal teenagers will go about their freedom and some who will actually fight for survival and that will make the show interesting and its not only about The 100 criminals in earth its also about their families who are worried about their children's survival.
1.0~Didn't get past episode 3. sue_mac Sign in Permalink Really, this is made for teens. As an adult viewer the show looked promising in synopsis but by episode 3 I realised that most of the characters were in some sort of mortal danger or potential danger, and that I just didn't care. I didn't like or dislike any of them enough to care what happened to them. Science fiction set in a post-apocalyptic time that presents the survivors with the problem 'how to we tell from space if the earth is ready for human life again. I know, let's send all the teens that have committed crimes. Then it doesn't matter if they don't survive." Rather Trumpesque, but could have been handled with better characters and better dialogue. The entire thing is clunky and although the young actors seem to be giving it a red hot go, the older actors seem to be in it for the pay cheque. If you like good characterisation and don't really care about how good looking the characters are, don't waste your time.
10.0~My favorite show!! hamadovic-09859 Sign in Permalink This show is simply my favorite show from all the others i watch, it's unique, and changes iit's tone each season to give you something new and not a tedious repetition of previous seasons, if you compare the first season with the current fifth season, it's changed a lot, in a better way of course, some might not like the first season, but believe me just keep watchinh and it gets much, much better!
1.0~feminism propaganda plot vkulikov Sign in Permalink The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in women's writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's historical and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest. There has also been a close link between feminist literature and activism, with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.
3.0~Useless teen drama dressed up (badly) as scifi... Rob_Taylor Sign in Permalink Madness once wrote a song which had the lyric "You're an embarrassment.." in it and this is what I felt mostly whilst I waded through the first two episodes of this dreck. Embarrassment. Embarrassment that anybody can still watch stuff like this. The teens are awful, awful stereotypes of kids today but amped up to ridiculous levels. But, leaving aside the fact that this is horribly mislabeled as scifi, is the story, characters and setting, any good at all? In a word... no! The setting is nonsensical rubbish. Earth is destroyed by nuclear radiation and what is left of the human race lives on a conglomeration of orbiting space habitats. The last 4,000 people alive (supposedly, but you know it isn't true right from the start), crammed into a sealed environment. So, 100 years on from the disaster that destroyed Earth, exactly what are these people eating? 100 years without re-supply from Earth. No influx of food, water or oxygen. How, exactly, is this possible? I can answer that one easily. Clearly the new supplies appear regularly with the Avon lady, because every woman on the show has perfect make-up and eyebrows, so she must call at the station every week. Not only that, but they appear to have artificial gravity. The space station isn't spinning, yet everyone walks around normally? Then there are the utter stupidities that pass as rules in this society. Any crime is a capital crime, unless you are under age 18, when you are merely imprisoned for life. Anything else and you are spaced. Case in point... a doctor saves the life of the president and she uses too much blood in the operation to do so. Using too many resources...capital crime...and they are ready to space her. What utter stupidity is this?! Now, facing a life-support failure (everything else seems to work just fine) they send 100 teens from the pen, down to the surface of Earth to see if it is now habitable. 100, know-nothing, teens. Wouldn't a few, Oh, I don't know...scientists, or specialists, be better? You know, the sorts of people that won't simply say, to hell with it and have a party? But no, they send the cliché kids down and, predictably, they make out, and have a party and goof off and don't do anything productive. Oh God! It's so painful to watch! When the kids do finally do something productive, it is attempting a hike for twenty miles. Remember, these are kids that have been locked up in cells for years - no exercise - yet they are all fit as fiddles. What's more, despite having been in a sealed environment for their whole lives, they take to the wilderness as if they were born to it. One of them even has tracking skills, for God's sake! Utter nonsense. Clearly I'm not the target demographic for this show, but the nod towards adults, in the form of the station scenes, puzzles me. No one who isn't a teen could derive much entertainment from the ground-based sections, which are just intensely irritating for anyone with a brain-stem. So I have no idea what this mish-mash of teen drama and attempted gritty social commentary is meant to be, or who those latter sections are aimed at. But hey! What do I know, right? I'm just an old fart! All I do know is that the show is badly scripted and has a terribly badly written setting. Maybe the book makes more sense, but this show doesn't. One final thought... If you are going to make a teen drama (scifi or otherwise) maybe it would be a good idea to... I don't know... actually use teen actors for the main roles? The main stars are all in their twenties and the chief "bad teen" guy is actually thirty this year. Thirty! Scifi is all about suspension of disbelief, but there are limits for goodness' sake! SUMMARY: Makes Revolution look sensible. Poor script, acting and setting. Uses a supposed post-apocalyptic setting as a vehicle for what is actually a poor teen high-school drama. Someone saw Twilight and said "Hey! Can we make a scifi version of that?"
10.0~One of the best shows liwaak Sign in Permalink This show is one of the best shows because it's always a lot of action. A lot of great actors doing their job well. 10/10
8.0~First impressions can be deceiving. One of the best sci-fi, post apocalyptic series to ever grace our TV screens. angelakis Sign in Permalink Hi. If you are sceptical whether or not to watch this series like I was, read on. If you are seeing the overall low rating and the ratings of the 3rd season plummeting, don't be concerned. Two of the main cast had to be removed from the series because they had signed other contracts and the fans who didn't bother researching the reasons why, are down voting the series. If you watched the first episode and came away with the feeling that this is another immature, teen series, especially after the "We're back bitches!" part, keep watching. That teen feel and look is on purpose, believe me things get dark and serious pretty fast and those opening episodes make that more sense the more you watch. Oh, and Octavia goes on to become one of the best characters in the series. First impressions can be deceiving. With that being said just watch and enjoy one of the best sci-fi, post apocalyptic series to ever grace our TV screens. Info: The fictional language spoken was entirely created for the series.
4.0~Incredibly mediocre anarchist-36486 Sign in Permalink Well I had a friend convince me that this show was worth continuing to watch after I finished the first season and I really wish I hadn't listened. While the story does start to be come slightly less ridiculous in the second season it's still total pre-teen fluff. The premise is ripe with opportunity to explore interesting themes like the isolation of space, first contact with an indigenous culture, that District 9 did so well, or even what it means to be a people, a part of a society, something, anything really that's a little deeper than whats going on here. As it stands there's really nothing here for me, the characters are so idiotic and stereotypical they aren't relatable at all. I found myself just getting more and more frustrated with their stupid squabbles put in place just to fluff out the episodes and wishing that season two ended with everyone being executed. Maybe if you were 14 this would be an exciting sci-fi with some drama. But as it stands it lacks grit, depth, and a moving narrative. I would not recommend this show to anyone
6.0~It become 🤢 qupontie Sign in Permalink I start to upset They still betray each other and killing each other and simply forgive each other what is the hell? And earth still destroying and suddenly they found a way to come back!! Finally the best actors keep dieing in the showand I don't know why Clarck still alive even her way to act is the same and she become silly!
9.0~Underrated show but so good! csvillagracia Sign in Permalink I've never been hooked to a TV show not since "Lost". After i read some of the reviews, i gave it a shot. I was checking on what show to watch and find the plot of this show interesting. Good thing i gave this show a chance after watching few episodes, and i'll tell you this (as everybody is saying) -- it gets better and better after each episodes, starting with Season 1. While watching it, suddenly you'll realize that you're hooked and you ended up wanting more (literally 10 episodes a day is not enough). What's more interesting about this show is that the complexity of the characters and the story. It's a mix of action, drama, comedy at some part and it don't give a sh*t killing some characters! which make it more interesting. So, if you're reading this, i will highly suggest you to watch this show and you'll never regret it! BTW Season 4 is coming :)
7.0~keeps you watching kitten_x Sign in Permalink I was very hesitant when I started watching this, a lot of TV shows nowadays have held a promise of being really good and just plain not delivered. first of all, the premise of this show is very interesting. set in a future where humans haven't set foot on the earth for a hundred years and are living in a culmination of international space stations, I mean all things said and done that is a blooming awesome plot line. I won't say too much more for fear of spoilers, but let's just say that the plot gets better. the show cuts between the humans still left on the ark (the name they have given to the space stations that have been connected) and the 100 adolescents sent back to earth to see if it is survivable. it is very well done, with cutting between settings at very tense moments that will madden you, but in a good way. the acting, while not being Oscar material, is very good and believable. the cast seem to get very into their roles which in turn makes you believe in their characters. you're left rooting for some and hating others, some which you will change your mind on over the course for the series. both story lines, on the ground and in space, are very tense and captivating. I solidly watched the first series in one night as I could not stop watching. I really do recommend this show, do not think it is just another YA dystopian thriller, which seem to be pouring out of Hollywood lately with the hunger games kicking it off. this is a well written, well portrayed TV show that will leave you gutted when you realize series two is not out yet!
8.0~In my opinion, this is one of the best shows on TV right now alex-magnusson00 Sign in Permalink SPOILER WARNING! I have a lot to say about The 100. It's like a mix of all my favorite meals. The show has drama, action, many cool different environments and a whole bunch of great characters. I really love the story, from season 1 all up to season 3 (wich is not done yet). I also like how they really can show how a nuclear war can affect the earth and humanity. BUT ENOUGH SAID OF THAT. If you are going to watch this, you need to accept it for what it is. The 100 is, Sci-Fi, it's drama, it's action. all in one show. And YES, the main characters are a group of teenagers, but when you have watched it for a while you realize that the story is way more complex than that. Later on you get to know so many cool characters. If we're excluding Clarke for a moment, we have characters like Octavia, Raven, Abby, Bellamy and Kane. And of of course Lexa, who's the most badass of them all. And another thing about the characters. The show runners are not afraid to kill of major or recurring characters. AGAIN, SPOILER WARNING RIGHT NOW!. A few exampls are, Wells, Finn, and Lexa (wich was truly heartbreaking). Beut even though the deaths are really sad sometimes, the plot becomes really exciting and even compelling. And in some cases its not impossible that a dead character might return somehow. These are all the things that makes the show so freaking good despite what many people say. Many people see The 100 as some stupid high school teenage drama but I can assure you that it's not. It is mature and exciting and goes eventually pretty dark. But thats also why I like it so much. In my opinion it's one of the best shows on television right now and actually underrated.
1.0~an ultimate letdown bluepuppi Sign in Permalink The show decided to add a lesbian character (Lexa) in the second season to be paired with the main character(Clarke) to get better ratings. She was incredibly written and very complex and I fell in love with her instantly. Of course as I always do as a lesbian watching shows for representation I was afraid for her. LGBT always die and we never get happy endings. Before season 3 aired the writer himself leaked images from the shoot for the season 3 finale of Clarke and Lexa together. He did it on purpose to make the lesbian fans not leave because they thought Lexa would survive another season. Instead he killed her halfway through the 3rd season with the laziest most plot hole ridden death I've seen in ages. He then somehow thought he was exempt from being part of the "bury your gays trope" but he knew what he was doing. Lexa reappeared in the finale in a computer simulation (how they had pictures of her at the finale shoot) only for Clarke to have to let her go again. After Lexa's death the show is awful. It's completely filled with plot holes and things only done for "shock value". Just don't watch it and save yourself the trouble.
2.0~Lexa Deserved Better leahchuu Sign in Permalink It was good until 3x07 (as you've probably heard), where they unnecessarily killed off Commander Lexa in the WORST possible way and for the dumbest reason ever. I've never been more disappointed in a show and I feel that all the time and love I've put into it was completely for nothing. Execution was terrible and made no sense at all. Huge loss to the LGBT community (people such as myself) as well since Clarke and Lexa were such a huge pairing and major lesbian representation that we so rarely get to see in mainstream media. A shame to see that go to waste because of stupid writing and a developer only looking out for ratings. Unless they bring Heda back, I'm never watching again.
6.0~good topic for series but style could be so much better than this. nurullahkus Sign in Permalink i think first season is not bad as a scenario,they could improve it which are the characters introduced better at beginning of the series,scenarist is changing the event a little bit faster,i think the events should have continue slower and could be more detail in them.my point is totally 6-7 for first season.second season is the best one for me,again everything is changing fast but this is adapting the characters and they are making their role better,so it is really fluent and scenario is high quality,scenarist is making unexpected and impressive scenes in this season.my point is 9 for second.third season is starting well but few episodes later everything is changing unusual and this is really bad for the scenario and scenarist,there are so many different. as if everything is started again.and i think this goes on end of the fourth season,there are a few some good episode but main goal in the series is completely changing.third season is really bad as aim of series,fourth season is good but it is like rest of the third season.first and second is different aim and third and fourth is totally different aim.it could be better than this.
1.0~malus conspiracy koushiksarkarks Sign in Permalink Life is seen potty here. A person that committed major crimes still can be good guys is shown here.
10.0~This show surprised me with how great it became. nothingmusic42 Sign in Permalink I always tell people the same thing when i recommend this show: Don't judge it by the first few episode. It is a bit of a slow burn at the beginning, but if you aren't hooked by the end of the Charlotte arc, then it isn't for you. This show became one of the most brutal, blood-soaked shows on TV. There are no heroes, and even the best of the protagonists have had to kill innocents in order to survive. The first few episodes make it seem like it's going to be light-hearted, teen drama, then it pulls a swerve, and the body count shoots through the roof. Each of the 3 seasons have a different theme: innocence lost to the brutality of survival, body horror and how far will people go to protect their friends and family, and losing your free will in order to erase your pain. Finally, Marie Avgeropoulos (Octavia Blake) definitely has a future ahead of her as an action movie star if she chooses it. I highly recommend this show if you want solid story-telling backed up with creative and graphic violence. You can catch the previous seasons on Netflix, and have plenty of time to be ready for Season 4 on Feb 1, 2017.
7.0~It's a nice show gonzalezrstudio Sign in Permalink If you could get page the fact that only attractive people survived a nuclear war, and if you're willing to understand that not all Television shows abide by scientific law, and if you're looking for a way to get away from reality for a bit, then this is a nice show for you. It's a cool premise and has a lot of unexpected twists and turns. I love the main characters and how they interact with one another, and things are starting to get really interesting with the City of Light coming to view... I would have totally given this show a better review if it wasn't for a few things: 1. One this i love about watching TV shows is you can watch characters grow and develop and change - for better or worse. Aside from Bellamy becoming less of a jerk over time, you don't really see that in the 100. One person in particular is Octavia. She spent the majority of her life hiding under floor boards and she steps foot on the earth and is bold and loud and courageous... she develops crushes on everyone she sees and pursues even a man that kidnapped her. You'd think that she would be a bit more timid considering her upbringing. But hey, what can you expect, going into this you have to realize it's a drama on the CW. 2. The unnecessary and excessive love triangles are irritating. Especially the lesbian scene which seemed to only be for shock factor because it was totally out of no where. Honestly if they continue with the love drama i might not continue watching. I love shows like this because it allows me to leave real life for a bit and enter into a fictional land. I don't want my fictional land to have unnecessary drama lol.
3.0~It had such promise! circusclaws Sign in Permalink So the idea behind this show was brilliant, ex-con kids sent to earth to see if life was sustainable after a nuclear war. Great, huh? The problems are with the writers. Instead of developing the plot toward survival and realistic dystopian life, they manage to turn yet another CW teen-angst fest. There are 100 of you left, you don't know if the rest of society will come join you....do you kill more of yourself? Or do you value life as there are so few of the human race left? Apparently you just kill yourselves. (mild spoiler) A main character dies. The series skips finding the body, skips anything to do with the aftermath apart from finding the killer - who the main character seems to forgive without a problem. Way to make what should have been a main plot character completely trivial. Despite only having killed one animal by epo 4 they are building a shelter in the middle of nowhere without any food source, yet none of them appear to be hungry or suffering for it. Overall, the show could have been fantastic if someone had taken a little more time over the premise instead of the teenage drama.
4.0~Good premise - bad execution marie-a1789 Sign in Permalink This show is a good idea on paper, but the whole teen drama makes it really annoying to watch.
10.0~Perfect iinaif-70233 Sign in Permalink I liked the steadiness of the writing. I'm a GoT fan, so I noticed the effect of bad writing in its final season, but the 100 has that steadiness of writing and that shocking twist at every season finale. Liked it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
1.0~Who's crazy here? jeftinetabletezapotenciju Sign in Permalink This will be the most stupid, most inconsistent and most fussy TV product ever. How old are the writers of this horror? And for whom do they think they are creating? 8 year olds, 15 year olds? The amount of nonsense and fully constructed and violently forced twists is so huge that it is still all a little unreal to me. I mean, really? At one point, the characters are incomprehensible good and noble, a minute later, they are the worst of mankind. And so it goes round and round. Anything goes. Just to fill the required time. I do not intend to dissect the show and allocate certain nonsense, who is interested, can randomly select any episode and will immediately understand what I'm saying. Just a fiew examples. Octavia, one of hundred of teenagers from the space station, renounces her people and proclaims herself "graunder". After less than two weeks. OK. Then, in a situation where newcomers from the sky are in danger of Grounders retaliation , she angrily leaves the main protagonist, Clarck, accusing her of selling "their people" (crew from the space station). A minute later, she calls one of the Graunder's Leaders to go along with her to fight those same people from the sky she was so vorry about minute before to avenge the death of the murdered "grounders". Somewhere along the way, her brother does not allow the mob to lynch a girl guilty of murder. She is too young and he is that goody goody. He will protect her no metter what. A couple of sequels later, he participates in the massacre of 300 innocent graunders without any conscience or moral dilemmas. Realy? Just because it was needed for plot advancement. Who's crazy here? Shut off this travesty of a program, please.
1.0~Don't lose your time with this TV show EddyCurrant Sign in Permalink How this series can be so bad? I'm baffled it gets as of today a 7,8 score. Maybe I could understand it if it's target audience was 10 to 12 year olds... but not even then really. Bear in mind I have only been able to complete episode one, and with a lot of effort that's been as multiple times I've felt like stop watching it for good. There are many wrongs here and I'm not going to detail everything. See for yourself (although there are more than 100.000 viewers rating this over 5 points and 31.8% voters giving it 10 points, so this review is at a minority here). Pace... where is pace? suspense? development of story and characters? We are just abruptly spoon feed key events, characters and the whole of the script since the very beginning. I'm not going to delve into more details... it's too late to be up writing! but I can't help to mention that music and its use at hectic moments was nauseating at best... TV commercial level or worst. On the whole it's a shame, I wish they would've make something else out of this idea/story.
8.0~give it a chance ! starts off really slow isaac-ward-37-757643 Sign in Permalink Over all its a good show you just gotta get past all their attempts to appeal to teenage girl by putting in all the pointless romance and drama stuff. If you can do that and stick with it for the first half of the season its actually pretty addictive ! Can't wait for the next season! .... Don't have anything else to say but they make you write a minimum of 10 lines to post a review on this web site :\ what's up with that? A good review should be short and straight to the point we don't need all the extra info just the opinion ! I think I've done 10 lines now though so ya basically its a good show you just gotta focus more on the premise of the show and less on the painful drama that makes it a vampire short of twilight at times
4.0~A Disgrace to the Sci-Fi Genre beatlesrock69 Sign in Permalink THIS FIRST PART HAS NO SPOILERS: The show suffers from one of the largest number of scientific inaccuracies and plot holes that I've ever seen. It's almost like they went out of their way to make the entire thing implausible. It would be bad on its own, but sci-fi more than anything has to try and give sound explanations for its premises. I'll go into detail about this later. Moving on, the characters are flat and boring. There isn't the slightest hint of character development throughout the show. None of the life changing events the teens go through seem to alter their personality or relationship in the slightest. The show seems to think that sprinkling the occasional sex scene and teen romance here and there compensates for good dialogue and introspection. The directing is poor at best, but that's quite frequent in mid-range sci-fis so I won't penalize it too much. Suffice it to say it's uninventive, repeating the same exact shots fifty times: hand-held camera, suspenseful music and bad acting. The whole thing feels like a bad version of a Lost and Walking Dead mashup, with poorly characterized "outsiders" in the form of grounders and a "plot twist of the week" narration format. Also, what's with this show's complete inability to kill its characters off? Without going into details, time and again major characters come close to death, some times all logic would point to their lack of survival, and yet the show feels compelled to get them to miraculously come back from the shadows. It's childish and condescending to a grown audience, death is a part of life, and thus a part of any show that mirrors it. The 100 is just a terrible teen romance show cloaked in a sci-fi skin. Then again, this is the network that brought us such gems as The Vampire Diaries, 90210 and Supergirl, what did I expect. SPOILERS: Now on to naming some of the most frustrating plot holes, inaccuracies and straight up nonsense in the show: 1) Chancellor Jaha lands on Earth from space in a missile. Yes, a missile. He somehow finds space to crawl inside it, and the missile not only doesn't explode upon impact, or while burning through the atmosphere, but is so unscathed that Jaha is unharmed when he "lands". What?! 2) After the nuclear disaster the world's space stations assemble together like a transformer? That's not how engineering works. 3) Why would air run out on the ark? The show never even bothers explaining how its ENTIRE premise takes place. Surviving in space for that long meant air wasn't finite to begin with, but produced through onboard flora, as the show hints at for literally 3 seconds in one of its episodes, so why is it running out? 4) There's a bridge that connects the grounders' camp to the 100's. Apparently in a forest, the only link between two patches of land probably a few kilometers away, is a bridge. Also, Jasper had no problem getting to the base of the bridge and back up, why couldn't the grounders? 5) Why did the Exodus ship carrying Diana Sydney explode? Once again the show completely glances over incredibly important plot points. This is an event that caused the entire ark to be doomed and we don't know WHY Sydney organized the coup and we don't know how her fate ended, we know NOTHING. 6) OK so apparently the Ark's people can survive on Earth because radiation levels from the sun in space are even higher than those of a post-nuclear war Earth. What a load of drivel. FIRST, If that were the case then everyone on the Ark would have died just like on the Earth. SECOND, that's not the case. Being a few thousand kilometers from the Earth's surface doesn't in ANY way increase radiation coming from a sun that's thousands of millions of kilometers away. If it did, we wouldn't send astronauts to the international space station for months at a time. 7) An underground bunker wouldn't stop radiation, what kind of nonsense science is that? Also, the people at Mount Weather use hazmat suits and gas masks to shield themselves from NUCLEAR RADIATION?! I mean, come on. Oh and for some reason they think dialysis will cure "contaminated" individuals of radiation. Radiation doesn't just affect the blood, the entire body is contaminated, dialysis won't do anything, even IF you could remove radiation from the blood. 8) At some point in season 1 some of the 100 hide in a cave to avoid radiation fog, because as we all know radiation can't enter open crevices... I could go on forever, this show has more nonsense than substance. Anyway, don't watch this overrated drivel.
8.0~Good serie, good idea but... pavelyasko Sign in Permalink The idea is great, all the actors are great except Marie Avgeropoulos's act and all the dramas around her.. She exaggerates with everything she does, every movement of her, makes no sense in her actions, too much drama as I said before...
10.0~Them feels be like. Vanshika Sign in Permalink Well when I started watching this show, I was watching it because there was nothing else left on Netflix for me to watch. I expected to be bored out of my mind but dAYUM THIS WAS AMAZING. I can't start to explain how much this story means to me. This is a very inspirational story not because its someone's life story but rather in a way that shows you how people can change from who you thought they were to a person you never knew. It shows how desperate time calls for desperate measures and basically to be careful what you choose. John Green wrote a quote in his book, the fault in our stars - "Grief does not change you, it reveals you." This story/show has lived up to that quotation from the very beginning, we see how griefs reveals people for either revenge or peace. This show is hands down one of the best sci-fi shows I have seen.
5.0~Decent-ish jvirtala1984 Sign in Permalink I wanted to like it, the idea of the show was captivating. After 10mins, I was ready to abandon it. I can almost immediately sense when show is bad. This was typical Class C teenager drama. I found myself fast forwarding through the worst drama scenes. I wanted to see the twist. Second and third episode were painful, but I had holiday so I kept watching. Surprisingly, it got better. Not great but better. There was actually more to the show than illogical teenagers making choices that I can predict miles away. By second season I had almost forgot that I hated the show. I was still annoyed by Clarke, who is 12 years old princess making her own mind despite what anyone say. She wants, she will have, despite others she will have it her way. We viewers are suppose to like her, because she is young-strong-woman. Please! She sacrifices who ever she wants for her own believe, like couple of hundred people in the village. In this show they might kill 10 people, and forgive it. But damn if its one that matters to couple of main characters, then "we cannot kill our own". Its show for teenagers mainly. For adults (and above average demanding you viewers) its only watchable if all the other options have been drained. Pro: Great idea - Few good actors - Season two had promising twists in plot Cons: Cliché teenager actors - Predictable plot - Highly illogical decisions. They have been weeks and weeks on ground but they have only make cheap fence than I could tear down with my bare hands. How about cutting the trees for 500m radius to improve visibility, dig a deep moat around the camp, enforce then fence with thick wood, etc. - Pretty much everything that can be done wrong to destroy goodish idea and decentish acting. I've seen 8 episodes of season 3 and this is were "my fight ends". Its stupid, I cannot ignore it. I actually like Pyke more than I like Marcus. I would just destroy the barbarians with modern weapons and induce them to attack my camp. I would show what modern mine field and fully automated weapons will do to blades and horses; 20 automatic rifle + moat + mine field + re-enforced fence would destroy couple of thousand animals running without strategy, with ease. Who in the earth would even want to make peace with the grounders, they are animals.
10.0~Much better than Expected, S4 losing its way. ElessarAndurilS Sign in Permalink "The 100" TV series struck me as a show that was going to retell a story that has been told in so many ways. Post apocalyptic world stories have been told since we, as a race, became capable of wiping out life on the planet. I'm 7 episodes into the second season on Netflix and have found it to date to be grounded on some common theme's in such stories, but some things are common to such a story. While being "only" 100 years in the future it is hard to believe that the survivors would already have lost all knowledge of history as the "grounders" appear to have. Granted they are the survivors of a nuclear holocaust and the result of the survival of the fittest, but that would imply they are both strong and smart not just brutal. However I love the twist of adding that those that survived outside of a "pod" (Mount Weather) mutated (both by being in space where solar radiation exposure is high) and those on the ground evolved genetically so that like many impurities, radiation was filtered out by the body's own natural filtering system. However the survivors of those that blew up the earth naturally feel they are the "civilized" survivors of the human race and the rightful heirs to the world even though they didn't survive by natural selection but by technology that the new world would be better off without (in large part). I also love how quickly the disposable population of the arc, child criminals were thrown to the earth in an act of desperation and yet survived (albeit akin to the lord of the flies a bit) until the "grown ups" fall to the earth in an act of desperation to avoid inevitable death on the ARC as it is destroyed by the traitors trying to steal one of the landing pods leaving all else behind to die. Definitely got what they deserved when Mount Weather jammed their controls leaving them plunging to their deaths, but it all has just played out at a quick pace in an interesting manner with redemption for initial villains and the good turning to villains in acts of despair. Now the young adults are showing the signs of having the whit's to survive the real enemy vs. the obvious. By the end of season 2, Clarke has evolved into the leader not by choice by by being chosen. When followed, and even your enemies treat you as the leader you must lead. So far they have done a great job with an old plot introducing some minor but important (genetic adoption to the post nuclear environment for example) causing the story to turn on a dime making the second half of season 2 incredibly intense. Clarke basically gets the entire unified clans fighting for her only to be duped by their leader by teaching her to much. I'm ready for season 3 as they have taken what was an 9 to a 10+ by growing it to a very unexpected and dark place. I can't believe the territory the writers have covered in two seasons, I am amazed, please, and thrilled for more. 26 episodes in and I can't believe how far the story has gone. I have to laugh when I feared it was a teen drama, far from it. The 100 has tread where no other show has, faster than I have seen a show do it outside of Breaking Bad. I have me a new favorite show, I hope S3 keeps it going as it is incredible!!! After Season 4, I'm now concerned for the show. The fast pace of seasons 1-3 has been lost and the scope gotten to a point where all points lead to (if it happens) a season 5 drifting even farther from what made The 100 great in S1-S3.
10.0~The 100 is awesome Logan14680 Sign in Permalink I think The 100 is a great show. There are great characters and plots. I like every season.
6.0~A very interesting show haileyapark Sign in Permalink I was very surprised by this show, it is much better then I expected. Make no mistake this is a CW show, and I hope you know what I mean by that. But that being said, it is still a great and interesting watch. I don't want to go to much into anything, but the episodes so far are solid and this show could run for a very long time. The characters are very real, and the female lead is a teenage girl who isn't afraid to stand up for what she believes in. The characters don't so much revolve around good and evil, but a grey area. Which makes it interesting, the question they all face is how far would you go to survive? It's hard to see a lot of the teenagers face this alone, and hard to see the adults try to save the human race.
10.0~One of the best... HIGHLY RECOMMEND ajcareyfilms Sign in Permalink Okay, let's be honest. Sure, the show has a rocky start and seems to be one of those cliché teen dramas. Even I can admit that. It'll feel cringey in the beginning, and it's understandable that some might not have the patience for that, but for those of you who do, I ABSOLUTELY, 100 percent, encourage you to stick with the show and watch it. The show was trying to find its footing in the beginning like many other shows, and now that it has, I can honestly say that it's my favorite show on television. The 100 challenges the characters and viewers, and is one of the most politically immersed shows I've ever seen. Sure, it's sci-fi set in the post-apocalyptic world of Kass Morgan (author of the books), and people may deem it unrealistic, but that's what a lot of sic-fi is. These kids are trapped in a world on their own and have to accommodate to environments that they only understood behind a glass cage and never experienced for themselves. Information and learning only went so far. As you get into season 2 and beyond, you'll understand how politics plays an important role in the show, and that the CW has done a fantastic job of creating these characters and developing them into the people they are. I'd love to talk more about this show, but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, so you'll just have to watch and see it for yourselves.
9.0~Half Sci-Fi half Mad Max. shaolinmasterkev Sign in Permalink Half Sci-Fi half Mad Max. This show is good, quality of episodes can vary. Gets better as the seasons progress! From season to season the characters alliances seem to change for no reason, just so the writes can have new drama.
10.0~Best sci-fi series ever made migsnnn Sign in Permalink I signed up to IMDb site only to write a good review about The 100. Because it made me sad then I saw that It's popularity are dropped. I'm not a movie fan and not an expert. I just believe that people who created the show it's very talented, hard-working, and what they've done (and I hope will be doing) happens only once in a life time. Even though first series it is not very impressive (I stopped watching show after first episode, because I thought It is just another cheap show who wants to become Something), it is getting better and better episode after episode. And now, then season 3 ended I'm thinking that this is the best apocalyptic type series ever made and I consider myself a little bit addicted to this fantasy (though very realistic and quite likely to happened some day). Great things about this show: There is no stupid teenage love stories. No sexual bullshit. Love stories are real. People die. People suffer. The story-line of the show is very intense, it makes you feel unsafe, and teaches you that it's an illusion that in our reality we feel so safe, it brings you thoughts that if something happens ( and it could happened in any time), you will have to survive only, and you won't recognize yourself then, you'll do things that you never knew you could, or you always said to your friends in front of table full of food and drinks that you NEVER EVER DO that kind of things. What if you will do? What if your sister would be tortured? What if you had to kill someone to survive? And These things makes THE 100 so good. Because even though it is sci-fi it plants thoughts in your head, that it could be, that you live in a comfort surrounded environment and you do not know ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF. Thanks for those who are reading. I wish you the best. And if by any magical coincidence someone from the 100 team reads this, I just want to say: Stay on this track, don't put bigger boobs on girls, don't do stupid sexual bullshit. Keep it real, keep it perfect. Thank you for making my life more awesome by bringing me (and all who watches), into another reality.
5.0~Mediocre brimsurfer Sign in Permalink The show started off on the right foot, it was really good. I got hooked on it but then it started going down hill and the plot, the story direction and the decisions made by characters became unrealistic. Many key characters appear to be hypocritical in their actions as the show progress. Also one thing that bothers me is that the show has females in most of the relevant roles and power positions. One may think that the show has some kind of feminist agenda although I don't know if its the case or not. But it does seem that an explicit effort is made to put women in power positions in this show. Men are given rather irrelevant roles and this adds to the unrealistic-ness of the show. Also acting is not very good, actually its horrible in some scenes. I am giving this show 5 out of 10, the show could have done a lot better with a more realistic approach, better acting and better balance of power between genders.
10.0~absolutely love this show - no spoiler please read. maceachern28 Sign in Permalink I seen so many bad reviews on this show so I made an account to express my thoughts. As soon as the first episode ended I had to keep watching. Just finished the first season and i am praying there will be more. The idea of this show is amazing especially due to the heating of nuclear and chemical warfare lately. I would love a season 2 and see this show carry on. If the producers of The 100 are reading this please make season 2 and carry on or at least conclude the story. I want to learn more about the grounders, the space station, the toxic cloud, the state of earth before they went to orbit, what happens with relationships and so on. There is many different ways this story can go. Please continue this show, and most of all don't be afraid to be creative and make this show "The 100" a series to remember. Make the haters bite their tongue! 10/10
7.0~Give it a chance...and you'll find it has a number of redeeming qualities. DarkWandererAU Sign in Permalink If what you prize most is edge-of-your-seat suspense and captivating character development...then why the hell are you still reading my rubbish review? YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING THE 100! From the start of the first episode you're pretty much gripping your seat, even though you haven't had time to form a connection with the characters yet. As other reviews have said, the first couple of episodes are the hardest, but its the characters that makes us not want to switch it off. Each episode brings a new challenge that the main characters have to over-come, which makes each episode as epic as the last. I swear, if my life was as eventful as those of the characters in this show...I'd probably just end it all now to save myself from dying slowly of stress. With each new challenge comes decisions that need to be made, which ultimately affects a characters standing within the group. Which is even more gut-wrenching in the first few episodes when you're unsure about each character. Basically, the first few episodes you'll be playing "pin the alignment on the character". But once you see their true colours, you'll be all "of course he/she is that way, how did I not see it". I could go on...AND ON, about all the good points of the story line and reveal how mind-blowingly awesome it is. But that would be telling. But I will give you a tiny taste into the characters. Clarke: Blonde, blue eyed with a spectacular set of...*clears throat*, sorry where was I? Clarke is your protagonist, it is through her (mostly) that we learn what the F is going on. I would have to say one of my favourite heroines to date. A lot of strong, female leads these days just lay it on too thick. But I have to say, I kind of like Clarke. She has a good balance of brains and balls. She leaves space as a child and arrives on earth as an adult...and we see this progress more & more. She doesn't forgive her own weaknesses lightly, but is quick to forgives others for theirs. She puts the safety of her people above all else, sometimes stupidly so. You will, of course, see her pay for some of those decisions. Bellamy: This guy...this guy had me hating him for almost the first half of the first season. Now he is pretty much my favourite character. He is the self-imposed leader of the group (well, co-leader with Clarke pretty much). The thing you need to know about most of the teenagers that were sent to earth, is that their lives have always pretty much sucked (with the exception of Clarke). Bellamy got the worst end of the deal. His duty to his sister, no matter how happy he is to perform it, is a burden he carries. As you will find out, he feels responsible for his sister more than he should and will do anything to keep her safe. He is a strong, sometimes ruthless leader, and those tough decisions are usually made with the well-being of his sister close at heart. A true ultimate bad-a**. Kane: One of my favourite actors from Lost plays this character, and he does a fine job (Desmond, in case any of you are familiar, minus the Scottish accent). You are always so back and forth with this guy. Is he good or bad? Do I like him or do I hate him? If I met him, would I give him a hug or put my fist up his balls? His "villainous" actions really grind your gears. But there are moments with this guy that almost make you bloody weep! He is definitely not beyond redemption, its just whether he WANTS to get there or not. He hides his caring for any individual under a cold, corporate exterior. But when something truly matters, his human side comes out and totally takes you by surprise. Chancellor Jaha: Like Kane, Jaha is middle-aged but is also the leader (Chancellor) of the Ark (the name of the space station everyone lives on, in case you weren't keeping up to date). The first few episodes show the Chancellor as this oppressive figure, the dominant government head who will stop at nothing for "the greater good", even if it is at the expense of innocent lives. I won't lie...his balls had a place for my fist as well after the first few episodes. But once again, we see massive character development, and he is one of a few characters to have a moment of clarity and see the "error of their ways". I ended up liking him, and there is no doubt he is a good man. He has just made some poor decisions. OK, wrapping it up! Things that make me want to watch this show. No character is fully good or fully bad, definitely keeps things interesting. This show is like Lost, in a sense that a bunch of people are stranded in a strange place and have to compete with god knows what. Mystery lurks around all corners, and its not in a lame way either! Its actually fully captivating. You know how when you are watching Game of Thrones, then suddenly out of no where something really violent and shocking will just happen? Same thing in The 100, and I thought the only show that could shock me like that was Game of Thrones...boy, was I wrong! Finally...THE CHARACTERS! Seriously, despite the loop holes and plot holes...this show really is all about the character development. Even the more minor characters are interesting in their own right. So when you're not busy digging your finger nails into the side of your arm chair, just sit back and enjoy the chemistry and development between the characters. The 100 truly makes for an excellent TV experience.
10.0~Great first season philip-paine1 Sign in Permalink On the whole a great series. The love triangles, plot holes, and ability of the characters to keep up model like appearances in the woods, only slightly detract from what is a surprisingly well written and acted series. If there is any show on TV right now that carries the torch BSG left it is the 100. The characters face real moral dilemmas, especially those left on the Ark. Many of the characters have developed substantially over the course of the first season. I have been impressed with the depth that the writers and actors have brought to characters like Kane. Overall, if you are a sci-fi fan, this a great show and well worth a watch. In my opinion, it is currently the best sci-fi on television hands down.
10.0~Amazing and love the actors. kusjuh_lisa_xxx Sign in Permalink I did watch the 100 one time earlier and I stopped at season 1 because it got bit bored but you just have to go trough Because of all the seasons has a perfect story of telling to make a decision when there really is not good decision at all. Some Characters are just going trough a lot and still keep fighting.
8.0~This show is going places. cmegala Sign in Permalink If you're reading some of the other negative reviews, don't. They have no place anywhere near this show. Not going to lie, I thought that 'The 100' was a dead end show where they would just end up dragging things out, but somehow they surprised me. So far I'm understating. If you've seen season 1, then you'll understand when I say its pretty 'meh' but season 2 is an absolute killer and if you watch on, you'll have more mind blowing, heart-rate increasing, edge of your seat moments than you can count. Somehow they took the concept of unpredictable and reshaped it to give us the enigma that is 'The 100'. Every episode could be a movie in itself with it's plot twists and immense character development. What seemed like a dead end show has now blossomed into an intricate maze of fine showmanship. I still don't know how long this show is going to manage to keep up the intensity or how many seasons it will undertake, but at this point I'm not too worried because they've managed to prove me wrong so far. If you have any doubt that 'The 100' is a poorly executed show, give it a chance and maybe you'll like it. Sometimes I just have to hold my head and wonder how the hell they're going to get out of that one.
9.0~Can't believe this on CW! Very Dark elsidaliaj Sign in Permalink TLDR: JUST WATCH IT. Season 6 is slower but still unique. I can't believe this is on the CW, can't imagine how much better it would of been on something like HBO. The show devolves into pure madness as the seasons continue on, to Mad Max levels. Yes it does start off as teenage twilight drama but then it goes into WTF how did we end up here, how is this much brutality even allowed on a public channel?? Sci-fi is the backdrop it is a moralistic drama type of show like the walking dead, but much much better. If you thought the moral choices on the walking dead were anything this turns it up to 100%. It's also not pure sci fi in space, it's also the doomsday apocalypse, with mad max and the hunger game thrown in! Plus some of the most messed up things you'll see in television in a while. Each season just gets better and better, something 95% of shows can't pull off. Characters die at a brutal pace like the game of thrones, and that is only episode 3 of season 1 which some said were very slow. Now let me tell you why it's a 10 in my book besides it's shortcomings of not so great dialogues and questionable acting at times. There a few gems where you are like woah that was pretty good. The reason why it's so good, and kudos to the staff is the sheer amount of material per episode, each episode literally feels like a season within itself. The only other show That had this kind of pacing action was UKs Utopia. Even Westworld season 2 was a snorefest. If you're tired of the walking dead's or other shows dragging along a plot point for a whole season or 2, this show is for you! An example is season 5 episode 1, there is a mysterious spaceship in the scene every other show would of made you find out the mystery after dragging it out for a whole season, here you find out the next episode and things get rolling. Also the sheer unreliability of the plot is great too. I was recently watching an episode and I expected something to happen maybe because of say season 2, and all of a sudden the complete opposite happened. Expected outcomes are literally a 50/50 coin flip. Most other shows I'll jump on my phone and multitask zone out a bit this one I can't everything is interesting. And the universe keeps on expanding I could see the plot going in so many different directions. It's either pure genius to adopt this show or sheer luck given the unlimited possibilities, as opposed to Zombie apocalypse simulator with different backdrops of other shows. Don't pay attention to the scientific realist NASA scientists who supposedly watch realistic FICTION all the time, get it? Haha
10.0~"Addictive" venter-c-d17 Sign in Permalink This series may not interest everyone, but for those who love a good Fantasy/Sci-Fi, with a little Romance, and a lot of Action and Drama, then this is the one for you!! It starts out a little slow in the first few episodes when they still on the "Ark" and "when the 100 first land" but once it gets going and they start meeting the dangers that face them on earth, you can't stop watching as it pulls you deeper into their world. It had me on the edge of my seat at times and with the second season leaving you not knowing what next is going to happen with so many twists and turns, it makes you want more after each episode. The story line is very well written and draws you into the teen's difficulties as they try to survive and defend themselves while trying to be better than those before them. The acting complements it really well and furthermore the cast has been brilliantly put together to suit and fit every role in this series. With the third season around the corner and promise of a lot more twists and turns, and more action packed episodes to make you beg for more!
6.0~Not so great caprica20 Sign in Permalink I watched first episode. From trailer it seemed to be interesting show, but expectations did not came true. Episode without flair, surprises, or any significant emotions. Behaviour of the characters completely idiotic, but you can justify this by age of the characters. It just hard to watch. Action focus on two places, on earth and on cosmic station, where I must say things looks much better and more interesting. In this two places we have groups of people with different point of how to do things. IMO show could be much better if they would send adults instead teenagers and show us intelligent show with drama and mystery. Choosing teenagers acting like 12 y.o it's just hard to watch, you get angry watching their actions. They don't do what they should do, don't think whatsoever, no responsibilities etc. I don't see how you can drain satisfaction by watching something like this. Fortunately we have two characters which behave reasonable (for the show standards) I think we won't get any mystery, there is nothing pointing this element would be added in the show. Besides that, The 100 is pretty. Good effects, cool views, like landscapes and 27 y.o Marie Avgeropoulos playing girl with the name of the low budget car model, Octavia, showing her charms in first episode. For time being I staying with the show, it was only pilot. For sure is better than Helix(at least for me.) Unfortunately I'm afraid that The 100 will be a dud after all. But you can give it a chance. It's not like we have headache from amount of SF shows on the market.
8.0~A series of unfortunate events hielkevansplunder-09897 Sign in Permalink This is one of the better series I have watched in a while. The story line is thrilling and sometimes it even got me carried away. Like other people say, you just have to except the ludicrous/unrealistic events that happen in the series. Just a few things that are still bothering me after watching the first 3 seasons. 1. Humans that lived their whole live at zero-G have bones as strong as chalk, going back to earth with these bones would be painful/unbearable for them. 2. The fact that the grounders have their own language, but also seem to speak proper English. Also it sounds really dumb and painful to the ears (especially the catchy phrases like ''jus drein jus draun'') 3. The characters on this show can't speak a dialogue without saying ''I did it for my people'' annoying as .... 4. In every situation in which they have limited time before the enemy comes or whatever, they start heart to heart conversations in the heat of that moment. Although this made the particular scene more exciting (watched a few of those scenes on the tip of the chair), it is also completely unnecessary. You're just keep asking yourself, why oh why is this happening.. I really enjoyed the series so far. Season 2 is the best one in my opinion. I hope the makers can keep up the level in season 4.
10.0~This TV is just magic! luu-05999 Sign in Permalink When I started watching The 100, I though it was OK, BUT, as I kept watching, I got more and more into it. The TV show contains all the aspects of the big TV shows from the 2000's. At the middle of the first season they combined zombies, the end of the world and human race extinction all together. It is done beautifully! They mixed the human nature with the futuristic technologies, fears and mistakes that we have done throughout history. The first thought that crossed my mind was at the end of season 1 "this is the new LOST TV show!" I couldn't stop seeing scenes and situation that were presented in Lost. Another aspect to point out is the performance of the actors in it, they progressively got better at interpreting their roles and gave more value to the entire TV show. I think the season 2 is one of the best season of the whole year 2015. They took the story to a new level and my mind exploded with the excitement, intrigue, and the love I get from pure science fiction. I hope they will continue this TV show for long, it is the new boom of the 2010 generation TV shows <3
1.0~Failing after 1 minute alexanderb04 Sign in Permalink This series totally fail almost immediately. The idea that the human race would only have a vague knowledge about planet Earth's status after orbiting the Earth for 97 years is so ridiculous near to insanity. What about probes be sent to Earth? No, let us send 100 juveniles. The knowledge about radioactive levels, wild life and so on would of course be known to the humans before they start to send people to Earth. And especially juvenile people. :-) And in our times with so many successful missions to Mars with probes it is beyond understanding how the writers thinking here. A tip to the writer's of this series. Get a consultant from NASA next time.
10.0~extraordinary haider1253 Sign in Permalink I think it's the best science fiction in the history of the television TV shows because there is no boredom, always juxtaposing and giving a lot of enthusiasm, and full of action-packed scenes I think the series is integrated in all respects
5.0~Scifi brainwash. davidcevans Sign in Permalink I started off watching The 100 and was glued until the third series. Too much disappointment in the story line. Its like the writers have gone out of their way to emphasize the hardship. Makes me wonder: the story line seems to parallel the historic Jewish struggle and the Zionist agenda. Expelled from their home land into a life of exile, the struggle of recreating the homeland, the acceptance of the thirteenth tribe, The mountain men. Watching this will probably help you understand the war in Syria. I started off watching The 100 and was glued until the third series. Too much disappointment in the story line.

10.0~Amazing alessatziolis Sign in Permalink Literally one of my all time favourite tv-shows, the characters have amazing developments over the seasons and it never gets boring. A true must watch for everyone who loves some good futuristic series :)
4.0~So disappointing... tamkidd67 Sign in Permalink Basic premise isn't that bad, but 100 perfect teens trying to outdo each other with terrible overacting doesn't really work well. What are the chances of having so many perfect kids of that age in the brig at the same time anyway? Not to mention the ultra stupidity of all the characters. The same people continue to make the same mistakes over and over, and despite none of the 100 ever being on Earth, they all adapt effortlessly. Also seem to be no physical effects from growing up on a space station. Come on. Where is the food coming from? They picked some berries in one episode! Lucky they were safe to eat, eh? Time to put this show to bed!
10.0~Season 5 is UNREAL tori_ludwig Sign in Permalink I need them to finish production on season 6 already!!
1.0~Season 1 and 2 decent. Season 3 is horrible sjensenstrad Sign in Permalink This TV show was a 6 in Season 1 and 2, but season 3 is just horrible it is going no where. Trust the sky people, kill the sky people, trust the sky people, kill the sky people. And in the other camp, trust the grounders, kill the grounders, trust the grounders, kill the grounders. It is very boring and a waste of time. I have also lost interest in the story line of "City of the light" a long time ago, and now I have lost faith in that the story writers a able to pull that one off also. Not much going on in this TV show, the days of our live is a better scifi show at this point UPdate; It has turn even worse. Only stupid characters who is doing stupid thing all the time. And the show isn't moving forward, they still blame clarke for something she did long time ago, and the guy which girlfriend got killed then is still whining about it. And that Bellamy can just kill 300 grounders and no one cares to mention that. Someone wrote "best thing since Battlestar Galactica" guess you don't have access to much TV shows honey.
6.0~Not bad but too many holes kk-bohlender Sign in Permalink Well sure, it's one of those teenage apocalyptic dramas that have been trending recently. But at least story wise they had somewhat of an excuse as to why these young adults are having more problems than the average puberty. And to be fair, they didn't kill off the adults and not all of them are completely evil. But it is still very cliché to make a teenage audience watch a show by telling them the parents are the evil guys. Otherwise I'd say the dialogs are a bit on the predictable side and it always amazes me how everyone manages to have some pretty extravagant hair styles ,clothes, and sometimes even make up. It's also hard not to facepalm your brains out from some of their Bull**** scientific explanations. Or the fact that within a hundred years there appear to have developed a bunch of new societies on the planet with different languages and traditions and S*** Still, i must admit i like watching the show. A few characters and plot twists actually kept me focused on the screen and the scenery is just drop dead gorgeous. What can I say I'm a sucker for strong female protagonists and anything involving starting a civilization from scratch. Also Lesbian bonus! So to everyone thinking about starting to watch the series: If you are looking for some deep, meaningful story to get you all excited, you should probably look elsewhere. But it's a fast-moving show with easy on the eyes, decent actors.
9.0~This show is worth every second of your time. masdestroyer Sign in Permalink I have never felt the need to leave an in depth review for anything I've seen before but this show is more than worthy for my first review and for your time as a viewer. I'm writing this review just after I've watched the Season 5 finale. I didn't want to write a review just for Season 5 as I think the show has continually done many things I'm about to talk about throughout its 5 seasons and continues to grow and evolve in fantastic and engaging ways. In this first paragraph however I want to highlight that at the time of this review Season 5 has been some of the best TV I've ever witnessed (and I watch a lot of TV). Something that is especially apparent in Season 5 more so than almost any other show I've ever seen - is that it has absolutely ZERO filler and this means that every episode is an absolute thrill ride and your excitement and anticipation waiting a week for each episode is always payed off. I don't think I've seen a show with zero filler yet still be able to fit all of the things you expect like building good character development and storylines etc. The show has surpassed a huge hurdle this season and I think many writers, directors and the like could learn from and that I hope this lightning in a bottle continues into the following seasons. Onto the show in general; Without giving too much away plot wise for any of the seasons, The show begins years after a nuclear holocaust wipes out the earth and the remains of the human race are stuck in space on a space station named the Ark. The show follows 100 delinquent kids who for various reasons get sent down to the earth to basically check if its inhabitable. The show builds and evolves and just keeps getting better and better as it goes on so I'm avoiding talking about many specifics. Half the tension at the beginning is finding out what earth is actually like so to ruin any of that here would be a monumental disservice to the show. When the show started I thought that the premise had promise but never did I expect it to be as good as it was nor become what it is now. These doubts I had come especially as it was on the CW, a channel that I believe despite having some solid shows, has always been a cliche young adult oriented channel. This of course is my own opinion. Although there's hints of cringe and some fan fiction like writing at the beginning of the show, if you stick with it, the show becomes increasingly more adult and grounded (pun unintended) as time goes on. I was shocked at how deep and brutal the show can be even at the beginning but especially in the second season and let alone where we are now in the show and story. I was also shocked at just how captivating the show is. When I sat down to watch it I didn't expect it to be terrible or anything but I definitely did not expect it to be so engaging and interesting. Throughout the show there's constant threads and throwbacks to previous seasons and although any good series should of course do that, this is especially a bulletpoint for this show as it is always changing. Each season is new and unique but doesn't ever stray too far from the core of the show and never leaves you thinking "Oh why did they change this?" Or "I wish the show was still more like Season X". As said earlier despite there being a little bit of cringe here and there the characters all have incredible arcs and each one of them is extremely unique. I won't mention too many points out of fear of spoilers but seeing the growth of a character like Octavia is incredible over the seasons or even the lead character Clarke. The way Clarke changes even from Season 4 to 5 is really well executed and adds layers to characters who at the beginning were just delinquent kids but a few seasons in come across as battle hardened young adults. I've rated the show a 10 not because it's perfect (not many, if any shows are) but because it provides everything you want when you sit down to watch a television show. Build up, suspense, shock value, interesting situations, action, (many other buzz words), drama and pay off - the latter being something I think many shows are not delivering on. If you've got this far then you've seen I've hyped this show up a lot - hopefully not too much but it is extremely good in many aspects. The TL:DR is basically stick with the show at the beginning as it just gets better and better and becomes extremely captivating. Hopefully I've convinced some of you to check out this great show. Thanks for reading this review :) .
5.0~WRITERS ARE F'ing AWFUL nohomo-82650 Sign in Permalink I've never watched a tv show before where the writers literally make every single character bi polar its outrageous. One episode you like them and the next you don't. It's literally like this for EVERYONE they portray in this show. That being said it makes it damn near impossible to like a single character. The show has a ton of potential, but the writers do a GREAT JOB of ruining it. 5/10.
10.0~Great Show mememellowintokyo Sign in Permalink This is a fantastic show full of emotion and excitement. The 100 is set in TonDC (Washington DC) after a nuclear war has wiped out all the planets life or so they think. Right before the war began 12 countries sent people up into space in hope that one day there could be life on earth again. These stations came together to form the Ark a home for all of the stations. Three generations later, the 4,000 survivors living on a space ark see their resources dwindle and face draconian measures established to ensure humanity's future. Desperately looking for a solution, the ark's leaders send 100 juvenile prisoners back to the planet to test its habitability. Having always lived in space, the exiles find the planet fascinating and terrifying, but with the fate of the human race in their hands, they must forge a path into the unknown.
10.0~This turns out to be good mingdaoooo Sign in Permalink It started as not really good TV show, i mean the deaths and all are so ridiculous and have no reason but as we keep watch it there are always reason to why they are dying that fast. If you watch it good you will know whats going to happen and you will whats coming. This shows is totally good, gender and stereotype killer. What do you want? Female leader? their both greatest leader clans's are Females, Clarke and Lexa, strong girl? They have Octavia, smart? They have Raven, this shows is just beyond great. I hope the season 4 is going to be soon, i wont handle it if they cancel the show. I know Clexa ship is sunken, but they are canon(ed) so please keep supporting this show, if this is about LGBT community i don't think you really mean it, they still have Bryan/Miller or maybe Bell/Murphy (lol). Every good things could be happen, have faith.
10.0~The 100 is amazing! schrda Sign in Permalink I love this show and everyone I have encouraged to watch it have also loved this show. In order to get into the show, you need to watch at least the first four episodes. If you still don't like it after that, than perhaps this show isn't for you but you need to at least watch the first few episodes before you give up. Eliza Taylor (Clarke Griffen) and Bob Morley (Bellamy Blake) are great actors and they amaze me every episode. All the actors are amazing and bring something special to their roles. If you think the first season is amazing then you will be blown away by the second season and I hope they keep up this greatness in the third season.
6.0~A Cheeseburger of a Show joncheskin Sign in Permalink If I had to sum up "The 100" in one phrase, I think I would pick "guilty pleasure." This is not refined art; in fact, if it were a meal, it would not be a gourmet delicacy--rather it would be a big honkin' McDonald's Cheeseburger. Neither nutritious nor edifying, it is nonetheless satisfying and even addictive. The premise is similar to many we have seen before--Earth has been obliterated by nuclear warfare, and the survivors have escaped the radiation by camping out in an earth-orbiting space station called the "Ark". After 97 years, they have decided to risk an expedition to earth to see if it is again habitable, but decide not to hazard their finest citizens, but rather a group of juvenile criminals who are "expendable." Adult criminals are not around; because of strict social controls, any criminal offense by an adult in this society is capital--thus the only criminals are under 18. The teens are sent down, and have to contend not only with their own lawlessness, but also a hazardous environment full of natural calamities, savage nuclear survivors ("Grounders") and competing visions for their quest for survival. The series is a compilation of their adventures. This show is nothing real new; post-apocalyptic drama has been around since the 1950s, and post-apocalyptic drama featuring teens is all the rage with the success of the "Hunger Games." "Survival serials" are also the rage, for example "The Walking Dead." "The 100" seems to capitalize on both of these genres, and adds a bit of old-fashioned sci-fi a la "Battlestar Galactica," then mixes in a lot of violence and some teen soap-opera a la "Baywatch" for a truly marvelous concoction. Performances and writing are both sometimes clunky, but Eliza Taylor and Bob Morley play their characters with intensity and sincerity. The show's constant cliffhangers draw you in and some of the stories are genuinely inspired morality tales, do or die dilemmas that get you on the edge of your seat. Some of the science is completely implausible, but shows like this never care about that; they just try to grab the viewer and take him or her for a good ride. So sit back and enjoy that double Big Mac.
2.0~Good Science fiction ruined by american liberalism mooreyr Sign in Permalink Theme: 7/10 Story: 2/10 Acting: 5/10 Characterization: 1/10 Credibility, continuity and logic: 0/10 1) Theme is absolutely brilliant. the greedy and shortsighted Human race has destroyed the earth. Fortunately some has survived by being in the sky station. Now they wants to visit the earth. Good theme gets 7 out of 10. 2)Story (and Screenplay) is too weak for a good science fiction show. The writers are confused as they dont know whether go for the teen love stories of Twilight or go for the story of survival in the deserted earth. one basic thing is being missed here, when you are making a sci-fi drama with the concept of survival as theme, you pay attention to the survival and not to the love triangles and emotional effects of it. Story is absolute horror. mature viewers need a good sci fiction and not teen age romance in the apocalyptic world. or just make it simple romantic drama, why to defame sci-fi genre..! Horrific story gets 2 out of 10. 3) Acting is justified as given material to the actors. They try really hard but fall back as the screenplay and story just betrays them. Actors are not a problem for the show. Acting gets 5 out of 10 4) Characterization: Every good shows are getting loved for the characters they are building up. Eg. Daryl or Rick from TWD or Abraham Satrakian from The strain. The 100 lacks likable characters. This might reflect the unstable mind of creative team or the love for mediocrity from producers. Some characters are close to be like as Allie, Lexa, Lincoln and at some point Bellamy but rest of them fail to catch attention due to poor characterization. Most of the characters eg. Jasper, Octavia, Clarke, Raven, Finn are boring and just throwing tantrum or looking for the opportunity to get laid. All the decisions are made up n that base. typical crap. Characterization gets 1 out of 10 5) Credibility, continuity and logic: The writer (the original book writer Kass Morgan and creator Jason Rothenberg) is either not fit to write science fiction or has not enough knowledge or research of how to write a good Sci fiction. The show lacks credibility of story and details, continuity and also logic. Few example: Hey, there is nuclear war on the planet. lets unite in sky, ohh station 13 is not ready. fire a missile on it. Seriously..!! You have seen earth getting destroyed by nukes from the sky and you fire a missile on another sky station..!! We want to know if Earth is survivable, lets send 100 teenage kids instead of robotic vehicle or another technological device. And hey, we care for them so lets put wrist band on their hand which cant find difference between dead or deactivate. Blood groups doesn't exists anymore, mountain man can suck blood of anyone. Radiation is just like flu except for mountain men. in the first 2 season you see 3 teenage horny girls (Clarke/Ocatvia/Raven) are just doing whatever the first thought come in to their head. The logic of Clarke ( and ultimately of Kass Morgan and Jason Rothenberg) are coming like, I want to save one guy. Let the rest die. All the protagonist are craving for Peace and to achieve that peace they let murderers get away and let them wander free to murder more. (sounds familiar..!) The whole bunch of kids are looking for sex partner in the apocalyptic world and most of the events and decisions are just too liberal (if you know what I mean). Most of the teenage protagonists are changing their minds constantly, killing and let others get killed yet talking about peace and no war. The real leaders of the groups are just observers. One irritating teen Jasper who never got a real date with girl is just constantly screwing up everything yet everyone wants him to be just happy as he cant find a girl to date (all of them just dies after hooking up with him). No one understands the basic rule of survival. No one understand that the psycho dont think the way normal people thinks. And everything is not about your teenage romantic dual especially when you have just landed in the post apocalyptic planet. The CW must be desperate for TRP as they renewed the Show for 7th season. There is a lot more. The moral of the story is the show has its god bits but the base of the show is dull and unrealistically boring. I wont recommend the show, unless someone has enough time to waste.
9.0~Sci-fi Game of Thrones jdkco Sign in Permalink I am so glad I watched season 1 of this. Otherwise I would never have seen season 2 which was AWESOME!!! Watch the first 3 episodes of season 1 and you will be hooked. By season 2 - the characters you have got used to change, good become bad, bad become good. Surprises, twists and turns are continuous in season 2. I am waiting with great anticipation for season 3... The lead characters are surprisingly good, all unknowns for me, a couple of other actors I have seen before but the new comers take all the credit, characters who are believable, likable and relatable. Give it a go, you will be surprised
5.0~I gave up merpman Sign in Permalink First series showed promise, not exactly a fresh approach to sci-fi but fresh enough. Second and series not as good as the first, and the third just plain sucks but there you go. Despite the obvious scientific stupidness, people born and lived entire lives in zero-G without ever having seen anything green, have no problem with earth's gravity or becoming trackers and rural warriors pretty quick off the bat. But thats not even my main concern, you can overlook this, its the contrived sequences that go back and forwards, repeating themselves, repeating the same mistakes, just lots of repeats really. People constantly saving each other, A and B saves C, then B gets caught and A and C go back to save B etc. etc. gets nauseous in the end. Showed promised, then fell off a cliff.
8.0~Starts off slow, but builds into a very compelling and interesting story sam-moore82 Sign in Permalink If you'd asked me after the first few episodes what I thought of this show, I'd say that it had some good, dark and surprising moments, but was let down by underdeveloped characters, inconsistent writing quality and predictable plot points. After the first few episodes, however, the show realises that it's trying to be a compelling, dark and intriguing survival story instead of a documentary on which guy Octavia wants to sleep with, and it becomes a very addictive show to watch. So the plot for the show is that, after a nuclear war, the only surviving humans live on an Arc orbiting earth. After 100 years, oxygen is low, meaning all crimes are punishable by death unless you're under 18. If you're lucky enough to be under 18, you get executed on your 18th birthday. That is until someone came up with the idea of sending 100 of these children down to earth to see if it's survivable, and thus the premise of the show is set up. It's actually a nice setup for a show, and the good CGI of the Arc as well as a genuinely capable performances by the cast set it off on the right foot, even if the start is a little too rushed (they're literally already being sent down to earth 3 minutes in, and you're introduced to characters in arbitrary ways that tell you nothing about them. The show also reminds you that these are teenagers with predictable romance situations and iffy scripting in place of actual character development. As already mentioned, the show drops these to an acceptable level and starts creating an interesting crew of survivors who get placed into difficult situations and have to work together to survive. The real moment that signified the start of this change was when Belamy (who starts off as your cliché unlikable leader figure in the group) is placed in a situation, avoiding spoilers, where he has to kill someone. It's when the show really starts to bring in the themes of survival and that this is life-and-death. There's also some dark plot twists not long after this that make you realise that they are onto something here. The characters all start to develop into believable people, the writing steps up a notch and the story lines start becoming more unique. This is helped a lot by the utilisation of the adult cast on board the Arc. They are also battling with survival, and there's some great character development done here, particularly with Jaha and Kane. By the end of the season, I actually cared about these characters, their survival and what happened next, and that the show is suitable for all ages and not just teenagers. There's still some cheap love triangles and such where they try and keep the teen audience entertained, but if you can ignore that then there's a genuinely good and interesting show here. I won't talk that much about Season 2, as it's difficult to do so without hitting spoilers, but the show really becomes a must watch by the end. All the characters are put to great use, the writing is great and the storyline feels much more unique and developed.
1.0~It's get boring again Sarahnuraini23 Sign in Permalink i watched this series since it premier 1st season, i watch it because a couple of my favorite TV series ended so i need more TV series to watch, honestly season 1 it very boring, slow and 'meh', and the cw also almost cancel it, i used to wait for 5 or 6 episode before i binge watched it with 3x playback speed because how boring it is (at least this way i could kept my interest with their boring and slow storyline). but the season 2 actually getting good, their storyline interesting and just at the right pace, the characters development are amazing, the last episode of the season 2 actually making me excited for season 3. and season 3, man season 3 wtf man the writer trying too hard to be game of thrones, the series become full of plot holes and shock value their story lines is a mess, and they actually killed off 2 characters (that chick that now on ftwd and that one lovable black man) whose in my opinion makes this whole series interesting, and they also messed up some beautiful character development that build up in season 2. i gave this series a chance but they disappointed me again so yeah i think i'm done with it.
10.0~After Game of Thrones best series ever watched wolfsebastian-20004 Sign in Permalink One of the best series ever watched it is very thrilling the most catching series I ever was able to watch After one episode I instantly watched the second and so on.....Between 2 days I watched it until the end.... I couldn't stop watching I was infected with the 100 virus ^^ You never know who will die and who will survive I only hope that not everyone will die .....The music is not famous but I think it is very well chosen and fits perfect into the different scenes hope that there are many following seasons :) Chars very well played, music good chosen... Hope I helped U :) Have fun and enjoy it until the end ;) Yours Fabian-Sebastian Wolf
7.0~Exciting series with some gaping plot holes and histrionic scenes potatometer Sign in Permalink The bad? I don't think the grounders make much sense. In only 97 years I don't think human culture would change this much. While I don't doubt at all that an apocalyptic event would lead to a more tribal society, these people have developed an entirely new religion and language (and yet they still know English). I'm not a scientist so I could be wrong about this, but if after a nuclear exchange there is any human life at all left, there should also be more technology left, too. The Grounders appear to be living a medieval lifestyle at best, but people who were initial survivors of a late-21st century nuclear war would probably figure out how to live at a 18th or 19th century technological level, at least. I mean there would be some engineers, scientists, teachers, etc., among the survivors. And if humans were able to survive, there would be some books out there. And then there's the issue of 12 nuclear power plants that just happen to meltdown at the same time. I can't imagine that would happen, and I can't imagine that if it did, it would happen the way it does in the show. A dozen meltdowns probably wouldn't be an extinction-level event. Nonetheless the show is pretty good. I find it to be exciting and generally well written with some nice twists. Occasionally it's melodramatic.
1.0~Beyond bad Man-Behind-The-Pen Sign in Permalink The concept is good. Then it happens. They land. She takes out a map. Looks at it and looks at a distant mountain and knows exactly where they are and where they need to go. I am not even going to go into how much is this stupid. You would think that they would equip them at least with basics, like some form of navigation, and emergency supplies just for the off chance if they land stranded and something goes wrong. Characters: We got typical pretty do good to all take charge blondy. A teen with daddy issues and redemption issues. A bad girl, which is polar opposite of the blondy. Charming delinquent that both girls start liking. Therein lies the typical teen love triangle. Not to mention, that the first thing they do when they land is to behave how only dumb ass U.S. Muricans would behave in adverse situation. Wasting daylight, arguing and all around behaving like morons. I can understand why they sent them down to Earth. I would kick them off the space station too. Then we come to the technology. 100 years and they could not come up with any kind of tech to measure conditions on Earth and send scientific teams to explore the Earth. This show is beyond bad. I stopped watching after I saw that crap with the map and beginnings of "Bad kids" vs "Good kids" crap. Oh and parents perfectly ok with sending their kids into certain death. Seriously!
10.0~Give it time!! alex_borthwick Sign in Permalink This one is definitely a slow starter but it really really picks up! I started by watching one or two episodes at a time and was just playing along, and glad I did. By the second half of the first season I was beginning to become more intrigued by the show and now I'm hooked. You have to allow the slight plot holes in the story (all films/TVs shows have them!) You also have to remember that the first few episodes are setting up an initial backstory for them to develop the foundations of a future great TV show. The writers ideas lie primarily on the basis that they will be on the ground. The TV show gets so much better once you're past the first few episodes and I'm certain that the people giving terrible reviews are people who've given up on the show too soon. Stick at it people!
9.0~Really good. garymanu Sign in Permalink i really like this show and cant wait to find out how this show moves on. i understand how many older people might not like this as there is many young actors so it can seem like a teenage show. i think you guys should give this ago and i think as this show moves on you will like it more. i haven't read the book so i don't know if it stays true to it but i will give the book a read after this. i cant wait to see the problems that happen when you let teenagers on earth with no system of government. i hope they go on to develop the "no laws" system that is set up. i think this will be one of the best TV shows this year so i hope it is given the chance.
9.0~Please do not abandon the show after Season 3. lamaking Sign in Permalink I am not used to reviewing series on IMdB, but I had to make an exception for this one. This show has been going on for 5 seasons now and has its ups and downs. Clearly. What I am going to do is spoil you starting from paragraph 3 (this being paragraph 1) if you do not have watched the whole show including season 5. For those who are hesitating to watch The 100, well... What the hell are you waiting for? This might appear as a teenage show, which it is, but this is much more than that too. There are great plots, great actors and lots of death and turnarounds. Everything a show needs to be good. However, Newcomers I must warn you of two things. First is strap yourself in because as I said there is going to be lots of death and difficult decisions for the characters, but I consider that a good thing as you probably do too. Second is do not stop the show at half season 3, everyone agrees that season 3 is the worst of all but the next ones are way better in many ways. This is far from The Walking Dead case, in the end they knew how to make it a great show again. First and second seasons are great to watch, characters are interesting, and the actors are great as well. What happens during The 100 is what I expect in any TV show I watch. Do not bond with any characters in any way, you might be disappointed by what happens to them. When I say that, I do not only mean that in a physical way, but in a psychological way too. War, treasons, manipulation and complicated relationships (to say the least) is what makes the show so great. There is not a single thing that is easy in this show, starting with the decisions the characters have to make. As I said, the show obviously had some downsides. Season 3 is the one. Well... last 7 episodes of season 3. Everyone of us, fans of the show, did disagree with the death of Lexa. I do not mind that they killed her, but the way they did was just not acceptable. And to add to the drama, this was an LGBT character. Obviously, what was meant to happen happened, and the LGBT community took this personally (or some of them at least). I can understand why, because of the way she died which was the stupidest I have ever seen in a show of this kind. Would have she been a non-LGBT character, I would have mind as much. After season 3 I hesitated to even keep going with the show, I was worried they would make the same mistakes, bringing the same plots forward all over again. And they almost did in season 4, but the way the story was written, the actors' play and the ending make it watchable, and an actual good season in my opinion. Not the best I have seen, but good enough to keep me within the story. I think that it is mostly the ending that made me want to wait for season 5. And God... I cannot tell you how worth it the wait was... Season 5 is THE greatest season so far of this show. For those who do not have watched it yet, please watch it already! Honestly, I was not expecting the show to go this way, and I am so happy that they did. Everything is great about this season, there is not a single episode where I was bored or expecting what would happen. Almost every episode is a surprise of its own, the new characters are great and the new actors too (especially William Miller as Paxton McCreary <3). What happened to the ones who stayed on Earth is very well hidden until the right moment, the ones up in space want to go back to Earth and want this time to do the right thing (they finally learned from their mistakes) and Clarke became a mother of some girl called Madi, who will turn out to be a truly interesting character. Season 5 was great, and the end of the last episode gives us a very nice opening to season 6. They finally got to stop making the same mistakes all over again, and now the show can move on from what they used to do during these 5 seasons, which was that one character always ends up repeating the same mistakes the others did. This was getting really boring and frustrating. But now, and maybe because they finally destroyed Earth for good, they may be able to do something different this time on a new planet. I will not hide that I have high expectations for season 6, and that I will probably be the first one to s*** on the show if this goes the same way all over again. But I am confident that this will go the right way, I have lots of theories of what could happen on this new Season and this gets me real excited. May we meet again.
10.0~They are getting better by the season islandgrl-94422 Sign in Permalink Season 5 was epic. Great stuff but where, oh where, do they go from here? Let's not drop the ball.
1.0~Most mediocre show out there. fantasiannightmare Sign in Permalink The season 2 episode 1 beginner is just plain stupid, the whole point of the kids landing on the earth was to establish a place for them to call home, so why are the a**h***s in charge now and not the kids, the series fell apart on season 2 for me, the whole thing just died because it literally does not make any sense for the whole series to continue, the kids should be in charge, they literally made a base for the people so they deserve to be in command, not the adults who sent the kids down to die on earth, then the adults start shocking them, giving them lectures, telling them who's in charge when they really aren't in charge, they make the story go from AMAZING to complete B***s*** in a matter of one episode. I would not recommend this to anyone, ANYONE for season 2, the developers should be ashamed, the directors should be ashamed, even the adults who tried to make the whole episode be ashamed, for ruining a great series that could've been Season 3 will die in a fire, and i do hope it does, cause I'm done with this series, unless they redeem it somehow and let the kids back in charge like they should be. If you came for a show that would give you some amazing thrills and some spectacular acting, i would rather watch "The ship" for its show points, otherwise i would not try to care about any, even this one, That is why I'm giving it a 1 out of 10 because its just the most mediocre show out there, i recommend no one watches season 2 because just on the first episode it dies.
4.0~Eh. Love to hate. Forget everything you know about the world. wtf-79997 Sign in Permalink I love to hate this show. Its ridiculous, but I can't not watch it. If by "suspend belief" you're expected to turn into a 5 year old who doesn't understand how biology/chemistry/radiation works, then yeah - suspend that belief! My biggest issue with the 100 is: The human race left Earth only 97 years ago. How did the grounders come up with a completely new language, have no idea about technology, and have customs (leaving deformed babies out to die) etc? Surely these people had parents, grandparents etc that told them about the world before the nukes. I like to pretend they've been away for 1000 years at least when I watch. It makes a little more sense then. You're running out of air - lets send 100 perfect healthy, young teenage "criminals" to what could be death with absolutely no leadership in case they DO survive? (seriously they had no way to track radiation or monitor what was going on down there??) while keeping the old, sick, non useful people to suck up more oxygen. The whole space radiation vs nuke radiation is another thing that bothers me. Why is it the grounders are out and about just fine? How did they survive the initial blasts? WHERE DO THEY GET SO MUCH MAKE UP IN A POST APOCALYPTIC WORLD? WHO TAUGHT THEM TO BRAID HAIR??
1.0~It is bad, it is very bad cashovina Sign in Permalink Really quick, it is a Gossip girl in the forest, but with bad acting. The main idea is interesting which they took from the book, but this is very bad. The 100 is often compared with the Lost. It is not even close to Lost. It is a typical teenage series, only difference from other boring teenage series is that they are in the woods, not in the school. You can compare it with the Maze runner, but maze runner is a movie and it is interesting. This is not.
8.0~A good science fiction television series... ahmetkozan Sign in Permalink First off, I enjoyed Season 1 of The 100. Season 3 was inferior compared to other seasons. The 100 is an American post-apocalyptic drama television series. I love The 100 because it has a unique story line. 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse, 100 prisoners sent down to the earth to see if it is survivable for the ark and it's lacking resources. This show is another amazing and intriguing apocalyptic show that has caught my attention. I was sceptical at first as I am not a huge fan of the CW's channel however I realised that this is an exception to that thought. I have so far really enjoyed watching it and am hooked. If you like The Walking Dead, Revolution or Lost then you will love this show! If you like apocalytic, intense, thrilling, quality dramas, this is your show. It has a nuclear and isolated feel to it and it has yet to disappoint me. If you like the show too, please spread the word as much as possible, the show can't survive without support and good ratings so encourage those around you. There are so many cool sci fi themes and issues in the show that it really keeps you interested in watching. Characters are also very interesting and bring you in. I would highly recommend this show to any sci fi fan! You won't be disappointed. 8/10
1.0~Season 1 Recap burnakozz Sign in Permalink Well idk about u guys . but i could say i seen a pretty good number of shows lately . So let me say m opinion and plz correct me if i am mistaken . Human Race Living on Space , 100 Years away from Earth (Meaning the Survivors on Earth Are Actually Surviving for 100 years in hard conditions and constant threats ) a Bunch of Spoiled Kids with Issues how they look or who they screw Land on Earth , They get Poisoned , Sick , High and actually only 15 of them die against unnatural Environment , Toxic Rain and Savages that actually SURVIVED on this god forsaken land . A Spoilled little Blonde Wannabe Princess with almost absolutely knowledge in Medicine Actually Performs a Hard Surgery with Instructions Via a Radio with interruptions without Screwing up and saves the guy ... + I have seen better acting in Porn than Eliza's Taylor in this Series . Sorry but the stupidity and the Bad Acting of some Actors in the Show just makes it too much for me , Probably one of the worst Series i seen , even the legion was better than this joke . P.S: I am a Huge Fan of Post apocalyptic Scenarios , movies and games . but this series is really really bad . If u seen more than one Series in ur life u get what i mean . I Could Gone and Said the 1000 more Flaws and Unrealistic Stuff going on these Series but it would take way more than 1000 words to do it . Cause Lets face it , it's not a Sci-Fi genre Like Star Wars or Harry Potter . It is a bout Things That ACTUALLY Exist , like space Stations and Survival in a Post Apocalyptic Earth (That might actually happen in the future) i mean For the Love of god FIX THIS BS Series and make it a bit more realistic , i cant stand that stupid blonde's Acting more than first Season . Ty
9.0~It's addictive ghaliahbaalbaki Sign in Permalink I love the show because of its interesting plot and conflict it's something new and interesting the storyline is very interesting and it always keeps you in suspense the best thing about the show are the character developments every character has developed and grown they show you how much the characters have been through and how that affected who they are I shows how much the characters struggle to survive and I love the octavia storyline how she was once an innocent girl but how much she changed she grow up as a person and is definitely a whole different character and I find it really interesting also I really love the grounder storyline it's a very unique plot and I think it really adds a lot to the show
10.0~A Beautiful and Dramatic Show madammaladroite Sign in Permalink Just wonderful. It's my favourite TV show. The acting is amazing and the chemistry between the two main characters is absolutely wonderful.
10.0~Get over the first season belo252 Sign in Permalink Started watching this because I liked the idea of this show. It started like weak high school drama combined with sci-fi at first but if you close your eyes for that and just enjoy the show, you will get addicted to it. If you don't look very close to some things like guns on arc, why punishment on arc is death but if you are under 18 you go to prison, why they send all teenagers not adults, why all of them is arrogant, selfish and sometimes just stupid,then in general it not bad, by the way acting is good and persons are interesting. In summary first season was more like high school drama with some holes but second season right now is really good, I would say epic. No more teenager stuff. I would give 9 of 10 cause second season is breath taking.
10.0~THIS SERIES HAS TO CONTINUE !!! emanuelbalaban Sign in Permalink I watched 5 seasons in like 5 days. I can't believe myself. I couldn't stop!! This is a very successful title I think its my best TV series. Well entertained, not cheap, cool, inspired from a book and with beautiful actors, well playing actors. I like it. I just like it. Please don't stop what you are doing! I can't wait for the next episode to come next friday! Man, really, Clarke dies?!
8.0~I'ts a good science fiction series Kentaris_a Sign in Permalink I watched The 100 a lot for 3 weeks and liked it. When i started to watch i found the dialogue too bad but from the season 2 this improved. The characters are gereric however the story line is soo good that erases this bad things. The season 5 final is amazing i want to season 6
1.0~What a terrible show! paparas1 Sign in Permalink I am a sci-fi movie fan but this tv series is developed and produced by sick simpletons, in my opinion. It is unwatchable, so I give it a generous 0.
1.0~Absurd pcsimonson1651 Sign in Permalink I could only watch the first few minutes of this show. If you are the type of person that does not care you are being asked to believe any of this could really happen, then by all means go ahead watch the show and be entertained. But if you are the type of person who likes to watch shows that actually make sense, as well as entertain, then do not watch this show. There are so many unbelievable things, things that make no sense in just the first few minutes, that it just wasn't worth watching it through to the end of even the pilot. The overall story line or idea sounds good and really could have been good, but it falls flat on it's face right away. First of all, WHY would the space station send a bunch of immature children to a toxic planet with no training in anything except on how to party as soon as they land?
10.0~Brilliant paullake-59028 Sign in Permalink Brilliant family of Actors ,Brilliant story arcs, Brilliant effects and Brilliant set construction, I have not been on the edge of my seat as much since the Original series TV release of "V" back in 1983. This show just goes from strength to strength, a really enjoyable Sci-Fi flick, i'm grateful to everyone involved in its production. Brilliant
8.0~The story that keeps evolving. Nathiri Sign in Permalink I knew my brother had been watching this and it came up again from a friend, so I thought, I should check this out. Man, I was disappointed with the first episode. I found the immersion killed by the way some of the actors acted and looked. I wasn't planning on watching the 2nd; then a couple days later, I thought, that story was kind of interesting; I'll check out more. Boom. I was hooked. There have been several twists I NEVER expected. The way they killed off some characters really surprised me. The story is increasingly getting better at a steady rate, and so are the characters. Some of the decisions these characters have to make really surprise you, but yet their motivations are realistic and understandable. They don't just make these decisions out of nowhere: their attitudes develop into that state to where they can make them. I notice there is some talk about the "science" in some of the reviews; but honestly I never stopped to think about it. It seemed believable to me. Perhaps I'm uneducated there. Anyway, I would highly recommend this show if you want a very strong, interesting narrative...at least up through season 3 and then 5. I found 4 a bit disappointing with the limited characters.
10.0~Saudi ammarelshamy Sign in Permalink This season is very good and I hope it is try be the best in the the 100
8.0~Not really a fan of this character. kisada-47911 Sign in Permalink Personally, really annoyed with Clark's character. No expertise what so ever except medical and constantly making excuse for every overly stupid decision and still be accepted and obeyed from others. Ps. The show is good fun though, may be with some annoyed characters.
9.0~WHAT WOULD CLARKE DO???!!! Not a bad show!! I'm really shocked at how hooked I am!! stephaniepaynephotography Sign in Permalink OK, so first off, I'm super picky when it comes to shows that I like!! I'm a Game of Thrones, Lost, Flight of the Concords, & Dexter watcher...oh & South Park. I have watched up to the mid-2nd season of this show on Netflix and am absolutely hooked!!! Now mind you, it's not perfect!! Sometimes dramatic scenes are a tad muted & it's accuracy & true to form is a little skewed sometimes but it really does have an awesome story-line & the actors are not half bad either, especially the younger crew!! I definitely think if you like Lost, you may like this one!! I call it a junk food show...one of those shows that are perfect to watch when your waiting for Game of Thrones to premier:) Even the costume & set designs are awesome!! They don't have Lord of the Rings budget but they make it work!! The details are planned out well, but there are moments that you know, that just would never happen...like the obvious main one; sending 100 teenage criminals to the earth to see if it's livable again, without military, scientist, loads of supplies & communication devices but that's Hollywood, right? That's kind of the whole point of sci-fi Style shows anyway so you just have to look past that and watch it as a fantasy world or parallel universe. (SPOILER ALERT AHEAD...The rest of my review is about the premise of the story up to the mid-2nd season) This show is suppose to be in the future after we bomb each other to death, a bunch of different countries join their space stations together to build the "Ark" but it can only last so long so they send 100 teens to the ground but obviously something goes wrong and they don't know if they are alive or dead. The show starts with 2 separate groups, the teens down on earth & the adults up on the Ark in space. But soon they are all together on the ground but a whole new can of worms opens with the natives called "Grounders" "Reappers" & "Mountain Men" ... Clarke, the 100 leader, tries to make peace with everyone but actions cause reactions and it never works out perfectly. Definitely a lot of action and drama in this show & the best part is, they really give a lot of important powerful roles to woman!! Well I'm going to go finish season 2!!! Hope you'll decide to watch it because it's definitely worth your time!!
2.0~Omg.. i wasted my time for nothing sewar-13675 Sign in Permalink (Excuse my horrible english) Just let me tell u this.. my first attempt trying to watch this show' it was a 2 years ago. After one episode. I gave up. Yet 2 years later again my friend told me dont give up!& Keep watching.. so after a oneweek i forced my self to continue watching.. and i finished season 1! I skipedd all the scenes in the space because i knew its boring. And in the end of the day they all gonna land, its like I predicted it, and it did happen, thank god i skipped all of it. Season 2 episode 5. I decided to stop this complicated boring drama, The story telling is horrible. Like no way im gonna watch 1 more season to see if its actually good and worth it, Guhhh, i wasted my time watching this nonsense! I didnt want to suffer anymore, just dont waste your time.
1.0~Great cast, disappointing plot daved-06551 Sign in Permalink To protect against spoilers, I am writing in general, not providing specific examples. First of all, The 100 has a great cast. I just wish the plot was better written. I watched season one and two within a week, then started season three. If they had concluded the show after two seasons, I would have rated it much higher. Strength: The actors Weaknesses: * story lines are too long * lack of a clear main plot * too many events running simultaneously * unrealistic survival of injuries/accidents Overall, this television series seems more interested in gore and horror than science fiction. A more focused sustained plot and less butchery would make it a better television series. Sorry, but I gave up watching this frustrating show.
9.0~One of the best Sci-fi jmertsel Sign in Permalink It is my first rate on IMDb and I registered only because I felt that THE 100 deserves it! Very difficult scenario and all serial could be a Sci-fi drama with Tom & Jerry characteristics. Oppositely the majority of scenes are realistic and this made the serial very interesting. But the most important thing is that all crew gives the best. Very good acting and performance and I should give the credit to the casting company! Also very good scenario! I am watching Under the Dome and Extant and there are several problems based on actor's performance and scenario. THE 100 is almost excellent and especially the young actors. We are waiting to season 3 and we are sure it will be very very good!
6.0~Could have been a GREAT Series like GOT. hyng8862 Sign in Permalink Overall watchable. A lot of unnecessary reaction at the wrong place, wrong time or too extreme. Tried to put too many scenarios. Most of the main characters seem to have multiple split personality from one end of extreme to the complete opposite in a very short time. The scripts can be quite similar to a B grade movie. The more I watch, the more annoying it gets. I think the script writers were trying too hard or the producers and directors not doing enough at the right place. Overall it's watchable. OK on season 2 now, wow it got worse. Giving this a lower rating of 6 instead of a 7.
9.0~This is a great show, don't listen to the nay Sayers photovisionary Sign in Permalink I really don't get the negative reviews here. This is a very original, fantastic show with great acting & deep, emotional character development. And no, it is not a show just about teenagers. There is plenty of age diversity.I think a lot probably don't like it because they simply don't empathize with human connections and all of their complexities; or they are perfectionists that like to pick things apart instead of just enjoying it for what it is. What a shame. Anyway, for those who have not started watching this series, I highly recommend it; that is if you like a show that is designed to be fictional, and is deeply "grounded" in human relationships which constantly evolve and are tested- you will love it. It is exciting, unpredictable, thought-provoking, heart-breaking at times, and always enjoyable. Having watched it from the beginning, I've been on the edge of my seat one minute, crying the next, full of warmth on the inside, shocked with disbelief, and optimistic in what seemed the impossible. And as with people in our lives, no one is perfect, all have flaws here and there- so does this show, so what?! It is well worth watching and as a 52 y/o who has watched a lot of TV series over the decades, I can say The 100 is one of my absolute favorites. It is well worth giving a chance.
8.0~A Complex Drama in the Post-apocalyptic Wilds atlasmb Sign in Permalink It looks to me, based upon some reviews here, that many viewers gave up on this show within the first few episodes, before it had even begun to demonstrate the basics of the show's story. "The 100" begins with a remnant of Earth society, orbiting Earth years after an apocalyptic event. Due to circumstances, 100 of them--teens and young adults--are sent to an unknown fate on Earth's surface, where they set up an elementary society and try to survive in dangerous environs. "Grounders" are living on the surface, as are at least two other societies of people. The plot hits its stride when the remaining satellite people also descend to the surface. So many posters complain about "absurd" plot points, some of which are incorrect or irrelevant. I assume these reviewers refused to watch "Star Trek" because of absurd story lines and scientific improbabilities. That is their prerogative. But those who can suspend some disbelief will find a complex story about social order and the nature of man. There are some very good actors involved. The visuals are rich. And the cast expands as the characters meet and become familiar with others. I might add, without giving away any spoilers, that the "new world" of this unfamiliar Earth offers many surprises and a few unexpected secrets. Update 12/16/14: This series has proved that it is on the right track. The plot lines are engaging and the characters are well-defined. I am upgrading my vote to "8".
9.0~Not just a teen drama. There is good writing here! sooperklew Sign in Permalink OK, first of all. Is this show made for teens? Well, yes it is. Does that mean it can't be good? I don't think so. Its sort a 'LOST' for teens. I think there is a lot of good writing and fun ideas here. Is it the best show ever? No its not. So what are you going to do? Watch the best show ever over and over again? Its well worth watching if you haven't seen it. They're constantly bringing in different ideas to the show to make it interesting. Is there a little too much teen angst? Yes there is. Pobody's Nerfect. Are some of the characters annoying at times? Yes they are. But this show has real imagination that you don't often see in television. I think its much better written than 'Wayward Pines' for example. I wish these writers had written that.
1.0~High hopes turn to low expectations Bing_The_Terrible Sign in Permalink Most everything that needs to be said of this series has already been said, really. I, myself looked forward to the series after reading the synopsis for the pilot episode, thinking that in the very least I might have a new sci-fi show to waste time on, but no. I can't even bare to watch anymore, as the plot is so unoriginal, see-through, predictable and done to death that it's frankly depressing. On top of which, the way characters interact and events take place with no regard to logic what-so-ever requires the viewer to suspend reality to a level far beyond science-fiction. At times I found myself gritting my teeth and rolling my eyes as characters were introduced, and plot devices explained, all operating mechanically in a very deliberate and predictable manor. Villains forgo any logic that might make their endeavors simpler, and heroes shrug off murder attempts and threats by blatantly psychotic criminals as if they were childish insults. It's infuriating. Don't bother with 'The 100', it's merely a perfectly televised example of why HIRING TALENTED WRITERS IS SO IMPORTANT.
1.0~It's getting "better and better"!!! valm-957-536316 Sign in Permalink An orgy of treachery, double crossing and murder. All characters are psychopaths. The most self destructive choice that is there, that will be the only one for everybody! But season 6.... Mmm... A new world, colonized by: 50% certified murderers, rapist, child molesters and such, the other 50% being savage murderous cannibals! Clearly the "land of the free, the home of the brave". I can barely wait to see it!
8.0~Really impressed. Shopaholic35 Sign in Permalink The 100 is a mix between The Hunger Games and Star-Crossed. It's your typical Sci-Fi teen drama with an apocalyptic end of the world theme. What's not to love. Send a bunch of young adult criminals on a mission with no guidance or structure and you end up with a lord of the flies situation. This shows not everyones cup of tea but it aims to entertain and on that it delivers. The special effects are really successful and the "new" Earth is absolutely beautiful aside from a few mutated freaky creatures. I can't wait to see what direction they take in developing the storyline as it has so much potential. I think some people are being a little harsh about the inaccuracies of the show. Before you even watch something like this you know its not going to be realistic. It's about allowing your imagination to run wild without the constraints of actuality. You don't need to think through it, just enjoy it.
5.0~Turn Off/Down The Darn Music! lyngal28 Sign in Permalink Who in the heck thinks it is a good idea to play music throughout the entire show? Most of the time the actors speak in low and whispered voices and because of that darn music, you can't hear what they are saying. It's very distracting, annoying, and unnecessary. The show has an interesting story line and concept. Could this be the world's future--quite possibly. However, the viewer doesn't always know what is going on because you can't hear what they are saying. You can kind of figure it out by just watching but many details about what the characters are thinking and how they feel are lost by the loud overlapping music. And for that reason, I give it a 5 out of 10 rating. Producers, or whoever makes the decision about music, please consider not using it throughout the entire show.
1.0~How do they expect us to continue watching without the main character? kellyelleira Sign in Permalink This show was great and it was also great to finally have a real LGBT relationship between two main characters, but the writers decided to kill off one of the two main characters and now the show is ruined. Killing off the main character takes away a huge part of the show, and now it is complete garbage.You don't kill off the main character, everyone knows that. Hopefully this show will get cancelled so that the writers will learn their lesson. It has already lost a lot of followers on its official pages, and the ratings have gone down incredibly fast. I know I, and many others, have moved on to other shows now. Good bye, The 100. It was fun while it lasted.
8.0~Don't listen to the negative reviews anthonydcase Sign in Permalink Most of the reviews on here are basically either Darwinists or complete morons (is there a difference?). People are groaning about the "lack of scientific accuracy" with artificial gravity (aka a staple of modern sci-fi as a whole) and then, inn the same breath, complaining that "society is the same 100 years in the future as it is today." First of all, science evolves too people. What makes you think AG couldn't be a thing? Are you attacking Star Trek (which is basically this except backwards) or Battlestar Galactica? No? Then stop. Secondly, this society is a lot different then today's. I mean, there is only ONE white guy in power, and he doesn't show up until the second season. This might actually be the problem people have with this show. "An entire season without a white guy in a position of power? Unthinkable." There are complaints that a smart girl exists. There are complaints that they sent attractive, breeding-aged girls down. Do you see what I'm getting at? If not, most of the negative reviews are sexist. Should they have just sent down a Geiger counter with the kids? Sure. Is the writing bad? At times (mostly in the pilot), sure. But that's true of any show. Is it horrendous? No. Is the acting bad? Well, they can't cry very well, but other then that no. Does it show interesting, three dimensional characters? Yes. Is there an obnoxious amount of white men? Nope. In short, if you don't like post-modernist approaches toward young adult entertainment, then don't watch the show. Simple as that. However, if you can pull your head out of your @$$ for a little, and you enjoy shows like LOST, give it a shot. It might surprise you.
1.0~This series is painfully stupid, do not waste your time. languscar Sign in Permalink Where do i start??? 1 The characters are boring, predictable and too knowledgeable. For exapmple, Clarke thinks she knows everything about planet earth even though it was her first time to go there. She is super annoying because she wana be right in every decision. Oh wait, when did she train to be a doctor?? I thought there was no school up there!!! How come Clarke knows more at her age? I remember is season 1 episode 2 she was saying there was ot suppose to be a river here! How did she know? Maps? Really? 2 Really, how did they manage to develop devices which can monitor someone who is in planet earth while they failed to detect if the planet was still radio-active? Does nt make any sense 3 thirdly, how do you send your youth to the place you are not sure they will live instead of sending the old and experienced people? 4 seriously?? Is the planet really that small?? Why do some of the members of the 100 get lost and still be around their camp? Really? When someone get lost wonders far! I mean very far. 5 the acting is so unrealistic. We expected to believe that you can get along with someone who was sleeping with your boyfriend? Really? Girls are very jealous to say the least. Well i can say a lot but i promise you that i am getting even more irritated as i write this review. What a waste.
8.0~Keeps getting stronger paul_3-960-896774 Sign in Permalink I was seriously on the fence about this show, didn't think it was that interesting and basically watched the first season because I had an hour to kill. The second season premiere did not change my opinion of the show, in fact I thought it was all going that hill from there down but boy I was wrong. The new opening theme looks great, it suits the show and make it even more futuristic then just set up in a post apocalyptic world. That said, the Mount Weather storyline was, for a while, the worst one of the show because if you have half a brain, once you know why the Mountain Men still live underground, you guess why they want Clarke and her friends - The 48. But the writers of the show were smart and didn't take the audience for idiots, so Clarke found proof by episode 2. Another reason why I didn't like the introduction of the Mountain Men was simply consanguinity. If they've been living in the Mountain for a nearly a hundred years how the f**k are they looking alright? Aren't they all cousins by now? Anyway, the show got better, it got real good, real fast the writers dug themselves out of this whole and turned things around. The 100 S2 built on the strengths of season 1 and became intriguing. They've broadened the scope of the show with the mountain men then mentioning the Ice People and they've brought back the monsters, mutated animals, and most importantly they gave layers to the Grounders. The battle for power and leadership in the different groups was genius, worthy of a Game of Thrones comparison - No, it wasn't. I'm being way too kind. There was a lot of twists and turns and it was thrilling to watch. It's mysterious, exciting, they've managed to jam a lot in the series, new characters, new dynamics, and new territories to keep us guessing and asking for more. The 100 is shaping up to be one the best non comic book related shows on the CW. @wornoutspines
10.0~Everyone is a critic katedin Sign in Permalink I really love The 100 because I never get bored with it, like the story changes, people change there's always something different happening. Now I can respect that there's people that do not like it but honestly don't pay attention to all the 1 star critic wannabes that have seen only the pilot and think they have all the series figured out ( there's 5 seasons). Even worse when they're like it's not like BSG, of course it's not, nothing is like BSG ( just rewatch it). That being said the series is very interesting and it changes completely every season.
10.0~Been watching from the start stevekrofchick Sign in Permalink I love this show. It's getting better and better as it continues. I now prefer this show over the Walking Dead as I'm sick of the gore. For those that say it's unrealistic, then I sure hope you aren't a Walking Dead fan as it has a 10 times more unrealistic plot than the 100. The story line is great and is believable enough to really enjoy the show. The story is really getting great now and i can't wait for the next episode. This is one of the best new series to hit television and all my friends and family are into it since we've told them about the show. Two thumbs up and I mention this show to everyone! What's up it it currently off the air???
8.0~Good story with amazingly bad science and plot holes gazzalodi Sign in Permalink I really should give this lower marks, but the story telling is just really good. Who cares if the people on the Arc flew over "Polis" for a hundred years and never noticed that huge fire burning on top of that building that never went out. Big whoop. Bodies that "reject radiation", umm, sure. And our heroine has murdered around a thousand people so far. I don't care. I want to see Lexa again!
6.0~The 100 AlenMM Sign in Permalink Good thing about this show is definitely that there is some mix of drama and sci-fi and when you mix that you can get an amazing thing. TV show The 100 follow a group of 100 teenagers who are sent to the earth after 97 years to find out is earth livable place and is there any sing of radiation. The Reason why Earth was left is nuclear war. Threw the episodes they simultaneously show life of people on Arc (Space station where they lived all this years) and people of earth. The 100 also show psychological picture of people in hard and life threatening situation and how they can change in positive or negative way and show what they really are. What makes this show more interesting is that there is a lot of romance, hard decision's and mystery's left on the Earth "TO BE OR NOT TO BE" found out. This is an very interesting compound of an apocalyptic, survival, drama with many sci-fi effects and "creatures".
9.0~Unexpectedly interesting find SilverOrlov Sign in Permalink Despite the fact that, like in most serials, they like to "carry snot", In all other moments it is a strong and interesting serial. Normal level graphics, environment, setting, An interesting idea and realization of this idea, and sometimes plot twists make you say something like "that's it, it's cool". Not a masterpiece, but a very interesting series, which I would advise to watch to my friends
9.0~Overall good series joot-19-804897 Sign in Permalink *little SPOILER* There is a lot to flame about in the first season. The human race has build a huge space station, but we don't know what is happening on the planet? :) Use a radio or camera for crying out loud?! Anyway..season 2 is really good in my opinion. There is a good story, actors/character building are pretty good and the tech and gore level are decent. Having main characters die is a good shocker and interesting to me. I am looking forward the the next of the episodes this season. After that i am pretty sure a new enemy will appear, but other than that i wonder if they can keep me interesting in wanting to see more. It would become a bit boring if they just continue looking for a place to live a quite life?
2.0~... what is this? AudiTT669 Sign in Permalink Bad writing turns into forced acting, totally out of place emotional responses, and cringeworthy one-liners. All of these things make the show as close to unwatchable as it can be. If I was watching this in a room with someone, I would feel second hand anxiety from just how bad the writing and actors are. For these reasons I can't figure out what age group the show is for, seems a bit mature for children and too juvenile for adults. Episodes seem to have no structure, events play-out in a completely arbitrary fashion, and there's more inconsistency than you can shake a stick at. Not to mention how ludicrous and rushed the plot feels. No one should need to watch more than a few episodes to know this is something they want to avoid. I truly cannot see what those who have enjoyed it see in it, but the popular positive reviews that make statements like "You have to take it for what it is" and "It's not that bad" should tell you just about everything you need to know.
6.0~Lincoln tiffanybodie Sign in Permalink This show was amazing 1st and 2nd season I lost interest once Lincoln (my favorite character) started getting less screen time and then killed off. It basically goes downhill after the "city of life" becomes the center of attention
6.0~Great at first, slowly becomes awful. gohan_dbz_98 Sign in Permalink I've just recently gotten into the show, at first I loved it - the story, characters, possibilities.. But as it drags on into the third season, it starts to change. The first season was great, it was an action adventure show in a realistic sci-fi setting - I love that stuff. Second season was also incredible, it really gives you that 'Lost' feel. But then it hits the third season, and it leaves you thinking "Uhm, okay.. Guess I'll see where it goes", then it hits you with such a Luke-warm, anti climactic finale that does NOT leave you satisfied. Then the fourth season comes around, and at this point it loses sight of (what I hoped) it set out to be. What starts out with such momentum, slowly kills itself by transforming from an action/adventure/sci-fi TV show, into a drama focused, 'make everyone hook up with each other' mess. When you watch the first seasons, you feel a connection to these characters. You really do grow attached, and find yourself truly learning who these people are, and what decisions they generally make. But eventually, everyone kind of contradicts the character growth that they put 2 entire seasons into shaping. I understand the premise of WHY this is happening, people will do anything to survive, but it just doesn't feel right. They start tossing out cringy, poorly written lines about 'there are no good guys', and moving the story along in ways the characters TRULY wouldn't, while leaving many plot holes. I don't want to get into the specifics, but trust me, you'll notice them. Summary: I honestly don't mind romance and heavy drama TV shows, but they're not for me, and I don't enjoy them. But with that in mind, a TV show shouldn't spend it's first 2 seasons making a niche, and then take a sharp 180 degree turn into an entirely different direction. If this was the show it set out to be in the beginning, it would find it's audience and keep it. But for some reason the writers struggle to define the shows identity, leaving a bunch of fans expecting more, with much less then they had hoped. Unless you're into shows like Grey's Anatomy, I'd avoid it. But people who are into shows like The Walking Dead, Lost, House, etc. you'll be hugely disappointed.
9.0~Seems Interesting... eugeniusratshipa Sign in Permalink This review is based on the pilot only. Basically it felt like a teenage version of Lost. The Jungle, survival, rules...maybe. It seems there will be creatures affected by the radiation, meaning probably mutants will be appearing, just like in Lost. Nonetheless, The 100 has a futuristic feeling to it. It's one of those shows that may actually portray future life events; How the world may be in different situations. Like maybe a world of anarchy since mainly what happens to the 100 is what's interesting, they basically have to decide what to do, how to rebuild earth and the like. Also it really sucks you in, many characters to relate to. Hopefully they won't kill him/her off. Also loved the soundtracks. Looking forward to watching the rest of it.
10.0~This show is exhilarating to watch. mairacadaxa Sign in Permalink Yes, at first it may seem like a ordinary teen series without much to add. But it evolves. Quickly. I mean it. By the end of the third episode you will stop everything you're doing and go on a binge because there's no way you won't want to know what happens next. Character development at its best. The show with the most variety of skin color, hair color and accents that I have ever seen. Powerful female character that are LEADERS. Not co-leaders. Not right hands. Actual decision making 100% power on their hands female leaders. Major characters might be killed off, and there's nothing you can do about it. You'll cry. You'll cheer. You'll hope. They created a whole new world, a new language, a new concept of humanity. In all sincerity, go watch this show if you haven't already. (ps: Why this show has poor ratings? One answer: bad ads. It's seriously the only explanation.)
10.0~Gets better and better nicole938 Sign in Permalink So this show definitely isn't a slam dunk right out the gate and actually, if not for the reviews on IMDb, I probably would have given up on it after the second episode. I'm SO glad I didn't. Say what you will about the show's science, or lack thereof, what it lacks in proof, it makes up for with compelling characters and a plot that continues to surprise me with each new episode. Hardcore sci fi fans will probably find it lacking, but those looking for a rich plot and characters to endlessly root for (I'm looking at you Clarke) will enjoy it for what it is. Not gonna lie, I LOVE how woman dominated the show is. The women run things and it's never an issue. Never a question. That's just the way it is. It seems to be one of the most unapologetically diverse shows currently on the air today. Sometimes the characters change too rapidly and before you can blink, that character you loved last episode is now a raging jerk, but by the next episode you're back to loving them. It can definitely make your head spin a little, but it somehow works. Now of course it is the CW, so the kids (and adults for that matter) are all hot, because of course they are. But hey, you won't hear any complaints from me. And I love that even the minor characters have some depth attached to them. You will root for Clarke tirelessly because as far as heroes go, she's a bad ass. And even when she does the absolute wrong thing, you still love her and want her to win. Okay, I could clearly go on and on about this show but I won't. Do yourself a favor and give it a chance. If you're not hooked by the fifth episode, I'll buy you an ice cream. Okay, I won't buy you an ice cream, but trust me, it's worth it and you'll be glad you did.
10.0~Love all about it soad_ingis Sign in Permalink This season is almost too good...love it. Now im waiting for season 7...and im probably going to wait a while, but that's totally going to be worth
6.0~Both genius and idiotic paulritsma Sign in Permalink I can't get over it. I'll say it again: this series is both genius and idiotic. The setting, backstory, politics and ethical dilemma's that have been designed by the creator(s?) is fantastic. With these masterfully prepared ingredients they should be able to create a timeless masterpiece. But they didn't. Instead we see characters displaying irregular and unnatural behavior, and unnecessary subplots that slow down the story, and break the suspension of disbelief when random luck occurs. Examples: A good, thoughtful guy, becomes a mindless warcriminal. An intelligent young man with leadership qualities, decides to follow an idiotic leader whose intend is to kill all the other humans (grounders). A missile approaches a village, the leaders know it, but decide to keep quiet about it. In the explosion many people die, except the heroes. All these subplots could have been deleted from the series, they just don't add anything, and make no sense. Back to the good parts, there is no shortage of it. All the different peoples who survived the 'praimfaya' developed their own cultures and religions. This is really interesting. The AI story is kind of interesting, but could be better, somehow. Overal I enjoy watching it, but get irritated by illogical characters, or unnecessary subplots. I actually think the series would be better with less episodes per season.
1.0~This show Is watchable... If you've never taken a science class. cyndi_fan247 Sign in Permalink But for anyone with even a substandard education should be laughing at what we're supposed to believe in this hot pile of garbage of a show. The fact that it's still on for (going on 5 seasons) is somewhat alarming. Aside from the plot holes, it panders far too much to the teenage crowd with romances and hookups that are a distraction. This show could have been something, but they put absolutely no effort or thought behind the hard concepts of the show, which makes it completely unwatchable for me, because I just can't suspend my disbelief that far.
8.0~Water generator problem? Why not LifeStraw? postdamage Sign in Permalink I really like the show... Though it actually took a whole different direction that I expected... Still not sure if it's better that way or not... We'll probably see later... I don't want to write long reviews, 'cause nobody really wants to read all those long reviews. Plus there's many pages of 'em. *I just have one... question: Why are they so desperate for losing a water generator in the future (in The 100) when even we (in the present) have LifeStraw or just some water filters (which are used even by astronauts)? Can't they just easily filter their urine or what? Why do they need a water generator?*
8.0~Great show except the homosexual parts sherriduggins Sign in Permalink The gay scenes almost ruined it for me but Im thankful for fastforward
9.0~Keeps Surprising nsivaloganathan-09269 Sign in Permalink Sitting here, having watched a few episodes of season 2 and the thought that springs to mind is 'surprised'. Every time I think ugh bad script, lame characters and many plotholes, things happen and I am sucked back in. Every now and again I scream at the screen at the ridiculousness of some of the scenarios and a few scenes later something happens that I would have never expected from this show. My verdict: push through. This show, so far, is worth it.
1.0~High school drama in a retarded future. salmskou Sign in Permalink I laughed through season 1 and 2, then finally stopped, not even boredom could make me continue, it is the dumbest sci-fi show i have ever seen. 1. If you want to survive on a space station, you don't float people (eject people into space) dumbest idea ever, that's biological matter you wont be able to get back, at least sentence people to "death by recycling". radiation, gravity, evolution etc. are also things the producers fail to understand the basics of. and why the !"#¤ would the "grounders" develop an entirely new language over 100 years, when they already speak perfect English. Its just so damn dumb. 2. Every single scene in the show is some kind of teenage issue, learn about life, become independent etc. its just terrible, and all decisions are either made through feelings, and if not, they will be sobbing and moaning about doing a logical choice again and again, its terrible emotional bullshit. 3. Notice how much they use these 3 sentences, its utterly ridiculous. "My people", "your people" and "our people".
10.0~Give it a chance, great watching! surangas Sign in Permalink Literally watched season 3 & 4 in 3 days! Extreme situations which show how different minds and communities handle these situations. A lot of young actors giving it a good go as well. Give it a chance. I watch all sorts, Suits, Luke Cage, Blacklist, designated survivor, GoT so definitely not skewed to this type of genre!
1.0~Vanilla and dumb yuri-levikov Sign in Permalink The 100 shades of twilight. The stupidest pseudo sci-fi flick ever. The motto is:"do not use the kill switch on the power station - blow it", "oh, there's a monster - stare at it", " army can't - let's call for teenage girls and sugar-boys", "kill more, and then speak in low dramatic whisper with tears - yeah, OK, you're not a murderer any more". Lame to the grade modern DC all whispering series start looking like proper quality movies.
8.0~Third Episode was Surprisingly Tear-Jerking and Good marie-villanueva Sign in Permalink This episode is the best that aired so far. The first episode was a little "iffy": cliché characters, juvenile bullying, the sudden but random rise to leadership of Bellamy, the lack of prioritizing (I can go on and on). But this episode was more raw, dark and emotional than I had expected it to be. I love that (so far) its starting to look like the writers aren't focusing on a love story to drive the plot forward- instead, they are focusing on survival, as it should be for a story like this. I think the first two episodes were all about laying down the groundwork. But now that we have been introduced into this new world and are getting the feel of it, this show can truly shine and pull us deeper into its plot. Already, in the third episode, we see some character development- Clarke isn't as hard-edged and stiff as she initially seemed to be; Bellamy isn't a heartless fool who is a dick for no reason. In fact, in this episode, we see a vulnerability to him. Furthermore, the kids are starting to get their priorities straight (Thank God). Also, the crew promised a lot of deaths for this season, and already we see the death of a somewhat major character. The show will certainly get darker. Now we know that they have the guts to make bold choices and kill off fan favourites. I liked that they showed us flashbacks in the Ark before Clarke's incarceration. I hope they continue to reveal more about life in the Ark and back stories as well. I truly think that this show has the potential to be one of CW's best shows considering the line- up they currently have. It's something different that I've never really seen on television before- a cross between Lord of the Flies with sci-fi elements. But at the heart of it, it's a story about survival and community. I'm curious to see where the story will go from here so I will definitely keep watching.
10.0~The 100 gets a 100% nidkap1129 Sign in Permalink All accusations concerning reality aside, the 100 is probably one of the best shows I have watched in a long time. It is very difficult to have a TV show that is completely accurate, because otherwise that wouldn't make for good entertainment. The 100 has the perfect blend of all elements that are essential for a successful TV show; politics, romance, suspense, and moral ethics. Even though there have only been 8 episodes so far, the plot never fails to surprise me and characters have already grown in different ways. Each character is complex and elaborate and different and Clarke is probably the best female heroine to ever grace a TV screen in a long time. Not a single episode has failed to make me consider something deep or made me tear up and I'm sure none will ever fail to. Both my girl friends and guy friends love the show and I encourage everyone to stick through the pilot and continue watching - you will not be disappointed.
7.0~Great premise, but there are so many flaws that it's just not believable georgemarvin2001 Sign in Permalink I like the idea, a makeshift group of space stations jammed together to try to survive after a nuclear apocalypse. The good: The cast! Eliza Taylor is proving to be an excellent choice for the main character, Clarke. Charismatic and believable, she's not just the typical damsel in distress. She's tough as nails and charming at the same time. Marie Avgerpoulos is another strong female lead, a great actress and, as someone who loves hunting and fishing in real life, she should be right at home in this series. The male leads are also believable, and the series has plenty of time to develop a strong supporting cast. Isaiah Washington was also a great choice as Chancellor. The bad: Third-rate hack writing is a big problem. The premise is good, but it's obvious that the author and at least some of the writers flunked 7th grade math (4,000-324=2,210?) and science, nobody bothered to do any research about radiation, and they all forgot that Geiger counters, telescopes, DNA tests, etc. exist, nobody thought about the fact that a transmitter that is transmitting data to the satellite is a transmitter capable of transmitting data to the satellite, so it would be stupid to not have made the bracelets capable of letting the 100 send messages back to the station and to each other. And the characters do things that make no sense at all, like when the guy who gets stabbed becomes a gun-hating flower child, or Clarke doesn't take any precautions when she goes to sleep in the same room with the girl who just murdered her boyfriend. Or when the little psychopath commits suicide. For that matter, the whole idea of making a one-episode, oversimplified plot that is so similar to the well-written, well-executed Lizzie storyline on The Walking Dead was just the epitome of a bad idea. If you can put your mind on cruise control and ignore the fact that the series is a sci-fi show that totally ignores science, and often even ignores basic math (since when is 97 years 3 generations? A generation is 20 years, 20x3=60) and assume that some of the characters are going to do something absolutely stupid and out of character at least once per episode, and just watch it for the fun of it, it's not bad.
10.0~A Pure Gem!!!!! baehr_adam Sign in Permalink OMG I will 1st say that I just finished binge watching the entire 1st season of "The 100" in 3 days and it was Phenomenal!!!!! Review: Story: I believe the story was done extremely well and I give props to CW for always coming out with Superb shows as for the story it goes like this 97 years after the Earth is ravaged by Nuclear Warfare the people on board the Ark send 100 criminals down to Earth to see if it is survivable. I like how it's really two stories in one show because they show the story of what is happening to "The 100" on Earth and also what is going on in space on the "Ark" and they handle it with great finesse. Acting: The acting was top-notch especially since I only recognized a few actors and the rest I had never even seen or heard of before but they handled there parts with great precision and really brought out the heartfelt moments in the season. Action: I will say in my opinion that this is where the first season blew me away was in its action. I was never sitting there bored there is always action in every episode and twists and turns at every bend of each episode as well. I love how they incorporate different factions into the series and I will not say any more on that topic. All in all the action is Insane and Unpredictable in the best way possible. Verdict: I would recommend this show to anyone and everyone who loves Sci-Fi and End of the World style shows. I was excited even before I started watching this show and after finishing the 1st season I'm blown away by the whole concept and everything that went into this show and I can't wait to start Season 2 later today!!!!! 10 out of 10.
1.0~It WAS good.. djamesemt Sign in Permalink The writing took a complete flop. Basically, everyone wants to die. Every single scene is cringeworthy and I cant watch anymore. Plot: No plot, imagine a bunch of morons, that's the entire season 5. The sci-fi is limited to a few small scenes. The acting is close-ups of faces which blankly stare. Oh, and dont forget the extreme close-ups of the 12yo girls face, "Commander". Serious
1.0~Extremely retarded. valm-957-536316 Sign in Permalink 'contains spoiler' Really awful: 1. To protect and save the "Humanity" you kill 400 highly trained and skilled people and save 1000 savage murderous rapists instead? 2. That "Jaha" guy cheated lied and double crossed everyone in all 4 seasons, and nobody bothered to put a bullet in his head! 3. That prison ship at the end of Season 4? Where from? Nar Shadaa? Trantor? Klingonian space? 4. The daughter of "Clarke" (a true lesbian)? Who is the father? God? Then the girl is Jesusa Christa? :/ And many, too many more...
5.0~Tired of all the constant beat up looking actors concours-13531 Sign in Permalink I get the series, but really? everyone has a scared and dripping blood face? Never heard of water or a towel to clean up? Totally annoying and unrealistic to me. Ruins the rest of the story for me.
1.0~Awful alissarios-100 Sign in Permalink I didn't even make it through the first episode of this show. The premise sounded interesting, but within the first five minutes of the series premiere, I knew this would be a mind numbing teen drama under the guise of a sci-fi. The acting is awful, the pacing is rushed, the characters aren't likable, I could go on. Aside from the scientific holes that were already apparent in the first episode, the entire situation and the characters behavior were very unrealistic. Why couldn't they just send down something that could detect radiation? Why did they send their youngest and healthiest to almost certain death? Why 100 out of only 4000? Basically the writers threw all rationality and logic out the window in order to make what they thought would be a creative take on the whole sci-fi apocalyptic thing, but instead ended up with a dumb teen drama that happens to take place in a sci-fi universe. Don't waste your time with this show.
6.0~Kymer Rouge vs the Nazis patrickmaura Sign in Permalink The problem with this show is that the supposed good guys our all sociopaths. Its like watching the Nazi's vs The Kymer Rouge. Both groups were sadists. I do find it interesting but the idea of the people in the ark being moral superior is disgusting. All the Ark residents our evil to the core. No issues justifying genocide or killing children all to save them selves. Never seen such a loathing and sociopathic show ever. And I am not even going to get into the incredible weak science and tactics. The truth is this show mirrors the US in that we think we are the best and kill everyone else because they don't matter at all.
10.0~In love with this show! courtneyswood Sign in Permalink So I don't really know if this review will contain any spoilers, but I check marked just in case. I don't want to spoil too much for those who will watch it. I'm an avid Netflix watcher, and I truly enjoy finding good shows to get hooked on. I had been watching show after show and had become rather bored. I had previously come across this show and turned it down many, many times. I've never really been a huge fan of Sci-Fi, but this show completely shocked me. I had very low expectations while watching the first episode, and I truly expected The 100 to be overly focused on petty drama, but it's actually well rounded. Now, the beginning does start a little slow, and I didn't get really into it until the fourth episode, but after that, I've been binge watching it. It's been around five days, and I'm currently on the last episode of Season 2. It's been nothing short of excellent. The ultimate shocker is that Season 2 is actually much better than the first season, which is very rare. For the most part, television shows start off great and progressively become dull. However, The 100 is much different. It started out somewhat slowly, and it continuously became better. The best part is that Season 2 is even more bloodthirsty than the first season, which I found to be quite intriguing. Overall, this show turned out to be quite interesting. Of course, there are those who will disagree, but I definitely feel as if it's worth a watch. Enjoy!
6.0~I like this show, I wish I liked it more...But it is a MESS walleye-42537 Sign in Permalink I like the premise, the acting is mostly decent, better than most low budget Sci-Fi. Make no mistake, this is very low budget. You just don't see it as much because they don't use the "Normal" scenes you might see in an Apocalyptic show. They rely more on character confrontations/relations and old fashioned "Good vs.Evil Drama. In reality, you cannot afford to make a TV show like this, UNLESS you turn it to more of the "Low Budget" direction. I say it is a MESS because you can't really figure out who or what the characters are and represent. I anticipate they are doing this on purpose to keep the viewers on their toes, but in many instances, the Characters are acting or doing things completely out of their "Norm". Most people don't do that. In one episode Peace will be a Huge driving point for a character and in the next episode, not so much as they Easily kill or call for the killing of others. Not to mention, the "World" that they live in is derived of Clans, Coalitions, and Friendships, but they are easily thrown out the window at the drop of a hat or any certain event. Like I said, I am sure this is done on purpose to keep you on your toes and not being able to say, "I saw that coming, or I knew that would happen". In small amounts, this is a good strategy for a show, but on the epic level this show does it on, it is becoming "Routine". You can almost assume now that any plan or goal will NOT happen as that is how the whole show is written. If a character says they are going "Left", you KNOW for sure they aren't and will end up going "Right" instead. Same with the plot and story lines. Overall, I like this show, it is entertaining and I like this Genre... BUT... they take the "Tortured Soul" plot of many of these types of shows too far and it actually drags it down in the end. They have the main characters not only Battle with their own "Darkness" and sometimes following it when needed, but they do it when NOT needed as well. If you can't rely on the Main Characters of a show to be true to at least one Positive aspect of their Personality, then you question the ability of anyone else "Living" on the show. Perhaps LUNA was on to something? This sadly leads to another issue with viewers. With myself, to be honest, if they killed the two main characters off, Clarke and Bellamy, I wouldn't really care all that much. Because THEY AND THE SHOW are a MESS, you really can't "get in the corner" of the main characters anymore like you once could. This is NOT how a show should make you want to feel or act towards the main characters. Because of all I have written, I give "The 100" one more year, (Season 5) and then it will be canceled. UNLESS, by some miracle, they "Clean Up" the mess they have created in the show and the Characters, mainly the main characters during the 5th season. One additional thing, I won't say what it is otherwise I have to report this review as a "Spoiler", but if you have been watching the show, you know what big event is supposed to be happening. They have been prepping for it the entire 4th season. IF THEY ALLOW THIS EVENT TO HAPPEN..... it will take the show down a BAD ROAD that it surely will NEVER recover from. It will guarantee the show doesn't have a 6th Season. Nobody will be entertained with the same plot lines happening week after week for the next "5 years". That is what will happen if the "Event" is allowed to become part of the show. There is just too little epic plot lines that can be established when the show is confined to a "Small Area" of Environment. The only option if they "do the event" is to fast forward "Past" it when its effects are no longer part of the story for the 5th Season. But then, we also won't know what the motivation of the characters are any longer. Essentially, we will have to learn about them as if they are new characters. The whole show and Characters will "Shift" and essentially "Reset" to Season 1 of this show. While it was fun the First time around, it would be repetitive and lame a 2nd time around. It will also become a disastrous move by the Writers and will guarantee the show gets canceled after Season 5. I think the show started going "South" when they destroyed the ability to use the Mount Weather angle back in Season 2. Season 3 had a good plot line with a formidable opponent as did Season 4, but they tend to "Drag" it all out a bit. When you look at it, the Season 4 "Problem" is the ULTIMATE problem. How do you top that for a Season 5 "problem" without "Jumping the Shark"? Like many shows these days, they don't have a problem "killing off" second tier main cast members. Although, this show does it to Epic proportions unlike we have ever seen. It really makes it so you don't want to get to "involved" with any other characters in the show outside of Clarke or Bellamy. Enjoy Season 5 as there probably won't be a Season 6.
10.0~season 5 so epic!!! Oh My God can't wait next season yoelreynaldo Sign in Permalink S1-S5 is getting better. Finally the ending of S5 so epic
8.0~Good Series! has confused some people though. apkified Sign in Permalink Great series. love the concept. Yes, some things could be changed, but no ones perfect, right? I think some people don't really understand whats going on. Its quite fast paced so maybe some of the facts and some of the characters get missed or forgotten. This causes a bit of confusion. But, isn't that the fun? trying to work out whats gonna happen next? trying to figure out what you've missed so you can piece things together? If your looking for a show that will get you angry, annoyed, interested, sad, happy and makes you eager to see the next episode....Then this is for you.(except if you don't like space stuff or not partial to a bit of tribal style warfare). Also I cant believe that guy from Hollyoaks is in it, Ricky Whittle. That's why he doesn't talk that much ;)
8.0~It's good ixmere Sign in Permalink Can they change the main character, Clarke is a little boring to watch. But the serie is good, I finished all 5 seasons in 3 days. It has a good sequel, I do recommend watching it.
9.0~Just when it gets good there is no episode 6? krshanks Sign in Permalink I was stoked to see Clark's character reinvented.. and only 1 episode of the follow-up and they stopped the normal weekly airing. C'MON!
4.0~Started somewhat decent in 1st season, but has drifted into a story with poor vision jbarrington-1 Sign in Permalink I love almost any type of new sci-fi shows, and I know some shows can start of a bit weak until it can truly find its direction, so I typically give them time. In the first season of "The 100", this series seemed a little weak, but showed promise with its general premise, and I really expected it to only get better. However, this show appears to have evolved into some sort of a sci-fi "daytime" soap opera. The seemingly same groups of people are hating each other, distrusting each other, and trusting each other, or forming into different variations of these groups just to slightly shuffle the deck some. They constantly bounce back and forth this way all of the time, every week or so. I don't know whether the writers don't know how to write for a sci-fi series, or they just don't have much imagination. Anyway, I could keep going on and on about the various things wrong about this show that keep making it weaker and weaker, but I feel that I could be writing for a good while. I do get the general sense "The 100" won't last another season or so, but I will wait for this season to complete before I finally decide to stop watching.
8.0~Not a bad series kristoferthompson Sign in Permalink This series ha a lot of potential. The characters are pretty good, and start to develop nicely. I found myself hating some characters at the beginning but starting to understand and even like them by the end of the series. There are a lot of "Lord of the Flies" influences here, however I felt it didn't detract from the overall story. The comments on overpopulation and resource exploitation will probably get missed by many, but are useful background plot device. The worst part of this series is the music. Every time there is an intensely emotional scene it is ruined by some whiny, hipster, indie, cold play BS music that completely ruins the atmosphere, and will date this production. If this whiny music was cut this would be a much better series.
1.0~We Lost Star Crossed and The Tomorrow people to this?!?!? brownmike8882 Sign in Permalink plain and simple everyone said it.. this show speaks for itself.. horrible characters typical blonde following for typically white brown hair guy.. black dude gets merked off and they end up having sex after his death.. no memorial nothing..nothing in his honor after he was keep a big secret.. oh and I saw 2 white boys get stabbed and live.. one got hit with a big giant spare!!! hahaha and lived.. the other space walker? I don't know what happen to him.. but who cares.. this show is horrible and they need to see that its brainless teen drama I rather see the secret circle come back or whatever its called. BRING BACK STAR CROSSED AND THE TOMORROW PEOPLE
10.0~I usually don't write reviews,but after season 4 I felt the need to do that. keepttmarrt Sign in Permalink Season 4 was like this show is just started.The first two seasons were not perfect,but pretty good.After season 3,I wanted to end watching it because the acting and the story were so full of flaws.But no matter how awful it was sometimes,I did't stop watching.Season 4 was the best this show could do.It had action,expanse,praimfaya and space again.Well,sort of,but even for ten minutes,the space felt real and satisfying.And the acting was very good for a CW show.They nailed it,and the cliffhanger in the final was awesome.Well done,and I hope that season 5 will be as moving as season 4.
10.0~Great Sci-Fi Entertainment with a conclusive story and many turning points. d-sassi Sign in Permalink Review on The Hundred - Sci Fi Show - March 2016 First of all let me say that i tend to watch several sci-fi shows in parallel. So I can compare my recent sci-fi show experiences unbiased by long term memory. The 100 clearly is one of the top three. (Unsure of its ranking because it competes with "the expanse" and "dark matter"^^) I watched this show on netflix and I followed its development into an amazing sci-fi show. The story of season one was intense and I eagerly awaited each new episode. In Season 2 it did not loose suspense nor depth nor character variety. That is a good thing. Season 3 is still running and about to end - sooner than I had hoped for. This show deserves another season because it is good sci fi. It is great entertainment.
10.0~The 100 is like fine wine and the taste is uncompromising. jacksakes Sign in Permalink I wish more people would watch The 100. Such a brutal show about survival on a wasteland Earth. The blend of tribe and technology is so well-fused, it becomes so unique as the tribal side sees technology as a religion, but is not really wrong. I don't know which is worse: while Game of Thrones kills off characters you fall in love with, The 100 twists their morality so bad they are almost unrecognizable at later iterations. Yes, all the characters grow, for better or worse. The only way they don't is because they're dead. The main character is closest to what I can see as chaotic good, but I might be wrong. She'll go through great lengths to exterminate entire groups of people in order to save the better part of humanity. They call her the commander of death. The production value is really good for a TV series. The scenes are very reminiscent of today's war with of course better but battered tech. This setting would make an incredible multiplayer game that holds up the tactical side of the war games, while still holding the sci fi fantasy of black blooded warriors who can metabolize radiation, and a computer chip that is passed down through through a line of commanders who serve as the tribe leader, retaining the skill and memories of anyone who claimed the chip before them. There are stories out there that really know how to bite, sink in, and don't know to let go. This is definitely one of them.
9.0~You'll enjoy it if you turn off your OCD chip! mark9696 Sign in Permalink Firstly, I've registered to post this just to comment on the pomposity of certain individuals who take 'SCIENCE FICTION' far too seriously! This series has exactly the same 'flaws' as lost, walking dead, breaking bad, doctor who, red dwarf etc. etc. in that it is not based on standard physics or normal everyday story lines, this is why science fiction is great because you can just turn off your logical thinking and just use your imagination to conjure up stories like this. Chill out haters and watch a documentary on discovery if you want real life but don't hate a science fiction series for being...well, science fiction! As for the series, I personally think this has been inspired by lost, the fallout game series, lord of the flies and a hint of cloud atlas with some twilight thrown in for the younger viewers! the ark, mixed with the earth bound 'kids' give a nice go between to keep the interest away from 'just another jungle series' although that might be inevitable in the next series and if you've watched the last episode of series 1 it could certainly go in multiple directions. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the series after a slightly sluggish start, I'd give it a few episodes (as with most series) before you give up on it and remember, it's SCIENCE FICTION, so leave your logical head turned off.
8.0~Titillating, not Vapid doubleplusungood-39354 Sign in Permalink If you look at the ratings, there are lots of 1's and other low scores, and yet the show is still averaging ~8. It's much the same for masterpieces such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Although not a masterpiece, the 100 may be the best science fiction show on TV at present. The first two episodes make it seem like a teen drama, but they are unrepresentative. For one thing, there will be content inappropriate for young teens. If you still don't like the show by episode five, then you should probably give up, though the show continues to improve throughout the first season and the next. A constant theme of the show is characters choosing to do immoral actions in order to survive. That's an interesting dilemma. Because of this, some "good" characters take a turn to the "dark side", while some "evil" characters find a little redemption. Sometimes the writers are too heavy-handed in the transitions, but at least the characters are evolving and not stuck as cartoonish stereotypes. Another theme of the show is the fluidity of power. Someone in power may be getting electric lashes later, and then rise again to power: lather, rinse, repeat. The initial leader of the Ark, Jaha, is an interesting character, in that he seems to have shades of "Baltar" (Battlestar Galactica), a sort of false prophet. He speaks of destiny, while killing anyone who inconveniently gets in the way. Scientific accuracy is not one of the show's strong points, but allow me address some of the biggest criticisms. * Many reviewers are upset about the Ark people's blood being a temporary cure to radiation; however, the show tells us they are genetically engineered to be radiation-resistant. * The way radiation acts in the show is totally inconsistent with our current science, and yes, this is annoying. However, this is the distant future; I'm led to believe the nuclear apocalypse was with "improved" nukes that leave persistent radiation causing death in minutes, unless you are genetically resistant. Meh, I tried. * Another weird thing is the acid fog, but you get a logical explanation for it during season two. Still, it's odd that it doesn't affect foliage. However, there are many plants today that are acid-resistant or even acid-loving. One real world plant has even been shown to have recently mutated to no longer be vulnerable to one kind of acid, a man-made herbicide used in Agent Orange. So, presumably only plants resistant to the acid fog (Agent Orange?) grow around the mountain, because any non-resistant plants were killed off long ago. * Finally, some reviewers point to the illogic/dangers of having guns in space, but the show tells us the space stations were at war at one time, presumably during the nuclear world war, and the thirteenth station was destroyed. Only after that did the people on the remaining twelve stations decide it was better to work together. They joined the stations together to form the Ark. Granted, science and logic are not the show's strong suit, but the storyline is. So, take a big dose of suspension of disbelief and prepare for an adventure.
1.0~teen SiFi bullshit without science or logic. tashmiasultana Sign in Permalink The writers of this show must be the laziest writers of all time. loopholes Sooo big it can sink titanic. total waste of time. u have been warned.
1.0~While characters loose their identity; the viewer loses time. janicewymore-79708 Sign in Permalink If you like to see a degeneration of the human race, this is the show for you. It's just not for me.
8.0~Starts off weak but does improve Lil-dip Sign in Permalink Just as my title suggest it does start off weak, however it is improving and I'm really starting to enjoy the show. Yes it does have it's flaws but I'm not one to over think them I just casually laugh them off and move on. It's definitely not for everyone but if you give it a chance and you do like it then great! If not then oh well. I do recommend giving it a chance though, what it lacks in depth it makes up for with it's passion and dramatic story telling. Look at all these reviews and how many people gave it a chance. I bet they are still hooked hoping it gets better! Which it has! I just find it a fun easy going watch without to much confusion, it doesn't have any swearing, there's no graphic sex scenes or drugs.
8.0~Amazing! charlottewaring Sign in Permalink This series is so original and although it takes a while to warm up the plot of the story continues to get better. It's constantly filled with drama and action. It's take on sci-fi is new and exciting and although at first I was a bit skeptical about what they where they were going to lead the story the climax of each season so far has just gotten more exciting. Another amazing thing about this series is that it's constantly shifting. Although sometimes the story line can become confusing and there's a lot happening all at once this series is a must watch! I've just finished season three and I honestly cannot wait for what's going to happen in season 4!
10.0~Binge worthy avilan Sign in Permalink When you want to escape our surreal and implausible political reality with something more realistic, this is the best show to binge on, if you like excitement, fast action, fabulous acting, and strong female leaders/warriors. This show has it all: blood, fire, beautiful dirty people, war paint and tattoos, long eyelashes, fashionable combat boots, and no matter what, cleavage.
10.0~A viewers opinion minnabearhug Sign in Permalink Binge watched this show in 2 weeks. Couldn't watch anything else. So many twists and turns to keep u on edge. A lot of saying "What The?" A lot of "Game of Thrones" style violence. Extremely strong characters with lessons to learn for all of them. And from all their many mistakes. Teaching us all lessons of humanity.
8.0~Actually getting better ! remcovos85 Sign in Permalink Sure you can approach this show from a physics point of view and trash it all night long; how can they walk inside the space ship, how can they maintain oxygen for 90+ years, hello Geiger counter !!, etc. etc. However, if you do this you can basically QQ about every (sf) show, since they all have plot holes, exaggerated explosions and impossibilities Considering its broad casted on cw, which has its main focus on younger audience, you know you won't escape the cheesy love triangles. But in all fairness as the season is progressing the characters do start to grow on you. Furthermore the plot is slowly diverging and getting more depth to it, with a lot of plot lines available to keep the show interesting for a long time to come. Are the grounders alone (apparently not), are they really the bad guys. What will happen to the people in the Ark, and what happens when the hardliners get to the ground. Conclusion : its not the best show ever but its definitely entertaining. 7.5/10
2.0~Bad aftertaste, after a good start mvtienhoven Sign in Permalink I regret finishing watching the show until season 4. The start of the show felt really fresh and as promising as it gets. Season 1 got me hooked, which is why I decided to watch it as far as I did. The developments were interesting and I could really feel for the precarious situation the characters in the show were in. I could understand to an extent the mistakes the characters in the show made. But this became less and less as these mistakes were made more than once. The characters hardly learned from each others' mistakes, let alone from their own mistakes. They just kept doing things which aggravated their situation, probably to keep the show "interesting", but to me it did exact the opposite. However, because the show started so nice and fresh, I kept having hope the characters would come to their senses eventually, but that was a false hope. The same mistakes were made again and again, eventually I felt like I couldn't feel any empathy for the characters anymore. This lack of empathy for the characters started somewhere in Season 2 and only got worse as the story progressed. I kept the hope up until the very last episode of season 4, but I was let down. I can suspend my disbelief for a lot of plot holes, bad science incorporated into the world-design, or even mistakes made by characters. But that becomes simply impossible if the characters obviously keep making mistakes for the sake of bringing the characters in a downward spiral, so their odds of survival become less. It's all been made to have the characters face harder challenges, but it isn't believable for me if literally all characters are to stubborn to change their perspectives, tactics and simply common sense. It's like the characters are devolved human-beings with degenerative mental capacity, aren't flexible in their beliefs, in-compassionate and unable to read social patterns. If this would be future humanity, we would surely be doomed, that's for sure. So far about the story-writing. Truth be told the CGI is okay, the production is pretty good and I think the actors are actually potentially really good. But you know what they say: A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link. If it didn't have good parts in terms of what I described above, this series definitely deserves a 1 rating. To destroy the hope of an actually decent/good series, is more disgusting than being bad from the very outset.
4.0~Cheesy as it gets. paulilepisto Sign in Permalink I have watched only two episodes, but i felt compelled to do this review, i'm very surprised it has got as high as 7,7 rating, oh well - maybe it gets better later. But i have to say, i really doubt that this one gets better, almost every line written is cheesy AF and is delivered with such bad acting, that it makes me either yawn or laugh how bad it is. Which is kind of a shame because the concept itself is interesting/entertaining enough, and this is why i might still watch an episode or few. But really, they messed up the interesting topic with such low-quality teenager drama, that is not believable at all (at lest for a foreigner like me) that it makes it so hard to get into it. Also the CGI is worse than series 10 years older than this one. 4/10 and that already contains the hopes that it might get better, but the overall style of the script and the acting would have to take quite a leap forward.
9.0~You need to survive half of the first season then is going beteer and better bizonas Sign in Permalink Beginning is crap without good acting and holes in plots but then from few last episodes of first season everything changing. Good story and season 2 is the best one! Very good plot with season 5 and i'm really curious how this story will go in Season 6.
3.0~Entertaining but Painfully Illogical evanniekerk Sign in Permalink The premise of this show is great. I loved the whole idea of it. That however, is where my loved ended. This is because it is one of the most poorly written shows I have ever force myself to finish. I understand that drama and conflict is necessary for any show to survive, but frankly how it was created in The 100 was insulting. In order to drive their story, the writers have completely ignored natural thought process and logical problem solving/decision making that any human would rationally come to if placed in the character's shoes, which in my opinion is the worst crime in writing. This is especially true for a show based on a post apocalyptic scenario, because in my opinion the main draw is to imagine how possible it is and how people would realistically behave in such a situation. Because of this I found myself continuously questioning the show rather then enjoying the story. I have never written a review before but felt obligated to for this show. As I mentioned earlier I fell in love with the premise right away and the entire time kept hoping it would improve, which it unfortunately did not. Now if you are good at ignoring cheesy and illogical writing then I would definitely recommend watching. If not, I would avoid this program.
7.0~You have to accept it for what it is mitzisgirl22 Sign in Permalink Before watching the 100 you have to accept the obvious: it is a drama put on by the CW (the same folks that brought you 90210) about a group of 100 teens left stranded on earth by a society that has been living in space for a century. It is needless to say that the show is going to ask viewers to suspend their disbelief for the 40 minutes it takes to watch an episode. A lot of people tend to criticize the show for being unrealistic scientifically. The problem with this being that of course the show is going to be unrealistic. You have to accept that the premise of the show is that 100 teens get stranded on earth by their race of space people 100 years after a nuclear disaster. Sometimes television programs don't abide by standard rules of physics, or any kind of science for that matter. Sometimes that's what television is there for - to give you a break from the believable. If you are a stickler for scientific accuracy or a big fan of classic sci-fi the reality is that this might not be the show for you. If, however, you are someone looking for something exciting and (honestly) addicting to watch you might be in luck. In regards to the script I can honestly say that I suffered through 90210 cringing all the way and while some of The 100's script might be a little cringe-worthy to start, it is certainly much better than most (if not all) of the teen dramas on television. This is a good show! You just have to accept what you're getting yourself into.
9.0~very impressed. lexi-guiot Sign in Permalink I have to say it started a bit weak, but now I am completely addicted! Yes there are some cringe worth moments, but give it a go... the last episode was a complete turning point, and I personally cannot wait for the next episode. I remember how boring the vampire diaries was at the beginning and now it is one of the most addictive shows ever... who knows maybe the 100 will be the same. I was quite surprised with the fact that a show like The tomorrow people is still on the air, and also that it got distributed to the UK. I started watching it, and I literary could not take it anymore after 6 or 7 episodes... horribly acted! The acting in this show its quite good. I find the characters on this show a lot more interesting, probably because they are criminals, so you kinda want to know what each of them did. It also have that element of uncertainty that shows like the vampire diaries, teen wolf or the originals have, where even the main characters can be killed off, which makes the show even more interesting. So I hope it gets enough viewers to keep it going.
10.0~Love love love sorceamail Sign in Permalink Yes the first few episodes have a weak plot and run with the dialogue of which you would see in a high school based film, but it gets so much better. The plot makes a major twist and runs along very smoothly. It is a cliffhanger show which leaves you curious and gnawing on your nails for the next episode. I see lots and lots of negative reviews but those are just of the people who haven't seen all of it and just reviewed it based off of the first few episodes. Please give it a chance.
9.0~A lot better than I expected davefuller-35-194964 Sign in Permalink Read a few reviews and was a little skeptical as to what I might end up watching. Glad I didn't let those reviews detract me from watching this series. It is quite entertaining for the escapism it provides. Its a fictional series and not to be taken seriously. Sadly some of the critics here have done that with comments like this is not how someone would or should behave. At the end of the day the series is fiction, science fiction to classify it better. It would be like a futuristic version of lord of the flies watching a bunch of teenagers try to form a community. It has a bit of potential and it has started well. Looking forward to how it evolves in season 2.
10.0~Wonkru hughesc87 Sign in Permalink Before watching this I had my doubts. Thought it would be just another teen drama that would never amount to anything. But after season 1 when the cast grew into their characters I fell in love. I usually never rewatch a show but this show is an exception. I will rewatch it when I have nothing else to watch. Just simply because I enjoy the story and the cast that much. Every person I recommend this show to, can't put it down. They're hooked too. I will recommend this show to anyone who will ask.
10.0~Wowwowow malek_abla Sign in Permalink This serie is wonderfull its addicting from the very first episode what an amazing show 10/10 worth of watching
1.0~Yet more teen angst disguised as drama MrFilmic Sign in Permalink Sadly like the contemporary trend at the moment The 100 is yet another attempt to get teenagers into Sci-Fi. Tho this isn't necessarily a bad thing, like so many other "teen" oriented dramas, attention is on how everybody looks and not on what they're saying or how they're acting. There is a serious lack of realism in so many ways - i.e. where do the earth stranded kids get their hair, make-up and manicures done? How come such a resource stripped "Ark" can afford to send off it's youngest, best looking, (though admittedly slightly naughty)most promising prospects of their generation ? I could go on... This wouldn't be so bad if the plot or the script had any redeeming qualities. The acting isn't terrible, per say, it's just that the words they're given to speak could have been written by a committee, whose only remit is to make a show that gives you the thrills of The Hunger Games and the deep brooding premature emotions of Twilight! Tho popular aspects to go for, deeply sad for non teenage Sci-Fi fans hoping for something more original and less teeny! Anyway in my opinion The 100 is not as good or absorbing as The 4400, for example.
1.0~why, why, why? mirtillomagico Sign in Permalink If even one hundred years locked up in a space station cannot pull out a better script, well, maybe it is true that the human race does not deserve to survive! The embarrassment reigns in front of The 100, all minors, who have never been under Earth's gravity and yet they dance like in a rave; the one that has lived under the floor for 16 years, but flawlessly jumps into the first river ever seen by 4 generations; the much-more-than-minor who becomes the leader of the so-bad-that-nastier-you-cannot in 30 seconds; the class conflicts thrown here and there because in 2014 we are all politically committed; the blondest and most known-it-all main character of all times, the short-sighted politician who wants to save the human race, but perhaps does not know what the gene pool is, etc etc ... the list could be infinite . I'm tempted to write that the problem is the age of the protagonists and the target, but recent unfortunate events (see Terra Nova or Revolution) have shown that even if adults are added, the result does not change. It is not that I'm claiming a Doctor Who all days, but really you, you Hollywood screenwriter cannot do anything better than The 100? Do you really think that teenagers from all over the world were not capable of appreciating a well-written and credible sci-fi story?
1.0~Juvenile hogwash mfrost71w Sign in Permalink I can only assume this was written in the 1980s by the writers of 'Porkys' and its been on the shelf a long time. Excellent premise executed very, very badly. Apart from the sets and the science fiction undercurrent, the entire series seemingly takes place in some 1980s American west coast middle class preppy school and contains every 'angst-ridden teenager' cliché imaginable. As a school drama, its not even as good as 90210 and The O.C., and they weren't very good. A poor man's crude and clumsy Dawsons Creek set in space without any of the fine acting, writing and directing of Dawsons Creek The characters are so cardboard they may as well wear badges - 'good girl', 'arrogant baddie', 'misunderstood rebel', 'whore with heart of gold'. The adults aren't much better and are obviously well aware that they are there just to fill-in the storyline and pad out the story.
7.0~Filming location/plot location/environment now jaelynn9 Sign in Permalink My rating just went up about 1.5 points as I near the end of the 1st season. I think they should have made the setting actually in BC. It's obvious the forest are in the Pacific NW. At least if you live in the state you would know that. Though there are very old forests left in the Blue Ridge Mts, it's just not that lush. I wish the world could/would understand the importance of forest, and I don't mean new ones, I mean the ancient ones and peat/permafrost. It's so sad what humans have done and continue to do our world. It saddens me daily and I do have an extremely low carbon footprint, except that I live in a cold climate, that's where better house design needs to happen and solar power use, and there are safe nuclear methods/techniques out there that can use spent fuel rods from other nuclear plants, but it's expensive. I imagine b/c big oil doesn't want to go out of business, or the materials are hard to source and still damaging to the environment. Sorry to ramble there...I am just dumbfounded by the seemingly lack of concern for our planet.
8.0~I'm hooked 'cause of the leading ladies.... fidothedog7 Sign in Permalink I was hooked after the first couple of shows. And that's because of the four leading ladies - Clarke, Octavia, Raven and yes, Abby. Each one is strong and single minded, with each possessing an unyielding focus. And, it doesn't hurt to be knock-out good looking, too. The combination of those characteristics and good looks is a hook with a big barb. Of course, after a couple of shows one realizes that the Producer and the writers are roaming the woods of British Columbia in desperate search of a story. As noted herein, the premise, the threads (or shreds) of the story are as ridiculous as are transgressions of (mostly) the boys to cause a conflict as a set up for the next episode. In most cases it's bearable to look past this nonsense to catch another glimpse of the leading girls, who probably show up on the set looking great just to be slapped around by Makeup. It just goes to show that good looks and a strong character is great even in a burlap sack. The moment that these strong characters take a dive (as the boys have), I'll deep six the whole show. Do you hear that, Jason?
2.0~First couple episodes were OK, then it became an annoying teen drama go-myco Sign in Permalink Started randomly watching this on Netflix out of boredom. It started out OK. The story was what kept me watching at first because it was interesting. But as I kept watching it just got more and more annoying. Then you realize its just really about a bunch of rebellious teenagers getting back at their parents. All the while doing stupid things and getting themselves killed. Even the one rational character on the show, Clarke loses it and submits to teenage angst. Also a lot of stuff didn't make sense like the massive hurricane that somehow only last a few hours or the acid fog that travels at light speed or the fact that no one eats anything, they just live off rainwater and violence. By the end I was just naming people off that needed to die (which was almost everybody). Quit after the 5th episode of S1.
8.0~Hang on for an amazing show. eagleey Sign in Permalink So here we go. Again a review I write mostly because there are so many bad/negative reviews out there which judge a show after the first 2 episodes. I won't go into any detail but it is one of my favorite shows. The biggest reason for this is the incredible character development. Clarke started a bit to mature, but all the others are childish, short sighted and more or less selfish in the beginning. It is amazing how the writers give everyone the time the need to develop. Starting as some kind of teeny survival 08/15 story it evolves into a thrilling survival/since-fiction series with likable characters, no immortality of main characters, an continuously changing cast of minor roles and an unpredictable story. Yeah some episodes are a bit slow and specially in the beginning you have to sit through once in a while, but it gets better and better. The first episode is around 7/10...and from the beginning of the second I need more than 10 points to describe this series.
6.0~Its so good that is bad or vise versa? introducez Sign in Permalink I cant explain. Can you ever imagine a show that makes you like every character then hate them and vise versa. Best way to explain it is you see everyone at their worst and their best, there is no favorites here. Tolerance and the curiosity of how someone is going to disappoint you next is the darkness of this show that kept me watching until the end. I am not sure If find enjoyment from disappointment or the originality was intriguing. I Prefer darkness in different ways ill give this a 6 personally no other show I wanted to strangle main characters in made me watch 4+ seasons... However the first season is the one that forces you down the rabbit hole with its sense of promising potential
9.0~How is this bad amellekerkhi Sign in Permalink People who give negative reviews about this series because of it being unrealistic are plain stupid. Come on! It's fictional, it can be as unrealistic and scientifically incorrect as it wants to be. Just let go of your attachment to obsess over accuracy and enjoy the show. It had a slow start (as most series do) but it gets really good. Sometimes you just have to bare with it for a little while. And it's especially good if you need something to watch when you're waiting for the awesome stuff (American Horror Story, The Walking Dead, Games of Thrones) to come back on TV. Plus it's a nice change from zombies and gore. I definitely recommend you give it a chance.
7.0~Good Entertainment!! john-boshelle Sign in Permalink There are far too many bad reviews. Yes, I agree the teenager (twilight bandwagon) aspect is hard to swallow at first. But once the story gets flowing, its great entertainment. I think Sci-Fi in general suffers from over critical reviews. Too many people question every realistic aspect, while forgetting it's a story teller's piece of futuristic fiction. If you're able to separate your self away from scrutinising every minor aspect, then give it a go and enjoy well thought-out show, with a few flowing undercurrents. But if you can't immerse yourself, because you are looking for a documentary-window-into-the-future-esc then maybe you should stay away.
7.0~Great, but declining. mrhaydenellis Sign in Permalink The 100 is one of my favourite shows. However, it's been declining. It's starting to be the same thing over and over again and it's getting boring. Season One was amazing, it was well written with a great storyline. Season Two was also really well done, my favourite season. However, the newest season has been really boring. It's the same thing again and again. They need to come up with some new and not the same thing, (ex. they start a war, they go to war, lose some people. People need to escape. Clarke needs to persuade not to kill the other people) Don't get me wrong, it's a good show with a great storyline, but they need to change it up. However, I think season 4 will be the last season.
6.0~give it time to warm up! mikialama Sign in Permalink This show is definitely worth watching, no matter what the naysayers keep going on about! Yes, it started out fairly roughly...major plot holes, not much character development, some horrendous acting, but all of a sudden, it did an about face and actually became surprisingly decent entertainment. It was like the writers, cast, director--everyone involved- -just found their footing, hit their stride and it's all come together. Someone else compared it to the remade Battlestar Galactica, and that's very apt. It's great fun and adventure. Will anyone on it win an award from the Mensa society? Nope. But it's not trying to be anything other than it is...a great romping space opera that this viewer at least really looks forward to seeing more of! Keep up the good work, 100!
1.0~Lamer and more boring each year, Season Five is total crap. crusadermagnus Sign in Permalink This serious has always been infantile, badly written, badly acted and clearly shows the only thing the writers know about survival or real human psychology is what they get from other hollywood trash. The science has always been pathetic again showing lack of any real research or technical advice. If they had a clue they would have hired a real science advisor, a survival advisor, a good psychologist and decent biologist. From the start this show has been excessively about drama shots and teenage romance fantasies about what the post apoc world might be like. The self serving boring monologue speeches are so bad you often find yourself saying STFU and reaching for fast forward. The writers dont have a clue about plotting a story either. They write themselves into situations with at least a half dozen readily available solutions that are clear to anyone with a clue and yet they act like there are only one or two that won't kill all that remains of humanity. It just gets worse and worse and season five is so bad it makes me want to punch out the writers for wasting my time. And the people that say this is done right, really need to get a dose of the real world.
7.0~Better than I expected georgiannapoliti Sign in Permalink Before I watched this show I heard it was kind of lame and a teen drama. While it certainly has the vibe of a teen drama (just like all the other show the CW makes) its really good to watch. Its got a dystopian quality that I love. Its a genre that has a lot to offer but the problem is that it can easily lose track and I think this show does it quit often but its not very important in the end. Its got good characters that have a lot to give. Its got a nice backstory that can keep going for a long time but sometimes I feel like some things are forced into the show. Certain relationships between some characters. Clarke and Lexa's relationship for example makes me feel more awkward than I expected it to be. In my eyes they don't really match. The one really positive thing though is that Clarke is the first bisexual lead character in a show. There's only one thing to say about that...at last. Give this show a go. Its growing on me very much.
6.0~Compelling yet annoying markzed-80806 Sign in Permalink Firstly, I ticked the spoilers box as, while my whingeing is not specific, it may give away some ideas to those that are yet to watch this. The concept of this series was great, the premise a little 'dodgy- but-we'll-live-with-it' and the execution was well-attempted by all. The writing, however, drove me nuts. The show could have easily been called "The 100 Bad and ill-timed Decisions". In attempting to heighten/prolong the drama, characters would make such stupid game-changing decisions, forcing me to smack my forehead in frustration throughout the series. Someone in charge set this show to 90% conflict and 8% angst (not to mention 2% female-on-female action), and all manner of shenanigans ensued to maintain that level. Loyalty-switching was all the rage. (I can't say, "Like they changed their underwear", because Grounders probably go commando). There were various timely yet ill-advised massacres to ensure that peace existed only during the ad-breaks. There were several cliff-hanger countdown moments that were missed due to lengthy hand-wringing and "Hey, we know that time is running out but let's pull dramatic faces and talk about it some more". A sprinkling of common-sense decisions would have made this so much more enjoyable. I should mention the good stuff before I run out of puff. Ricky Whittle as Lincoln gets top marks for the Grounder torn between two cultures. Alycia Debnam-Carey nailed the role of Lexa. All that violence in such a cute package. In conclusion, this is a very watchable drama but viewers will understand my frustrations as it unfolds.
1.0~Hype ARKspeed Sign in Permalink This is total Bullshit man, It would have been a Great movie, but a TV series...NO WAY.. It's total crap. I got frustrated after 30 mins of pilot. That too, i was forcing myself to give this series a chance (Due to Octavia), But i believe CW is turning into TRP Whores. They should rather hire prostitutes and create a CW Brothel. Waste of time. Also i have discovered one thing, if there are retarded Songs in-between the show, to "MOOD UP" things, then the show will be so retarded, that your brain will turn up into a wood. Then again, The Originals also have those songs, but they have some sort of concept which makes it like a puzzle. Breaking Bad was the ONLY show that gave me high. Game of Thrones as well. Moreover, the show is very ill-directed there are things being told, that is not at all required and making very poor attempt at Special Effects.
1.0~Don't trust the high rating DanieDisney Sign in Permalink This show is horrible. The acting = horrible. The plot = horrible. The directing = horrible. The most irritating being the main actress, who can't act. If you have never seen the movie "The Room", then you may not understand when I say it's THAT bad. They spit out their lines and don't give time to react. It's unintentionally hilarious. I just watched an episode where the main actress yelled a question at someone repeatedly and then without pause, which would have allowed a reaction, she then yelled for them to "say something". Really, just don't waste your time. It's a massive disappointment. The premise is intriguing, but it's poorly executed.
6.0~funny characters ataherzadeh-45793 Sign in Permalink There are sexy girls like clarke who are in charge.it's not acceptable that these characters can be leaders.it's a joke.
1.0~Pathetic jcorreia1977 Sign in Permalink The plot and idea are actually the only things that are awesome, as all else fails miserably: bad actors, made by and for teens, everyone's handsome, pearly white teeth included, the ridiculous groupie thing and pseudo-romance that belongs to teens' world,... I mean, check the first episode of the series, only then can you see why words fail to describe this... this... whatever this is. I'm a massive sci-fi fan, and needless to say I've been toasted lately with such amazing series as Fringe, Salem, Penny Dreadful,etc. but for each good release, why must there be dozens of series that make no sense at all? For every X-Files, True Detective and The Sopranos there's at least twenty series like The 100.
10.0~How Do I Contact the show creators? misswheats Sign in Permalink Absolutely amazing show! I just started watching it recently. I started it on March 28th and I've already completed season 1 and 2 (April.2). It has really inspired me to try to find you guys. I wish to contact the creators as I would love nothing more than to help! I am a useful crew member, I am an actress, and I am a makeup artist currently enrolled in VFS. I have been acting for two years now and I have years more experience in makeup. I would love to give any or all of my skills to help you. As well as learn new skills that I have seen on your show. I would love an opportunity to volunteer so I can meet you all. I am also local living in North Vancouver. How can I reach you? I'd like to show you my portfolio to show you I am useful. Thank you.
7.0~Entertaining show, but not perfect jskeast Sign in Permalink I have only watch the first season, and while I would not call it amazing in any regards, I did find myself binge-watching it on netflix. In my opinion, for someone who either likes teen dramas or scifi apocalypse, its worth a showing and worth more credit than a lot of people are giving it. Setting: This is where I think the show excels. While the premise of the show seems far-fetched in the beginning, reasonable explanations are given as the show progresses. There are two settings, on earth and in space. The space is filled with politics, and pretty straight forward. None of the characterization in space had much depth. I felt (compared to many other reviewers) that given the limitations of supplies in space, most of the policies in space were acceptable, if not believable. On the ground, it is pretty much what one would expect of a high school camp with no guidance, which fits the setting perfectly. I actually thought they did a good job with the progressions of the kids personalities as the show progressed. Cast: Nothing amazing, but certainly standard for television, better than low budget TV. I thought all characters were cast extremely well, and were able to pull off either their own character, no matter how simplistic or deep their character was. I also noticed the lead cast would constantly portray their character even when the scene was not focused on them. (not for true for the minor characters). Some scenes and shots felt lazy, but I attribute this more towards the writing. Visual Effects: Not much to say, good for television. Did not interfere with the story. Some props were obviously fake, but they did a great job with the world. The show is graphic and would not recommend for children (blood, punctures, sex scenes, etc), no full nudity. Writing: Was OK. There were a lot of lines that were forced to insure the audience knew what was going on, even if it was explained the scene before, and often it felt like the wrong character was saying the lines. I don't have much else to say here, but in a word, lazy. TLDR: Check it out if you want a sci-fi Apocalypse. In 2 episodes, you know what you are going to get.
8.0~It's getting good! gjustinj Sign in Permalink The series was off to a slow start, but it is getting better and better. The premise is original and fun, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is no doubt about it that this show is one to keep an eye on, it seems it gets darker each episode, but with that said that could also end up killing the show as a lot of viewers have accepted its violence so far because it has been done tastefully, without too much gore. Most of the bloodier scenes take place in a dark place or is carefully done by camera angles to get the point across but to not upset the CW's typical viewers, and this is great in a world of The Walking Death and Game of Thrones, etc. It's a welcome method of delivering the same intensity without being overly grotesque. There are too many negative comments on this website regarding this show, it's getting good! I expect to see this series renewed soon.
1.0~Feels so teenage.. tokalak Sign in Permalink So far away from scientists.. we can count 100 reasons to stop watching this..
10.0~Yet another show to binge watch!! baliakashbali Sign in Permalink I always give a 10 on 10 to a show that is way too amazing to be binge watched... and the 100 is yet another show that keeps you craving for more and more... and you gotta accept it for what it is... A drama CW show!! There is a mention on some of the reviews of this one... that the show starts slow... hell no!! It has a certain grip on you right from the first episode itself!! Good characters... amazing plots... and surely it has come a long way since its first episode of season 1!! Reapers, grounders, mountain men and the 100 so far... I am pretty unsure right now what more is on its way... because I am still midway through the season 2... and there's 2 more seasons to go!! Watch it.. you wont be disappointed!!
8.0~Kill Clark already! iedli Sign in Permalink When are you going to kill Clark? That confused serial betrayer needs to be dead!
10.0~i am loving this show sebastianav99 Sign in Permalink this TV show is just amazing. it has romance, mystery, adventure, suspense, and action. it's the perfect show, every episode makes you want you to see the next episode, and you cant stop watching it.if you aren't watching this show then you should and believe me you will love it. it has good acting, good storyline, it has everything you want for your entertainment. with this second season i am just getting excited more and more, because its awesome everything thats happening. i don't know why this show has been rated as seven, at least it should be eight actually. this show is in top 5 of the best TV shows in 2014 (its actually number 4). i just hope this show doesn't get canceled because that would be a shame, because this show is too amazing. after the third episode everything just start to get better and better.
1.0~Total Utterly Garbage marcoaaj Sign in Permalink I was looking for something new to watch on Netflix and hey, a 7.8 start sci-fi series seems a good choice, right? Couldn't be more wrong... I gave it a chance and watched the first three episodes but nothing in this series make sense. The dialogues are as shallow as the characters and the plot; or plots, as there are dozens of plots happening at the same time. Most of them senseless. This is not a science fiction series, it is just Beverly Hill 90210 in the middle of the jungle with stupid characters and story. The most impressive part of this series is how it managed to achieve such a high score in IMDB!
10.0~Brilliant! Hooked from the start Ashleypl5 Sign in Permalink Have to admit, I normally avoid this genre of TV Show as it isn't normally something that appeals to me, but I was so hooked on this show. Love the characters that get introduced over the seasons, and adore Octavia and Lincoln. The second season was the best of the two, and the plot had me wanting to keep watching. Needless to say I binge watched it over a weekend and enjoyed it a lot! The Mount Pleasant plot was brilliant and cleverly thought out, i think it did well to show the battle of survival and as much as I am not a fan of Clarke even i felt a little sorry for her having to bear the burden of her actions in the final episode! Cannot wait for season 3! 10/10 - Would definitely recommend this show !
2.0~what is the point of naming after a book that is nothing alike melovemovies Sign in Permalink what is the point of naming a TV show after a book that is suppose to be based after said book that is absolutely nothing alike!!! what is the point of naming a TV show after a book that is suppose to be based after said book that is absolutely nothing alike!!! what is the point of naming a TV show after a book that is suppose to be based after said book that is absolutely nothing alike!!! what is the point of naming a TV show after a book that is suppose to be based after said book that is absolutely nothing alike!!! what is the point of naming a TV show after a book that is suppose to be based after said book that is absolutely nothing alike!!! now its 10 lines!!!!!!
10.0~LOVE barkerchelsey Sign in Permalink I absolutely love Season 1 & 2, I've watched them 3x. Really wish that they would have continued.
10.0~One of the Best kept Secrets on Television! eckhouse24 Sign in Permalink I never heard of The 100 Until I was going through Netflix. I read the plot line and was surprised to hear this was a show on the CW. I watched the first couple of episodes and I understood why it was on the CW. But then something happened. I kept watching and the show kept getting better and edgier. As I continued to Season 2 the show just kept keeping me involved with these characters. Characters that started off annoying and whiny became very well developed and for every choice they made, there was a reason and not just lets do it. The show has a dark tone to it but under it all, there is light. And though at first, the script, the lines that these people were saying came right out of cheesefest, it too got better. And the acting became so much more believable. Now, the premise is questionable, but who cares. Most shows have a premise that is questionable. I loved Breaking Bad, but was that a really believable premise. We can question the logic of any TV series or movie or just sit back and be entertained and believe that what ever they are telling us is a part of their world, not our world. I look forward to Season 3 and will not miss an episode.
10.0~Wonderfully acted, many people's criticisms are far off in my opinion, I address them here ProfessorX2 Sign in Permalink I started reading the reviews for this show and was actually shocked. I love this show so much! After reading a lot of the criticisms I realized a lot of people have similar issues with the show: 1. Several people have mentioned that it is ridiculous that people are killed for minor offenses when there is only 4000 people left. Do these people even watch this show? A space station is only so big. They already have laws in place that nobody can have more than one child so overpopulation doesn't become an issue. The point is to keep the human race alive at any cost. With that in mind it's really not that unbelievable that they would kill people for any offense. It's a good threat to hang over people's heads to keep order in an already small area and it also helps with overpopulation. This is not even remotely a stretch in my mind. I think it is an interesting aspect of the show 2. The reason they didn't ask for volunteers and sent the prisoners to the ground is because they didn't want anyone else on the space station to know there was an issue. There was a whole episode with flashbacks showing how Clarke's father wanted to tell everyone about the life support issue. The rest of the council thought there would be anarchy on the ark if people knew life support was failing. This is totally understandable. If people believed they were all going to die it is a lot more likely that they would freak out than sit down calmly and try to think of a solution. It was easier to close off the prison so nobody would know the 100 were gone than ask for volunteers and risk anarchy 3. The people saying this is a teen drama show have likely never seen an actual teen drama show. So far the 100 is clear of any teen pregnancy or prom drama. I guess people think that the whole love triangle that seems to be emerging makes it a teen drama? Since no other shows of value have ever had a love triangle before? Most teen dramas don't have multiple deaths by the third episode. I just don't see it. In my opinion this show does a wonderful job of presenting an interesting storyline and the acting is fantastic. They have developed complex characters and relationships already as any good show does. Bob Morley in particular plays a very complex character who blurs the lines between good and evil for the people he loves. I really hope this show gets renewed!
10.0~Great storytelling, visionary bara007 Sign in Permalink Great show, always evolving. It think season 3 now got even better. It really tries to give something to think about - which is now rare withstories - even though it is not likable and rough at times, in the end it is worth it. It doesn't try to take the EASY way out. Each season is just like watching a separate movie - everything borough to life in such detail. The story is passionate, the actors are engaging and skilled, the story takes a hold on you and doesn't let go. Until it is all over - .... in good or in bad.
10.0~excellent!! didiny25 Sign in Permalink Must watch every episode packed with suspense. Must watch. Great acting. Fall in love with all the characters
8.0~Full throttle action sci fi adventure tv robertemerald Sign in Permalink For a sci fi series to be credible it must have science that is at least plausible (even if liberties are taken with progress in the future), it must be thought provoking and meaningful (some sort of vision, hopefully, for humans, useful vision) and it must be faithful to a special effects or visual department that means the script, ideas, actors, etc, don't have to carry the story alone. The 100 delivers on all counts, in fact, its probably the best future scenario for a post-nuclear holocaust show that I've ever seen. The vision is far reaching yet believable, and beautiful, so its a pleasure to see, great vistas and good cgi. I've read criticism about plot holes for this series, but given the pool of humanity is so much reduced, then these are unfair. Mistakes are luminous in a small group, less likely and less luminous in a huge population. Granted, its a teenage action drama with plenty of fighting and bitching. Why not? I've docked it a point for a promise in the early episodes of dangerous new wildlife, which never really happened, but only a point because over the next two seasons dangerous wildlife do make occasional dramatic appearances once a season. I docked it another point for the soundscape. On occasion there is a perfect emotive song playing, or some good emotive chorus or electronics, but that's used sparingly and overall the show is too tied to old-school strings in this regard. This is an important contribution to television science fiction, and great fun to watch. The actors are superb. The costumes are superb. The sets are amazing, and get a level better with every series. The story is highly original, and highly unpredictable. I highly recommend The 100 to all ages over 16. It's never boring, not for a second. I love it and I'm way past 50!
10.0~So good! mail-19035 Sign in Permalink Definitely one of the best sci-fi series out there, if not the best! Season 5 is so far my favorite!
7.0~Give it a chance,it gets better. didebetul111 Sign in Permalink Okay. I'm not afraid to admit that I started this show because of Bob Morley and some other personal reasons related to him. Almost everybody who saw the pilot claimed that it was the worst show they'd ever seen. I felt bad for the people who made this show,truly. So I thought maybe I should watch it,give it a chance and see it myself. The first 4 episodes I think,were extremely terrible,true. I thought I couldn't stand the plot holes and the bad acting anymore but I thought I should at least finish season 1 but then the show suddenly turned around and started to get better. Acting was improving,storyline was getting even more interesting. Season finale was actually really good and I wanted to see the next season and it was suddenly darker and better. I liked this show. If you ignore some of the details and note that no Sci-fi show is perfect,it's a good show. Enjoyable. People really need to stop judging the shows just by watching the pilot. It's going really great right now and if you can make it through the first 4 or 5 episodes then you'll see the good stuff coming ahead. Also God bless Bob Morley and his fake American accent voice.
9.0~Well worth watching jacobpierce-32961 Sign in Permalink Absolutely edge of your seat. The first season is a little slow but after that, it is very addicting
9.0~Epic as-20804 Sign in Permalink You will stop watching other series if you start watching this one..You will not get bored of the "100".So much suspense,Mistery and Thrill...Loved this..
3.0~Season 2 was it's peak. Now it just feels meaningless and repetitive because of the bad writing Halopalo Sign in Permalink (A science-fiction series about teenagers sent on Earth to examine if it's finally livable again after a nuclear apocalypse that happened almost 100 years ago and forced the survivors to live in space stations.) In the beginning of season 1, the 100 was basically a cheesy teen show, but then at some point the tone changed. And season 2 was what it could have been as its best: a show that explores what is morally right and wrong when you are desperate to survive. How far can you go and still be deserving of surviving? There was still unintended melodramatic tackiness in it, but it was going to the right direction. But instead of continuing with this tone and enhancing and deepening the morality aspect, they decided in season 3 to go for a shock value road. Traumatic things just happen now to characters but they are never really explored. They build up tension, then there's the shocking moment, and then it's ignored. Viewers don't get a satisfying emotional payoff for the suspense. It's like the writers are fixated serving "unexpected" shock value moments after another. I write "unexpected", because in reality they are just repeating story lines and doing do overs from a slightly different ankle. Unexpected deaths become expected deaths. Especially if you are a love interest for one of the main characters... The writers don't seem to care that much, what these traumatic moments and hardships would actually do to a person and how that should affect the writing of these characters in the long run. It's forgotten or it's explained away with an off screen development. Or you can just write that chip in the character's head made the character do it, so does it even matter what they did, said etc.? Things just happen because they happen. Because it's "shocking", because "you don't see it coming", because it's "surprising"... The morality aspect and the emotional effects are wiped away. Basically whatever the characters do, they just write them to parrot: "it's us against them, I had to do it, you had to do it, my people, my people, my people, for our people". No deeper push or a meaning is needed for a genocide. No deeper meaning is needed for wanting your sibling suddenly to die, no deeper meaning is needed to torture someone etc. Even child abuse is presented simply as a way to protect that child, because the child is "my people, us against them, I torture my child, so no one else can use her etc.". And then it's ignored. Everything is fine again. It's very cheap writing. Characters become just soulless plot devices who never stop to think or feel or reflect what's happening and what are they doing. They just do whatever they have to while repeating those same old catchphrases like brain-dead robots. There is also no reason to trust any character development you think you see on the screen, because the writers seem to get fed up easily with previously written character arcs. So the characters and relationships are basically rewritten in every season. It's really odd that also the relationships form "as a surprise". The writers seem to think that it would be boring, if there's actual on screen development and the viewers would see the relationships evolving. It has to be a shock and a surprise too. But anyways, by season 5 you don't even recognize the characters anymore. I guess it's fun for the writers and the actors, as they get to do something new and play a different character every season, but this leads viewers to feel detached. There is no continuation or coherence in the storytelling. The characters don't learn anything. It's like they forget what they have experienced. They repeat the same things or are continuously unable to see the other side, even though they have self experienced that other side! And when viewers become more and more detached because of this poor and lazy writing, it leads to a realization that you don't even care who survives anymore. Which is pretty bad if you are watching a survival show. The choice to mix up relationships, dynamics and even personalities and writing the characters to betray someone just because suddenly "my people" is different than previously, makes all their bonds seem meaningless. One moment they are friends and the next moment they torture each other, betray each other, leave each other to die etc. And again these things are ignored. They just write a fast and easy fix to start a new plot with new dynamics. Viewers don't get to see the effects of betrayals on their relationships. Characters don't really discuss about these things either. The dialogue becomes more and more shallow and by season 5 characters basically just repeat already used catchphrases. It's very hard to sell these relationships as something true and deep, when characters don't ever really seem to talk honestly and directly with each other. How can you claim that your main characters are soul mates and best friends, when you don't write them to talk to each other? It's so odd it becomes extremely funny when the characters have their most "meaningful" discussions through middle hands. They use for example the other one's child or the other one's significant other as messengers. Or even a dead girlfriend who talks through the head of the other one's child! Whatever it takes to avoid an actual direct conversation, I guess. For some reason the writers just don't want to let their own main characters, who are supposed to be best friends, to talk to each other. Weir, weird, weird. So it's a very, very plot driven show. Which is kind of ironic, bc there's also a lot of plot holes in it. And because the writers have such an urge to invent something new all the time (it's predictable nonsense most of the time) and reinvent the characters, all the twists and turns and shocks feel very forced if you pay closer attention to them. So even a plot driven viewer needs to ignore quite a lot of stuff to enjoy it. When the pace is quick enough, I guess ignoring is possible. But when there's time to reflect what actually was shown, you probably start to feel like someone thinks you are a very stupid viewer to write something like this and thinking it's good enough. For a viewer who enjoys watching the development of the characters, it becomes a very frustrating show. If you like to understand the characters, get to know how they think and feel, and how situations effect them, this is definitely not a show for you.
6.0~This show sucks but you'll still want to watch it mdnoman_hyder Sign in Permalink If you combine almost every stereotypical post apocalyptic cliches , and then added bad acting, disappointing meaningless deaths and then add " this is war" or "we're at war" a million times- then you get - the 100. You'll be annoyed with high school type teen drama, and you'll also be yelling at major characters especially Clarke. But you'll still want to watch it though.
3.0~Smug teens mrdestroyer2001 Sign in Permalink I have long wanted to watch this series, because the idea of bringing people back to the post-apocalyptic Earth was attracted, the creators of the film had a lot of opportunities to make candy out of the plot, but for some reason they did not use them. So what we see. The crowd of teenagers who have landed reminds more likely the students of the modern American college, but not the prisoners-rebels from the spacecraft. The behavior is appropriate, self-righteous dialogues in the spirit of "who is the coolest here", "ancestors suck", etc. The adolescent society immediately after landing is divided into anarchists and Komsomol members, but neither those nor others cause the slightest sympathy. A squad of Komsomol members is led by an arrogant blonde who does not consult and reckon with anyone, leaves pity to anarchists for their own, even if their former, friend, to kill several people to go on a life-threatening search for a kidnapped team member on uncharted territory. And while she is a positive character? The leader of anarchists also does not shine with originality, his behavior can be painted in steps. Sweet couple also does not cause any sympathy, their love is more like a hormonal explosion and narcissism. Sometimes local residents-mutants flash in the frame, and a strange yellow fog appears, but the main characters don't care about them, because this interferes with their personal life and self-affirmation. In the hope that all is not lost, we look at the space station. But no, a set of templates is waiting for us and there - a bad chancellor, a good chancellor and trusting citizens. It's amazing how flat and uninteresting the bad chancellor played by Henry Ian Cusick turned out to be, from the very beginning he has positioned himself as an unambiguous villain, although from the role it was possible to squeeze more charisma, more game, but not fate, you see. The soundtrack is also at the level of the template for the teens series, so even for him I don't want to increase the rating.
10.0~Hands down the best show I have ever watched in my life. I'm 27 years old. halarachel Sign in Permalink This series is so exceptional!!!!!! I may not get to watch it live all the time but that doesn't mean I don't want to. I love every single season. It's so well thought out and every actress and actor fit their roles so well. It's exciting, sad, there's romance, there's action, there's war there's peace there is so much to this show and would many twists. It never gets boring. EVER.i could go on and on but I'll end on the his note... please don't stop this series I actually look forward to it and have become a big big fan. Thanks for allowing me to write a review and hope it helps with the decision to keep this amazing show going.
1.0~E4 vs Amazon Video byondkakarot Sign in Permalink This is a review for all you amazon prime viewers who decided to fork over your hard earned cash to Amazon for the privilege of watching The 100. We have been played. Next time a show is available on amazon and somewhere else simultaneously. Opt for the other choice because it Amazon literally charges us for nothing. You could watch the same show on E4 on demand app and it's free.
2.0~Each season gets worse and worse matthewwatts-35413 Sign in Permalink When the first season aired i really quite enjoyed the 100 as it had that Walking Dead feel that anyone could be killed. But by season 2 the plot and themes had completely changed and so had everything good about the first season. I have personally not watched the full 3rd season (just a few episodes here and there) and it is full of cliché and unrealistic dialogue as well as a completely ridiculous and far different plot line to the one in season 1. I would recommend the first season but stop there, do not ruin the characters you came to love by watching any further as they are ruined completely because their priorities completely change as do their personalities.
8.0~It's aging nicely. marcsmail-93180 Sign in Permalink I think season 5 is by far the best effort yet. I'm looking forward to season 6.
10.0~Its starts slow but Season 2 gets insanely good and it keeps getting better rayannawaz Sign in Permalink Its pretty cliché on paper but its unique from other apocalyptic shows.Its starts off a little boring and stale but season 2 of the show is insanely good. Its one of the most underrated shows and I will even go as far as comparing it to Game of Thrones. I recommend you to watch it.
10.0~Amazing Pilot zeeshan005 Sign in Permalink I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st episode and cant wait to see more. I just hope the writers focus more on the struggle of mankind than the teen angle and all the drama that comes with it. Yes it is about a hundred teens dropped on post apocalyptic earth but the whole time in space idea should have changed humanity including the teen populace. It would be nice to see how they show the changed human nature. And Plus acting was pretty good for the main characters and they did a decent job of it. The only thing I did not understand was the whole nuclear disaster and radiation in a completely healthy and beautiful might I add forest environment. Doesn't feel very apocolyptic. So far I am hooked and I hope the CW give it a decent chance.
8.0~Outstanding entertainment, being sold short by one time viewers! ryzah Sign in Permalink I will hold my hands up and agree the the first episode was diabolical, for a teenage audience and with many floors, but as nothing else was on, on a Monday evening, I thought I'd give the show a chance and Zeus's beard am I glad I did. Firstly, I want to challenge what negative reviews have said about the premise. *Only 100 'juvenile delinquents'? As stated by most of the same 'haters' the ship is highly regimented and therefore it is highly unlikely there would be more. *Everybody looking too good? Nobody ever looked slap up and it's a void, petty argument, based on the fact that the actors are good looking! Unfortunately that's how it is and I certainly wouldn't want to be watching ugly people for an hour a day when I get that in real life! *Sending the fittest down, rather than the week or elderly? Surely the fittest will have a better chance of survival from the drop, landing and survival of whatever's down there and they'd done wrong - Those be the rules? I could go on, as the show actually answers many of these as the episodes unfold. Once you take the series as it is- That being Science Fiction (Emphasis on the 'Fiction' part) It's edge of your seat, can't wait to tune in next week, brilliance! The acting is extremely solid for a cast of young actors, which makes for believable scenes and emotional moments and you really do feel for the characters. After watching 'Revolution' and the tripe that is 'Under the Dome' for full seasons, it is clear 'The 100' has some of the best young actors in the business, when you compare them to the laughable acting in the two aforementioned programs! The change of scenes from ground, to space is excellent and the special effects are great without being too overbearing. The best thing about the show truly is how dark it became very quickly, again, without being over the top blood and gore. It keeps you guessing from minute to minute and as quoted in the show "The more we find out, the less we really know" is a superb tag line for the show! Each episode leads on brilliantly to the epic finale, that proceeds to an outstanding cliffhanger, allowing the show to go on in any direction; but also closing a few doors and unanswered questions behind!! Here's to the new series and anyone willing to grit through the first episode I recommend 'The 100' for a roller-coaster of a show! "We will see you again"
8.0~Improving every episode klaas-wijnsma Sign in Permalink I am not a critic nor am I a fan from the start. Critic means criticism and that's mostly negative. Are their loopholes, yes. Are some things unrealistic, yes. But get through the first 3 episodes, when the pretty faces are covered in dirt and blood and it heats up. The do good girl Clarke with the rebel Bellamy. The perfect son in law finn with the kickass Raven, the pretty and tough octavia, the characters are well set in to the world beyond the bombs. Getting into season 2 I am sure this series will keep many entertained. The pace is good and it keeps me entertained. I think most of you will. Unless you just want to critize
4.0~Does humanity deserve to live? ihatemyles Sign in Permalink This whole series is like Lord of the Flies. However, I think the kids from 1990 classic had more common sense than the people in this new series, and why did they send one hundred degenerates with no means of communication. The people of the Ark are no better. They have no problem blowing engineers, doctors, and people that could make a difference out of the air locks. This T.V. show could have been great, but it left me saying, "Does humanity deserve to live if we are this completely stupid." I think I watched my last episode tonight, and just like Revolution I'm taking this title off my play-list. I want better T.V. from the writers of Hollywood, is this to much to ask, or do I stop giving shows involving kids as leaders a chance. To be continued . . .
10.0~Great show and character development steevall27 Sign in Permalink Don't expect reality. It's a sci-fi drama. Get through half of the first season and you'll love it.
3.0~Too Young... drazenpranjic88 Sign in Permalink Well...i love Sci-Fi! especially post apocalyptic ones, but this... i just can't take it serious enough... Like i said in my summary it misses experienced older people down there not some damn whole life locked up kids who don't know anything. Great idea let's send all our young people the last hope of humanity to check things out and risk their life, we can make new one yeah... And then their send back on the planet to check things out it's the survival of the human race we're talking about not who's got the better makeup, body or who's going with who on a date... Everything's there the football player, cheerleader, leader, whore, nerd etc.. That scene where she takes off here clothes...posing like she's a top model and jumping into water, getting only scratched by a monster and then saved by the hero, but don't worry everything will be fine they got a girl who's got the instinct to keep everyone safe..... The acting is terrible with so many unwanted stuff it makes you wanna break something. The music oh my God.. the music it's better to watch it in mute mode when it begins or don't if you like high school musicals, movies, series whatever!
9.0~Love it anapodgornii Sign in Permalink Each season is getting better, can't wait for season 6
5.0~It gets better DennisLaursen89 Sign in Permalink I've watched the first season, and I must say, it actually gets better over the time. In the first episodes, it looks more like a bad teen-drama with jealous girls, macho boys, other stereotypes, and a lot of intrigues, rather than a sci-fi show. Yes, there is a lot of teen-drama, especially in the first episodes. And yes, there is a bunch of plot holes. And I was about to give up on the show. But I sense a developing in the plot, so I decide to give it another change. And the show actually gets better, and the teen-angers are reduced to a tolerable level. However, not enough to that I will give the show a higher overall rating than 5 out of 10 stars. But still enough to that I will watch season 2 too.
10.0~Worth it! Get past the first 3 episodes and you'll be hooked! FOR ALL AGES! peeka_b Sign in Permalink This show is seriously underrated simply because it's on CW. I'll admit, it sure started out like a teenage drama show for the first 2 episodes max. The show has such a fast pace from then on though and focuses so much more on survival than teenage drama. Yes there is drama. But even when the main character gets into a love triangle, the characters are mature about it and move on. Instead of the girls being catty and fighting, they shrug it off and work together to make sure everyone can live. It also happens to be one of the darkest shows on TV now. It shows the harsh nature of humanity and how far people are willing to go to survive. A group of juvenile delinquents morphs into a group needing to go to war and torture people. Season 2 is so dark with every episode and every single episode pushes the plot along. There has yet to be an episode that leaves me unsatisfied simply because they don't waste a second. Overall, it may not have the best script but the plot is intense and the characters are so lovable. If you get past the first few episodes, you'll see that the show breaks down the idea of having a definite bad guy and shows the blurred lines that are created when dealing with life and death.
4.0~Clusterf**k evilsync Sign in Permalink Clusterf**k after clusterf**k that can only happen under a matriarchy.
7.0~An interesting blend of recent and old trends in Post Apocalyptic medias. DLSchindler Sign in Permalink A century from now an orbital city has a population running low on life support. One hundred juvenile delinquents are sent down to Earth to see if they can survive so that further colonization might follow them. They will find themselves divided, leaderless, facing Post-Apocalyptic dangers and a wilderness. They are expendable, a hundred red-shirts wearing monitoring bracelets. Meanwhile things in space keep escalating. The story seems to be a blend of Elysium, Hunger Games, and After Earth and lots of older movies like Lord of the Flies, Recon 2020 and Breakfast Club. Refreshingly well written and pretty good casting. Intended towards a teenage or young adult audience but with an intricate amount of depth, group dynamics and slightly-not-stereotyped characters. Additionally with a side plot involving adult characters who seem to behave worse than the kids back in space, executing Doctors for using too much medicine or Engineers for reporting problems in the life support systems and arguing over who-killed-who constantly. Might remind some viewers of recent trends in video games also. I think it wouldn't be too late/too tacky to have a double-digit number in the corner of the screen counting down 'the hundred title characters' as they are eliminated.
2.0~Same old story. imahotmama Sign in Permalink As an avid viewer of the 100 I was satisfied with how it ended in season 5 as a series finale. Season 6 is slow and needs new writers. Same stories different locations. Extremely difficult to watch as it just drags on.
10.0~A MUST WATCH!!! ekaterinaleposa Sign in Permalink Just amazing... You will be soo hooked! Personaly season 2 is the Best. And the ending of season 5? Woow couldvn be better!!!
10.0~all I can say is wow, I was hooked in first 10 bergensteinlinda Sign in Permalink T best show on t.v.. I would love to be in an episode of this. Would be a dream come true. Awesome. Can't wait for the next set. It This show is one that is far ahead of our time, and so close to the truth of what will happen in the future on earth. If we continue to destroy everything God has given us, we will end up just like the 100 shows us. Think about this as you cause wars, kill, Rob, beat, starve, abuse the land. That will be our future. Is this what we really want our grand children to live like, or die like. Wake up world. BIt is coming sooner than you think. So many dangers await the sky people and the grounders, that they haven't even dreamt of. Beings beneath the earth, that radiation has effected, in horrible ways.
4.0~The more things change the more they stay the same. barbya15 Sign in Permalink It started out ok, got interesting and then every season is the same thing... over and over again....
9.0~The evolution of the characters of the series and the way they think and take decisions, are points in favor of the serial, and decisions are dominated by decisions are fatefu Yaser_3isaa Sign in Permalink When I want to watch a series I am very interested in the evolution of characters and transformation of the series, this series is a living example of the evolution of characters, I have seen the four seasons so far, and I found that the characters turn and change the print and the way of thinking in making decisions, for example there is a character in the series was yesterday naive and looking About fun and entertainment and rely on others to defend themselves, and then after the passage of many events and face, today became someone else, fighting for what you believe in and even lead and inspire others. It is also calculated that decisions made by characters are often fateful decisions (whether we are or not), which puts us as viewers and watchers watching what happens next. Relations in the series are complex and some of them - from my personal opinion - is unclear and may be illogical and should not be included in the series can be abandoned. The serial deserves to continue and give it a chance, it reminds me of the series (Breaking Bad) in terms of the transformation of characters, the disadvantage of such serials that the events of development may be relatively slow, but after the development of this series becomes more interesting, you may feel bored at first, Opportunity, you will touch the essence of this series and live events as if you are part of it. Finally, it may be a series of science fiction and drama, but it touches something of our reality and opened a narrow window to what may be our future.
2.0~Tween drama on a radioactive Earth. boyanajj Sign in Permalink The premise is simple and in other circumstances would work quite well, but what this show massively suffers from is it's target. It's obviously pushed towards teens, and for some unknown reason that meant that all main characters are some teenage criminals propelled down to a still very-much radioactive Earth in order to find hope for humanity. Here's the thing. First of all, can anyone please tell me what's the point in jailing up tween criminals if you're going to execute them regardless after the become of age? That's just a stupid waste of resources. Second, did the officials on that space boat do not realize that a bunch of spiteful delinquents are going to go all Lord of the Flies the moment their bottoms hit mother Earth?! That's the dumbest control group I've ever seen. Further making it clear they can take off those dumb bracelets was also a glaring mistake. Do not even get me started on the glowing forest/two-headed deer/giant snake. And finally, while some characters have some sort of self-preservation skills the rest of them are literally too stupid to live, which definitely does little to garner any sympathy in me as a viewer.
6.0~Good concept gone terribly wrong and bad acting icuruok Sign in Permalink Season 1 made a good impression less the awful acting. The plot is there in the start of this series but, wipes out in seasons 2 and 3. Comes back in seasons 4 and 5 but, the acting only gets worse and the season 5 finale doesn't make me want to tune in to any more episodes, should they be in the works. What started out as a hopeful series sure seemed like a lot of silliness in the last episode of season 5. I would rate with less stars but, the special effects are watch-worthy the majority of the time and the categories of those who returned to earth were chosen well.
6.0~I watch it while I do house work pazzintexas Sign in Permalink I have made it through 3 seasons so I find it entertaining enough to watch but I put it in the category of "no thinking necessary". I watch it while I do housework in my free time. Nothing is ever really important enough to have to rewind when it regains my full attention. It does enough.
6.0~Ridiculous monitors adytzu_blaze Sign in Permalink I quite like the show except for a brutal lapse in the script. I mean come on! They have the technology to monitor vitals from space but as soon as they take off the monitors they show "Transmission terminated" and everybody thinks that person is dead... Wouldn't it make sense for the monitors to read vital signs if the person is alive, read a flat-line if the person is dead and only if the monitor is taken off to read "Transmission terminated"? That way they would know if the person is dead or if they only taken off their monitor. This piece of controversy is what turns me away from this show. They could have put more thought in the script or at least hire a technical consultant if the writers are technically challenged...
10.0~It's a teen drama, but it's good, very good jaspersmit-13447 Sign in Permalink The 100 does something not many series can do, it gets better with every season, the character development is great and realistic. Honestly I don't know exactly what to say other than that this is a great series with an actually good story and writing that makes sense. There aren't huge plotholes which is extremely important for a sci-fi show.
6.0~This show needs change in season 5 or it should get the end mimikarasu Sign in Permalink First it was kinda ok but then in next seasons it just lost my taste..lot of "teen romance".. scifi twilight or what.. Season 5 seems like the best one lately, lets say like a little light in a long dark tunnel, but i think in this story too much is not good i hope its not gonna be like previous seasons..then it needs to end or maybe give it a break..
1.0~Really bad mryouwho-988-38888 Sign in Permalink This is a teen show for stupid, obese, "trump voting" Americans. There aren't plot holes, because there isn't any plot. The characters just randomly change personality throughout the series (often even within the same episode!) fulfill whatever stupid "five year old" ideas the silly writer came up with while being drunk/high. Nothing makes sense or is believable in the chain of events. The highest voted ratings above 7 have the below comments, which are always a great indication of a good show: "You have to accept it for what it is" "Please bear with the first few episodes" "The series was off to a slow start" "First impression, low budget acting and mediocre scripters." Ah people never stopped surprising me with their idiocy!
2.0~Cannot stop watching hoping it will get better! sistabessy Sign in Permalink I so miss how the show started out, and even though it does not follow the books at all, season 1 and 2 I really loved, 3 and 4 acceptable, but 5, what a mess, it is erratic, chaotic, makes no sense most of the time, is so dark, it seems they have gotten lost in the writing and directing of the show. It reminds me of the show LOST which started out so good and then what a topsy turvy mess that turned out to be. Maybe the actor who plays Kane should not be directing, he was in LOST. The separation of the original cast does not work, Octavia is completely crazy and needs to go. McCreary so disgusting, and kill Echo off, please. They could have turned this season into something really good with the entry of Diyoza into Shallow Valley and the opportunity to rebuild, but this constant need to fight and kill, is the Orange Man on staff now? What Octavia did to Monty, unacceptable, why would you put your Wonkru in such jeopardy if you truly cared about them. It is a shame that they did not have Gia's spear reach Octavia, stupid and weak Bellamy. Murphy, Emori, Raven and Diyoza are the only redeemable characters. It is sad, since this show started out so strong, what are they going to do in Season 6, this one is just dragging on filling up space with useless crap.
5.0~The show is good kill Clark riosrosario Sign in Permalink The show is pretty much any show they prolong the whole season with them trying to get there defenses up and kill the enemy at the end of the season. I just don't like Clark she needs to die please
10.0~CAPTIVATING to anyone! jmartel-53796 Sign in Permalink Where do I start. I've never written a review about any TV show or movie on IMDb before. But I really feel the need to review this one. The only reason I say that is because so many of the negative comments that I have seen on here about this show are incredibly misleading. People say it's a teeny drama show 😐. This is far from a teeny drama show. If you stick with it you'll see its very captivating. It's about war and sacrifice and tough decisions when it comes to the people you care about. I don't like when people spoil shows so I wont do that. What I will say though, is so many times people have to make decisions that are extremely hard. Honestly some decisions people might say are immoral. But because of the situation they're in its not easy to say. In that case it teaches you that things aren't black and white. The lines between right and wrong aren't always easy to see, especially in war. For science nerds saying it's unbelievable, it's science fiction just shut up and enjoy.
9.0~Amazing ItsAliAmur Sign in Permalink Seriously stick with this show. I watch a lot of TV and when I first started watching the 100 I found the dialogue/accuracy questionable and it seemed like just another CW show. I stayed with it mostly for the interesting concept. And wow, the second season develops into one of the most exciting programs out there right now. The storyline moves around like lightening, the characters go on believable arcs which deliver amazing transformations in some cases, it's highly original and creates some fascinating dynamics between characters which you don't see anywhere else. OK it's not perfect (sometimes the science makes me frown) but it does so much right I barely pay attention to the increasingly rare blips now. Heading towards the end of season 2, every scene is compelling and feels important and you care about what happens because they have built it in the right way. Don't expect the fluffy love stories CW is famous for, this is in no way a show just for teenagers, it's not afraid to kill people, and deaths are permanent (thank goodness). The way they bring up questions of morality and strategy, the ambiguity of the characters, the head on approach to the subject matter, all are fascinating. It's gritty and edgy with excellent production value and the only other program I'm getting the same level of epic from right now is Game of Thrones. I've never written a review before but I just had to support this show and want it to get past any stigma it created in the initial episodes. Check out the ratings in season 2, those are earned and well- deserved. Binge watch it people! You won't regret it.
8.0~Seasons Up To 5 Are Good. u_likeIt Sign in Permalink By Season 5 I was like " K. I'll just wait for it to get good again." ...And then it didn't. The story got way off track; they've been thru 3 apocalypse as a species and are about to get another one in season 6 (and they're not even on the same planet anymore). They have wiped out The 100 so the title can't even apply to the story anymore. They've also killed off every other group that's been brought to the show in the show: The Mountain People, The Prisoners, The Ark, and all of The Clans including Onecru (the grounders were low-key always the center of the drama/effect) leaving behind damaged characters, like Blodreina, and characters, like Clarke's Doc Mom's BF (who keeps almost dying which is incredibly annoying), I never liked before but somehow got worse so now its like wut's the point anymore (the plot has gone way down in quality 2 btws I'm just too worked up to think about that too). Clarke used to be badass Wanheda but lately its like Wanheda died too and left 'Uncool Mother Figure Clarke' who would betray anyone for her daughter (and that's cool but she doesn't have to act like she doesn't even care that she's hurting her friends and her friends dont have to keep letting her be the 'leader' cus Bellamy's got it locked down (or literally anyone else who's still alive)) which is stupid and they could have replaced her with the badass Octavia Skairippa character but they were too busy screwing her into a super messed up 'Blodreina' version (that I have mixed feeling about (defiantly leaning towards bad) and made her the 'bitter villain' type. All I had left is The O.G. Raven but they don't use her anymore either so I quit by 6x03. Everything before all that was pretty good tho.
10.0~Very good show with unlimited potential after season 5 knuffelruffel Sign in Permalink I've been there from the beginning and each season tops the previous one. The character development allows such a great story for season 6. In depth review coming soon
4.0~Too many plot holes and not enough believable acting. alfredsmith Sign in Permalink The premise of The 100 lends itself to some great storytelling. Unfortunately, this escaped the makers of this show. The ensemble cast is huge and as expectingh in such a big cast, only a few of them have the required acting skills. The characters are shallow and completely unlikeable. The story is slow and boring. Despite being sci-fi, much of the science is downright misleading and laughable. Perhaps it's aimed at teens but I thinks teens are probably too clever for this. I'm afraid that by episode 4 I'd had enough and could not continue watching this drivel. There's lots of better TV series around. Go and watch one of them.
1.0~utter dribble iain-attenborough Sign in Permalink If you are 5-13 I guess you might find this of interest. If you are looking for some new SciFi to fill the void post Bsg or SG1 etc.. You will be sorely saddened by what is being produced here. So many plot inconsistencies it makes your brain hurt. Add to that, the acting is weak. Years on-board a space station, yet every actor/actress seems to be straight out of a magazine cover shoot. Where are all the fat kids? Or the spotty ones? Or the nerds? Or the emotional ones? Or the quiet ones... 1/10 - waste of time even turning it on.
4.0~Waste of time bhabilgi Sign in Permalink How does one start reviewing a TV series that is almost entirely crap? Well I don't really know but I'm probably going to see how while writing this review for The 100. In the series, set in about 100 years in the future, the remainder of humanity lives in a space station commonly referred to as the arc because of a nuclear war that deemed Earth inhabitable. Then one day this civilization on the space station decides to sends all of it's prisoners to earth in order to test life conditions on it. The thing that I must mention here which is extremely stupid here is the prisoners. As mentioned early on in the series there is an insufficiency of oxygen on the space station and therefore the punishment for nearly everything is being ''floated'' aka. removed of the ship, so why would there be a huge prison block in the ship where 100 prisoners are held? I mean in the eighth episode I believe the government on the space station decides to just kill 300 people in order to stop slow down the problem of the lack of oxygen, earlier during the 100 years in which they were in space wouldn't they have thought of a way to undermine oxygen consumption to the minimum? Or would they have just said yeah not our problem right now lol lets build a super cool prison block so we can send all of its inhabitants to earth and have an abandoned prison which we will never use, yeah seems like a great idea. The basic idea of the series is therefore stupid. But now let's get to the even dumber part of the series: The characters. Now our main character Clarke is one of the stupidest protagonists I have ever seen. Every action she takes is stupid. For example in the 8th episode I think her lover boy friend says yeah we can make peace with the grounders we just have to have a meeting but don't bring any guns. What does blondie do immediately calls the idiot (Rodrick from Wimpy Kid) and the charismatic guy (Finn I think?) to bring guns because why not not like the future of humanity depends on it. Then what happens you guessed it crap happens because of miss dumb ass. Rodrick sees a guy in the trees and just starts firing in the air(trying to kill a bird maybe?) and just generally everywhere which results in a kind of war between the grounders and the prisoners caused by our not so lovable moron Clarke. It's just completely and utterly stupid. Another character is Clarke's friend who Clark thinks is responsible for the death of her father. So long story short it turns out that Clarke's mother was responsible for the death of Clarke's father(such twist much plot wow) and that this guy took the blame for it so that the relationship between blondie and her mother wouldn't be damaged. After all of this crap is revealed the friend dies in the next episode and you know what Clarke does when she learns that the guy who took the blame and suffered for her mothers fault since their teen years just because he cared about them dies? she forgets him up until the kid's father asks him. Nice very convincing. It's just extremely stupid and the last thing I want to point out before ending this review with a final remark is that the psycho girl who killed the friend also had no meaning whatsoever. She came killed a guy and committed suicide. It had no impact whatsoever except for the exile of Murphy. Could have and should have been removed, it was stupid. So overall in this review I wanted to just point out a few main things that bothered me about this series and just show everyone that after watching it until the 10th episode I completely regret it. It seemed interesting at first but oh god is it not. A complete waste of time.
8.0~It's Fun cool_alien_empire Sign in Permalink I avoid teen drama at all cost. Even when I was a teen, I did. But this show tries very hard, I think, not to be your basic teen drama with sci-fi thrown in. The action is very well placed, and the story lines are engaging. Even the actions and reactions of characters are believable--yes, it's frustrating to see teenagers act like...well, teenagers. But the first few episodes, especially, reminded me of Lord of the Flies. I think what makes this show work is that none of the characters are 2-dimensional. You can't just say, oh, there's the 'bad guy.' There's the 'hero.' I like that. The characters grow. I read one review that complained about how the delinquents behaved upon arriving to Earth. Well, yeah. They're former prisoners and basically kids placed in an unpredictable environment. I think part of the appeal is that people don't do what you expect them to or want them to. They seem, at least to me, to be very realistic--flawed, irritating, and capable of change.
9.0~Great show rootrootrootshaw Sign in Permalink Okay.. So I know how everyone now hates the show except for people who ship Bellamy and Clarke. And I have to say, this show is amazing. The writing is brilliant, it's gruesome, it's painful, it shows how after everything, after the humans were destroyed by war and weapons, even after 97 years, they just go back to their old ways. Yes, Lexa's death was a mistake, it was horrible, clexa was disgustingly used to bait the viewers. But you have to watch the show objectively and see how good it is; acting-wise the actors are all brilliant, Eliza Taylor deserves all the awards. It started out as a teen cliché drama but it has evolved into something deep and brilliant. Give it a chance, forget about your ships, and watch it.
4.0~The 100 clichés phantom_pixie Sign in Permalink The show had a great premise, almost 100 years into the future, what is left of humanity floats in space on a station known as The Ark. A crew of 100 people are sent to Earth to see if it's habitable, just that the 100 are juvenile delinquents. Unfortunately the show is just a sci-fi version of Lord of the flies. Where a neurotic girl named Clarke tries to hold a group together and keep people (she like) alive. It starts off well but as the show progresses Clarke only make decisions that serve her, much like what she accuse the other leader, Bellamy, of doing. She acts like the world only revolves around her, are stand fast on her decisions but changes her opinion on a whim, and is only ever happy when she gets her way. Never regarding other peoples feelings or problems. When she is not clinging on to the charming Finn, she lashes out on Bellamy. And the forced triangle drama is just tiresome, proving once again that a girl is nothing without a boyfriend. Other than fighting each other, the 100 will also go to war with The Grounders and The Reapers. The most cliché protagonists you can think up. Add to each episode one "redshirt" that will obviously meet the wrong end of a spear and you grow tired of the formula real quick. The show should be called the 100 clichés. Since every single thing is beyond obvious and has all been done before. I would recommend this show on a late night, when you have gone through you blu-ray collection and can't sleep. But other than that, there are better shows out there.
10.0~Amazing! sk-lover Sign in Permalink I watched this TV show because I was bored on Netflix one day. I was hooked from the beginning. This show is easily the best thing on television right now. It is so great to see actors that have been in smaller roles of other things and now are front and center in this show. I mean who knew Ricky Whittle was such a down right babe when he's dirty and primitive. Sweet sassy molassy! This show has so many characters that are not only hot but also lovable. I was so bummed when I realized that I had to wait for the next season. I'm now buying every episode from Amazon Instant. I can't get enough of it. I hope they continue this show for a while. I recommend anyone who is even a little curious to give this show a try. You will be so surprised about how much you look forward to the next episode or how emotionally tied you get with the characters. I would give more than 10 stars if I could. I have never enjoyed a show as much as I do this one.
1.0~Ummm..... could you come up with new material? hannonsean Sign in Permalink Let's survive. Let's do war. Let's make peace, then do war again. Oh shoot we have to survive, peace again, oh but wait we like war better. Everyone dies except for 800 people in a bunker because peace is dumb. Now, 300 new people come to earth, and instead of being smart and making peace, they war. Less than 1500 people left in the human race, and they war. Come on, you have got to have more creative ideas than that. Repeating the same thing over and over is boring and predictable. I haven't been surprised by the show since season 1. I finish shows cause mentally have to. But I don't enjoy it.
1.0~useless script and actors georg-29541 Sign in Permalink the main cast is the cheesiest crap i've ever seen. their attitude and their monologues are terrible and it makes me cringe. the idea behind the show seems good. nothing makes sense based on the 100 kids since their all assholes. bad. bad. bad.

6.0~Watchable megagurka Sign in Permalink I watched the first season of "The 100" before writing this review. If you can disregard the bad things about this show and are interested in the sci-fi elements this show might be worth watching if you have nothing better to do. It starts with a pretty cool premise that enables a lot of different plot developments. However there are plenty of things with this show that are annoying: The characters are very one dimensional, they are either very good or very bad. They also immediately know what has happened given one clue and what to do next. It's very hard to connect with and feel for anyone of them. The dialogue is very simple, filled with clichés and the lines feel very stilted. Nobody actually talks like this. Constant self sacrifices and self reflection by the main characters to make them look really good and to provoke some emotional response from the viewer. Frequent "cliff hanger" cuts in the middle of episodes which are preceded by the same annoying crescendoing music. Almost like it's made for inserting commercial breaks. This gets annoying very quickly. Lots of small side stories (look backs, romantic relations etc.) which doesn't add anything to the main storyline. They are basically just time fillers. Very little development actually occurs in the main story line in the whole first season. It could probably be compressed to about two or three episodes. I can see that many teenagers (mostly girls) would enjoy this show, but for the intelligent adult it's harder to consume. I watched Narcos before this and the difference is huge in terms of production quality and adult appeal. However, I will probably watch season two of "The 100" anyway.
10.0~First season reviews??? novica83 Sign in Permalink Why do I still see them? This show has evolved during it's seasons so much, it's ridicules to even consider critics from the first one. For example, episodes from last season have 9+ grades, all of them! Every season tells a different story, but all of them are about human character in tough situations, and that's what makes this show so special. My recommendation is to watch whole show and make your judgement by yourself. Cant wait for more new episodes!
9.0~Awesome Series amirgun Sign in Permalink Awesome, Awesome, Awesome Series. Everything is awesome.
3.0~Decent cast can't overcome horrendous script cransley-78942 Sign in Permalink Plot devices function exactly like every other future dystopia story ever. As far as the show's production, here's the gist: Get in a fist fight? Face blood. Get shot in the leg? Face blood. Stub your toe? Face blood. Every characters face is literally always covered entirely in blood no matter the circumstance. The production budget must mostly be taken up by the ridiculous amounts of makeup each episode. The cast themselves I think are quite good, given what they're working with. Eliza Taylor and Thomas McDonell do a particularly good job of remaining believable. If you want a very poorly directed, even less logical version of The Maze Runner, this is the show for you.
10.0~10 Stars, Best series with Mr Robot of last Year. Waiting for the 3rd Season maretto-77425 Sign in Permalink Best Series of the last few years with MR ROBOT. MUST BE WATCHED! Suspense and great story. So bad I have to wait an year for the 3rd season, I give 10 stars cause this series entertain and give big suspense in every single episode. Also it s very interesting to see how characters and the people change the way to behave during his life on Earth and Space, facing the death and wars everyday. Each reactions of the characters was absolutely realistic, and the psychology of all of them has been well treated. To be honest, I would not even think watching this series how "it's possible they have mascara and make up" available in the space after 97 years as a read on a review below. Quite weird reading this on a review, I d like to make you understand you're watching a TV series not a science documentary on the BBC, so you should pay attention on other mistakes that usually are made in other shows but not on this one! Obviously not everything is so realistic ( but who knows if in the future it will), but I repeat, it s a TV Series! I absolutely suggest to watch The 100, if you like SCI-FI/Futuristic Movies for sure You will enjoy it. 10 Stars till now, waiting for the 3rd season next year!
10.0~GOOD. Interesting story, good actors, nice science-fiction elements. DON'T listen to the stupid negative reviews from teenagers' haters. michaeljustgreat Sign in Permalink I read the three reviews currently available and they are all negative! Why? Because it involves for this particular first episode mostly 17 years old teenagers!! As if it would automatically mean bad when there are teenagers involved!! The same stupid negative comments were made for the Star-crossed TV series and in fact it appears that Star-crossed is very good because it has a very good story and the actors are excellent. Same with the 100 TV series, despite the idiots who do not like TV series only because there are teenagers involved, I find this first episode of The 100 to be very interesting. Even though I am an adult, me I do like teenagers when they act well in their roles and when there is a good story to support the TV series, as it seems to be the case at least with this first episode. So, teenagers or not, I will keep watching this TV series. That means that it is very likely to be a very good TV series in the coming next episodes, as the first episode demonstrates. Update: After seeing episode 1 that was very interesting, episode 2 confirms this first impression, as episode 2 is also very interesting and you really want to see the next episodes. It proves to me that this TV series The 100 will be nothing short of very good to excellent. The lesson on these negative reviews: DON'T BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. Update: do NOT take into account the negative reviews that come mostly from haters of young people, as a big proportion of the actors in this TV series are teenagers! I am an adult and I appreciate a lot this TV series. Here are mostly TV series and a few movies that I highly recommend, as I watched them and enjoyed them a lot. -------------------------------------------------------- There are a few classics in science-fiction TV series: ---Smallville ---Star Trek: Enterprise ---Babylon 5 ---Earth: Final Conflict ---Battlestar Galactica ---Star Wars (6 movies so far and counting) ---Jupiter Ascending (a movie) all deserving 15 out of 10 because they are all very special TV series for the quality of their stories and for the amazing actors that they have. Are these TV series perfect? No, as they sometimes have "filler" episodes that are not too great and they also sometimes have "holes", illogical elements in the main story or in the individual stories of particular episodes. Despite sometimes the presence of these very few shortcomings, these TV series are really unique and special in many ways that you will nevertheless enjoy them greatly. Other TV series that are excellent but not necessarily science-fiction? Here is my list of other excellent TV series that you will appreciate a lot: --A few more science-fiction: ---Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome (it is science-fiction) ---Caprica (it is science-fiction) ---Babylon 5: Thirdspace (it is science-fiction) ---Space: Above and Beyond (it is science-fiction) ---Defying Gravity (it is science-fiction) ---The Tomorrow People (it is science-fiction) ---The 100 (it is science-fiction) ---Almost Human (it is science-fiction) --Non-science fiction: ---24 ---24: Live Another Day ---Dexter ---The Vampire Diaries (it is fantasy I could call it) ---Breaking Bad ---Kyle XY (it is slightly science-fiction) ---Nikita ---Damages --------------------------------------------------------
10.0~Fantasitc anotherwiltedwallflower Sign in Permalink I'm always fussy about what shows I want to watch, and when I first scrolled past it on Netflix I was skeptical. The first half of the first episode had me rolling my eyes but as the season progressed I realised it wasn't the typical lame angsty teen romance garbage that seems to inflame this genre. Long story short, I watched both seasons twice within a week... I think I'm going to start again now. (going through a bad time don't judge me.) A++ character development, seriously I couldn't be happier with the changes they all went through. Not everyone gets their happy ending that would usually be expected with this sort of show, and that's what makes it great. Yay.
10.0~I love this so much ssn-81831 Sign in Permalink It is so cool and I'd love to laugh and I love and I love drama of you I love her so much thank you all come today or not today
1.0~ridiculous garbage nwise903 Sign in Permalink first and foremost are there no longer a thing called satellites? and why wouldn't they send a communication device down with them. in a way its as if the movie idiocracy happened with a few smart people left. second the whole community thing is just.... dumb. all the kids do is a lord of the flies crap. all of their problems would be easily solved. second i hate when they come up with slang.... grounders? and the whole community on the space station just doesn't make sense the concept of "floating" and the council. if things really became what they are it would be a more survival of the fittest scenario and the people in charge would not be alive.
9.0~it feels like us julidreamgirl Sign in Permalink this drama touches me, I feel it, like it's gonna happen to us soon. we're gonna fight it, we're gonna have enemies, in our own culture or outside. all the ignorance of grounders, living like the first generation of humans, having wars for nothing and killing for nothing. it sounds really familiar even now, doesn't it? this show has some imperfections, but as you see I've rated 10 for this. because it shows the reality. that not all the people in charge can make right decisions. not all the leaders are perfect. not all the chancellors are gonna be nice as they protect everyone. because it's not true, they can't always be like heroes in fairy tales. they don't have super powers. they are gonna make mistakes and their mistakes are gonna haunt them forever. but as they go forward they'll be better in protecting and leading their people. I just wish when that day comes we can be better than grounders or even Clarke. anyways, I just suggest you to watch it. it's an amazing show for me, I hope you like it too!
3.0~Gossip Girl in the jungle yatsura-99282 Sign in Permalink Ignore all reviews, they got paid to lie. The series completely ignores the whole premise. Space station? radiation on earth? monsters? survival? The characters couldn't care less about any of those. "Oh we got expelled from our families to die on radiated earth, our shuttle crashed, several of our friends died and we are stuck in middle of a jungle without food or water? lets throw a party for 2 days!" Food, water and even makeup appear out of nowhere. Not a single actor attracts any sympathy whatsoever. It really is Gossip Girl in the jungle, therefor you see teenagers arguing about their relationships 90% of the series. Scripts are bad, dialogues are bad, actors are bad, studios are bad. Every episode is like Sharknado or The Room. Why other reviews give 10/10 stars? Read them carefully. You know something is shady if they want you to wait for the end of season 2 before you judge the series. No other series would get such reviews after 50 godawful episodes in a row.
8.0~Despite bad sci-fi, this show exceeded all my expectations by far farfarskalsonger Sign in Permalink When reading this show's generally bad reviews I feel obligated to share my point of view. I agree, this is not great sci-fi. To be honest, it's nowhere near great sci-fi. But still, i cannot agree with the hate it's receiving. Reviewers complain about a lack of logic and scientific relevance. My guess is that the average reviewer of this show is a committed sci-fi- fan, who crossed path with this show exclusively because of its genre description. You are not this show's intended audience. The lack of scientific accuracy does not make the 100 a stupid TV show, made for stupid people. Focus is not on the technology, but on the characters. This show has succeeded in something few shows targeting young adults ever do; it portrays ethical problems with relevancy and depth without making it cliché. The group dynamic is a constant topic, and the slow rise of a strong, female leader is an always welcome contribution to the constantly relevant debate of gender (and female in particular) objectification. To anyone considering giving this show a chance; do so, with an open mind. The first episode, like most other pilots, is really bad. The whole concept of too much action squeezed into 40 tiny minutes that are to give a show a further chance rarely ever lives up to the quality of the "main" season. With that in mind, I would recommend you to give it a try.
10.0~The 100 is amazing ajmal-13382 Sign in Permalink An amazing show, can't find anything like it. All the characters are unique and well written. I enjoy a TV show that is not afraid to kill off characters. I hope the show stays for many more seasons. Reminds me a little of the walking dead, but I really enjoy TV shows with a good script. Great characters, interesting that many of them are from Australia and I think England. It's surprising they shot the Fottage in British Columbia, Canada, not many shows are filmed there. Many things are occurring in different parts and can't wait for the 3rd season. Really liked the ending of season and can't wait to watch more! And give all reviews 10/10!
10.0~Really Good mhkj33 Sign in Permalink This TV series is one of the best specially season two ,, the first one was slow beginning then started to be really strong and very nice ending but the second one its really perfect from the first episode to the end,, good job This TV series is one of the best specially season two ,, the first one was slow beginning then started to be really strong and very nice ending but the second one its really perfect from the first episode to the end ,, good job This TV series is one of the best specially season two ,, the first one was slow beginning then started to be really strong and very nice ending but the second one its really perfect from the first episode to the end ,, good job
9.0~Actually really good nasne87-1 Sign in Permalink OK, after reading so many bad reviews that I mostly found pretty unfair, I figured I should write one myself. If you let some small things go, and just focus on the story, this is actually a really great show. I'll admit that in the first two-three episodes the show was still trying to find its way, but it got so much better after that! I think people are forgetting this is an CW show. Yes, that means that even without a speck of civilization the characters are going to be wearing make-up. You know this, you knew it when the show started and for me it is not enough to completely burn the show down. Yes there are some problems with the science. But honestly, I dare you to find one sci-fi show on TV that doesn't temper with the reality of science. Look past all these complaints, just go with the story and you will find that the story is actually really good, that the actors are not bad and growing in their parts with every episode and that the show is very good at portraying the struggle of the people from the ark, trying to survive a hostile earth. Yes they make stupid decisions, but they have to pay the price for those and that is what makes this show so good. It does not shy away from taking the hard road.
10.0~This is one of the best series in the world!.. adir-81807 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best series in the world for those who like it and watched it. Those who did not watch the series to the end will never know it. I highly recommend watching this series !!!
10.0~awesome show rk248193 Sign in Permalink Guys I'm gonna tell you something i watched a lot of Hollywood shows and movies but this one of a kind. you can compare this with Game of thrones. if you are a fan of sci-fi,apocalyptic drama you must see this shows.i cant tell you guys how much this means to me now i m totally addicted to the 100. i think this is the one of the best show in this time.man the graphics is awwweesssomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee if you wanna see a real shows that makes you fell that this is it i cant wait a minute to see another episode of this shows.i can tell you guys this the best shows ever ever made in 21 century and for director and writer please make at least 20 seasons. ps watch it
10.0~Please bear with the first few episodes, season 2 is epic and bloodthirsty like game of thrones toxinok-77914 Sign in Permalink Seriously stick with this show. I watch a lot of TV and when I first started watching the 100 I found the dialogue/accuracy questionable and it seemed like just another CW show. I stayed with it mostly for the interesting concept. And wow, the second season develops into one of the most exciting programs out there right now. The storyline moves around like lightening, the characters go on believable arcs which deliver amazing transformations in some cases, it's highly original and creates some fascinating dynamics between characters which you don't see anywhere else. OK it's not perfect (sometimes the science makes me frown) but it does so much right I barely pay attention to the increasingly rare blips now. Heading towards the end of season 2, every scene is compelling and feels important and you care about what happens because they have built it in the right way. Don't expect the fluffy love stories CW is famous for, this is in no way a show just for teenagers, it's not afraid to kill people, and deaths are permanent (thank goodness). The way they bring up questions of morality and strategy, the ambiguity of the characters, the head on approach to the subject matter, all are fascinating. It's gritty and edgy with excellent production value and the only other program I'm getting the same level of epic from right now is Game of Thrones. I've never written a review before but I just had to support this show and want it to get past any stigma it created in the initial episodes. Check out the ratings in season 2, those are earned and well-deserved. Binge watch it people! You won't regret it.
10.0~Starts Off Slow Then Becomes Amazing gerrydeb Sign in Permalink First off to all the naysayers just hating on teenage dramas because their based around teenagers and its the 'in' thing to criticize shows like that give it a chance and stop taking a biased pessimistic view on the show. Now to the review the show starts slow especially the first 4 episodes but by the season 1 finale i guarantee you will feel emotionally connected to the characters, intrigued by the undiscovered secrets future Earth has to show and on the edge of your seat after cliffhanger endings to amazing episodes leaving you thinking about the show for the whole week until the next episode is released. The Plot Development between characters may be very slow to start but by mid season 2 you have characters who originally hated each other showing romantic chemistry whilst best friends turn against each other. The show is increasing in popularity and with the bigger budget that comes with the renewed success i can only see the show moving on to bigger and better things. All in all a very good show that highly recommend sticking through with despite the slow start to season 1!
2.0~A good show? ashikmokami78657 Sign in Permalink Sci fy collision with teen melodrama describes what not to do in a good show. Worse character representation and dialogue, a r.i.p for a good story. This even makes the last season of lost masterpiece.
5.0~I'm in the middle of the road on this one. jerrycrow44 Sign in Permalink First off I'll say the SFX, CGI, costumes, scenery and actors of this show are great. Wow, that's a lot of great for someone to be in the middle of the road you might ask. True, but I haven't gotten to the writing yet. Yikes! I hate, HATE, when smart characters are written to do absolutely stupid things over and over again and have no common sense. I don't need to go into specifics because it happens almost constantly in every episode, at least it seems that way to me. Anyone can do stupid things SOMETIMES, but come on! I know people who never or rarely do or say stupid things. Can we get someone like that in this show to represent? Please? Also, it seems that anyone is an expert when they need to be. They are all IT specialists, marksmen, medics, demolition expert, mechanics, martial artists, etc. One example is Octavia, a young petite girl who has lived her whole life in a single small room when she wasn't hiding in a very small hole in the floor to avoid being floated. How she came to be a rather sex starved skank I'm not sure. Did her mother give her inappropriate reading material to pass the time when she was in the floor? I don't know. She did, some how, become a combat queen. Kicking butt and killing men and women larger and more skilled than she. I reiterate, she lived her whole life in a small room and in the floor. Sheesh. Do NOT tell me she got all that from 'grounder training', just don't. Next, I just finished Season 5 Episode 1. It starts off with Clarke coming out of the bunker she made it to with very little radiation damage to her face which was severely radiation burned at the end of last season. This is only 42 days after the Primefaya devastated most of the planet. I have a lot of WTFs about this. No hair loss? Thank God, she does have beautiful hair, I'd hate to see it gone or patchy. Perfect skin? Except for a few red patches in areas that don't ruin her good looks, she has perfectly healed skin, and I'm sure those patches will be completely gone in a few episodes. She leaves the safety of the bunker after 42 days when she and the others were to go in to space for 5 years to wait until it was safe again? Umm...why? Did she somehow realize they made a mistake in judging how long the radiation would last? 42 days vs 5 years is a big mistake. I've gone on long enough, and could go on much longer about the major idiocies in the writing of these episodes, but I won't. I have watched every episode because of the stuff I like about it. I hope the writers get their *hit together and give the fans a good ending. Seeing as how they are in the 5th season there may not be many more to come.
2.0~That Incessant Background "Music" ismailnuri Sign in Permalink I would like this if I could hear the characters with their whispering the dialogue. However, the crappy background din drowns out 90% of the dialogue. Hire some new sound engineers and fire the music guy! As for the story line, it has really gone haywire. The first season was promising but the direction it's taken since is from science future fiction to fantasy at it's worst. I have been a science fiction fan for years. Bring back the writers like Bradbury and Asimov, then at least we might be able to understand where the story line is going. I don't know half the time what is happening. It was a good premise carried out poorly.
3.0~a serious insult to intelligence ratatatuff Sign in Permalink The story is set after a nuclear apocalypse. Earth is radiated and the rest of humanity is living in a small space station and guess what... it's overpopulated and they run out of air. Some 100 TEENS (!) got sent to earth to check out if there is still radiation. This is dumb, seriously. Oh, I forgot, they are CRIMINAL teens, of course... because in the future they would have a government that sends teenagers into prison for minor crimes... oh yeah, sure... This follows the current trend of "lightweight" dystopia like "The Hunger Games" or "Elysium". That is, a "dystopia" stripped of any political, moral or ethical meaning but with a lot teen drama... Todays "dystopia" does not have anything in common with "Brave New World" or "1984", it has stooped to the level of "Beverly Hills 90210". The whole plot is ridiculous. The rest of humanity lives in a space-station and is sending CRIMINAL TEENAGERS out to die on a radiated earth? Really??? Humankind will only survive if it kills its children??? Somehow I really doubt that... And once these teenagers are down on earth they suddenly become aggressive idiots. Whoever wrote the story has a really strange vision of humanity. Or maybe this is a poor attempt at brainwashing the viewers to always obey law and order and never question authority (yes, sometimes I really had a feeling of watching right-wing propaganda, I kid you not)...but: even if there would be a space-station running out of air... even if they would send TEENAGERS down to earth... even if these teenagers would be incredibly dumb... ...they would certainly NOT behave like this! My suspension of disbelief was continuously broken by implausible and irrational actions by the characters. If you want to watch a bunch of pretty and really dumb teenagers doing a lot of dumb things while their parents get thrown out of the airlock, then you might like this series. If you want an intelligent sci-fi series you should stay far away from "The 100". I have seen a lot of bad shows but I think this is the one that tops everything. If I hadn't seen it I would not believe that someone really bought this script and decided to produce this crap. PS: I took a look at some of the 10Star-reviews (I could not believe that someone actually likes this AND rates it that high) and checked the names for their other reviews. Try it for yourself and see how many have been made by CW...
8.0~Absolutely epic! cassidyblay Sign in Permalink Very philosophical. Would make you think. Bare with the first few episodes. It all makes sense after the season 1. Mine boggling show. Great acting. This is my best CW show so far.
1.0~Utter waste of time wimvdwerf Sign in Permalink So many good SF series have been dropped the last few years. And what do we get in return? This? A high school drama? That is all what it is. All that technology to maintain a space station and no means to scan the planet below? Come on, give me a break. And what do you end down to act as settlers? A bunch of kids with hardly any knowledge about flora and fauna. And then there is the discovery of rifles. Without maintenance of a few decades they are still operable? At least do me the favor of oiling the guns. But no, except for the odd misfire the kids are able to blast away. They have never seen a horse but loading, aiming and firing comes naturally? There are so many holes in the story that you can run a bus through it. But why bother to continue while others have already so eloquently pointed out that is all too silly for words. I am not wasting more time with watching another silly episode.
9.0~Don't listen to the negativity Codygedman11 Sign in Permalink If you are looking for a show to pick at, critique and force yourself to be analytical about every nook and cranny; then this show may not be for you. If you are like normal people who want to turn their brain off from their crying children, mean bosses, and the bad weather and be entertained, then you have found your show. I am in the middle of the first season and WOW, it has me at the end of my seat during most episodes. The whole premise is far fetched but if something like this happened in real life, I think the events that would occur would be parallel with the show. Watch it, get through at least 5 episodes, if you aren't hooked then I am afraid to say you have critic-itis; and there is no hope for thee!
10.0~Brilliant... eventually liamvdheuvel Sign in Permalink Okay, so I started watching the 100 and thought it was awful, the first episode it poorly written, acted, and the amount of plot holes within was unbelievable. However, I am now on episode 11 of season 2, so it must have turned itself around that's exactly what it did, at this point this is one of my favourite shows, and definitely the most improved show I've ever seen, it's like they got rid of the whole production team after about the 4th episode of season 1 and got the people behind Lost to turn this show around. It's intense, unexpected, and the sci-fi premise just continues getting deeper and deeper. The character development has been amazing, and the show itself has transformed from an insufferable teen drama, to an intense 'what could happen next' show full of action. The potential is limitless. I'd say ignore all the bad reviews, they only watched the first few episodes, and give this show a real shot (as in suffer the initial slog that it is) and you'll will come to love this show and get completely hooked. The 100 is something new and special.
8.0~It gets extremely good. nicktracy420 Sign in Permalink I put this show off for years after watching the first episode and thought it to be a typical CW drivel. I found myself with nothing to watch and read some recent reviews for the show saying it gets better after the first few episodes. They weren't wrong. It gets intense and isn't your typical CW show, a network I have a burning hatred for as most of their shows turn into teenage drama garbage. If you want a really messed up show with good acting where the characters are forced to make incredibly difficult decisions then look no further. Get through the first episodes and be amazed. My favorite part about the show is it isn't slow burning, the action heats up quick and most big plot devices are actually resolved quite quickly only to have more thrown on the fire which usually screws our characters over even worse than before. 8.5/10 it has its issues but it's definitely solid, I am hooked enough to look past the dumb parts and most of the time forget they even exist moments later.
6.0~Good but not great godfreyanywar Sign in Permalink Seasons 1-3 are good but after that it starts getting pointless to watch. Ignore the fools that keep overrating this weak show after season 3.
9.0~A great Sci-Fi series for teenagers. lachieh_97 Sign in Permalink The show begins a little slowly in the first few episodes, however, it keeps building up to the season one finale, and it is excellent. The character building is also great; a large part of the show focuses on Clarke's feeling of betrayal by people close to her when her father is killed, especially the relationship between her and her mother. Although the acting is fairly ordinary at times and the show would have been better with more experienced actors, it does not fail to disappoint! It has many cliffhangers and keeps you wanting more. The only thing bad about the show is all the wars they are fighting; first with the grounders and then with the mountain-men, it seems like this will be the only direction of the show. Overall the show is fantastic and I do recommend watching it.
1.0~Bad teen angst dreck ons-641-319439 Sign in Permalink What an awful waste of my viewing time and the production company's money. Made for the CW 'Network', The 100 is a dreadful teen sci-fi drama set on a post-apocalyptic future Earth. But I am perplexed -- how did this script pass muster? Is there an expectation that anything with overly hormonal, stoopid teens will get some eyeballs? I was hoping that this would be an interesting new sci-fi show, but it is just a poorly scripted high school drama with all the clichés, pitting mean girls, bullies, cheerleaders, jocks, nerds and other one-dimensional characters against each other, but this time set in the future. The only reason I would watch another episode is if I were assured a large number of the obnoxious brats and bullies that were landed on earth would be quickly killed off -- and killed in some especially gruesome manner!
10.0~Amazing manorofficial Sign in Permalink Just amazing and wonderful. Could not ask for a better show
9.0~Just awesome mlllzlyfe Sign in Permalink I will make this quick. I found this show on IMDb and read some of the reviews and decided to give it a go. It's a great show. It will keep you wanting to binge watch every episode. Very original. Just try to remember it's a sci-fi show so it very imaginative. So you will have to leave out a lot of common sense and just enjoy the ride. Very thrilling. Good character development. Fast moving story line. You actually start feeling some emotional attachment to a lot of characters. Great characters, good actors very fun to watch. Great first season. Awesome second season. Very binge worthy and great story that will keep you hooked and happy to be home as we get into these cold winter days.
1.0~Where are the continuity experts? smellslikeangels Sign in Permalink This show is so full of continuity errors it's painful to watch. Wounds that heal in seconds, moss that grows on metal, nobody ever gets a concussion, people don't drink water after being lost in a desert, clean shaven men with no razors, "paralyzed" legs suddenly able to move and feel pain, fractures being healed by cauterization, Western Red Cedar found on the Eastern United States, mutations being nothing like what radiation actually does to biological systems, etc., etc., etc. etc. etc etc etc. I count at least 20 continuity errors every episode. I don't get why this show got a better rating than Zoo, which is as campy as this show but with better attention to detail, better acting, better writing, and better CGI.
8.0~Good story line, bad character development ramcatamora Sign in Permalink The storyline is very good, however the character development is frustrating. It escalates from 1 to 10 quickly. Now, a character is very noble and 2 episodes after he's willing to sacrifice the lives of others. I hope the writers do justice with the characters.
9.0~Amazing warmatesot Sign in Permalink Amazing. Season two blew my mind. Season one started weak, but yo. I don't know what happened in season 2. It is amazing. Very bold plot. I love the drama mixed with the thriller. No comedy, well not that i caught on. I love the introduction of new characters in season 2, It doesn't make it messy, but brings the show to life. It is basically like a war story, but the war of the future. I also really liked the game of thrones feel to the show. At the end of the day, they all want to survive. I also really like the new intro. So much better than the last. I am really looking forward to the next episode. Watch out for the winter finally. It gave me chills. Pun intended.
9.0~This Show Has Promise beautybuzz92 Sign in Permalink I think the issue that everyone seems to be having, was from initial episodes. We are now into the 9th episode next week. This show has come along way from episode 1 crazy. All of the Characters have grown as people, and some in very interesting and unexpected ways. We are also currently in a teen centred apocalyptic over-load due to the popularity of books turned movies "The Hunger Games and Divergent" This show needs viewer support so that we can continue to see the character AND plot developments!! Keep in mind, shows have to have back stories and seemingly irrelevant details before they can throw in the big guns that leave you begging for more!
10.0~Really good show kidddope Sign in Permalink This one of those shows that starts off shaky but quickly becomes something amazing. When first watching it, it seems like it's going to be one of those dreadful teen dramas. After about a few episodes it changes. The writing is exceptional and their attention to detail is amazing. a lot of the smaller details really count. The actors play their parts very well as the actors know their characters. Lindsey Morgan on 3x11 exemplifies this as well as Eliza Taylor in 3x15 (I can't think of older ones as I've been really wrapped up in this season). I will say that the first part of season 3 felt a little rushed which cause some of the story lines to feel like they didn't meet their full potential but it makes up for it with the second half of the season. This however was due to the fact that a certain actress was leaving the show due to contractual obligations so they had to wrap that up quick. It didn't take away much from the show. It is definitely worth a watch.
10.0~Didn't expect much in the beginning but now I can't stop watching it teresa_mok Sign in Permalink Yes the beginning was quite slow and boring but once the grounders appear it gets more exciting
6.0~Great start then I guess they couldn't figure out what to write about stevefzaman Sign in Permalink This was probably one of the best shows I have seen on TV and then it just started to become pretty disappointing. Still however, I kinda like watching it overall. Bring back some sci-fi and cool it with the whole "we're trying to survive so we have to fight non-sense" humans are not complete idiots and we know how to communicate with one another a whole lot better than this show illustrates. Criminals are not just evil just because, I know that we would like to train our audience to believe in this, the whole - evil doer non-sense, it definitely makes the job of writing easier, but consciousness is moving faster than it did from 1930 to 1960, people's intelligence has moved beyond your simple minding writing.
2.0~Teenagers with nice teeth read cheesy lines mrsTrellis-2 Sign in Permalink Good job that the nuclear holocaust left a crowd of adults on a space station with lots of toothpaste, dentists and hair product wasn't it? Without this it is unlikely that they would have produced a bunch of children who are all good looking and mainly delinquent. Are they? The initial premise seems to be that there are 100 under-eighteens (out of 4000 people) locked-up in a prison who can be shipped-off to Earth to do ... something or other. Strange that they managed to build a prison on the Arc by the way, not what I would have expected as part of an arc design. And what were their parents doing while the children were being shipped-off to Earth? We do hear of a few of them but one might have expected a bit more fuss about that but, ho hum, parents of the future seem to care more about teeth than, oh, let's say sending their children to a radiation-infected planet before they are entitled to vote. This drivel might appeal to teenagers but adults, do yourself a favour and read a book; this sort of thing has been covered well in science fiction literature and you won't have to suffer the dreadfully forced plot-lines. One last thing ... I have no problems with strong female leads but why name one "Clarke"?
9.0~Love this show minkpink Sign in Permalink Please don't allow other people to swayed you from watching this show or not. Yes... this first few episodes were slow, but you need to have your own opinion. My daughter and I love watching this show. Just remember not every show is perfect. So watch... don't watch, but don't let someone sway you from watching something because they don't like it.
8.0~Why the bad rep? scottbrayall-981-325890 Sign in Permalink Love how everyone points out that this does not follow what "normal protocol" for a post apocalyptic situation would be. I think they did a good job depicting how a real life situation would pan out. Do you really think that when the apocalypse hits the fan, all of society will conform to the leaders? I can certainly assure the population, all hell would break loose until some sort of order is regained. This is essentially the situation at hand. The 100 are seen as criminals regardless of their age, do not think for one second our governments would not do the same faced with the same situation. Convicted felons would definitely be sent in to hostile environments because they do owe a dept to society. The governments would definitely not send their brain surgeons, their Navy Seals, or any other elite member of society to a potentially hostile radiation filled planet. Get real, they would send those who still "owe a dept to society", they would send the felons, the criminals. In this case, those convicts are kids. How does this differ from the Hunger Games (which the general public loves). If you don't like it, don't watch it. Go watch some other TV show that you think makes sense (good luck with that).
10.0~Don't understand the hate, great story, a bit of a roller coaster idrewmuli Sign in Permalink Don't understand the hate, great story, a bit of a roller coaster
10.0~Easily my favourite show right now! lox_bagel Sign in Permalink If you can live with the occasional teen angst and face-palm-worthy moments here and there (more so in season 1) to be rewarded with gripping drama, great plot twists and character development, you will love this show. While there was still some unevenness in season 1, in my opinion the show has been continuously getting stronger. For a change, here is a series, where more than one or two characters actually get a decent story line and characters in general are well fleshed out. What I appreciate greatly is that nobody is entirely good nor bad, everything is shades of grey and this murkiness makes the characters believable in their motivations. And everyone is redeemable, no matter how dark their journey. As others have mentioned, there are parallels to classic themes and shows like LOST or BSG but it never felt like a rip-off to me. The SCI-FI element gets stronger in season 3, which I find exciting. While clearly marketed towards teens, I find myself addicted and highly entertained (It's been a long time since I was a teen :D) and will gladly call this my favourite show on television at the moment. There has been quite the stir recently about this show being racist/sexist/anti-LGBT and then some. I personally do not subscribe to this view. On the contrary, the 100 has a diverse cast in terms of race and sexual orientation without making it 'the topic' of the show. No one of any particular group (it being a minority or otherwise) is the typical 'good guy' or 'bad guy' here. There also seem to be a number of viewers getting upset about the level of violence in 'The 100'. While my own threshold is rather high in this regard, if you cannot stomach the sight of blood, you might want to avert your eyes or skip this show altogether... If you love good story-telling, surprises, plot-twists and redemption arcs combined with a surprisingly high production value (it is the CW after all), you will not regret watching 'The 100'.
10.0~Insanity jokiko-59457 Sign in Permalink The 100 learned me to give a show some time to develop before giving up on it or even rating it. Now we are 2 seasons far and I can write a honest opinion about it: this is one of THE best show on TV right now. While season 1 started out as a soapy teen show who tried to be like LOST and BattleStar Galactica, it developed into something I never expected. The change begun at the end of episode 3 and slowly by the end of season 1 it turned into a must watch show. Season 2 was able to maintain that level of intensity during their 16 episodes without never letting go of it. The characters/actors get better, they are more complex and compelling, especially Bellamy, Octavia and Clarke go trough a very intense and dark (for two of them) transition. Amazing show you should be watching.
7.0~I like this show but... booklover4ever Sign in Permalink I just started watching this show on Netflix obviously lol. I like this show but find it sometimes draws out too long on an area, if you know what I mean. It's geared towards a younger crowd but that seems to be my thing. I will give more details, if I remember, after I watch more of the show...
7.0~Interesting skylarstierwalt Sign in Permalink I normally hate sci-fi films and tv shows but this one is pretty good. I got sucked into the story within the first 5 minutes and I didn't stop watching until I was done. The cinematography and storyline are both so beautiful and intriguing. There are some weird parts that I got bored or that didn't flow with the story so it kind of lost me at times but overall I love it. The characters are easy to connect to and relate to. You feel like you're on the journey with them which is not always the case in sci-fi movies. It's definitely a different style of sci-fi.
1.0~Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Worst show i have ever watched! ikeanuhd Sign in Permalink Apart from the massive internal contradictions this show lacks Originality, Depth, good Dialogue, Immersive story etc. What is hate the most are the cheap sets, The CGI looks like its from 1980's and a post-nuclear war landschape with a massive green forest? come'on! What killed it for me was the acting. That was just... I don't have any words for it. There are so many great shows out there and there are people who watch this? 1/10
9.0~Magnificent, inspiring, thrilling despite some flaws ruuuub Sign in Permalink After watching the first 3 episodes, I just couldn't really get into it. In all honesty, the first episode is pretty bad... And the show takes a while to really pick it up. The concept seemed really good to me though, so after a while I gave it another chance. Now I am so, SO happy I did. I find The 100 such a delight. It often has me on the edge of my seat. It is fast-paced and grabs you with many twists. The only complaint I personally have about the pace is that it's sometimes a little too fast when it comes to -some- people dealing with traumas and loss. The actors and characters are lovely, compelling, real. There is no 'being a villain or a hero'. There is no true 'good or bad', just gray areas. We see the characters develop wonderfully, even some who you think are insignificant at first. I have grown to care about them. The ones I hated at first, I love now and vice versa. The setting is amazing, varied and makes for some lovely scenes. As for the soundtrack, one or two mishaps were made up for with lovely and atmospheric music and songs. There are some flaws with the science and some questions left unanswered. But of course they cannot incorporate all the answers in the show. However, I quickly forgive the show for that because it is so well- paced and where it drops the ball with science flaws or plot holes, it makes up with excellent characters, emotion, surprises and more. NEVER would I have expected to be so sucked in by this show, judging from the first few episodes. Please, give this show a (second) chance and be happy you did, like i was.
5.0~100+ people trying to make sense wendelao Sign in Permalink If you absolutely have nothing better to do with your time come on. Play it! If you appreciate your life, maybe just watch season 1 and then make up a personal finale for yourself or your friends and keep it forever. It would be much better than spending 100+ hours of non sense, trying to understand the unique logic of time-space and physics of the show and figuring out why a bunch of teenagers do not age, and always do the opposite of what they should do, without the capacity of learning from their mistakes. While others have forgotten english and made up a whole new language with its own unique culture and traditions in a one generation record time. It's a show about humans without humanity that are pretty hard to understand. Good luck in the journey if you go forward.
10.0~More of fantasy than SCi-Fi novica83 Sign in Permalink Best show I ever watched. I can't wait for new episodes. Acting is great, storytelling, directing... I can't find it a flaw! Except maybe it's more fantasy genre than sci fi, but if you find that as a flaw. Beside that only flaw for this show is I have to wait so long for new season.
1.0~Teenage space cowboys drama, Awfully disappointing and irritating airun_71 Sign in Permalink At first I thought it could have been an interesting concept, then Clarke got on my nerves whenever she opened her arrogant, smart-ass mouth. Her mother follows in the list... Other characters are either pathetic cliché, or simply stupid. (spoiler) "They're dying one by one of radiations!".. seriously?? Even a kid knows that death by radiations takes time, doesn't happen all the sudden, dumb-ass... ooh the air is breathable, therefore there is no danger..? come on, really??... Apart from idio(t)syncratic elements, dumb lines, smart-ass lines, irritating characters, flares flavour that apparently appears all over the place in space, there's nothing under the Sun, period.
9.0~One of the best natalooky Sign in Permalink Is a fact that I like very much sci-fi movies and series... I have also seen "Kyle XY", "Secter Circle", "Chuck" and more, but when I saw the trailer of "The 100" in CW's channel in you-tube I said to me: Here you are! This you have to see it. I was waiting so much to start in America so I can see it and I the next day (I am from Greece). And from the first episode I was sure that I was going to see this series till the end! And that is whats happened. I was so addicted that now I have a Facebook page for the Greek fans of The 100. The story is for my opinion very interesting. In every episode can happens something new. The main characters are very cute, and every one has a different point of view for what they have to do. I recommend this series this eyes closed.
8.0~What do you do with a series that... jdberner Sign in Permalink ...suddenly becomes far better than one could imagine? Well you watch it, of course, and be thankful it had a chance. I have been streaming this show since its availability, and pretty much felt like i was killing time...until i ran into season 4. Bearing in mind that this series has one of the least plausible post-apocalyptic scenarios, one cannot help but acknowledge that out of the too-often used mire of end-of-the-world scenarios, this show has become something extraordinary. Consider the first three seasons as a preamble if you must; certainly the cause of the irradiated earth (revealed in season 3 as the work of a delusional AI), the evolution of immunity due to "cosmic radiation", and most of the damage healed by the earth in 100 years (!), one would think that this was doomed to fail. Instead, it rises from its own ashes, and becomes a compelling drama with realistic cause/effect, outstanding plot casting, quite good dialogue, and acting talent that comes together in the 4/th season to become an exquisite ensemble. I am impressed, and happy that i continued watching!
1.0~Unmittigated Cobblers! alex-hunt Sign in Permalink Sorry I'm English: We don't mince our words! *** This review may contain spoilers *** A bunch of spoiled brats with pretensions of being actors. The only thing worse than watching it would being stranded there with them. Come back Flashforward all is forgiven! At least Flashforward had some direction and the story progressed. This series just seems to be one long, boring teen party in the woods where nothing much happens and somebody forgot the beer. My hope is that they all die quickly! Final words? drivel. Tedious. Amateurish.
10.0~Please have another season jajmford-96202 Sign in Permalink Definitely the best network television show on I hope it has a season in 2019
3.0~Suffers in comparison to Lost plus the cast is boring phd_travel Sign in Permalink If you haven't watched "Lost" then this survive in the jungle/forest adventure would seem quite exciting. But for anybody who has seen Lost, this just seems so lame by comparison. The mysterious monsters, bunkers, injuries, smoke are very similar. I know they are working with a lower budget on CW than ABC but the main weakness is the cast in "the 100" has no charisma. Remember the Lost cast with the stunning Evangeline Lilly, the tortured hero Matthew Fox, the scoundrel Josh Holloway, the lovely Yunjin Kim the list goes on. With all the attractive and good young actors and actresses out there how could they settle on this bland bunch. The Australian actors Eliza Taylor and Bob Morley are too plain and don't have the kind of faces you want to watch. Thomas McDonnell looks like he would rather be elsewhere. And the adults are kind of irritating too with Henry Ian Cusick from "Lost" who was the most irritating character on "Lost". Don't know who is fighting who about what. Just lots of punching and pseudo angst. And the hook ups don't have enough romantic background. I'm surprised they renewed this one - it's no better than "Starcrossed" or "Tomorrow People" which were canceled. Usually with CW there is either an attractive cast like "Vampire Diaries" or a good story "Arrow" or good action "Nikita". "The 100" doesn't have either going for it.
10.0~Amazing desamaterasu Sign in Permalink My friend told me to watch this show and just give it a chance because he really liked it. I was bored so I said what the hell and put it on. I finished 4 seasons of the show(around 70 episodes) in about 5 days. This show is super addicting, Season 1 isn't the greatest but it is still pretty good and from there it just gets better, unless they kill your favorite character, which in this show can very much happen. This show is definitely my all time second favorite and would have been definitely my first if my two favorite characters did not die. But still this shows connects to me emotionally and I always feel something while watching it, from very sad to very happy and vice versa. Overall, this show is one of the best sci-fi TV shows and if you can suspend your disbelief and give the show a chance to build on you, you very well might get addicted like me and finish the show insanely quickly!
4.0~Really? I spent four seasons on this ..... what? mmarianne Sign in Permalink I do think that the story is good, I like the idea of a spaceship having been up there for 99 years. And then they send down the prisoners, and it only takes a few days to show up who is the leaders and not. Naturally, the place have to make them stronger as they're fighting the surrounding clans. But there are so many annoying things with this series. (which I have seen back to back, don't think that I haven't) First. Language. Really? Do all the people in "USA" talk the same language as each other PLUS English, perfect English that is. Secondly. Clarke? What is the point of her? She annoys me so much, and have done for the last three seasons, I am so annoyed by her nods anywhere and anytime. All that nodding can't be good for that brain of hers, right? In this series you don't have to have a huge brain, unless you're those characters that keep on giving. Like Raven, Monty, Octavia and a few more. (very few) Third. I wonder if all actors these days go to the same acting school/classes where they are being taught that speaking in whispers make things more important? I have no respect for all those actors doing this. And in this series you get almost nothing but.. Henry Ian Cusick probably did the husky voice 95% of the time, and same for the woman who plays Abby. It just goes on and on and on.. Four. They are the ones coming down to be on earth (which, by the way, was amazed by for a whole five minutes) Why do they think that they are somewhat superior to those who already live there. Five. They name all people who are already living on the planet (or USA as it were) "grounders". They call themselves "Space-crew" which then become Spacekru. Funny isn't it, that a whole bunch of other clans are named something-something-kru. Really? Six. As if they would have had any luxury items left on the ship after all that time. Or such good shoes. There would be absolutely nothing for them to use unless they could themselves make them out of the things they grow. 7. Clothing is a big deal in this YA series. They all have the best clothes! Both the Ground-people (wow, they can really DRESS nice man!) and the spacekru people. It make me gasp for air and then giggle. Eight. It's the makeup. Enough said.
10.0~Whattay Series ! waleedkhan-63826 Sign in Permalink After first few Episodes The 100 develops into one of the best series ever seen. It's so addicting and so good, I don't get the hate ffs. Audience is so immature these days. Whattay series, do watch it and tell everyone to watch it.
10.0~Recently binged this on Netflix jacqulinesnider Sign in Permalink I can't believe I just binge watched 5 seasons of this on Netflix and never gave it a chance. I have the season premiere marked in my planner and cannot wait to watch it on primetime. I can't even how good this show is. Hoping it does not end anytime soon, especially since they are starting over on a new foreign planet. This is a d**n good show!!!!
10.0~I really enjoy this show brauni07-29-10564 Sign in Permalink But it was better when Lexa was alive. I know she can't come back but she made it much more interesting
1.0~No..just no.. hsm_reemo Sign in Permalink This show made me wannna make my own CinemaSins youtube channel to talk about all the mistakes they make. I get that all shows have flaws but like this one is just too much.
10.0~Clarke Griffin bopgi Sign in Permalink I don't understand the Clarke appeal. She is the most boring character, like all lead character in different franchises or TV series. They are all '' Pretty Little Liars type'' - brave people with a boring personality because the writers played it safe with their personality traits so that they won't rub people the wrong way. I can only imagine how boring the 100 will be next season if i have to watch Clarke being put on a pedestal more and "twitter described " Lexa while Raven Reyes continues to be sidelined when she should be at the forefront of the plot. Could it out of the series, it makes it very boring
2.0~Why did this go from being the best show, to the absolute worst travisaracena Sign in Permalink I am beyond disappointed with the direction this show's writers have taken. This show was one of my favorites, and now I can't stand it. All my favorite characters are dying left and right (R.I.P. Lincoln), Ali is the biggest b****, Pike is now in charge of the skycrew people, and Clarke is doing God knows what. As a film student, I understand that you must drastically alter your story so that you can further develop your characters and leave the audience feeling so many different types of emotions after watching, however, this has gone too far. I never write reviews for anything no matter how bad it is, but this show is TERRIBLE. I even think that giving it a 2 rating is a little too high. As I've said, I am beyond disappointed. I am going to stop watching this show after this season. I used to be up to date with this show with the first two seasons, but I quit. Sorry to the producers of this series, but you all need to be replaced.
5.0~Unique and boring civleaderSoprano Sign in Permalink Young adults get the opportunity to grow-up fast to leaders and specialist. This opportunity is giving in a world of chaos. Some will stand-up and others will fall. This process is interesting to follow and the world is rich and beautiful. Each character gives you no real reason to cheer for them. The noble ideas of the characters make unreasonable and stubbornly. Later in the show they will grow-up and become more reasonable. Although still some characters are a bit to selfish. Not the greatest show of all-time, but unique in current time. They made a few terrible mistakes that make the show great, but it has some aspects that make the show okay. I do believe the show is getting better each season, so I hope they continue.
1.0~Hard to watch. Teenager/high school drama, bad acting, bad writing + lack of common sense and scientific legitimacy. danielle1911 Sign in Permalink I may recommend this show for a 12 year old who doesn't notice things as well as an adult who knows a good TV Show when she/he sees it. There is too much focus on teenage/high school drama and not enough on the actual situation of the characters. It also has a Lord of the Flies feel as many of the teenagers become close to savages. It doesn't work here because these kids are much to old to behave the way they do. I feel as though I am constantly shaking my head left and right holding one hand to my forehead asking myself what am I watching. I have been trying to give the show a chance as some of my friends have recommended it to me and it seems to have decent reviews but I must say I will no longer take recommendations from those friends. We clearly have different expectations and opinions of what a good show is. There are many holes in the show that make it ridiculous and make the characters seem irrational and forgive me, but dumb. For one, they send 100 teenagers down with only wristbands to detect if they survive the radiation on earth so that they can recolonize it. They could build a massive spacecraft but never thought of building a probe that could detect the level of radiation on earth. Not only that but they don't send any communication devices with the teenagers, only the metal bracelets which aren't even reliable since they can take them off and signal a fake death. I realize that all of this would eliminate the show entirely from being possible but they should cover those grounds to make it seem more realistic to an audience that don't have potatoes as brains. Also, they have been on this space craft for 100 years and they still have plenty of space for non essential materials such as beauty products so that they can look like models. It's actually obnoxious and adds to the teenage/twilight appeal. This show should be targeted to young teens and I am a little disappointed that this show received a 7.9.
10.0~Best sci-fi amrishheavenhell Sign in Permalink Ultimately the best sci-fi TV- series.First season was not that good but then after epic seasons. Hoping this show will never end.The creaters doing a great Job. Must say without nudity too TV series can be made and run successfully. Watching this series made my time worthfull. Keep rocking guys.
5.0~Started getting bad from Season 4 james_mayer Sign in Permalink This show started off really good from Season 1. It was about surviving on a world that everyone is nearly extinct. But when I started watching Season 4, i quit mid way into episode 3 because I just couldn't take it anymore. Too much about leadership and power and democracy and government and all of that crap. Season 1 was amazing. Season 2 was even better. Season 3 is when all of that government stuff starts to come. The only reason why season 3 was good was the city of light. Thats what made it good. Now with the city of light gone, Season 4 is just plain boring and i quit watching because this started out as a show of survival and now its just plain bossing people around and crap. I really loved this series and now i quit watching. Watch up to season 4 and then the rest is up to you.
3.0~Started well, but than a real let down sketching-61247 Sign in Permalink Be careful couple spoilers in this review. I think a lot of the views that give this series a bad review have not given this series a chance, they watch a couple of episodes and hate it from then on because they don't understand it. I was like that, it frustrated me how people just followed certain individuals and did what they said without even questioning it, you wouldn't even act like with your parents so why some random guy who makes himself leader. Than you have other issues that just wouldn't happen in real life, but than I guess it's not and they try to make it interesting. After a couple of episodes it starts to make sense a little bit and the more you watch the better it gets, certain things still annoy you like how the earth people can just decide to kill who they please, but the sky people kill someone and they must die and everyone agrees with it and how it seems in this episode swords are stronger than guns, at the end of the day you can have a thousand solider with swords and a small number with good guns and guess what, guns would win. But what really gets me is im in season 5 so I have given this a chance, but it's not so unrealistic with the main character clearly could have wiped out her enemy, however she decides to make deals constantly, it's like she has not learned through the whole series. It's a really frustrating series and I won't be watching anymore, started well, but not it's just stupid, seems all of sky crew are stupid and make stupid decisions, they act like security is important but random visitors can walk around their ship and blow up the whole entire ship, and instead of calling the guards and injured person goes looking for this person and doesn't alert anyone else, let alone bring a weapon. I have babbled a lot, and apologies because I can't be bothered to reread what I have wrote. Just don't get into this series because you give it chance after chance and it will just annoy you with more stupid decisions that no1 sane would do.
8.0~Ganska bra johan-17686 Sign in Permalink Inte det bästa skådespeleriet men en bra handling och bra producerat.
9.0~OMG another high-school drama...wait WHAT?! fakewithsmokeandshadows Sign in Permalink I'll agree on plot gaps and the fact that from the 1st episode to maybe halfway through season 1 might seem like a high school drama ....but then stuff hits the fan.Characers start dying unexpectedly and the plot starts twisting so much you wont be able to guess the next episode and so on.Personally I think the show might be a bit feminist but not in a bad hardcore girl power way.They don't focus on the past so much purely because that's not the point of the show,they do not focus on the effect the nuclear bombs had on earth...they just want to survive...It's not your classical post- Apocalyptic show when 3 seasons are based only on figuring out what went wrong or even bothering about it...it's more like...well that happened ,now what shall we do?! Some of those teens know what they're doing because living on a spaceship you're entire life has it's perks,or because her mother is a doctor and so on.They are not invincible and they struggle to survive in a world they never knew before.It's entertaining. I love this show and i can't wait for season 3 to get out.
8.0~Excellent yannis-adamopoulos04 Sign in Permalink This show is awesome!!!!!The story it s incredible the caractere are incredible and so on!!
3.0~Can't take it anymore for character stupidity benkim-13778 Sign in Permalink I can't take it anymore for character stupidity. Characters in the film makes really obvious stupid decisions makes me think that all 100 kids have IQ of their age. It was good until Series 2 but since Series 3, i'm afraid my kids will learn from the stupid characters. i"m turning it off now.
3.0~Great show, cancelling it would help. dominikkajtazi96 Sign in Permalink I loved this show until season 5, stop it already it is getting worse and worse by every episode, sometimes you just need to know when to stop. Either that, either start killing main characters and make this show more interesting. I understand that Clarke survives everything as the main character, but Abby? Kane? Octavia? Kill them already.
10.0~Great show cdelvalle-37154 Sign in Permalink Love this show the first couple of episode are a little slow but if you give it a chance you will enjoy every bit of it falling in love with all the characters so much so that when they die they are really missed
10.0~Great show! banana_head2011 Sign in Permalink This show keeps you hooked from the very beginning! A definite must watch!
9.0~Great show! Really appreciate what they do with it nicolerichter-05790 Sign in Permalink I never felt like writing a review, but this show fully deserves the 9 stars! This show ranks so high for me because of its storyline ... it is so gripping and surprising. Most major twists are so unexpected. I want to be entertained by an science fiction / apocalyptic series and the 100 do it. But, I also love the good speed, moral controversy, some great acting & actors choosen, mix of characters (go female leaders), it's raw, dark but they conceal the bloody scenes well. No schmalzy love scenes. A few seasons in, they still come up with great plots to move the storyline forward whilst staying true to the tone. I deducted one star because of the unnecessary & unbelievable killing of Lincoln and Lexa. Come on! Apparently, there was tension between Rothenbeg and Whittle It so shows in season 3 where the mighty, strong Lincoln is banned to prison and hardly seen anymore (& subsequently executed). Lincoln was an important and interesting lead character for the storyline. Well portrayed and placed with by Whittle. Personal (or whatever) issues, should be not impact the show for us viewers!! Big shame about Lincoln. As for Lexa, similar. What happened in season 3?! I read Rothenberg issued a statement that this may have been a mistake. It was. If you are not sure what to do, do not kill them off, dead is dead! As for the odd comments criticizing the lack of scientific accuracy ... it is science fiction. Come on! If you watch the show closely, you will notice that they tie up loose ends pretty well and weave the storyline in a believable manner. Also, this is very far from being a teenager series, alone due to the storyline which it dark & raw. It starts a bit slow (in my view the few first episodes only) but picks up momentum fast (already in season 1) and got me hooked even faster. I hope the show continues at this level of quality for a long time. Good luck to the actors. Love the show (minus killing Lincoln & Lexa).
6.0~Just okay, VERY MINOR SPOILERS jessup-86446 Sign in Permalink Decent sci-fi premise but it is poorly executed. This thing is pretty badly bogged down by hammy acting, plot-holes, pointless love-triangles and equally pointless political struggles. Major plot hole: if they KNOW the station is running out of air, why send the 100 at all? Why not send everybody they can? Or here's another bright idea, send the people they were planning on culling anyways! The premise had such promise too: Humans abandon the earth after nuclear war, leaving behind an irradiated landscape for a century as they float in space as refugees. Cool. So now the viewer's expectation is that they will return to what is essentially an alien planet, only to face alien new dangers: mutated wildlife! Deadly acid fog! Giant eels! Hallucinogenic peanuts! Exciting rIght? Wrong. That stuff is in their, but the writers decided that the greatest threat should be... other people. Boring. I will say this, after the first few episodes where they get their Lord of the Flies on, the show does improve, but not much. 6/10 Stars
10.0~The 100 is one of the best shows i've ever seen rbeccapp Sign in Permalink The world of The 100 is down right addicting. I can't believe everyone isn't watching this show! It is so good, and refreshing from other TV shows out there. There is nothing else remotely like it, except for The Hunger Games and The Divergent movies. If you like those, then you will LOVE The 100! It's audience is crafted for adults and teens. It is easily one of the most anticipated shows i've ever wanted to see what happens next in the upcoming season. It is suspenseful, filled with drama, has some comedic relief, is action-packed, and has a little romance that keeps you wanting more. I will admit that when the show first aired on television, I wasn't interested in it because of the name of the show. But then I gave it a shot when I came across it on Netflix when season 2 ended on TV. I watched seasons 1 and 2 in one day! I couldn't stop watching it. The brilliant directors of The 100 did a great job reeling me in, and I was hooked. The story is well written and the actors are very talented. Overall, I think The 100 is way better than most of the other cw shows. --WATCH THIS SHOW--
3.0~teen drama in "After Earth" beef-638-121436 Sign in Permalink There is a lot of potential in the story - the viewer is warped into a postapocaliptic future, with mutated wildlife and unknown threats. However, this one deploys a group of teens which, quite predictable, make a mess of it. Basically it's a teen drama set in After Earth. Do I believe it? No. Really. So humans combined a dozen spacestations, and now there's been a 500 - 1000? people living in there for 79 years, without supplies. Right. One of those youngsters wears old pilot/bikers goggles as an accessory. Nice touch, but no. This guy is the first to swing on a rope. Yes, a (new) rope, just conveniently hanging over a river. The rope is badly camouflaged with some plants, but still it is shown for at least 10 seconds, clearly a rope. Now if I was the director, I would have that scene redone. Or perhaps they ran a tight budget and could not redo bad shots? The guy doesn't even use his goggles now he finally has a chance to. Good thing he gets killed seconds later. The 100 soon diminish to 98,97,96 ... it's just 99 bottles of beer on the wall all over again. The clothing seems pretty pristine for being 79 years old too. Not too much effort was made to think "The 100" trough. Lets just try to make a teen hit series, but cheaply. Will I watch episode 2? Nope.
9.0~Despite one personal issue, this is very well written and conceived Eco-Sophist Sign in Permalink Who can count the number of post-apocalyptic movies or shows that have been tried. From Revolution to Terminator, there certainly have been many. The 100 stands out, however, because it is particularly unpredictable, and yet, very rational! That is, it's written well enough to not be able to predict endings, but yet, they aren't so unpredictable so as to be unbelievable. My only issue is that I can't stand it when strong Black characters bite the dust early. But that is just a reminder that I can't expect other people to write the story that I want to see, I need to write it myself. But back to the positive, characters in this story evolve, make mistakes, listen to each other, experiment, and make choices that seem consistent their identities. There is enough science fiction to place it in that realm, but it also does a great job of making one think about broader issues like leadership styles (contrasts between male and female leadership perhaps); whether the public should know the full truth about their potential fates; whether it is possible to be peaceful in a violent world. You can ask yourself these questions and see how you think the writers (or the characters) of the 100 would answer. I hope this show's network will commit to at least three seasons, and not kick this to the curb, the way Fox did to Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, or the way TNT did to Rubicon.
10.0~The 100 is amazing show it's nothing you have ever seen :) Dreamer_Mave Sign in Permalink This is an amazing show I started watching it a couple of years ago, Its nothing like you would expect and the seasons keep getting better and better leaving you wanting more, their is a lot of action, drama, romance. From the beginning I understood the storyline, what is telling you. You understand the characters, Their is nothing like it. It keeps at your toes. I really hope that bellamy and clarke do become a couple in this upcoming season In April or in the future.
5.0~Supermodels in Space skipping_pig Sign in Permalink I sort of had to watch this as my wife is really into it. On the face of it the premiss is at least more interesting than the usual fodder we get shipped in from America. It is a shame then that the show does not have the courage of it's convictions and seems to operate on a mostly superficial and predictable level. This is not helped by the fact that every single character on the programme has model-like looks. Apparently only the beautiful people will survive Armageddon. Are American audiences really so vacuous that they will not accept the sight of any 'normal' looking person on television? I know this criticism can be leveled at many shows, but this series would be a whole lot more believable and involving if the characters looked a little more rugged around the edges, and a little less like catwalk models.
1.0~Most Boring Season rvtheimmortel Sign in Permalink Shows women are morons to lead anyone.... Season few episode events doesn't make any sense. Clarke and her mother roles are really not kind of as leadership role.
3.0~Don't let children watch season 3 - senseless ethnic massacre. ljbigler Sign in Permalink The story line has imagination if a bit soap opera like. I became "hooked" while home with a recent illness. I liked it till mid season 3. Parents should not let children watch this. A small group of citizens from the Ark massacre 300 "Grounders" with aromatic weapons. "Grounders" are only armed with spears and are only there to help protect the Ark citizens village due to a new alliance. Fear and prejudice are responsible for this terrible act. I quit watching then and you should be forewarned not to let children watch this terrible episode. Many adults will also find this upsetting. If you watch -my advice is stop at the 4th episode of season 3. Mrs. B
6.0~Protagonists are damn annoying bartoszbol-662-708840 Sign in Permalink My main problem with this show is not how stupid, naive, PC, prissy or unbelievable it generally is but how annoying the protagonists are. I just't can't identify or connect with anyone here so i catch myself again and again hoping that antagonists will prevail, which ends of course in constant disappointment :) Plus all those deux ex machina solutions and savings in the very last moment don't let you forgive how lame the writing really is. Besides, it is ok ;)
10.0~the 100 5th place in my top 20 series BrainSpy Sign in Permalink What can I say about the 100. I liked the series after the first episode. It wasn't as good as I expected. but it's getting better every episode. And now I can't wait to see the next episode. so it's worth watching. I think the writers did a great job. even with the slow start of season 1. I think I'll put the 100 on the 5th place in my top 20 series. even the acting is very strong. it's really a must see series. And I can't wait for what will come in the next episode. and i'm looking forward to season 3. i'm curious what the writer Will do in season 3. I hope to see the city of light in season 3 or in the next view episode's
5.0~Decent-ish jvirtala1984 Sign in Permalink I wanted to like it, the idea of the show was captivating. After 10mins, I was ready to abandon it. I can almost immediately sense when show is bad. This was typical Class C teenager drama. I found myself fast forwarding through the worst drama scenes. I wanted to see the twist. Second and third episode were painful, but I had holiday so I kept watching. Surprisingly, it got better. Not great but better. There was actually more to the show than illogical teenagers making choices that I can predict miles away. By second season I had almost forgot that I hated the show. I was still annoyed by Clarke, who is 12 years old princess making her own mind despite what anyone say. She wants, she will have, despite others she will have it her way. We viewers are suppose to like her, because she is young-strong-woman. Please! She sacrifices who ever she wants for her own believe, like couple of hundred people in the village. In this show they might kill 10 people, and forgive it. But damn if it is one that matters to couple of main characters, then "we cannot kill our own, we are not like them". Its show for teenagers mainly. For adults (and above average demanding young viewers) its only watchable if all the other options have been drained. Pro: Great idea - Few good actors - Season two had promising twists in plot Cons: Cliché teenager actors - Predictable plot - Highly illogical decisions. They have been weeks and weeks on ground but they have only make cheap fence than I could tear down with my bare hands. How about cutting the trees for 500m radius to improve visibility, dig a deep moat around the camp, enforce then fence with thick wood, etc. - Pretty much everything that can be done wrong to destroy goodish idea and decentish acting. I've seen 8 episodes of season 3 and this is were "my fight ends". Its stupid, I cannot ignore it. I actually like Pyke more than I like Marcus. I would just destroy the barbarians with modern weapons and induce them to attack my camp. I would show what modern mine field and fully automated weapons will do to blades and horses; 20 automatic rifle + moat + mine field + re-enforced fence would destroy couple of thousand animals running without strategy, with ease. Who in the earth would even want to make peace with the grounders, they are animals.
7.0~A mixed bag that nets positive brycefj Sign in Permalink Starting with the negative first. 1. Beneath a cover of chaos and blood and violence etc. this show contains every teenage stereotype. It's clear that the characters were written to appeal to high school age kids as there are the "Bad boy jocks" and the "Nerds" and the "Perfect good girl" and the "Wild bad girl" etc etc. That's a nitpick but it annoyed me that the characters were made with a typecast in mind instead of being what most people are, a mixed bag of often contrasting hobbies and interests. After a time these typecasts fade as characters develop, but during the first season it's basically "The 100" High School. 2. The science is absolutely laughable. It took almost thirty episodes for anyone to mention blood type and there were three or four transfusions before that point. That's just one example but if you are a person who needs believable science, move along. 3. The best characters are often marginalized in favor of the less interesting main characters. The best character in the show is arguably Marcus Kane (AKA Desmond Hume) and he is often relegated to a very, very, supportive role, of maybe 5 minutes per episode max. The best teen character on the show, Wells, doesn't get a lot of time either. 4. The characters are inconsistent and the dialogue has some really low moments. Also, some characters make some choices that will leave you head scratching for hours, some of these decisions and actions make no sense whatsoever. 5. This show can't sit still, it's very hectic, always jumping around and moving at a blitz pace. This is both a positive and a negative as the pacing makes it exciting, but it also forces the show to leave out any semblance of steady interaction between characters (unless it's Clarke, they find time for her to talk, a lot, when it's not needed mostly). 6. A 17 year old character dating a warrior guy who's played by someone who is 34. A 17 year old lead played by a 26 year old woman, another 17 year old being played by a 29 year old woman. I understand the struggles of working with young actors, but this is crazy. 7. This show can be very predictable. I'm not a very good predictor, but I've called at least six deaths on this show in advance and I've called a whole bunch of plot developments in advance. This show tends to go the predictable route at times. Rule of thumb, if a non major character speaks at any time, there is a 75% chance of death. Pros 1. This show has cajones, as in big steel ones, they take risks with their characters and aren't afraid to push boundaries and lines, which makes me respect the hell out of these writers. The fact that they do this is one of the prime reasons why there is actually real suspense. This is one of the few shows that actually can keep you wondering if the good guys will win. 2. Setting/Scene is beautiful and extremely well done with a lot of focus on making things as real and vivid as possible, big shout out to the effects and set crew. 3. The story is amazing, while the characters can use some work, the story is excellent and drives this show when the characters fail to do so. 4. Jaha and Kane, enough said, two excellent actors putting in quality performances. 5. A lack of Mary Sues and Marty Stus, at first there were, but as time passes in the show, Clarke, the atypical "the good girl who can do no wrong" ends up being sullied by the realities of this world. It's an awesome character progression. 6. Intriguing moral dilemmas that leave room for thought, I don't want to spoil anything so I'll let you find out for yourself. 7. Awesome violence (I have issues). 8. The pacing, while also a negative, stops this show from having any stale moments. Unlike TWD or Lost (those are better shows but still, some episodes were extremely slow) where some episodes dragged and led to nothing, this show packs an important development (or five) into every episode and leaves you satisfied, albeit with a cliffhanger, at the conclusion of every episode. 9. Morally dynamic enemies that aren't truly evil, as much as Machiavellian or desperate. If this show would linger more it could truly touch on the consequences of war but thus far it has only shown that "evil" enemies are often a mixture of good and bad people, where the bad simply have control (which is a damn fine lesson to be teaching). 10. Some very surprising moments are contained in this show. There are quite a few predictable moments, especially when some minor character speaks (seriously, 75% chance of death) but on occasion these writers will make you rewind and re-watch out of surprise and disbelief.
9.0~Give it a few episodes jimbah726 Sign in Permalink A lot of the negative reviews (almost all) focus on the fact it's a "teen drama" (which it isn't) and continue to talk about a lot of things that happen during the show which relate to this fact. The show has an awesome premise, and while the first few episodes are very "teen drama" I believe that these episodes are intentionally set up like that. The "world" is exceptionally harsh, and these naive teens don't fully understand that until a few episodes in. They learn the hard way. If you have seen the entirety of the first season you would know this is not a simple teen drama. Drama? Yes. There is drama. Scientific inaccuracies to convey drama and push story? Yes that's in this show. But it does these things well. Very well. Also, whoever wrote this show may be a little cheesy (less cheesy than shows like Arrow or Flash) but the story is phenomenal. Every episode contains many plot twists for an array of interesting characters who grow exponentially over the course of the two seasons I've seen. Legitimately every episode comes with serious plot twists and incredible moments. And it doesn't feel like these moments are fillers or simply flashy explosions. They're all relative to the main plot. Sometimes they're dark and sinister. Other times they're romantic. Many times they're political. This show will keep you entertained, all the time, with only the first few episodes of "teen drama" to complain about. Watch this show. You will like it. Nay, love it.
1.0~Terrible! Pclemens43 Sign in Permalink Would not recommend this to anyone! Total garbage! Unbelievable storyline with way to many holes! People on here will want to say anyone who gives this a negative review are teenage haters. Well that could not be further from the truth! I have three teenagers of my own and not one of them likes this show and we do not always agree on T V and that's fine because every one of my teens is an individual! But I'm glad to report the consensus in my home about this show is unanimous for a big thumbs down! I watch a lot of the CW and by far this is one of the worst offering I've seen from this station in a long time! Some want to compare this to The Walking Dead which to me is just absolutely absurd because the walking dead is well written, well acted and just plain TV at its best, the total opposite of The 100! Don't waste your time on this!
6.0~Interesting start but getting worse through the seasons nexx-43314 Sign in Permalink I know most people don't really care much for the scientific stuff but the writers of this show can't really assume that people who watch this are completely willing to ignore all the nonsense that happens in this show? If they just wanted to deal with teenage drama then they should have picked a fantasy theme like vampires, you can invent things all you want there. This show starts all scientific, it's even set in a world where most technology and human knowledge is similar to what we now have and know, but with every season the explanations get more and more far-fetched. The last season is especially unbelievable, 100 people is not enough to sustain a genetically viable population. The other thing are the characters, they're just like any half-brain series, they're not really consistent, they keep shifting from maniacal to reasonable mental states. The third season was pretty good, watching Allie take over everybody was frustratingly entertaining but this nuclear winter again...I don't know where it's going to lead, hopefully not big brother confinement of 100 people.
7.0~Good enough entertainment nick_pepsi Sign in Permalink The show has a good enough story, it lacks some solide background stories. And they have killed off their John Snow Aka Flinn obviously way to soon.
1.0~Complete dreck todmbold Sign in Permalink Let the tween girls swoon and melt per typical CW fare. If you want Sci- Fi look elsewhere. If you want quality writing, look elsewhere. If you want a plausible storyline, look elsewhere. If you need simple cause and effect with rational forward thinking from the director, writers, or anybody else involved with "The 100".....look elsewhere. Of the most glaring, and yet to be mentioned, back story disasters is the simple thought that birth control is simply nonexistent. If humans are put into space stations to survive for generations with extremely limited supplies, doesn't one think that birth control would be very very high on the agenda? Of course twists of logic are needed for Sci-Fi to work as a genre....but absolute loss of coherence to any rational forethought is unforgivable to followers of space Sci-Fi. Of course, if everything else is quality most fans can accept poor logic. The problem with "The 100" is everything else is terrible also. With the obvious exception of the attractiveness of every "teen" who has been crash landed on earth. That is the one thing CW is obviously resting it's hopes on. A question to CW. Is Hollywood really so devoid of intelligent writers and directors, or, are you so cheap that the good ones never cross your doorstep? If the original literary authors also did the adaptation......they should rejoice that they got paid for obvious sub-par work. As a qualifier. I watch CW too much with two teen-aged daughters. "The 100" is the worst of the worst and even they think it's a laughable farce. Such a promising premise with a weak follow through. Too bad really.
1.0~Second season mid-season finale is a stretch anofansn Sign in Permalink I'm just going to wait and see the next episode of the second season to review my IMDb score for this series. This is due to the conflict on the mid-season finale (for the second season) makes no sense at all. Here comes the spoiler... The fact that the decision to give up Finn has to take a whole episode to come to feels like "stretching it". And Finn has to be captured? While trying to hide? (Like Hitler in a bunker) And finally murdered by Clarke? (without a trial) Oh, please... I had high hope for this series by the beginning of second season. It is but obliterated by the mid-season finale (for the second season). So if this show doesn't get better, I'm scoring a bad review (the 1 star should suffice) on IMDb.
8.0~Now it's so boring fominychaitaleksandra Sign in Permalink At first I was so adicctive to this show , but now it's very boring for real
8.0~A decent pilot, but with great potential mr_idontknow Sign in Permalink I think that this show has great potential. It has an incredibly diverse setting which could bring about an incredible story. The scripting of the pilot was humorous and as intelligent enough to give the characters life. Although I was initially disappointed in the way things unfolded once landing on earth. I realized that these are all teenagers who have been locked in cells for the past who knows how long. Of course the first thing they do is cast off symbols of the tyranny happening above them. It makes sense that they would be careless at first but when they finally realize how hard life is going to be, they will come around to forming a leadership on their own. The camera shots I noticed were quite good but they were all close quarters. Only one or two large scale shots. I really wanted to see more of what the terrain looked like, especially in the night scene. the characters and their relationships are kind of unoriginal but they could get better with some work. The only character I think should be erased is the chancellor's son, he should die right away. His character just doesn't make sense. Turning your girlfriend and her dad in, then following her down to the planet to apologize is a really stupid idea. Yet when he is on the planet he seems to have the logical mind. First episode was OK I gave it a good rating because it has potential to be much better.
1.0~A really interesting idea totally wasted neilthai Sign in Permalink I really wanted it to be good. It has an interesting idea for the storyline. Sadly it doesn't live up to expectations. The delinquents sent to Earth are ignorant and hostile to the point of insanity. They would rather fight amongst themselves than do one thing to help survive. They lived in high tech space stations but act like the cast of west side story without the charm or education. The space station has a prime law, "All crimes are punishable by death." This leads to a world with limited numbers of workers killing people off for the most minor offenses. From top to bottom the writing is not thought through. I hope the next episodes have much better writing. I really want this show to work but right now it looks like a total loser.
7.0~It's hard but give it time. Trilore44 Sign in Permalink I have to admit than when I saw the first few episodes, I was like are you friggin kidding me. Because a lot of the posters are right in assuming that the kids cant act, and the teen angst crap is unbearable at times, especially if I have to look at Raven giving Clarke that stare one more time. I am not a huge CW fan but I started watching this for two reasons, first is that most shows started to end when this aired and second is because I'm a big Henry Ian Cusick fan. Thats what really saves the show in part because the acting on the ark isn't bad. But I can say that I'm glad I stuck with it because I thought the season finale was great and the story started to pick up midway through the season. If you originally couldn't stand it because of the awful teen acting, you should give it a second chance because its a lot better than some of the crap on TV.
9.0~The 100 aminnrashidi Sign in Permalink This show is the most adventurous TV show I've ever seen. I believe it deserves more credits.
4.0~A show on the fence. Soulmai Sign in Permalink Sci-Fi isn't about realism, that isn't what separates a child's show from an adult program. It's things like; 1.Defying the basic laws of physics. 2.Defying the basic laws of nature. 3.Defying the basic laws of humanity. 4.Defying the basic laws of medicine. In fact this show defies every basic law ever invented! While some sci-fi shows take liberties, The 100 takes it to extremes, so much so that even Futurama looks realistic when compared beside it. It has all the makings of a young teen program; the love triangle, rebellious hot teens, stylish apocalyptic clothing, and everyone is a child genius in some field. It also has the makings of an adult program; Excellent and reputable adult actors, fantastic backdrops, interesting adult characters, mature dialect. The major hurdle this show must address is the demographical continuity, by this I mean; It's a show on the fence, it needs to decide if it's target audience is mature and intelligent or young and shallow.
10.0~An excellent SF series with an horrible pilot episode pyjam Sign in Permalink People should stop writing a review here after they watched only the pilot (or fast forward through it) and rated it 1 star. This is a very good TV series with an horrible start. Myself, I thought it was crap after I watched the pilot. But I let someone convince me that it's a good show after the first couple of episodes. It seemed hard to believe considering how had the pilot episode was. I'm glad I trusted the praise. Indeed it's the best SF series since Battlestar Galactica. Not yet at its level, but definitively better than the horrible SF series we got since BSG. This is not a teen show with naive romance. It's a very mature show with very intense situations and a lot of horrible deaths. Also I like that the pace is fast. Every season builds a new situation and resolves it at this end. There is no blah blah like in a famous show that promises winter for 5 years If you haven't seen the series yet, stop reading reviews and binge watch it now. The pilot is horrible, the following episodes are bad, then it's becoming better and better. The second part of season 1 is good. The season 2 is very good to excellent with an awesome final. Go enjoy it now.
5.0~Great story line destroyed by commercials decour49 Sign in Permalink This started as a great story line but ended up as 5, seven minute trailers. Acting was fairly decent. The graphics were reminiscent of Avatar. But CW simply put way to much repeat advertisement to really enjoy the show. Best bet is to wait for it on hulu with a couple episodes under its belt so you can really enjoy the story line. Story does a great job of creating the character profiles early while separating the protagonist from the rest of the group. However, there's clearly a unrealistic approach to arriving at the new earth where the basic maslows hierarchy of needs is the the last thing on their mind. Food, shelter, water and safety take a back seat to partying and celebrating where clearer heads would normally prevail. Granted they all just got their freedom and its worth a bon fire and some marshmellows but honestly they can't believe that aside of themselves there's no other threat?
3.0~Awesome for hate watching latkins-48904 Sign in Permalink This is one of the greatest shows ever for watching and making fun of it. All of it is bad, from the writing to the acting to just the overall low budget production feel, and yet I love it. I laugh several times per show at something ridiculous. Caution: if you don't have a friend to talk about the show with, it won't be fun.
4.0~appallingly badly written neil-476 Sign in Permalink I love science fiction, post-apocalyptic survivalist stuff in particular. The trailer hooked me. I watched episode 1 last night with keen anticipation. I shall not be returning for episode 2. Ignoring its many, many other faults, the main thing which turned me off this is its complete lack of credibility. Absolutely nothing, from the scenario to the various subplots to the characterisations, is even remotely believable. It's been a while since I have been so disappointed by the gap between expectation and delivery. This is puerile drivel of the first order. Horrible rubbish.
10.0~5th Time's The Charm filip_m91 Sign in Permalink The 100 starts out pretty slowly with the first 3 episodes being a drag to get through. Earlier this year when the show had just come out, I managed to watch these three episodes only to find myself bored and dropping the whole thing. Little did I know that had I stuck through to the 4th episode and onwards, I would have been sitting at the edge of my chair, covering my eyes at times, and gasping at the twists and turns of this show. But the 5th episode was the turning point for me; that's when I realised how much I'm going to love this show if they keep this up. The acting in the beginning wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either, I've seen better and a few times I found myself cringing! But there have been more times than I can count where I've been impressed by the acting by many of them. The show keeps improving, and so does their acting. In conclusion: I really, really, recommend this show. But don't keep your hopes up. Just sayin': that's usually a recipe for disappointment. But yes, as a pretty picky TV-show enthusiast, I very much enjoy this show and I restlessly await the next episode!
7.0~it is good but the made it too long modyprosaad Sign in Permalink Season 1 &2 where great but the other seasons espicially season 5 is boring a little and in season 4 the flame is rediculous
10.0~10/10 if watching with someone else 5/10 if solo amirhosseinnnn Sign in Permalink This series is beautiful but so stressful for me ! I really get annoyed but the amount of stressful situations that happens during series my heart wants jump out of my body I stop watching in middle of each episode for 2-5 minutes before going on ! im 20 btw don't recommend for anyone that have heart problems, if you don't _like me_ still not a good choice to watch if you don't like stress ! so I give it 5/10 unless you watch it with someone else, that way you can hold other one hand all time and make it enjoyable so 10/10
9.0~It's becoming better than i thought BellaRoss Sign in Permalink This is become really interesting show. And it is getting better. Second season is my favorite, because they took the story to a new level. First was good...but the last season was really impression. There are holes, but you must give it a chance. I'm enjoying it, and I think that anyone else who likes to watch throw away TV will enjoy it too! Now it is one of my favorite show
6.0~Show is Okay sundy_bee Sign in Permalink This show would be so much better without the main character Clarke. She's a stupid character. She's not tough or special, she's dumb. I can't completely blame it on the actress because I have never seen her in anything else but she's not that great either. They also killed off Wells too soon and they should never have gotten rid of Lincoln. Just when I think I'm getting too annoyed to continue watching they hook me in for the next episode. The different concepts around the people interaction are definitely interesting for Sci-fi fans. Unfortunately, a lot of good sci-fi story concepts are ruined by teenage drama. The writers definitely wear out the back and forth loyalty between the different groups of people. They don't do enough to justify people trading sides or extreme actions.
9.0~Amazing rwx-r Sign in Permalink Absolutely amazing by any means , everything about this show is so great !!
9.0~Better than you expect it from CW prvanjules Sign in Permalink First of all I decided to give this show 9 out 10 stars because 10 for me is unreachable. Second: there might be some spoilers in here. I was starting to watch this show for two reasons: I have to study and I love to calm down after work, and I saw it all over the internet and decided to give it a try. When I think about CW, I think about overly polished and cheesy shows with a lack of diversity and representation, with flat writing and a boring or an overused story-arch. This is different. Of course it is based on a novel, and this novel might be better than I thought; but when we look at Game of Thrones and much the show began to butcher the original work post season three, I can be very certain that the show's own writing team has to do with that (there are many examples). The dialogs can become a little bit odd, but as I am a writer, I know that part is difficult, or even tricky. The acting however is very good. There are exceptions, but I love each of the actors' work and I admire the energy they seem to put into their characters. Now, let us take a look at the female characters: I screamed. This is exceptional and truly empowering. This cast, diverse and charismatic, just pulls you into this storm of emotions, it's amazing. I cannot decide whether I love Octavia or Clarke more, or Abby or Raven, or perhaps Maya or Lexa. I love how they decided to make this show, and how to create a series that doesn't only make you cry every third episode, but also makes you throw you laptop out of the window in sheer anxiety or unexpected twists, or just clap your hands when something positive is happening. I am so done with this show, I love how it destroyed my emotions beginning with assuming Jaha is dying, or Raven, but they won't (yet). Lincoln's constant torture makes me want to strangle a stranger, and the evolution of Octavia is something all little girls on this planet need to see. So, here I sit and I hope that season three won't be its breaking point as most shows suffer greatly in a third season. What I hope is that they will bring forth the greatness of this series and make it even better... and that other creators take this as an example. The CW needed one good show... and this is the one.
8.0~Follow up on the story is quite bad daniels_pa123 Sign in Permalink While watching the 100 i had mixed feelings. I put aside the twilight similarity and tried to focus on the very interesting story the series lies on - 3rd world war and post apocalyptic world. Problems started when they hit the ground - acid fog that showed up once, two headed deer that showed up once (beside the two headed horses which are somehow healthy enough for riding). The series just trows stuff on you without following those things through. What meat were they hunting ? The same two headed deer and expect it to be healthy ? Also first time the Mount Rushmore was the border - but during the show somehow that lost all meaning, and the Walkers just put a spear without reason ? If that is so why not kill them all ? Too much inconsistencies.
3.0~Skip it unless you are a frustrated teenager fullheadofsteam Sign in Permalink O.K., the major TV studio moguls say let's green light a project to begin a TV series of teen-fueled sci-fi, following the successes of the Hunger Games and The Maze Runner motion picture series. Oh, but wait, let's have more down time in our opening flick and less real character chemistry, and then mix in so many plot holes that the movie vanishes in a wisp of cinematic irrelevance. Worsened by the stereotypes: one main (teen) black character among all whites, who of course has a dad like our present 2008-2016, the leader of earthy survivors, called The Chancellor, a black man who has a white nemesis. Tokenism in movies really, really sucks big time. Then the stereotype of strong females who, alas, despite tough talk cannot survive emotionally, let alone physically, without the males. As a male, even I find this stereotype ridiculous and demeaning - - my wife, and most women I know, could survive without the help of us men, so male chauvinistic is this movie. And then there's the matter of an invisible, predatory creature in the post-apocalyptic world who spears one of the youths with a huge spear, at tremendous force, directly into the victim's chest, yet much later, after an inexplicably delayed search finds the victim, miraculously (as in without any credible explanation) still alive, and the search party can drag him to safety and recovery. As for me, I prefer Disney fantasies to fantasies such as this which pretentiously follows, in shallow fashion only, the footsteps of films pitting teens against a post-apocalyptic and uncertain future, showing here much too obvious influence by greedy studio heads who were probably sexually frustrated adolescents, and are now maritally and still sexually frustrated adults.
10.0~Butterfly Effect ericageh Sign in Permalink A little change in current by a butterfly can cause a tornado. This is the greatest post apocalyptic TV show of all time, and arguably one of the greatest shows of all time and that is saying something because I am a movie addict. This is another very underrated CW show,even with the acclaim the critics are heaping on this show it is not enough, in season 1 the way the story was going gradually I knew that this was gearing up to be something great, then came season 2, when I thought they could not possibly top perfection they did. Season 3 has exploded like a nuclear bomb. Lexa and Clark are one of the strongest female characters on TV in the 21st century. They also happen to be the cutest couple on TV this season. Everything they do is for the story, nothing is ever gratuitous, the don't even exploit people's love for action scenes in post apocalyptic dramas, it must be true to the story before they do it. Season 3 episode 3 is one of the best episodes on TV since the breaking bad finale .Well I can tell you a billion things that makes this show pure ecstasy to watch but just watch it, you will get what I am saying, every decision matters in this show like real life. In conclusion, I am the butterfly that is going to cause the fan base of this show to increase exponentially, they butterfly that starts the tornado is never remembered but I want to believe I am start a revolution for this show and other quality shows that the CW and other cable networks bring to the table,My top ten shows are not found on the big four. Please watch this show you will not regret a second of it.
1.0~Garbage qweasdrftgyhujik Sign in Permalink The 100 is probably one of the most frustrating shows that I have ever watched. The only reason why I sat through all of it is because I am a masochist. What makes it so frustrating is its phenomenal premise coupled with its terrible execution. It's not good sci-fi. This is for all of the obvious reason(bad science, illogical decisions, etc.), but it's also because the show is totally void of one of the most important aspects of sci-fi, how technology affects humans. Despite being stuck on a gloomy, gray space ship with a draconian, oligarchical system of government, and no smart phones or any form of social media for their entire lives, all of the 100 act exactly like any typical, modern millennial that you could find on the street. The way they speak and act and think doesn't seem to have been affected by the environment that they grew up in at all(with the exception of a little bit of class resentment that is almost immediately forgotten about). There doesn't seem to have been any physiological repercussions from being stuck in a place that's so far removed from where humanity started. Not even Octavia, who has spent her entire life in one room and around the same two people, seems to be anything but a typical 21st century teenager. It's ridiculous. One of the other most important aspects of sci-fi is world building. The premise of 100 is so good because it allows the writers to have all the freedom in the world. Literally anything could have been on Earth. Anything. They could have easily justified anything that they could think of with radiation or whatever. So what do the people of the Ark find when they finally get to see the Earth after 97 years? A bunch of generic, avatar-esque tribal people who are all exactly the same... How much of a difference is there between the ice people and the tree people? They don't think differently, they don't act differently, they don't have a different religion and they don't even dress that differently(the ice people wear white and the tree people wear brown). Yeah, there's the mountain men and reapers(the same thing as grounders, but uglier), but those all die so we end up being just left with the same boring barbarians. The grounders(barbarians) don't seem to have any notion of a culture and for whatever reason they have no access to any books or any sort of information based on how they act and think. Guns survived the fallout, but an entire medium of entertainment that has existed for hundreds of years seems to have been totally eradicated. We never find out what happens outside of a very limited area. I still wonder where Lincoln was planning on running away to before deciding not to(because of some girl he met like a week ago). I hope it wasn't that weird island where the only non-violent people live. Was Lincoln really content to just spend the rest of his life on some tiny rock in the middle of the sea? I kept thinking to myself, what's going on everywhere else? Does Asia still exist? We'll never know. A lot of people praised this show for the way it portrays women, not the way it portrays characters. Never mind the fact that they only introduced the more progressive parts of the show in the second season to pander and bolster ratings. The show doesn't actually explore sex roles and how they would be different in a post-apocalyptic setting, it just makes all of the most powerful characters female, which makes no sense. Despite what a lot of reviewers have said(some think the 100 is actually republican propaganda), the show is not actively trying to push any kind of political agenda, it only shows what it thinks will get ratings. There seems to be two waves of negative reviews. The first wave is mainly from 2014. These just say that the show is terrible and that getting past the first episode is impossible. The second wave comes from after the third season. These are made by the people who were drawn to this show for its progressiveness, but got triggered by the token minority characters suffering a lot. This is despite all of the suffering being meant to further demonize the type of people that liberals hate. The former type is correct. This show was always terrible and that wouldn't change regardless of how many minority characters there are or how many of those characters get killed off. Most people seem to think the 100 is bad because of its surface traits(bad acting, bad science, illogical decisions, super-model characters, teen drama), but the problems go so much deeper than that. If this show had every single one of the 100 be minority women and had fifty of them be mauled to death by super bears one after another, I would still give this show a 10/10 if it was actually good, which it isn't and never has been. At least Lost can say that it had a good start.
8.0~This is actually good matlizotte22 Sign in Permalink I started watching this because had nothing to do. First impression, low budget acting and mediocre scripters. But surprisingly, I got hooked. This show is actually good! Now we do need to warn the nerdy, let's hang bugs Bunny for being historically inaccurate type of listener. A TV show is supposed to give you a break from reality so everything in it doesn't have to be perfect. This is a show, a make believe world made to entertain people. It does not have to be scientifically accurate to be good! Television shows are stories, not the real world, get over it for Pete's sake! First couple of episodes will leave you with a weird feeling of watching a teen drama poorly written. But trust me, it gets better and becomes quickly interesting. Gives me the impression that the whole getting to earth episodes were not written by the same person. As soon as that passage is behind you, the show gets really interesting. Got me hooked!
10.0~If you only seen the 1st 2 episodes, than you don't know this show at all... miks206 Sign in Permalink This show is extremely underrated because viewers don't have patience. The first 3 episodes of season 1 were somewhat catering to the regular CW audience, but then it started taking some really dark turns. Character development is one of the best in Sci-Fi that I ever have seen. You gotta stick with the show. It's not really an American show, as most unknown actors and crew are Canadians, Europeans, and Australians who are faking the American accent really good, but since everyone and everything is in Vancouver since 2014, it has a strong Canadian Sci-Fi industry influence. Once again, this is NOT a regular CW show, not even suitable for teens, most demographics for the show are much older and got hooked on it thru later episodes and then watched the show from the start. As you watch first episodes and think that this a cliche, or if you like other CW shows, you are in for a dark twisted surprise and Sci-Fi here that is not too far fetched, as some of these technologies are in the process of development today. Sort of like technologies in Black Mirror. The core characters will be forced to do really immoral things, and lots of 'cheese' from the the early episodes, will start slowly making sense and it will get rally emotional and bloody later too... ever some horror moments too... The show starts slow and misleading for a reason, but then picks up at a speed of light... Las time a CW show started going into very unusual areas and drama was with the LA Complex back in 2010 or so, It was another show that didn't match CW's regular teeny tone. That amazing show probably scared the regular CW viewers, because even large networks could come up with anything so dramatic and realistic... But the show was canceled at a cliff hanger, what a shame. Anyways very exited that CW allows us to watch episode for free, but work on you PR... Bad PR is want killed LA Complex, and don't want The 100 to end... and make it available in Russia with a decent translation. There are forums and groups. A huge fan base with terrible voice over translations...
1.0~I don't think I'm watching the same show as everyone else... mdkepner Sign in Permalink This is some of the worst writing I have ever bore witness to in my entire existence. Nothing original or innovative in the entire series. Every episode is full of idiotic forced nonsense used to drive the plot. The characters are so painfully stupid that the only reason they're alive is because the writer forces them to be. The more I watched the more I hated the main cast and wanted them to all die, which became the only reason I continued to watch. From this day forward I will treat people who like this show as badly as I treat anyone who likes Nickelback. I rate this piece of garbage "cinematic abortion" out of 5.
10.0~The best TV show I have ever watched uvx-10625 Sign in Permalink The story is getting better every season and I am sure that the next session is going to be great
4.0~Mad Max 90210 rak1301 Sign in Permalink Take a bunch of spoiled angry angst-filled 20-somethings, put them in a Mad Max type post apocalyptic future, mix in lots of unnecessary gratuitous violence and hire seasoned soap opera writers to maintain the story line with no real resolution, and you have this mess of a sci-fi. I am through season four and have stuck with it reluctantly because like any successful soap, it is easy to get hooked. The underlying idea had potential: what happens when the descendants of civilized society try to repopulate a planet ravaged by nuclear catastrophe. Unfortunately there are several serious problem with this show: 1. There are no consistent nor likable characters. Nearly all of the players at various points alternate between protagonist, sadist, morality champion, murderer and pacifist. 2. The story has what Roger Ebert used to call something like an "idiot plot"; where at various points in the story, some otherwise intelligent person has to be an idiot and do something nobody would be dumb enough to do in order for the plot to continue. This is just weak writing. As in a cheap horror movie, who would go out for a stroll in dangerous woods at night just to relax? Nobody! 3. The violence is tiring. The writers often seem to start with a new idea for the display of gore or torture and then build a story around it. Luckily for the characters, no matter how deep the cut or how heavy the bleeding, just wrap a rag around it and they will be good as new the next day. In summary, this is way more soap than sci-fi. The seasons are fairly short so I am hoping if I stick with it eventually something will get resolved and one episode will end on a positive note; but I am not holding my breath.
1.0~One Of The Best jeydeeofficial Sign in Permalink I binged watched season 1 and 2 in 3 days and this is honestly one of the best shows out there right now. this show just gets better and better. the first few episodes were slow and seemed like an ordinary teen drama but it got better, more complicated and simply entertaining as it progressed. the character developments are visibly awesome. each character has their personality and depth. everyone is realistic, unlike common superheroes shows, where there are good guys and bad guys. on The 100, that line is too thin, almost invisible. plus, the show never stops surprising you, which makes it always so fun to watch. at the same time, it can get extremely intense.
10.0~The 100 is basically life. amandasimone21 Sign in Permalink This TV show has me on my feet within every episode at every second. I find this to be amazing. I am under the age of 18, and if there are anyone that enjoys watching intriguing action, captivating romances, and total destruction with firm leadership, then I recommend that you watch this one hundred percent. The characters within this TV series are humorous, dramatic, and amazing in general. This show which will be completely repeated throughout this review is that this is life.My personal favorite character is Clarke. Clarke is an amazing logical character. She is so determined in so many ways, she tried her best to make sure her point came across and is clear. She can be like a complete hard worker and determined 17 year old girl. At other times, she could be amazing, full of life and creative ideas.I just, basically, highly recommend watching this TV series. I recommend it 100 percent, PLEASE WATCH AND SUPPORT IT !
4.0~Trashy oovag Sign in Permalink The series is extremely trashy. I like it, but anyway, it does not deserve more points.
6.0~characters dakarafa Sign in Permalink Several characters have evolved through the episodes. They are nothing like they were in the beginning. They are growing fast. Good show, just hope the writers can stay on point.
6.0~2 Out of 100 is Enough FloodClearwater Sign in Permalink Actors Eliza Taylor (Clarke) and Marie Avgeropoulos (Octavia) are quite good actors in their respective roles as de facto Queens, one flaxen and one raven-haired, on a mutating, post-apocalyptic chessboard, surrounded by 98 other attractive young adults. The 100 has been derided as '90210 with radiation,' but the talent and near-universal appeal of these two scenery-chewing, siren-faced women cast as the ultimate set of frenemies creates an instant fanbase and allows the series to stand apart from other sci-fi series. Taylor, as the 'good' leader of a set of lost children, is often stuck with the pedestrian half of the dialogue. Her performance generally recalls a mixture of Reese Witherspoon with the archetype of an Athena (or would that be Artemis?). Avgeropoulos, who plays Octavia as a breathtaking Pandoric box of 'trouble' is a sometimes romping, sometimes slithering eye-magnet, a potent concoction of allure and razor-fast dramatic timing. Alliances shift, betrayals ensue, violence erupts, some of which sometimes drags and seems near to boring. Everyone wears black clothing, heartless adults deploy empowered teens as pawns. We've already seen a whole lot of that on film these days. Nevertheless, The 100 is sci-fi which has 2 compelling lead actors, playing against each other and playing for our attention, and they happen to be girls.
10.0~This show can get Intense SiphonBrew Sign in Permalink Sci Fi Post Nuclear War Fantasy/ Adventure and overall great show. Just finished binge watching, I really enjoyed the 100 and look forward to season 4. For a show on CW it is really violent and intense. The 100 will feel like a mash up of "Lord of the Flies" and "Lost" in the beginning. For me the 100 was easy to get addicted to. So if you give it a shot i hope you can enjoy it as much as me. If you have very moderate expectations i would say you won't be disappointed. It will be rewarding if you get really into a character's story line. And there will be many characters to get hooked to. There will be many fork in the road decision with crazy consequences. Watch the 100 with an open mind and it can take you on a ride. I thought it would really be a show for kids, but i knew right a way the opposite. Do not get spoiled and do not google to much about the show. Enjoy
7.0~Too Intense and Gory whtsursgn Sign in Permalink I admit it sucked me in. I watch the whole thing on Netflix and set to record for season too but once I had a break from the intensity of all the violence I could not get back into it. It never lets up. It's always one bad thing leading to another and just when you think it may be OK it isn't. If it wasn't so intense and had some gratification I may pick it back up but right now I have 3 episodes waiting for me and Im not really ready to get back into yet. I think the characters are well developed and the reality of some of the things they may go through are believable but there is too much fighting and for me to keep going with the series.
10.0~Legend qkzfz Sign in Permalink The actress is legend and the show is very very nice and the story it's something i can't speak about it 💔
8.0~A real life Wall-E....minus the robots chloereist Sign in Permalink This show was so different from anything I've seen and make you want to fight a long with these characters. I'm a huge fan of apocalyptic worlds and the way they brought this crazy world to life was so fun to watch! I say it's a real life wall-e since they start the whole show with all humans in space because of the polluted earth. This was a show that me, my mom and brother can all watch and be entertained while connecting with a lot of characters.
10.0~Promise you wont regret it quantumsucks Sign in Permalink Im not going to talk much, just do not mind the bad reviews. There are people saying if you like this show you are simple-minded or you lack knowledge of basic science are people that know only basic science themselves. Like what kind of logic is this? Were talking about many many years after from now on and its ridiculous to except some 200 years-ahead kind of thinking and flawless physics, people that know basic science will love to point out a flaw, but in reality you will never find a flawless movie with zero scientific mistakes, simple as that. If you could find a sci-fi movie with zero scientific mistake than scientists should stop working and just go watch movies and shows to learn the science they don't know. Ignorant people love to fake as they're smart. Don't mind them. This show isn't a science lesson videos or smh that you could find on YouTube, just go ahead and watch it for yourself, Promise you its epic
1.0~Lexa Dies rosecat-71699 Sign in Permalink OK so if you haven't seen this episode don't watch it. This episode caused me unbearable pain. It made me feel things I've never felt for a character before. Lexa didn't need to die and this affected thousands of viewers very negatively. After 3 Days I'm still seeing users crying and tweeting out about how sad they are. Lexa has trended 3 days in a row on twitter, the cast is shading Jason, and Eliza didn't even watch it live. I can't believe they would give us so much hope just to take it all away. Did he not understand her impact? No he did and no matter what excuse he has it doesn't matter. Jason has tried blaming the death on ADC taking a role on FTWD but there filming schedules didn't even coincide. He is a liar and gave hope to people that never have hope. We all thought Clarke and Lexa would finally get their happy ending. THEY WILL NEVER GET THAT BECAUSE LEXA IS DEAD FROM A STRAY BULLET. Nothing was honorable about any of this. I miss her like I miss a friend. I was in such a bad place before this show came along and gave me reason to smile, but now that is all ruined. Thanks Jason you suck. I will continue to support the actors/actresses in different shows,but I can't keep watching this. JUS DREIN JUS DAUN JASON.
10.0~Potentially, the next Lost. nerman-talakic Sign in Permalink There are show that require you to watch a couple of episodes to get you hooked, and there are shows that get you hooked in the first few minutes of the pilot episode. I was loving The 100 from the first five minutes and the main reason is the atmosphere of the show, it just allows you to immerse yourself completely into this show. The last time I got a similar feeling from a TV show was when I started watching Lost and we all know Lost was amazing despite it's flaws. The 100 has everything to potentially become an amazing TV show. It's got a great setting and atmosphere, solid acting and decent looking actors, parallel but connected plot lines, a bunch of mysteries to be uncovered and a lot of other cool small details. If the next episodes of the first season continue to impress me the way these first three did, I'll have to up my vote to 10 out of 10.
1.0~terrible sanda-golcea Sign in Permalink This movie lacks any logic. Don't even expect not even a tiny bit of common sense of any type. The subject was interesting: A post apocalyptic world and a bunch of humans send to repopulate it: what will they find? Well what they find and how they feel about their survival is depressing. We're on Earth: Let's party like we don't care about anything and have endless supplies!! wohoo! let's not worry what we'll eat tomorrow or what else (predators maybe?) is on this planet! I watched the first few episodes in the hope that it will get better, instead it got worse. It just makes you want to go like: really? seriously? why?! It lacks any science to back the story, the teenagers have nothing better to do than to party and bug and shoot and beat each other, and there's romance, oh so much romance.. so much cheap romance that is. Bottom line: I would not recommend it, not if you're bored, not if your teenage daughter or son wants to learn by example (oh gosh, definitely not for that), not if you want a good futuristic science- fiction. Not at all! Save your time and watch something else.
8.0~Seeks to rise above the standards of similar shows. rainy-designs Sign in Permalink In the beginning The 100 is much like any other TV show that is directed at The CW's typical viewing audience (see: teens). The entire first season is for the most part much too early to make an accurate judgment on what the show will grow into. Through out season 1 we do see some minor holes, but nothing devastating to setting or plot line. Acting is not always perfect but it is good - especially for the first season of a TV show which has a cast of mostly untried young TV actors and actresses, but the cast is varied and the characters are at least somewhat interesting and so season 1 is overall entertaining though not riveting or compelling. Season 2 is where The 100 begins to show its true colors and come into its full potential. As characters grow and the plot line advances it does become truly compelling, the characters are more than just interesting, they're diverse, dynamic, and fascinating. The actors and actresses have all settled solidly into their roles and they do more than just carry them off, they nail it. It has been a long while since the Fantasy and Science Fiction world has seen a TV show so heavily dominated by powerful female characters, Clarke is reminiscent of Buffy Summers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) in her strength, courage, compassion, and unyielding brilliance and will and she is only the beginning, Alexa, Octavia, Anya, Maya, Abby, Indra, and Raven are all excellent, powerful, compelling female characters - each unique. The men of the show are in no way out done by their female counterparts, Bellamy, Jaha, Kane, Murphy, Finn, Lincoln, Jasper, and Monty own their roles completely and their characters draw you in, make you think. It will require patience to get past the initial, just starting out type stumbling blocks that most TV shows go through during their first season but The 100 is well worth the wait because once it picks up traction it is nearly impossible to wait between episodes each week. The amount of thought and detail that has been placed in the show is admirable, looking back over season 1 it is pretty clear that season 2 has been planned from the beginning. The smaller details like developing an entire, unique language for the Grounders are nice additives and the nods towards literature like Lord of the Flies is appreciated.
9.0~The 100 is quite a good summary of the human condition so far.... dikaea Sign in Permalink 100 young people are sent to earth after a nuclear destruction, from a space colony that has its resources and means or survival on the brink of failure, 97 years after the incident to find out if it is survivable. And there it begins...once again! Consequences of long term isolation, power struggles, young minds in conflict with older ones, past mistakes repeated or not, love and war, friendship and animosity, technology and religion, betrayal and redemption, collision of different worlds and ideologies, sacrifice over the greater good, revenge and mercy, elitism or equality, communication or annihilation, cruelty or compassion, insanity or logic, fear or understanding all mixed together in impossible choices in a medieval/high tech setting 150 years from now.... The 100 is an interesting "fairy tale". One that has its flaws script and science wise, its exaggerations and clichés character wise... If it was written by top writers, performed by top actors and directed by top filmmakers it would be an absolute masterpiece. But it is not. What it is, is an intriguing, thought provoking presentation of what could happen if humanity found itself in a situation like this. Are we worth surviving as a species or should we all just give up and be extinct? The choice is ours. How we do it.... that's the tricky part.
1.0~It's 90210 in Fallout! It's Dawson's Creek in Space! It's bad writing! seanmetzinger Sign in Permalink If you hate 90210, you will hate this. Do not fall for it Sci-fi fans. We can suspend our belief for Star Trek, Star Wars, Walking Dead, Terra-Nova,and Doctor Who. No amount of imagining will get past huge plot holes, bad acting, bad writing (examples later), bad choices in details, & bad directing. I'll use only the first 7 Minutes of the first episode to point out whats wrong because it was so bad we couldn't go any further. Bad Acting and directing: When the main character, Clarke, is talking to Thelonious about her father I swear her anger was read off of a queue card behind Thelonious, whether that was bad directing or acting I leave that up to you. Huge Plot hole in one small bad detail choice: Plenty of people have pointed out the big scientific plot holes, a lot of shows have them but this has some huge ones that make it hard to get around but one that gets me because it is purely a vanity choice is the makeup. Every girl has perfect makeup-- even these so called prisoners. Red lips, mascara, perfect skin, perfect white teeth, long luxurious hair. We are talking about a society running out of resources some how has a never ending supply of beauty products. On top of that these are decedents of scientist and military -- beauty is always last on the list and often shunned by those as just useless vanity. For some reason the creators thought more of the vain "look pretty for the camera" mentality instead of immersing the viewer in the world. ======Now the biggest reason not to watch====== Bad writing -- Say you give it a pass for everything else this is where you will turn it off. First off plot points lack weight. The plot point of if you are 18 and commit a crime you die shouldn't be just said but actually witnessed, if the main character actually witnessed her father being taken away, that would be more emotional. The main plot point, the apocalypse isn't just a foot note so don't make it a single throw away line. Finally the dialog... at two points exposition is actually yelled by random people (you don't see who yells it) about one girl, "She is that girl that was found in the air vents" and then "No one has a brother" insinuating that was her crime and the guy that stole the uniform was her brother... lazy writing. Then shortly after this horrible scene was the line that made both me and my wife say turn it off. A good show is made by great lines. You can not take these things for granted. What should be the defining moment of a show the return of humans to earth, the first steps of mankind back on the soil of our home world, such steps that should be defined by word comparable to that of Neil Armstrong... the writers choose... "We're back, B*****s!" ... and with that we turned it off.
4.0~I Really Liked This Show . . . Until masscraft Sign in Permalink I genuinely enjoyed this show until the 110 pound girls started ordering around all the guys, many of whom are 225+ pound barbarians. No way do these oversized warriors bow down to these little girls. It's ridiculous and obvious pandering to the Hunger Games and Divergent crowd (both of which I enjoyed, BTW). I keep waiting for the male "grounders", all of whom look like they're ready to jump into a WWE ring and win, to reach out and smack they're skinny little leaders, but it doesn't happen. The premise is just disingenuous. This series started off so promising and believable (in a sci-fi sort of way), but quickly turned into a "girls rule!" farce. No thanks. I won't be back.
9.0~It's Great and refreshing stephanie_94 Sign in Permalink I don't know why people are being so hateful about this show, because I and fellow dutch people think that this is a really refreshing and cool show. Sure we had to get used to the acting, which wasn't that good in the beginning, but once you're past that, you can really enjoy the storyline, and then the acting doesn't bother you anymore. You see the show will grow and get better with every episode. Emotions are more believable, characters are growing on you, etc. And I think the storyline is really thought trough well! my compliments. Don't even think about cancelling the show because it's so addictive lol! You did a good job and i'm really excited to find out what will happen in the second season!
7.0~A world without God verandoug Sign in Permalink The 100, actually shows what the world would be like if there were no God. The reason the world has grown technologically in the last 2000 years is because of Jesus Christ. Otherwise we would be like these people killing each other and calling it good. There would be nothing but warriors and overbearing lords telling people what to do and how to do it. There is no freedom. Then ironically when the world is obliterated, the last standing building is a church. Does anybody notice this? Will be interesting to see how much killing they do in the next season.
9.0~Great escape, easy way to chillax after a long day cliberiou Sign in Permalink Watched the first two episodes and we got hooked. Simple, easy, fast paced, characters build up and change over time which is great, whilst others come and go within an episode... No shortage of change. Damn, what's going to happen next? It's kinda real at times, then it's fantasy, then it's pie in the sky (which is different to fantasy because it's kinda out there but you grapple with logic because there's a tangibility to be plot at a certain point) I think that's why we love it. Go the grounders! :-)
1.0~Do not watch the show! eliza-sandor1 Sign in Permalink The 100 was always problematic.But i sadly ignored it because of the feminist undertones and the representation of the lesbian and bisexual community in the second season. But since season 3 the show has become unwatchable. The racist and colonialist undertones are not undertones anymore. We now have grittiness and graphic violence instead of good and consistence storytelling. Just showing graphic scenes does not make you the second GoT. This show is aimed at teenagers, but there are no trigger warnings to protect them from seeing rape,violence,self-harm and violence. All the minorities seem to suffer every episode. Good character development and characters are sacrificed to elevate the straight (mostly white) male "heros". While the women suffer and have to "suck it up", the men can commit multiple murders without having to face the consequences and still be the hero because they lost someone. I have no idea why this show got renewed, but i sure as hell won't continue watching it,
3.0~reality show iuliusaugustus Sign in Permalink the idea is nice if we completely ignore all the stupid things and we go on with the story but, and this is a CAPITAL "BUT", this characters are similar to any reality show where people turn sides and total change their mind each week. we start with a nice group that become pretty bad people, than again good, than once again bad, than ...again and again. at least 3 times i wanted to stop watching season 1, but i was just curious how the story can go over and found a nice story with the idea of mount weather which made me curious and i started season 2 where again everybody is turning sides and go the total different way. everybody knows that a good character will evolve and become something after some episodes, this is the first series that has total redraw of characters at each 2-3 episodes season 3 if they make it ( i hope not ) will be the same, Lexa lose control of the 12 tribes and fight each other ( yeah after she betrayed Clarke to save "her people" ) and probably die all, Clarke will go solo and find that island too ( earth is round you know ), and after going berserk for a while Jaha will be again the good leader and will bring everybody to the island where the bomb will blow and everybody will die - end of season 3 with exception of Clarke which will stop the electricity AI dies too but not before charging the nuke. Clarke will go to water and a submarine will save her going to inner earth - season 4
7.0~juwfvngjunv roelhessels Sign in Permalink Unrealistic it is, for example the Moon is way to close to earth, but i like the series
2.0~Bloody and Dirty Faces. zasde-31406 Sign in Permalink A lot of Blood and Anger. Young people kill each other every day non stop. Longer than necessary, soapy dialogues, as if show creators love dragging out every episode. Too much difficult to understand fiction.
10.0~Keeps getting better and better! nanoassyria Sign in Permalink OMG this show literally became my favorite show. There's always action in it and you never get bored. It even keeps getting better. Guys please don't judge it if you only watched the first season because it gets darker and a lot better.... EVERY ONE SHOULD WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE
10.0~Great Show Sabrina108 Sign in Permalink I am quite personally a fan of most of the cw shows (past and present) and I love this show. It fits perfectly with the rest of their shows. Theirs been a lot of comments on here about it being another stupid teen drama. A) it's not really that stupid. It has a great idea focusing on a post nuclear war radiation soaked earth. And B) the cw has often catered to teen drama style shows (the vampire diaries, gossip girl, & 90210 were all teen dramas on the channel and all huge successes) so I don't get why people are complaining. It has a strong female lead and the characters in the show are often at odds with each other on what they think the best course of action is. But then they all pull together and typically most come out OK. Their is a high level of violence but it's not gory or scary or anything like that. This is one of those shows that almost anyone could watch as long as you can make it through the first episode or so because it does start off somewhat slow, but then again most shows do.
7.0~It's OK but could be better steefan-92 Sign in Permalink Edit: I had re-written whole review after getting to season 2 episode 12. OK here is the deal, my old review wasn't fair enough and I decided to change my initial rating and review.I was about to give it 8/9 before I got to episode 7-8 of second season, reason why I didn't and decided to go with mark 7 will be explained below. First, shows starts off badly , however it gets better and better from episode 1 onward. You get to know characters, watch how they strive to survive, get to known story from few perspectives , learn about each nation (culture) and acting is not as bad as my initial impression was. However it has some serious drawbacks , in season 1 it's about love triangle that goes on and on and on , it drags forever, for to long, thankfully ending of season is redemption for that.Now second part and problem I am having has appeared once remaining survivors from Ark landed.This is where everything started to fall apart, at first slowly but it accelerate fairly fast. What I am talking about is next thing.Chain of command is messed up ,I am not sure anymore who is riding who there.Second Clark's mother acts like some character from anime made for kids with attitude I "will save everyone, without anyone getting killed". Basically they at war and yet her mother persist being jerk, with attitude and annoying dialog, "you can't do that it's not safe", "you are just a kid", "I know what's good for you", "We have to warn them", "We can't leave them" and this drags on and on.Honestly they should have give her much less attention as they did in season 1 because she is the most annoying character. So that's main reason why I will give this show 7, because season 2 ruined almost everything that was build in season 1.In fact this show is not anymore about 100th, it lost identity and I am curious will season 3 make up for season 2 mess.Season 2 had great potential which is wasted by poorly written script.It has moments but as nearly as many season 1 had. Overall it's good show, in fact it turned out to be much better than I expected , it starts slow and first few episodes are really tedious to watch but once you get past fourth episode it becomes rather interesting.
1.0~"Lost" Sci-fi with Potential itsvchickthing1993 Sign in Permalink The CW's REVIEW: The 100 What could I tell you guys about this show... It has no motive...just wait, I'm not through yet, I promise. The 100 is like one of those "lost" shows not a lot people know about. There's no hype. And when you find that "show" it changes your life. You scrap for more, and more, and more. What I can see is that The 100 as I said has no "motive" there's not a plot, just a setting, they go from the setting. If you're open-minded to shows like this give it a try I urge you. The 100 are 100 delinquents from the Ark, a spaceship preserving what was left of humanity after Armageddon destroyed the earth. When the oxygen began running out the 100 delinquents were sent down with monitors to see if the earth was survivable. There you go. There's your setting. They take this background and send it off, in so many, many, freaking' many, twists and turns you never really know what's going on. They've got a main motive, but one minute it's enemies bad to enemies bearable because we need each other. So you never really know. Let's not forget some awesome female roles. Time for the bad? *DISCLAIMER* This show, is considered far more "darker" then some "shows." It's not unbearably scary dark. Yet there's always some "death" going on. It's about survival, and it portrays survival really well, a grisly take it or leave it kind of deal. It shows the good, it shows the evil, and then you have the anti-heroes. It shows people's stable mentality in a world of hunt or be hunted.(excuse me The Walking Dead for using your "slogan") Someone is always shot/stabbed/speared/slitted and etc. there is a fair amount of violence, but depending on how much you can handle it isn't that bad. I give The 100 a 10/10. It's crafty, and clever, worth a try, but because it just "go's" I highly enjoy it. Onto the book. All I can say is, The 100 book was made first. That's where your background comes from. The 2nd book "Day 21" was still being written by the time the first season of the TV show was being shot. It doesn't stay true to the books. I warn you. It's two separate worlds where you get the best of both. Because there was no main motive in the book either, you get one side from the author, then you get the visually grisly darker side, of the TV show.
8.0~Pretty good drama and action and a cringy script bo_nec-48068 Sign in Permalink So I've been watched it since the first season and I can say there's a few CGI but a good one, especially on the first two seasons. They've had a good starting point but there are some moments when you're just questioning yourself: " Why do they choose to do some unworthy things just for a little reward?? " and by that I mean Clarke's decisions which are mostly only bad ones but maybe that's how this character may be like... One who carries maybe too much for her friends. Have to mention that sometimes, it makes you angry to see these bad decisions that are being taken and this is the reason why script is cringe sometimes. However, I liked the first 4 seasons of the show, it has some good parts too, which makes it worthy to watch. The story about how humanity trying to survive is astonishing and it makes the show even more interesting.
9.0~This show is Not a teenage drama as is propagated! Please rate is show higher and stop looking at the first season for guidelines! David12222 Sign in Permalink If you did not think the first season was awesome, then you should definitely check out the second season! The story line has alter into a much darker plot that will shock those who watch cw TV. The way the grounders and the sky people are evolving is extraordinary! The constant threat of mount weather and their calculating cruelty is astounding! This show deserves much higher ratings than what it has been getting lately. This series has so much potential that it really is a shame that so many people are not giving it a chance. I fear for the future of this awesome show if it continues to be ignored. Please spread the word to increase more TV viewings and to stop these ridiculous ratings it has been getting!
8.0~Surprisingly well written and acting damon503 Sign in Permalink I gave this show a rating of an 8 and it is deserving of it. It is well written and the acting is top notch, Coming off a disappointing season 8 of TWD, I searched high and low for my next tv show to binge to, and being GoT's last season too, I am excited to say that I accidentally stumble upon this gem of a show. I was skeptical at first, seeing so many good looking teens and shirtless young guys with six packs, I seriously thought it would be another soap opera in space. Not even close! Each season is well written and has me on the edge of my seat every time wanting more! What makes this work is the amazing writing of the show, there's always a surprise at every turn. Once you think the heroes get out of a sticky situation, another one rears its ugly head just around the corner. Add the great cast and great acting, you end up having one hell of a show! And believe me, I stay away from all those corny, teeny shows like 90210 or Melrose Place because they always cater towards the female species. Trust me, this show caters towards both the male and female. And if you're a huge sci-fi fan, this series will be right up your alley, even if you're not, you'll find a surprisingly well written show to binge to. A great show, can't wait for season 5 to begin!
10.0~No one cares about science!!! amoiscott Sign in Permalink I am reading some of these negative comments and its like i am in school. Obviously the people who watch this don't care about the scientific logic. The story-line makes it good enough to watch. When i watch any television show, i don't look for the scientific logic, i look for entertainment. Some of you need to lighten up.
6.0~Great concept, iffy delivery. scornolan Sign in Permalink This was overall a great season and show so far. However some things get annoying, especially if you hate the whole high school relationship TV trope. I love relationships on shows //where they matter//, but The 100 focuses in on so many relationships and make-outs and hookups. I understand they are teens and have needs and all that, but for crissakes, this is a sci-fi dystopian show that could be SOOOOO much better if they focused on more sci-fi things! The first episode was great with this, so many cool notions. But by mid-season, the show falls prey to teenage relationships. God. Also the ending. I'm not going to put a spoiler in here so don't worry!!! All I want to say about it is what???????????? It made no sense to me at all, maybe in part because I haven't read the novel. (by the way, there's a novel??? crazy.) But shows and movies are supposed to make it so you don't //have// to read the book to understand. The 100 did a horrible job with this at so many parts, the end of season one being #1. Hopefully next season will shed some light on some of this.
4.0~The 100 has 100 awful reasons to keep dragging itself ranjan-thangjam Sign in Permalink Every character is so conflicted that it makes sense to understand that the writers are actually conflicted. Maybe they should try to have some integrity with their characters. Every season and every episode and an opportunity for any character to take a U-turn and find a 100 ways to ruin everything. There is none you want to take a stand for. It's like a master manipulator who keeps making up a web of lies and deceit - and you actually realize they are cheating on you. I hope there is no season 4 and the writers get busy. Writing something else. Something with a little sense of human credibility in it. Till then i am happy with a Steven Seagal movie. It seems like a respite.
6.0~I'll be gentle. mauritsverheij Sign in Permalink Well I know it's called fiction. I just really did not like the sudden change in characters. It doesn't get any less further on in the series. People turning on each other in the weirdest ways. Actually, once further on I started looking at the episodes as a Spanish soap from Married With Children I came to enjoy the series a little. The acting on the other hand is good as far as I think. I enjoyed it. Same as the decor, the scenery goes all out. It looked really nice. Just wished the story was a little less teenage-drama, I guess. Gave it three stars initially. I did however watched season 1 to 4 so I must have enjoyed something. The part with Alie was the fun part I think. I guess because it was the most coherent part. Though the first two and a half seasons I was about to scratch out my eyes out for keeping up. Raised it to four stars. Think it should be somewhere in between. The unbelievable plot-twists and sloppiness throughout the story-line, especially in the first two-and-a-half seasons are what tips it to the negative side of the scale for me. Would have liked to see some rational thinking and it to be a little more more correct (human and social-)science(s) and time-line wise. Though that's where fiction kicks in I reckon.
10.0~100 kids get sent down to a radiation filled earth after over a century of it not being survivable 100 years. zjenningz-25990 Sign in Permalink amazing show.I highly recommend to watch. The main roles are played by Eliza Taylor(Clarke),bob Morley(Bellamy) in which these two lead the 100 kids to survival on the radiation contaminated earth. I am a really picky person and yet i would rate this series a 10 out of 10. This show is better than the walking dead, prison break, flash, arrow, and many more. it is a must watch.
9.0~Exponentially getting better every episode!!! gabrielcforget Sign in Permalink The 100 started off slow. From bad acting to where the hell is this show going? At first I thought it was a show for 13 year old people. But I have to say from the middle of the first season I have become addicted to it and I am not 13 years old. What really made me love this show is the dilemmas that EVERY single character has to go through. It's hard not to get attached to some of them even though they might make bad choices especially considering what these young people go through. Almost every major event is unpredictable and have me at the edge of my seat. This show gets better every episode and every plot is more intense then the one before and this is why I strongly recommend this show if you like sci-fi series with action, adventure and life or death choices.
10.0~It gets better and better, by season 2 it is on par with the best of TV residentevil182 Sign in Permalink Whenever I read complains about The 100 most of them refer to the pilot, which I think it's pretty unfair since the show has 29 episodes to judge. The 100 starts out broad, but as it develops it gets darker and more engaging. By episode 3 you get hooked and from there onwards the show just gets better and better. Some characters on the show are born out of stereotypes, I won't deny that, but their evolution is what makes them remarkable. Think about Clarke Griffin, the main protagonist; during the pilot she's a defacto heroine moved only by the motivation of saving everyone because it is the right thing to do. Sounds pretty boring, right? I thought so too during the pilot. But then, as the show grows deeper and complex, so does the characters, and Clarke easily became my favorite character on the show. Why? Because of the layers the show created around her. It is impossible to describe Clarke in just one adjective. Just saying "she's strong" falls short, it doesn't show the moral dilemmas she faces, nor her moments of weakness. It doesn't show the brief moments she has to laugh or when she has to kill and is haunted about it. It doesn't show when she falls apart and picks herself right up, it doesn't show that she cares about people and at the same time that she has enough rage to kill without remorse. "Strong" can't even begin to describe Clarke; you'll need many more adjectives in order to describe her, and that's remarkable. There are many characters on TV that can be reduced to a single adjective, especially female characters which are usually reserved for mere love plots, but that's not the case with the women of The 100 (by season 2 loves triangles are completely dropped from the show). The 100 isn't afraid of taking risk, every episode makes a huge gamble as the characters make choices that will potentially alienate them for the audience; but what the show does so well is setting the context in which these hard choices are made, it makes the audience understand that the choices made don't come from a place of evil, but rather for survival. It dances on various shades of grey (not to confuse with that hideous book) and it makes the audience wonder: would I do the same? The characters are constantly at war with other factions on Earth, and they are forced to do things they are not proud of: they have killed innocent people, from both their side and the enemy's side, they have betrayed, they have deceived, and yet, when everything's put into perspective, you get what they do it, you understand their motivations and the circumstances that led them to do so. One of the strongest elements of The 100 is how real it feels; if the circumstances on our world were the same, I believe this is how it would come to past. The 100 is dead serious, it isn't campy like many other sci-fi shows (not that there is something wrong with being campy), and it does so to make a direct statement about human condition: we are not good guys, we are simply trying. Everything comes together eventually; the acting gets better and better, and so the script and the technical aspects of the show such as special effects and stunts are fairly amazing. As such, this is a show that should be judge upon seeing at least 4 episodes and not just deciding on the pilot. As soon as The 100 finds its voice, it becomes something else.
5.0~The 100 millennial's (GAME) reviewers-70304 Sign in Permalink Yes the show is good, and without the moronic decisions that they make in every show there wouldn't be a story. So as you watch the show, look for the moronic decisions, insights, and millennial references; tally them up during each episode. See who comes up with the longest list. It will add excitement and could be turned into a drinking game for each one you match... Have fun! Jim
1.0~Stealing a Sagan plot line intermixed with sexism and millennial magical thinking industrialwonk Sign in Permalink The one interesting plot line can be readily found in a very old science fiction book by Nick Sagan called "Idlewild." The other plot hook revolves around "misandry" in that the female characters are the linchpins of every "tribe or individual person" that this show encounters. BTW "misandry" cannot be found in the IMDb spellchecker but misogynist does! How is that for sexism! This show is not misogynistic it is "misandrist." I could easily accept a single group of celibate but beefy "Amazon Warriors," I could easily accept a highly competent woman scientist, and I could even accept a female computer. However, I cannot palate all this estrogen oozing forth all at once from everyone and everywhere and from multiple barbarian and Amazonian tribes, from magical heroines, from female AI's. Perhaps the characters will at some point in this show "bleed though their eyes or somewhere else entirely." The show is sexist from the reverse direction. The show is sexist trash. Worse than sexism, this show relies entirely on empowered millennials who use the power of self absorption combined with magical thinking to find common cause. Like millennials everywhere the groups portrayed in this TV show have the ability to cause problems and avoid both common sense and solution points.
10.0~Don't listen to the bad reviews! Folks_07 Sign in Permalink It's sad to see so many bad reviews with so many mistakes in it,it feels like people are looking at the cast,see CW and say "ahh nah,i don't need a 90210 post apocalyptic series, i'll give it a 1 out of 10". So, to all of those "great reviews",get your facts right before you rate something low for something that isn't true. If you want to be entertained, don't listen to bad reviews, especially when the average rating IS pretty high! Give it a try, watch 2-3 episodes and decide for yourself, a review or 1 episode most likely won't tell you if you will like it or not,or at least shouldn't. The 100 is something new,interesting and has (at least in my opinion) more pros then cons. The cast is doing a fine job, the story has a lot of potential and i really like the setting, they did some really great things here and the series is getting better and better with every episode. Give it a try if you are into Sci-Fi and or post apocalyptic settings!
10.0~Sci-Fi Drama with leadership, Sacrafice and emotions rohitgour-74996 Sign in Permalink First i am huge fan of this series , so i will give you the +ve review about THE100 if you are reading it so i am sure you have already read some reviews , so keeping this into mind ,this series is all about leadership and cooperation among the teenagers . When there is the situation of do or die and we have very less time to decide for not only for ourself but for the group that we are leading , so you can watch these type of events. This is Sci-Fi drama with a lot of deathly decisions . they tried to show us the core relation ship among the people ans how hard it is when someone did wrong that we love to , and we have to decide what to do next . This series tells us about that it is easy to do something alone , but when it comes to a group,there should be strong leadership to decide . To make your follower believe that when you are present no one can hurt them, then they will do anything that you want , they will die or kill for you jf in need . in this series you will different kind of atmosphere in every season.
2.0~Stunningly awful broadcastcreative Sign in Permalink Every high school movie ever meets every cheap scifi retread ever meets Lord of the Flies. The premise is beyond highly flawed. Dialogue as if written by a cliché robot. Poorly acted or is that just poorly written and directed and the actors can't save it .. there may be a couple good actors in the lot. Cliché plots, sets, wardrobe, makeup, effects and especially Foley .. ohhhh you Foley guys love your clichés. I guess all this stuff was re-tasked from other, hopefully better, productions. It's as if the possible future has been cast by scifi anecdote and there seems to be little imagination as to possible variants. This is the epitome of what's wrong with "network" programming (I guess the CW qualifies). Look to Netflix, HBO, AMC and foreign sources for anything with a hint of reality. This medium requires "the suspension of disbelief" ... watch The Wire, The Killing, Hinterland, Luther, and The Returned as examples. A lead reviewer called this great scifi .. I hope in so doing he hasn't painted all scifi fans with a broad brush. I would like to think that audience still hopes for something better.
1.0~Another good idea with much things went wrong nikolaiv85 Sign in Permalink I can't even start what is wrong with this TV show. First, this is some version of The lost, made in post-apocalyptic atmosphere. You can see all the time that hard core feminist(nice language from me to define her) woman wrote original book, because all men are bunch of unstable idiots only useful for woman manipulation and not making woman hands dirty. Second: this is story how untrained people with high tech technology return 150 years after nuclear apocalypse.They DON'T know there are on Earth too many different tribes, they DON'T know about another survivors and existence of any kind of vaults, they DON'T know anything about vegetation and animals on Earth. So -they are cave men high tech kind, and they put 100 teenagers to go on Earth because they have less and less air in Arc, space station formed from 12 others! That 100 teenagers, don't have- weapons, food, clothes, their ship missed their target for several miles and they can't get their supplies. Parents of 98 didn't know for that, but two of their parents are on power trips, and I can say-very stupid. BTW all of that kids are some kind of "criminals", so this is to "ease" their death sentence (you have feeling that some of them are in prison because they didn't flush toilet in 5 seconds). This is bad drama show -there is more talk about relationships, "power". We can see "illegal born girl" to change three guys in 2 days-one of them got killed, another is only nerd, and third one kidnapped her so she turned her kidnapper into lover and follower(yeah actress is very hot, but really-another female power trip again from writer). In first few episodes you can see bunch of people die for nothing, illogical turns. Later you can see illogical survivals, strange conclusions, and totally unrealistic diplomacy. All the time there are ignorant Clark (yeah parents really destroyed girl childhood by giving male name) and her mother, typical representatives of "strong woman"-little thinking, always in motion, ignorant about feelings(both of them killed their male partners because of greater good, and both thinking like emotion is weakness), and everyone breaking their own rules to save them-but they are "stronger than their friends" so two of them are " perfect personal strength". Clark is so "great person" that guy killed 18 unarmed people to FIND her, and she was "MERCIFUL" to stop their enemy to kill him with torture. Even tribes on Earth are ruled by women. Writer heard about matriarchy, but she forgot that patriarchy started when people became hunters, and you can see one mother with child in almost entire first two seasons. You start to imagine how that people can be even alive- from that point of view. There are also other science facts that can't be possible or could be easily solved if that kind of technology exist. We can call this- in future women will lead with all day complaining yelling,all day shifting relationships, because men are so stupid, and wars will start and end dependable on number of personal issues and mood of "female alpha leader". 4 is because idea is not bad,survival and social interaction can be difficult, but this kind of sexist dominance, making this "love can be used as power" drama, and lack of technological knowledge made this show garbage. Especially because all f... ups in targeted population (try to bring girls as main viewers ) is because of all this assumptions writer tried to represent as attributes of "strong female characters"...
7.0~not that bad tdunlavey-802-525091 Sign in Permalink I normally find CW shows obnoxious but this little show is a legitimate sci-fi show. it's like Battlestar Galactica meets Lord of the Flies. some of the stuff is silly, but most science fiction has science that makes no sense. These ppl. should've had little bonsais and other plant vegetation all over their space station so their oxygen levels wouldn't be failing and it looks like only the American population was saved. That being said the show isn't bad. The characters and their interactions are interesting especially the main male role of Bellamy...for a teenage drama these kids have had to make a couple serious decisions and have reacted accordingly in survival mode.
10.0~Incredibly good! kasperdyrendal Sign in Permalink *** NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW *** This show is really good! For a long time I was thinking that maybe I should see it, but I never really got around to it except for a couple of days ago! And I was hooked immediately! I kept thinking that it is probably some chick flip or something but it is not. There is drama, there is action, there is suspense and lots of blood! And the acting is really good in my opinion. The pace is good! - You don't feel like it is moving to slow or fast. It is all just very good! (Except the animals for some reason.. The animals are very CGI (But don't worry - there aren't a lot of animals, so it's okay)) I started watching this about 4-5 days ago and it took me about 2-3 days before I was done watching the first season. And now I am almost done with the second season already. And it's not even a week ago I started watching the show! A lot of TV Series have a long and slow plot (At least I think so) but this just jumps right into it all! The only shame is that there are no more than two seasons at the moment ;) I rate this a clear 10 out of 10 stars! Just give it a shot! And if you are in doubt, just watch the first episode and there is a high chance you will get hooked like me! :)
10.0~Amazing series but not for everyone.. prayaghigh Sign in Permalink The series is amazing but to a specific audience. Not everyone will like this because majority of the plot and everything is something that only a person who likes sci-fi movies or shows will love, which explains why the rating is low. Otherwise, the rating should be much higher if people only watch what they're interested in and not everything that pops up (read the genre first people). Some people might not like it because there are some parts where it feels like it's not going anywhere, but the writers and actors took care of that. Great actors, must watch for someone who likes space and sci-fi stuff.
7.0~If you get into it neimanmroz Sign in Permalink A lot of people will say that this show sucks. To be honest, it's not great. There are plot holes, relationships that may make you violent and characters even more so. However, if you can choke down the first three or four episodes, you might get hooked. I started watching The 100 because I was bored and didn't think I would make through the first episode. But after a little while I started to get into the plot. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE FIRST FEW EPISODES, some characters change entirely and others prove that their not as stupid as they seem when their introduced. So, all in all, don't watch if you're expecting some award winning acting or story telling. Watch if you want to keep yourself entertained with a decent show with a cool story.
7.0~What's your problem Jason Rothenberg? nimicas Sign in Permalink First of all, man I like this TV series, I like the story, the actors, but Jason Rothenberg why are you making us suffer? Your foolish scripts like killing mountain weather kids and other innocent people made me criticize you. What's got in to you? Like killing good people, kids? It's some sort of new TV series stuff, making a series amoral? How to watch kids? I hate you for that. Gassing kids is something what you dream at nights? The second thing is that that you made good people to leave the bunker, you made a kids without a father, you decided (scripted) that wild people are more equal than good "sky crew" people and deserves equal standards, forgetting that they are just a bunch of killers who don't care about nothing just some meat, girls, good being. Jason Rothenberg you look like a child who suffered in his youth and maybe you doesn't deserve to script The 100 series, I think you will ruin all the saga with your incompetent decisions and I would be frustrated as a watcher, liker and a viewer. Your decisions (scripting) are amoral, incompetent and you should be banned from TV Series producing. Have some examples from Jon Bokenkamp, Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, Chris Carter, Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, Andrew Kreisberg and other producers because you look poor, your skills makes viewers cry, angry and you shouldn't be on the air. I hope you're reading this, well you need this, because you are getting so much incompetent.
9.0~Flaws bring down a potentially great show coltonunden Sign in Permalink The 100 in plot, story, and production is a great show, it's new and has continuing potential to go anywhere it wants. However the flaws in characters have really put it off scale to be a 8/10 to 10/10. As a watcher so many characters don't keep personalities, they flip flop extremely. One day they are enemies and the next they are holding hands. While disaster may bring humans together, it doesn't do it consistently and especially on a regular basis. It really irks me how dramatically and without any context relationships changed. Especially Abby and Kane throughout the entire show. It's like every few episodes they do a reset and forget about the entire rest of the episodes that built on their personality. Its distracting and its disappointing from such a great show. People don't change their minds and entire relationships with people based on a episode, I would understand maybe working towards a season that they finally came together but the flip flopping and lack of any consistent character development is sad. This show has wonderful potential, and it uses most of it.
10.0~Crazy good Fredrik_Simensen Sign in Permalink Crazy good, can't stop watching. Negative side is it can't get any better. Good actors. The series was off to a slow start, but it is getting better and better. The premise is original and fun, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is no doubt about it that this show is one to keep an eye on, it seems it gets darker each episode, but with that said that could also end up killing the show as a lot of viewers have accepted its violence so far because it has been done tastefully, without too much gore. Most of the bloodier scenes take place in a dark place or is carefully done by camera angles to get the point across but to not upset the CW's typical viewers, and this is great in a world of The Walking Death and Game of Thrones, etc. It's a welcome method of delivering the same intensity without being overly grotesque.
10.0~The fight for your people.. and Jesus (Jaha) coming to save you tarekalitaha-1 Sign in Permalink There is much more to 100 than meets the eyes. Its a fast paced, full of action with lively characters facing difficult choices every episode. The underlying stories of why Clark, Raven, Bellamy, Jaha and all others do their actions is very important to understand why the show is so entertaining. The values, the brutality, the killing, it's an epic story where everyone is dispensable and the twists are well played. So I've established that i like the show, but here is my theory of what the series is conveying to its viewers, So you live in space then get sent to earth, where its brutal and basically everyone is killing themselves, for what? to protect their own. The new earth society is divided into new social categories: - The Blood suckers! (the mountain people) - The Educated (the sky people) - The Savage (The Grounders) - The Dispensables (The Reapers) The fight and kill happening on earth and then Jaha whose mission was always from day one to save the human race, is coming to earth himself. He is searching for the city of light That nobody dies in it. He started preaching about it and nobody believes him. I think the similarities are fun notice!
10.0~one of the best luca_iosua Sign in Permalink From episode 1 until now, this series has been one of the best. I mean, there are a few plot holes, but for real, if you're not really looking for them, you don't even realize it. It has a great story, that never gets boring, it has suspense and it gives you adrenaline. It's just great! <3
10.0~Best of all time!! tozenibiru1980 Sign in Permalink It gets better season after season!! With any doubt, the best post-apocalyptic series of all time!!
10.0~Best show and cast katkins-29458 Sign in Permalink I've watched since the beginning and can't get enough. I watch over and over from beginning to end this show is addictive. I can't wait for Season 4 it's gonna be awesome! The Cast is the best I love them all usually could care less about whose in a show I remember all the actors names! That says a lot for me since I am not a celebrity watcher. Eliza Taylor and Bob Morley have great on screen chemistry as leaders. Lindsey Morgan is gutsy, smart and cute and Chris Larkin is just sweet and real. On this show you even fall in love with the minor characters and miss when they are gone. If you like Sci fi watch this show it's captivating! Ricky Whittle was so endearing and lovable as Lincoln. Long live Linctavia!
3.0~So American... mgwerner-66619 Sign in Permalink The actors are all so healthy, clean (even when dirty), unscarred and American plump. Long, luxurious hair, bright smiles, and multiple layers of revealing clothes. No attempt to be believable. Season 3 shows that the star has been missing water and on short rations for months, but is still plump with chubby cheeks and extra padding around the next and shoulders. And flawless skin, despite radiation, sunburn, and struggling through the wilderness. Good premise, but way too much SJW everyone is equal and we can all get along. Real people would be much more bloodthirsty in a survival situation, and would always, always hold grudges. The real world would call for never, ever leaving an enemy alive.
6.0~This series could have been uplifting instead of killing kids drjane-99344 Sign in Permalink This could have been a cute, uplifting series about rediscovering and repopulating the earth. A group of humans with advanced scientific knowledge landing to help the current earth population; to bring them out of a dark age. Instead is it what has become a typical CW gory, kill-em series with big, bad, evil groups. Every new CW series contains a big government organization trying to kill a bunch of kids off. Even the "good guys" are bad, so who cares if they repopulate or all die off. Maybe the CW can learn from the shows that are not lasting and introduce some new shows that will last, like Smallville which ran for 7 years.
3.0~Starts out good...then degrades into moral stupidity. Too bad! patrog-35774 Sign in Permalink The first season wasn't too bad. It pulls you in and gets you interested. The second season initially ratchets things up and gets real interesting...but then starts scratching for audience/ratings/relevance/whatever by adding in girl on girl. Season three continues the trend by throwing in support for the same on the guy side. Partially through S03E08, my morals wouldn't let me slide anymore. While watching it, I actually told myself "if a certain sequence of events happened...I was done with the series"...well, very shortly after, it did and I clicked X and was done with it having wasted many hours on the first season and a half. Overall, if you've got a decent moral compass, I do not recommend wasting your time on this show. If you don't, go float yourself! :)
9.0~This show shocked me because of how great it was! natehorne-42305 Sign in Permalink This show is pretty good it gets better every season. It's a mashup of all the good shows and films, Passengers, Game of Thrones, The Hunger Games, Divergent and The Walking Dead. It starts quite slow at first then once you get past the first season you'll really get into it.
10.0~For me it was a roller coaster!! sorinelstan Sign in Permalink I don't usually give reviews but this time it felt like the right thing for this TV Series! I will not go into specifics but i will say how i felt through the seasons. For me the first season really hooked me up and it made me want more, following through season 3, after that, season 4 and 5 actually let me down a little, it was not what i hoped for, but season 6 hit me hard again, and i can't wait for the next episode to come, i'm like a child waiting for Christmas every week. The decisions, the suspense, the characters attitude and how they changed, everything it just aligned with my hearth and with what i wanted. For others it may not be that good or not even decent, but this 10 stars a really for season 6, because it gave me back the hype and enthusiasm to watch again! Thanks and please don't let me down again. At least until the end of this season!
10.0~Stick through season 1, gets better with every season bogdanvalentinneacsa Sign in Permalink Have to say, this is the only show or movie that I had to change my rating 4 times already. I have to admit, season 1 for me was not good. I did not really like the main character at all, I thought the acting was pretty mediocre bad and the romance seemed forced in and out of place (that was a 6.5 / 10 for me). But still, the premise was interesting enough, and I'm a sci-fi fan that I decided to stick with it, and the season finale had me intrigued. And man am I glad I stuck through it. Season 2 was already a lot more interesting, the acting got better, the romance was toned down and less sappy and the plot just got more interesting. That was already a 8 / 10 by then and most of the characters started to grow on me quite a bit. Season 3 and 4 just kept getting better and better, and right now for me this show is a 10 / 10 and can't wait for the next season to get here! Give the show a chance and power through the first season, you won't regret it.
10.0~Rebuttal of review by valm-957-536316 linbrikat Sign in Permalink I'm a great fan of The 100 but I'm quite prepared to accept that it isn't to everyone's taste. However, when I see a review like the one below by valm-957-536316, it just upsets me because this person is giving the show a rating of 1 out of 10 without properly understanding it. To answer their points - 1. Why do you call the grounders '1000 savage murderous rapists'? Yes they're primitive compared to Skaikru, but rapists? We've never seen anyone rape anyone in this show. 2. Jaha has basically been a hero for most of the show. In season 3 he was chipped by ALIE and was then under her control so wasn't responsible for his actions. 3. The prison ship has come from a mining colony in the asteroid belt. If you'd have been paying attention you'd have seen various clues to this scattered throughout season 4. 4. The child that Clarke is with is NOT her biological daughter. She's far too old for that. Clarke found her five years previously and has been taking care of her. We don't know who either of her parents were. Also, Clarke isn't a lesbian - she's bisexual.
1.0~So dissapointed jbbunyard Sign in Permalink The first two seasons were great, but all of a sudden they threw in the sexual orientation scene....out of the middle of nowhere. Seriously?
1.0~after season 2 it's not even close to SCI-FI, and soooo much feminist propaganda !! raidofdarkness Sign in Permalink No, Seriously, it's not SCI-FI at all any longer, it's more like feminism-fi now, women are brutal, men are feeble n all that new s**t. the only thing that show shows off now is that girls got balls and some men being shouted at and beaten up! how is that sci-fi?
1.0~Too many holes sjomia Sign in Permalink The idea is pretty good in theory but the main goal is survival of the species however no one is procreating and having babies, and people are getting killed how do you keep the species going if none of the women get pregnant? People have sex but no one have babies, and some of the women take leadership roles and I guess no longer have a desire to create a family just to be more like a man. Teenagers mostly pretty women develop Navy seals skills and kill professional warriors with ease, like most cheesy movies and shows, they talk too much before killing like taunting and building up the excitement to a non believable level. I saw the all the episodes out of morbid curiosity but too many cheesy scenes only a few good ones could not wait till series was over please do not make more, I am a fan of science fiction but this show does not come close to a believable reality, it is creative at times. It is mostly crappy this show takes away one of the basic elements in human nature which is to procreate. This show is for teenagers, is about teenage feminism mostly. The Clarke character is extremely annoying, a young girl who can defeat grown men professional soldiers with her fist and wits not be liable at all in really life she would have been killed long ago. The show does not have fresh material the plot gets repeated over and over it gets recycled it gets boring terrible writing, you always know who will win it is the same characters.
10.0~The 100 series legyman Sign in Permalink I found this series on Youtube, when I was searching for best sci-fi series. My vote is 10/10....since that good it is. Some people can find mistakes or whatever, I could not care less - it is good all the way. Storyline is great, it is mysterious and unpredictable. Best sci-fi series since Stargate SG-1 on my opinion. The cast is the best! I like new faces and experienced too. Bellamy, Clarke, Octavia, Finn, Raven - they are just great. I want season 3 ASP! I also loved Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis, but I never liked Star trek for example.
5.0~Sci-Fi soup spikeneil-84-836952 Sign in Permalink This series should have been called The 100 Lost Lord of the Flies Mad Max syndrome. Watchable if there's nothing better but very long winded a a tad silly in a lot of places.
1.0~Another one bites the dust popescu_sorin Sign in Permalink I was going to write a long review about this last season. But it's not worth it. They just ruined it. This last season is garbage. And trust me, i am a big fan of sci fi series, i've watched them all, good and bad. This was a good one, until this season. I'm not watching this anymore even if it's going to be a next season. Frack, still ended with a long review...
3.0~I can't like it but I haven't seen past the third episode phoenixinvictus Sign in Permalink I really tried to like it and even tried to watch a second episode. This series is set in the future where the Earth rendered uninhabitable for humans. The survivors were left in some international space station called the Ark. This doesn't make much sense because it would be more plausible for humans to go underground to survive a nuclear holocaust. But, whatever... Three generations later, the station is (surprise surprise) overcrowded and running low on resources (very unoriginal). Their clever plan to solve this problem? Why we will just toss out 100 of our young onto Earth cross our fingers and hope that they survive. They are treated as criminals, don't get any training or preparation and are expected to report to the Station and tell all that it is safe to return. The teenagers are clichés of rebellion and downright stupidity. On a space station of only 4000 people they should be closer together.
3.0~Teenage Romcom in Wartime tesselbrinky Sign in Permalink I was first happy to see many female characters in leadership and powerful roles. Sadly the series portrays a story very unrealistic and even starts to become annoying after some time. It showcases teenagers running around on a radiated planet, making dumb descisions and killing whatever catches their eye without consequences. The main character Clarke looks like she should be in a teen romcom. Why this teenage blonde girl with perfect looks becomes a leader to a community (including adults) becomes a bigger question every episode. She makes bad decision after bad decision. Kills hundreds of people including her own friends and abandones them. But somehow everyone still trusts her and the viewer is supposed to as well. This is the first time in a series I was actually rooting for the "bad guys" to put the main character to justice (but ofcourse she is always saved by weak excuses). I don't see why the writers think this is a good example of a hero?
9.0~Fantastic show sabetamaida Sign in Permalink It' a really great show, but with many illogical moments. I wonder how "The Grounders" became primitive after all. I mean, they are maybe 3rd generation after nuclear destruction. I would get it if they were 30th. How have they managed to develop another language in that short time and still living without electricity at least. In the end it perfectly shows how humans can be stupid and irrational. Sometimes you wonder do we deserve to exist at all.
10.0~A really great show natserrata Sign in Permalink A really great show not your typical syfi show.show a lot of amazing relationships and great support of the LGBTQ community.Every season gets better and better.Season 3 was one of the best so far
9.0~Though out execution and relevant themes make this truly a decent SciFi thriller. radnen Sign in Permalink I have watched a lot of shows and movies and I love all things Science Fiction. One of my favorite Science Fiction shows of all time is Battlestar Galactica, due in large part for it's portrayals of humanity at the brink of destruction, humanities perseverance in the face of unknown dangers, and the willingness to saunter on when all hope seems lost. This show, The 100 captures this not only in an elegant way, but in a way in which I've never quite seen before. Pick apart any story arc in this series and you can tell that they borrow a lot from other shows and movies. Welcome to modern writing, folks! It's rather the sum of the parts that I'm looking for here. We can start with the premise, a "Lord of the Flies" meets "Battlestar Galactica" meets "Lost" against the backdrop of an Earth where mankind was forced to evacuate into space due to nuclear fallout; it's quite the smattering of science fiction ideas strung end-to-end. This blend of the young adults decent into tribalism and the theme of the survival of humanity and those trapped still on the "Ark" are interwoven beautifully without sounding too cheesy or corny. It opens a whole slew of questions. For instance, after they find out about the grounders, it tells me the Ark was intended for only the elite portion of humanity who got to leave. But after 3 generations they seem to no longer live the way in which they came. There are engineers, janitors, and dirty jobs all scattered around the aging and dying megalithic structure in space. The community on the Ark reminds me much of BSG and the themes they faced. Another curiosity is the fact The 100 were juvenile delinquents. This opens a whole host of issues surrounding superiority complexes and crime. Murphy for instance is a wildcard because he was a hard, cold criminal. Setting up a community of criminals made for interesting intersections of peoples pasts and how they deal with law in the present. Also, take for instance episodes 5 and 12. Episode 5 was one of the saddest episodes because of the stark, cold, and calculated decisions that had to be made to survive in outer space all because the (happily alive) 100 didn't make contact in time. And on episode 12, Abby tried her best to save a girl when they only had 2 days of supplies left. Why try to save someone if they were all going to die anyways? But once the Ark returns to Earth, these moments could now no longer happen. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the Ark moments the best because of the execution of it and what it tells us about humanity when faced with our final moments. I'm excited to see where this goes next, now that there's a Whole New World to explore.
6.0~the 100 sophiebyrom-20030 Sign in Permalink In my opinion, i think the 100 is one of the most underrated shows on TV right now. And i really don't understand why. From it's bight cast of young actors, to it's story ( which even in the cliché dystopia setting, it still come's up with a new fresh plot) it's changing setting and it's strong character development within the shows twists and turns. But like all shows it has flaws. One of theses being the first ep. If the the 100 in'st very popular it could be that the first few episodes seem 'cliche' and show itself as a teen drama rather then the sc fi show it wants to be. But as the season goes on it does start being the show it wants to be. But the main aims of the show are never lost, but the main aim of the show is trying to get earth back, their home (whatever home may be now) I love the character's and how they are with one another. I also like the fact that the show creator's know if a group of teenagers did get put in that situation, they would kind of rebel, like they do on the show. At the end of the day i recommend this show if you like the sc-fi genre and even like a bit of war and conflict thrown into the mix.
10.0~Not as bad as some reviewers seem to think - though there is certainly room to improve... markuskeats Sign in Permalink Earth has lain uninhabited for 97 years after an all-out nuclear war forces a fraction of the human race to flee the planet and wait for the fallout to subside on the Arc, a space station orbiting the planet. Life on the Arc is strict and limited, where breaking even the most benign laws will elicit the death penalty. Those under 18 are interned until they come of age. Every individual has a purpose and makes a contribution so that all can survive. This all changes at the beginning of the first episode, when the main protagonist, Clarke, is forced out of her cell and told that she, along with 99 other inmates, will be the first humans to set foot on Earth, tasked with finding out if the planet is once again habitable. "The 100" invites us to follow two parallel story lines - one that follows the 100 youths sent to Earth, the other following the events that unfold on the Arc after they leave. It is inherently a story of survival, and this story becomes believable the more you are willing to forgive it for it's short comings. I won't sugar-coat it: this show is clearly intended for fans of young adult fiction, with themes drawn from Twilight, The Hunger Games, and more recently Divergent. Occasional flashes of teenage angst are sprinkled throughout the episodes, with a few twist endings thrown in that are unexpected. However, this is hardly a reason for the show to lose marks on, which seems to be the most significant drawback for the other reviewers. It's likely that if you've enjoy young adult fiction, and the three movies I mentioned, you'll probably enjoy this show quite a bit. For me, the biggest drawback has been the development of the characters and overall setting. While some character development is dotted through the episodes with flashbacks, not enough is done to establish their motives and personalities. At one moment we are led to believe that these characters are compassionate and caring, while the next they are cunning and deceitful. I feel like the show is trying to be gritty and real, but it feels forced and somewhat disingenuous. It's hard to tell if this is the writing or the acting (or both), but the show did slowly grow on me. The show hits its stride by the fifth episode, and it consequently garnered the attention it deserves.
2.0~To many ads grdskeeper Sign in Permalink This show would be pretty good if it wasn't a ad every 10 minutes .this second show will probably be my last.I don't care to see more ads then show to bad it had possibility?????????? the people in the show are doing a good acting and it seems to have a good story buy every time it starts getting good a ad pops up an spoils the mood the actors are trying to put on a good show but ads are killing it.It does kind of drag a little it is kind of like the movie jaws you just keep waiting for the shark to show up,We went thru the whole second show an still don't know who's on the planet with them.Just a couple of quick pictures of what might be there.
10.0~This show is so great! coreylandry Sign in Permalink I have been waiting for a post apocalyptic show to watch and I'm really hoping this is it. It contains the mutations of animals, really cool people with masks that they call "grounders" and nuclear storms that eat the flesh off of people. I'm really hoping this show continues.. It is actually really good and I can't wait for season 1 episode 5! Sure people say it's teen drama but that's really how it would be. If you were put on the ground after being locked up for years.. You too would be edgy and angry and want to rule. This show is just everything i have been looking for, and I really hope you create new seasons and keep it going. I hope the grounders are as bad ass as I am hoping they are!
4.0~Teen Rubbish Volstag Sign in Permalink How this can be enjoying a 7.7/10 rating on IMDb is utterly beyond me. This show reminds me very much of "Revolution" -- nothing more than a lame excuse to parade around attractive 20 and 30-somethings masquerading as teenagers. Admittedly, I only watched maybe 30 minutes of this filth, but that was more than enough time to let me know that this is not a science fiction show.... in even the most generous light. It is a teen drama / romance pretending to be a science fiction show. I don't expect this show, or any other show, to be 100% scientifically accurate, but I do expect them to -- at least -- pay lip service to the science. (spoilers to follow) How is it that everyone is well coiffed, physically fit, extremely attractive, and boasting pearly white game show host teeth, when they've been trapped on a space station for multiple generations? How have they not physically withered away by living in a sub 1g environment for multiple generations? Why did they not maintain extremely tight control of their limited resources? Wouldn't they have reduced the resident population from, say, 4k to 3k over the generations to prevent this very thing from happening? When our "teenagers" land on Earth, they're not immediately gobsmacked by going from the restrictive confines of a space station to the open expanse of an uninhabited Earth? The main character and four friends are going to walk 40 miles and return "before dark" carrying enough food to feed 100 people through a wilderness environment they have no direct experience with!? It's utterly preposterous! It would take at least a full day to make that journey, and they could only come back with enough food to last a meal or two (at best). I turned off the show right around this point. This is simply another teen drama trying to cash-in on the current craze of paranormal / magical / young adult fiction. Much like Revolution, it has a very compelling premise, with amateurish execution. Bottom line: if you like a smattering of "science" with your "science fiction", do yourself a favor and stay away from this drivel.
10.0~From Ugly Duckling to a Battlestar quality apostnik Sign in Permalink I was forced to watch first two episodes by my teenage child. I was disgusted by plot holes and teenagers wearing make up after a week in the woods. I suffered through the first season thinking why on earth I'm wasting my time. I'm a big Firefly and Battlestar Galactica fan. The 100 was nothing like it. Then the last episode of the first season came. There was this moment - WAIT WHAT. Something very dramatic was revealed that actually turned the show into SciFi. Almost in an instant things started making sense, teenagers lost nightclub makeup and acquired dirt and blood on their faces. It's almost like once the real story began and the visuals matched it. That was an extreme turn of both the events and cinematography. Some recent episodes in my mind rival Battlestar darkness and depth. Characters lost their stupid one-liners, internal consistency checks out, all kind of characters are well developed and then horrible things happen to them. And the earth based SciFi aspect is holding it all together unlike that space Ark joke in the beginning. If you bother to look at the individual episode ratings you will see this dramatic jump at the end of first season. Some episodes go above 9.0 for all the right reasons. In summary I recommend skimming through first half of the first season to get some backstory and start really watching second half. You will not be disappointed once you meet some interesting characters and technology of the second season.
3.0~Very bad but strangely entertaining d-prim Sign in Permalink This is probably one of the insultingly stupid things I have seen in years, to such an extent that I imagine the writers laughing out loud while doing their work. The plot is a mix of inconsistent elements borrowed from everything popular in the last decade, the most obvious clichés from the genre, absolutely over the top drama, generic moral dilemmas and of course 'young adult' romance we couldn't get enough of. All that is topped with unstable characters completely shifting personalities from one episode to another (others on the other hand will be stable to the point they will only actually repeat similar lines throughout the season) and dialogues that will make you cry / laugh, depending on how you deal with awkwardness. The actors do their job, I guess, however I was under the impression that casting was based on general appearance because almost everyone in 'The 100' is very, very pretty. Plus, I guess, every actor performs better with good direction, so there you go... My review, however, makes me a hypocrite - I hated myself for it but couldn't stop watching for at least two seasons. Maybe it's because I was bored out of my mind and needed something at least a bit sci- fi-ish, but after all, I did end up watching about thirty episodes, so there must have been something to it. I guess the story is interesting in general and the whole thing follows basic principles of what an entertaining show should look like, so... if you're down with flu and have absolutely nothing else to watch, you may give this series a shot.
10.0~Stop hating teen series/movies. This is awesome!!! registermenowok Sign in Permalink I'm one of the people who hate teen series/movies IF they sucks. This series does not sucks at all. I start to know this series from Netflix. I was channel surfing in Netflix and this has more than 4 stars out of 5. At first, I thought, not another teen series cashing in on Young Adult which is a big thing now like Hunger Games and stuff like that. But after watching a few minutes, I was hook. Then it hooks me until the end of Season 1. Normally I start to get bored after a few episodes. Example is I watch 4400 and get bored. Overall The 100 acting is OK but the script is awesome. You have two storyline running intertwined with each other in each episode which makes this quite interesting to follow. The feeling of watching this is almost the same as watching Walking Dead. You just want to know what is next. What is the mystery behind this people and stuff. I think those that hate teen series/movies are just haters. They will miss out this gem.
9.0~Overall, a promising show DandiGood Sign in Permalink Okay, so the show starts off a bit juvenile, but I really think that is to be expected with such young characters (can you really imagine 17-year-old you acting much differently in that situation? I can't). The teenage drama declines after the first few episodes and becomes a little more mature. I think the acting is pretty decent, and the characters are starting to round out a little (they are admittedly a little 2-dimensional at first). Are there plot points that seem a bit far-fetched? Yes. Like The Ark being able to monitor life-signs from space, but not being able to check habitability (radiation levels) without sending down human beings. But it is an entertaining show, nonetheless. Overall, barring some of the more obvious loopholes, I think that this show has potential. Hopefully it won't be cancelled before it falls into a good groove.
8.0~I Think it's a Great Show! ZippyTonguetwister Sign in Permalink Lot of negative reviews. I get it. But hey, it's a CW show aimed at anywhere from teen to early 30's most likely. With that in mind, I think it's a great show! I'm entertained, and the storyline(s) keep my attention. I like the characters, which is important. They're not out trying to win awards, it's an action series and I've genuinely enjoyed each week's episode. And it's not just the good guys and the bad guys, I think there are some intriguing layers to it all, so that keeps my attention as well. I think they have a lot of room to grow, too. I'd say if you liked the idea of Terra Nova (lots of outdoors, fighting for survival, a bit apocalyptic, lots of dirt on faces, that sort of thing), then I'd say give it a shot. But for sure you have to watch a few episodes to let it all develop a bit.
10.0~One of the best shows on TV right now... yahairahp Sign in Permalink I was a fan of a previous TV show from another channel that got off air without warning. Looking for similar TV shows with hopes to find something like it with a promising future, I've found the 100. Since it's very first episode I got addicted to it. I see the death of the characters as a new beginning, well you can't expect a TV show to last with a lame storyline and the same routines, if it was created like that it would have ended last year. It has to lead to Deaths, movements and changes because that are real life challenges of earths life. If you hope it shuts down, you rather change your channel and move on to another no one is forcing anyone to see anything, there's plenty of more shows to see. If you disagree with this TV show get up and change it.
2.0~10% mildly entertaining, 90% idiotic JakeBrinkman Sign in Permalink Note: I have watched through season 5, and I have no intention of watching further. Plot synopsis: A nuclear holocaust has caused all the surviving people to lose all common sense and their memory of history. Okay, that's not actually the plot, but that's what it seems like is happening. This show attempts to maintain constant tension, but the majority of the tense moments are directly caused by a character's decisions after they have seemingly lost all reason or sanity. All of the tense moments that aren't a moron's fault are the fault of some natural or technological disaster, and all of these "science" moments reveal that the show's writers know absolutely nothing about any form of science. But this terrible writing isn't even my least favorite part. The current top IMDb review describes the show as "not afraid to kill people, and deaths are permanent." This statement could not be any further from the truth. Whenever a character is given a speaking role, the character will either die in the same episode or they will survive all the way until the end, with extremely rare exception. Every single episode (sometimes multiple times in an episode) revolves around one or more main characters in a position where death appears to be guaranteed, but some miracle or deus ex machina never fails to save them at the very last possible second. While this is acceptable to happen occasionally, the constant overuse of this general writing style actually serves to negate the tension that the show is trying to raise. When you already know exactly who will live and die, the tension is effectively non-existent, and the show becomes quite boring and predictable. If you decide to put up with this atrocious show, I strongly suggest that you stop watching after season 2. Season 1 - Idiotic decisions and pseudo-science galore, but the two-part finale is actually exciting. 2 out of 10 Season 2 - This is the best season because characters more frequently (but still not always) use some form of reason to make decisions. 3 or 4 out of 10 Season 3 - Back to the formula of season 1, but without the exciting finale. 2/10 Season 4 - Much of the same, but now characters have begun to completely switch roles or inexplicably make decisions that are polar opposites of all their previous character development. 1/10 Season 5 - Same as season 4. 1/10 Spoiler: When a certain character does not die in S05E12, that was my final straw for this show. But I guess that's not really a spoiler because no one ever dies in this show.
1.0~unrealistic fiction adonemario Sign in Permalink it is a teen drama in an unrealistic fiction. teen drama type is okay but the only thing that pisses me off is the dumbness of the script. the things that are happening in this series are pure non sense and straight unbelievable. i can relate with shows that does magic and futuristic tech but this one is tough to swallow. acting is somewhat okay but they could have gotten a believable character. human is murderous in nature but if it is faced with survival issues things do change. kids can be kids but how can you party while being hungry. however the main idea of the show is not terrible at all. a compelling plot with survival is a trending genre. if only the writers and director made a reasonable choice this may have been there with Lost. i don't know how it managed to produce a 3rd season with bad storytelling. its surprising that it got a high rating here and rt.
8.0~Ignore 1st season reviews - big changes beyond Intellectual_Redneck Sign in Permalink Early reviews of this series dismiss the show as teenage drama. And rightfully so, for at least the first half of the first season. I personally was ready to give up after a few episodes but had read that it did get better and I was not disappointed If you keep that in mind, the story matures quickly and becomes more complex, specifically in the latter part of the first season and starting the 2nd. You see the power struggles between groups, and between the "adults" and "kids" who now find themselves under very different circumstances than at the start off the series, and the rules in which they lived by no longer apply. Quite an accomplishment in turning the series around, however it still is targeted at a younger audience. The main characters are well acted, to the point where I'd say any weak characters are some of the "adults". Overall not earth shattering but enjoyable and an interesting premise.
1.0~It is not as good as they say miguehemelberg Sign in Permalink First of all, I watched all the season and in the end I did not like it because the trivia that the producer manages is too bad. Play with the characters, generating both angry and good feelings in the viewer. Should, know how to better manage the viewers and really give them the satisfaction that during each of the seasons is generated. Personally Octavia Blake should already be dead, is NOT a character that satisfies the viewers, in fact many hate it. Then I warn you are ready to sign up in this series in which your feelings will be a roller coaster ...?
3.0~Season 3 killed the show mikaelmadsen1981 Sign in Permalink One of the more refreshing and unique shows on TV, mixing future with medieval genre (fantasy, sci-fi). The first two seasons made you want to see more and you will fall in love with the characters. Then came season 3 and completely ruined the show. A unique show ruined by writers eagerly wanting to make the show like every other survival/medieval show on TV. Kill of main characters for shock value while keeping characters that should have been killed of long ago. Adding blood, gore, more violence and major plot holes instead of keeping it unique for today's standards. Changing and rewriting characters. Season three will make you hate and question every characters move and judgement, what they stood for in season one and two are completely gone and every new episode is more confusing than the other. I started watching this show just because I needed something to watch for thirty minutes and got hooked. Season three got me unhooked, more and more with every episode. Don't get me wrong, the plot for season three is a good twist and added more of the unique blend between two genres. It's just that the rest of the writing is all over and changed the entire show towards the worse. A unique show ruined by the writers greed, a unique genre ruined by making it just like everything else.
7.0~Decent show too bad about the gratuitous nonsense Phantom495 Sign in Permalink Overall this is a good show, and I just don't understand why all of these writers for TV shows today, think that they need to treat sex like it is inconsequential, and treat homosexuality like it is so commonplace. I would like for them to just write the stories and stop trying to make stupid political statements that alienate large portions of the audience! It is very unfortunate that in our modern culture those of us with more conservative values, Christian values, or just common sense when it comes to biology are persecuted and made to feel like we are the outsiders. I personally would never treat anyone else the way that I am treated as a Christian conservative. I guess real tolerance doesn't come from the left after all...
1.0~How to wreck a nice concept acrobaat Sign in Permalink What an unbeleivable crap have they mare out what could have been such a nice story. A technical flawed. Interpersonal immature, the visuals are nice but that doesn't save the movie.
5.0~An entertaining but flawed teen sci fi drama. s3276169 Sign in Permalink I'm not a teenager so for me to say I actually enjoyed a drama pitched at younger viewers is no small admission. This series sees a group of kids who have committed minor crimes sent to earth from an orbiting space station, supposedly the last bastion of mankind after a nuclear war. Inexplicably, given I think not even 100 years (??) has passed the earth is quite habitable. This is where you need to first suspend disbelief, followed by a second time, when a group of survivors called the "grounders" appear who live on the planets surface and in spite of global nuclear war are healthy and mutation free. Err OK. The usual kind of bloody conflict ensues between the two groups and a third who appear at the end of the first season. Its all utterly implausible but oddly quite entertaining. Why? The primary reasons this series works is the interplay between the characters and the interesting plot twists and turns which keep you watching. Moreover, the series is not afraid to kill off key characters ensuring the story never becomes overly predictable. What's not so nice about this series is the underlying message that its OK to do horrible things to other people as long as its in the interests of your "clan".If that sounds familiar well just look at any despot or dictator throughout history who has used patriotism and country as an excuse to commit war crimes and acts of imperialism (read theft). This is not a positive message to send to young people and really casts this otherwise entertaining series, in a dim light. I would have rated this series higher were it not for its flawed message. Five out of ten from me.
5.0~getting dumb... claudippss Sign in Permalink All I can say... boring to dumb... and it was a good show, oh well
2.0~Awesome concept, let down by mediocre plot, dialogue and lack of logic arendhamming Sign in Permalink (only one paragraph with spoilers, marked as such) The concept is awesome. A space station with the surviving human race and then a small group of teenagers (played by actors in their twenties as usual) sent to earth. It's awesome because it can be a little sci-fi-ish, without being all about space ships and alien races. It's awesome because it could be like the hunger games meets battlestar galactica. However, what the hunger games had behind it were three books with a good plot, rather then a single book and way much ignorant screenwriters. In the end it's pretty much a teen drama. Complete with the mediocre acting and episode plots that twist the progress of the story to give every episode it's own tension arc, including the not too exciting cliff hanger. But what's worse... the dialogue. Completely irrational non-discussions that boil down to "i want you to do something that's for your own good, but if you do, you owe me something". The logic is often so cheesy that only someone completely stuck in US culture would fall for it, and then only if they're a not too critical teenager watching the show. Season one is done now. In season two, i'm sure they're going to keep everyone that made the series a "success" alive, regardless if that would be logical in the story progression. But the worst part of the series is the complete disregard of logic. Communication between factions breaks down, and gets re-established but barely audible, breaks down again and then suddenly offers video conferencing. Rocket fuel is at one moment very explosive, the next moment it needs kilos of tnt as an accelerant. When a group becomes sick they get the symptoms all exactly at the same time and after a while they're suddenly instantly healed. Of course, when you nitpick enough, every series has little mistakes, plot holes, etc. But in this series, they're in your face. It's really hard to look past them and just enjoy for all but the least critical viewer. (spoiler part) Everyone miraculously survives even the most dire situations. A group finds a guy who was captured from an expedition party miles and miles from camp. Apparently the jungle is then filled with blood to provide a trail to him. And when he is found, he's hung up on a tree for bait... only there's no one there to actually attack the group that came for him. (spoiler end) The characters are strung together from superficial stereotypes. People act totally implausible if a real person was actually in that situation. And the conflicts that rise between people feel like they arose from the writer's heads, not from the personalities and the situations they were put in. It's all so disappointing, because the concept behind the series is so awesome. I tried to tell myself everyone acted so irrational, because it's all teenagers. But then you realize it's also only written for teenagers, and the not very critical ones at that.
10.0~Just WOW! strahinjamiljanovic Sign in Permalink I created this account just to give this show 10/10 ! I never felt a need to do this, but this show is just amazing! My favorite show was "Lost" until I found out about "The 100" and this is way better (for my taste). First of all... I like the fact that I never heard about any actor in this show... This was a minus in my head but episode after episode it's become the perfect thing. This actors are perfect and they give this show a special flavor. I can't say that anyone was bad, they all played like it's their life and that's all that matters. About story... If you love to watch sci-fi movie/show, you will just not care about details... That's the point, leave your imagination to do the rest and be a "p". I hope that this show will never end, because the show must go on!
4.0~Would be fun and guilty pleasure if it wasn't annoyingly ridiculous biba_yu Sign in Permalink First to say, I did not like episode 1, but I decided to give it a chance. I am a great fan of sf, horrors, drama, fantasy and every fictional genre you can imagine, but this pilot had so so many plot holes and so many ridiculous things it was horribly annoying and it was impossible to suspend belief. I mean, I can see logic everywhere even in The Walking dead or AHS, or anywhere and I can enjoy it without trying so hard, but this is just too much. I was angry the whole episode. But for some characters I liked (Lincoln, Raven, Kane, Murphy, Thelonius, Clarke...) I decided to give it a chance. I even managed to get hooked. Some characters were worth watching for me, but it seems writers decided those are the characters to kill or put aside, the others are mostly just plain horrible horrible humans that just annoy the hell out of me. I mean if writers think that is normal human behaviour they need therapy. Majority of characters kills without remorse, without reason in a blink of an eye. They seem to be a bunch of deranged serial killers and consider it "normal". Even in seriously bloody Walking Dead, no one but proven psychotic killer kills live humans without blink and without remorse. heck even they feel remorse sometimes. Here, there is none of it. They just kill, kill, kill. Sometimes, just because. No one actually does anything smart, constructive, intelligent or with any strategy at all. Kane, Clarke, Abby, Lexa, Maya, are kinda trying something but it always backfires in some horrible way. They never have any really smart long term plans, like bunch of small children in playground. Writers are jumping left and right and change characters character in a whim. They vary from almost normal to psychotic killer and back. And because they are "sky people" they are "more worth" than "Grounders" so for every "sky" scum like few 100s grounders are killed but vice versa, well, we gotta forgive them. The biggest problem is no any strategy ever. Most of things done if not every is really stupid and it insults me every time. Dumping people in space as punishment from ship that is losing air slowly, not keeping safe probably the only living doctor on Earth and even trying to kill her couple of times, putting children in jails, space ship with not enough food or air to last, killing 300 people because well, they did not think this through, bracelets that can be taken off easily and this is interpreted as "death", plans for battle or rescue that are so horribly horribly bad, 3 year old would make better... Just compare it to Walking Dead and their carefully crafted smart strategies and you will see how stupid this is. Lets not get started on Pike. His "plans" are so horribly laughingly bad that I could not even watch it I was so pissed. I could not believe anyone would ever chose this psychopathic clown to be a leader and never ever question his horrible, really sinister and genocidal plans. So, we just landed on Earth like yesterday, "Grounders" lived here for 100 years, made villages, planted fields and make food, never mind there is whole effing Earth here with only handfull of humans, lets kill the one who are here in our 10 mile range just because we want their land, and maybe once they decide to kill us so it's kinda in advance we kill them and take their land. Who does that? Ever? I wanted him do die horrible death especially when he killed Lincoln with no effing reason at all. To prove something? The man is dangerous psycho, and he is not even charming, smart and charismatic like for instance Negan in TWD. Pike is bland, boring, stupid, completely non charismatic and everyone is blindly following him without single thought even thou guy started to be a "leader" like 2 days ago..Everything he does is just horrible and not even masked with any real reason, or witty charm or even has a shred of intelligence. He kills and jails everyone on his way like they have no family and friends who would care or get mad. After episode when he kills Lincoln I just gave it up. And the Mountain! Again bunch of psychopat killers with no trace of remorse, humanity or any intelligence, who actually die (melt!) within minutes when on outside air, kidnap bunch of kids from space drill them with mechanic drills no anestetics, not even trying to sterilise anything, in some deranged idea that it will cure them from their fragile nature. Who does that? Who does any of that? This series are mess. No real character depth or any development, no story, no smart strategic ideas and plans, no basic education on medicine, engineering or sf at all, lots of violence but with no real reason at all, just for sake of violence. it looks pretty, actors are attractive, some of them talented, it could be guilty pleasure but it is just too annoying. If I want deranged psychopat killer he should at least have some real personality and some charisma, not those laughable creatures we have here who are just annoying because they remind me of some real life politicians who are kinda same (but at least pretend they are not). Gave it 4 for some few decent characters. The rest is disaster.
5.0~They could have done so much more with this premise and just screwed it up jaefeathered Sign in Permalink I honestly feel like I gave this show a legitimate chance. People said that it starts to get a lot better about halfway through the first season and really gets good later on. I made it all the way through the first season and was thoroughly unimpressed. The only reason I kept watching was because I literally had no other shows to watch and it was marginally better than what was currently on TV. I love dystopian/post-apocalyptic movies, TV shows, and books, but this was one of the worse ones I've seen. The acting is mediocre at best, the dialogue is cliché and predictable, and I couldn't find a single likable character (only tolerable ones). I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for a lot of things, but when it's blatantly obvious that the original author and screenwriters know nothing about science or survival, it's tough to enjoy. I really wish they had gone into some of the repercussions of the morality issues the characters were facing, but they were just glossed over most of the time. If an episode ended on a "cliffhanger," it was hardly mentioned in the next episode. I wanted to see the characters struggle to build a functioning society. Rather than develop internal conflicts, the writers took the easy way out and wrote in external conflicts with the "grounders." It was also barely even noticeable that Earth had dealt with any kind of radiation. Sure, there were some two-headed deer and horses and some glowing butterflies, but that was about the extent of it. There was no noticeable impact to the people who had been living in a world filled with radiation from the beginning either. There was so much they could have done with this show, but it ended up just being a generic teenager show. If you don't care at all about realism and want to watch a bunch of attractive teenagers kill each other, then enjoy.
7.0~Reality is win-win galt007 Sign in Permalink The show raises ethical questions, but unfortunately they are life-boat scenarios of win-lose type. In contrast, real life is win-win. Let's take the example of the Ark, and the premise that to survive they need to save resources and sacrifice people. I would like to challenge this premise. In the 100 years on the Ark, they had plenty of time to develop methods to enrich life. Rather than trying to limit the population, they should have encouraged a bigger population, because there is more chance for a genius to be born and invent something creative. For instance, on the Ark, they could have collected air from the outer edge of the Earth's atmosphere. They could have harvested other elements from the moon. To propel small ships in space, they could have used compressed gas. Maybe some genius would have invented an Ion-drive. All power could have been generated by solar power and a nuclear-power factory (on the Ark). The political system on the Ark should have been capitalism, not a dictatorship. Capitalism would have unlocked the creativity of people, and encouraged improvements and technological innovation. Of course, there should have been still laws and law enforcement, but normal things like having a second child would not be a crime, and small crimes would not be punished by a death penalty. Under capitalism, air would be for sale on the Ark. The source of the air would be an air harvester business. Other businesses would raise and sell food. As a result, people who have air will trade with people who have food. This is the basic principle of capitalism. Eventually, innovation and competition will result in both abundance of air and abundance of food. Similar kind of analysis can be made about the situations on Earth. The Mountain Men could have a business relationship with the grounders. The Grounders would trade blood for some services. Note that a person can lose some small amount blood without harm to his body — his body regenerates his blood. Since Grounder's blood will have a market price, some Mountain innovators would find new ways to improve their condition. Bone marrow could have been collected from naturally dead Grounders. A dying Grounder on his death-bed would be (voluntarily) moved to Mountain hospital where he would spend his last days, and the moment he dies, his bone marrow would be collected. Eventually, however, some innovator would invent an easy and permanent solution to fix the blood once and for all. Now, let us talk about land ownership. If the Arker's landed inside an existing country, they automatically become residents of this country, and must abide by its laws. If a country's laws allow for private property, the Arker's could have lived in their civilized community and traded knowledge with other citizen Grounders, thereby teaching them about technology and raising their standard of living. However, if a country does not allow private property and basic human rights, the country has no moral right to exist politically — and for this cause it would be all right to put up a fight. However, there is no indication that this is the case. Although the Grounder culture was medieval, there is no indication that there was an antagonism towards private property. Finally, an uncultivated raw nature land can not be owned by any country. Land is owned only by actual people, and by those who work the land. For instance, in our present society, you can not declare that you own a piece of land on the Moon or in Antarctica. So the Arkers could have picked a spot that is uncultivated (as it appears, it is the spot where they landed) and declared their own country. (By the same logic, they can not move an existing village on that land. The village must move voluntarily by selling its land to the Arkers.)
9.0~Well done! ze-paulo-201-565920 Sign in Permalink Well, what can I say? At first, I thought this would be another teen drama series. But, as time was passing by, this show became more and more adult, dense, complex. Some characters come and go, but you have a body of resident characters that gets development as the series unfold. Of course, you have to make some suspension of belief at some aspects. For instance, all the women are beautiful, wearing sophisticated makeup, there's always weapons, ammo and fuel at disposal, and many other things that would never worked if this was a true world. But, that is what entertainment is all about: fantasy, dreamlike worlds, exotic places, unexpected heroes. And a show that stars Alycia Debnam-Carey is always worth watching!... ;-)
8.0~80 out of 100 max-62051 Sign in Permalink The 100 is mostly good. The effects are great and the story is well told. The first couple of seasons are riveting; however, as with most shows, The 100 struggles to find new drama in the later series that hasn't been done earlier. Nonetheless, the characters have depth and grow throughout the show. If you're looking for a new show to sink your teeth into, there's enough here to enjoy.
10.0~Best Show on Air lucyangel95 Sign in Permalink This show, while many seem to disregard it on principle, is unquestionably one of the best shows on air, and far and away the best show the CW has this season. While the other CW shows have had disappointing runs this year, with Arrow dropping in ratings and Supernatural struggling to find footing with the storyline their running, The 100 is a consistently exciting and interesting show with excellent writing and character development - for once, it is actually an improvement over the book series, something that tends not to be the case with adaptations. As we near the end of the second season, having had the best episode they have ever produced last week with 'Coup de Grâce', I cannot recommend this show highly enough, and while it's difficult to describe without spoiling anything, all I can say is that it is a truly unique and interesting story that stands out from the repetitive sci-fi and fantasy shows, and it is well deserving of being given a chance that you won't regret.
3.0~Don't waste your time pantzar Sign in Permalink This is the worst apocalyptic serie I've been watching in my entire life.
6.0~MTV generation post apocalypse death fest bighuck-51412 Sign in Permalink I'd like to give it a higher score but the randomness of the events and actions are amazingly stupid. Given the characters are all murdering psychopaths it's hard to pick out who is the right person to cheer for. Much of the show revolves around the mistakes the characters make on a regular basis. After awhile it gets rather old. Additionally all the random deaths of the main characters makes Game of Thrones seem tame in comparison.
10.0~One of my favorite shows kloeex Sign in Permalink This is one of my favorite shows! The first season was a little slow but now I'm addicted and can't wait for the next season.
