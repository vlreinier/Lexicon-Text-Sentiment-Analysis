5.0~Big and Bloated...needed a good editor doctorow Sign in Permalink If this movie had been edited to 2 1/2 hours it would have been a fine film. As it was.. The Return of the King was much too long, full of scenes that were much too long, redundant returns, and long and wistful glances over and over again. If this movie had been a pizza it would have been an extra-large anchovy, with hamburger, onion, garlic, sausage, mangoes, tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries, munster cheese, cheddar cheese, swiss cheese, apple slices, peaches, salmon and extra thick applications of oregano and pepper. In other words... too much and overdone. A great story, but poor execution, and the shame of it is.. there obviously were few if any budget constraints. A classic example of how less can indeed, be more..
10.0~Jackson triumphant in wrestling with Epic. jack_kelly Sign in Permalink The only niggling criticisms I have of this wonderful film are Peter Jackson's choices in the pace of the movie. There are simply so many episodes to include in RotK. Firstly, the director is shackled by the books descriptions of Frodo's journey into Mordor, with all of its necessarily repetitive passages in conveying both his increasing despair and the grim monotony of the landscape. In a sense the moving picture is more of a blunt instrument when dealing with the passage of time. Whereas the Two Towers book could convey easily Treebeard's deliberations and general sluggishness, the filmmaker has to actually depict it, without bringing on boredom in the viewer. (I'm not sure he managed it with the yawn inspiring Treebeard) In RotK, Jackson is also saddled with following the book's touching but long winded denouement. *SPOILERS* Given the sheer volume of events in the third film, the decision to move the whole Shelob episode into RotK now looks flawed. But the real problems with prioritising arrive when Jackson shows his form by focusing far too much on the Aragorn's recruitment of the dead. This whole sequence in the mountain looks more Temple of Doom than Tolkein. It smacks of popcorn horror, Ironically, Jackson then has to rush the Dead Army's battle scene later on. Their assault on Minas Tirith played out like a domestic bleach commercial, with a green torrent flushing out the porcelain walls of the citadel in all of 15 seconds. The acting standard varies a fair bit, but is generally very good. Particularly impressive are McKellan Boyd, and Bloom once again. Hill comes into his own after a slightly whiney TT offering. The American actors just about master the British accent but only manage it by tiptoeing around their lines and thus losing much of their urgency, Sean Astin's engaging performance excepted. Viggo Mortensen just about gets away with it with his sheer cinema presence. He looks like Aragorn even if he doesn't really sound like him. The one dimensional Elijah Wood is simply bound by the material Tolkein gives him to work with. I also have no idea why Jackson' risked dragging the breathtaking Pelennor fields battle scenes into farce by inventing the ludicrous looking Orc Leader. His facial features stray into pantomime territory and the sniggers in the audience where all too obvious whenever he appeared on screen. He appeared at odds completely with the look and feel of the whole trilogy. Jackson's also seemed influenced by the popular reaction to Legolas' wonderfully subtle and brief horse manoeuvre in Two Towers. The CG creaks away a la Spider-man in his Mumakil scene here in RotK. Otherwise the CG stuff is all superb, particularly in long shot. The realization of Minas Tirith, which presumably relies on both miniatures and CG is absolutely fabulous and deserves awards and an extended edition documentary all of its own. It's probably the best artificial creation of a city so far in cinema history. It certainly puts three hut Edoras to shame. Otherwise, Jackson's preoccupation with those 1970's calendar drawings of Howe and Lee etc can be a little hit or miss. It sometimes gives the photography a slightly progressive rock band album cover feel. Although, Minas Morgul switched genres and looked uncannily like a Cure Concert set. Although they redeem themselves completely for the wonderful Minas Tirith, Barad Dur and the Black Gate set amongst others. Overall, 9/10. The gripes are just drowned out by the sheer awe and delight of the whole piece. Films like this come along very very rarely. I doubt whether anyone will need to attempt a live action LotR again, ever.
10.0~The best movie gasel Sign in Permalink One of the best films I recommend to everyone.It takes place in impressive locations. The characters are fantastic.
7.0~nice one sarakoki Sign in Permalink One of my best movies.. i like it .. the story is strong and the actors are good
10.0~The film that made me a Rings Maniac! brownish_33 Sign in Permalink before i saw ROTK in theaters, i had no idea what the big deal was. i remembering seeing the first 2 on VHS years ealier and enjoyed them, but never really GOT into it. however, that all changed when i went with my mom to see ROTK in theaters one day......and i was changed. i cried! i laughed! i felt moments of terror, i FREAKED when frodo fell off the cliff with gollum....only he didn't fall in! it gripped me like no other movie has since! and it instantly made me a fan. now i am a rings maniac, all due to this film. i will admit, fellowship has since become my favorite, but i will never forget the experience of ROTK. the battle scenes were gorgeus and epic, and it was just so GREAT! i waitied for an entire YEAR for the extended version on DVD with baited breath! i read all 3 books that summer (and they were actually like the films were! talk about faithfulness)! the ending made me and my mom cry buckets! stunning, absolutely stunning.
5.0~not great movies. karlo-1 Sign in Permalink It's hard to understand all the fuss about The Lord of the Rings. Best movies of all time? I thought it was embarrassing that they were even nominated for Best Picture, let alone winning one. I found them boring and repetitive. The only thing I can figure is there's a hardcore group of obsessed Tolkien fans -- a la Trekkies -- who loved the books and the film interpretations, but really aren't very interested or well-versed in cinema. Take a look at the Top 250 films and ask yourselves where these movies really belong. It will be interesting to see how their rankings hold up over the years. My guess is that they'll fall farther and farther, while the truly great movies that have stood the test of time will remain.
10.0~Simply awe-inspiring! Amanhithiel Sign in Permalink This movie was absolutely amazing. I am speechless! It had so many beautiful moments; the three that stand out in my mind are the lighting of the beacon fires, the charge of the Rohirrim, and the Grey Havens. The acting jobs that wowed my are, in this order, Sean Astin and Billy Boyd (I didn't know Billy could sing!!!). They gave wonderful performances, and Sean should most definitely win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar! Return of the King left me speechless. Okay, I am never speechless, but it is just a figure of, well, speech. Its beauty and magnitude were, as my summary says, awe-inspiring. I cried at least 5 times, and I left in tears, only after the beautiful ending credits song "Into the West" by Annie Lennox was over. Simply put, this is truly the best movie I have ever seen, and the battles, emotion, and plot, in my mind, may never be topped. I give 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' a solid ten out of ten, (10/10) and would give it a higher rating if at all possible. You should definitely see this movie, you are sure to love it!
7.0~A 6/10, missing alot even as a film Servo-11 Sign in Permalink This movie could really use an EE -- BADLY. Characters are just picked up and discarded (Eomer, in particular), Eowyn's battle with the Witch King will, with luck, be expanded. It was over before I knew it and the editing was shabby. Too many oliphaunts and CGI, atrocious battle tactics on the part of the Rohirrim (sure, charge into a head of 10 story beasts even though we have bows and arrows and can shoot from a distance - sounds good!), meaningless inventions (Arwen's life tied to Ring, the Arwen "to leave or not to leave" flip flop, the Lembas Conspiracy, and that stupid Legolas-Oliphaunt trick), a limp confrontation scene with the king of the dead, no resolution to Saruman (the main bad guy of the first two films, if you've forgotten), and the worst hatchet job on an established fictional character (Denethor, Denethor, Denethor). Horrible, horrible. Plus a cheesy bed-jumping scene and coronation where the cheddar flowed in abundance. It was a mess that I hope the EE will mend somewhat, but there's a lot to fix. A LOT. A disappointing end to a trilogy that began with a masterpiece in FOTR. On the plus side, David Wenham, Billy Boyd and Sean Astin. They were brilliant and made it worth spending the money to see it once. Their performances were true and heartfelt, though Faramir sadly dropped out of the picture because PJ unwisely cut the Houses of Healing sequence. It's not worth the hype and I didn't think this once in a lifetime film event would end so sadly.
10.0~A breath taker!!! Yeager81 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has managed to make the audience feeling like in another time. From the first scene till the last one, you are in the world of middle earth. I couldn´t imagine the Characters to be played by others than Elijah and Co. This movie is a real breath taker.
10.0~OMG The BEST film I have ever seen! jbroyhill Sign in Permalink This movie is by far the greatest movie I have ever seen. THe music was outstanding. Not the normal music with films that have on theme song that they play over and over, but each character had his own theme song etc. Sounded more like something from Mosart or Batoven. The special effects are the best you will see. They even go past special effect kings like Star Wars. What I really like is the blend with CG and models. For example most buildings are models. Also they only use CG for stuff in the background and creatures which gives everything a 'real' feeling. Return of the King is a huge jump as far as CG from the other Rings films. I don't know why b/c they were all made at the same time. But it is. The Acting is 100% Shakespeare. They even have actors sing which you don't see in modern films. The film also has some of the largest and action pack battles you will ever see. Best Rings film, Best Film, Go see, Trust me. 10/10
7.0~Can't say I liked it preppy-3 Sign in Permalink First of, I LOVED the first two movies. Well-written, beautifully directed with eye-popping special effects and never boring (despite their length). Well...it doesn't hold true for this one. Yes--the direction is good, the special effects still fantastic...but I was bored. It had an air of "been there--seen that" about it. I've seen these special effects, I've seen these creatures...there were no surprises. And the story moves VERY slowly...much slower than the first two. Frodo, Sam and Gollum's trip to Mount Doom took FOREVER! Also Viggo Mortensen (after giving a good performance in the second one) really was lousy this time around. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies were good but hardly in it. The best acting was from Ian McKellan (a tower of strength as Gandalf) and Sean Astin as Sam. Also it was good to see Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett back again...and I DID enjoy the battles somewhat...but I was continuously looking at my watch. And the film has at least FIVE endings! Also the tone of this film was darker than the first two and this film is WAY too violent for a PG-13--this is an R rating all the way. I can only give this a 7. I just really didn't like it.
10.0~well,what can i say? hatshepsut_23 Sign in Permalink This,my fellows, is nothing but a clean masterpiece.Peter Jackson has done it again and this movie,the last,was awesome!Why?Battle on Pelennors field for one thing,Pippins song is another,Frodos inside battle...and Samwise Gamgi.
10.0~Excellent!!! Must see!!! Great acting all around!!!! kreder Sign in Permalink I would have to say this was my favorite of the three!!! Action and of course romance - perfect combination to keep your eyes glued to the movie screen!!! :-) It saddens me that it is finally over though. I am sure we will see great things from a lot of these actors/actresses who were in the movie! Especially, Orlando Bloom..whose role in Lord of the Rings no doubt has brought out just the start of what this man has yet to show us in the "movie" world. I will be keeping a sharp eye out for him in upcoming roles. :-) Anyone who has the opportunity to go out and see this movie should.
10.0~Beautiful (and a note on the ending) Jamey - http://Welcome.to/MovieViews Sign in Permalink A staggering film, Return of the King completes the Lord of the Rings trilogy with true confidence. For sentimental reasons, it could be my favorite of the three films. Not that it doesn't have what is possibly the most spectacular battle sequence ever put to film (it does), and the tech credits don't set new standards (they do). What I love about these films is that Peter Jackson has conjured a world beyond our imagination, and then made it REAL in a way we could not have imagined. AND REGARDING THE ENDING: be forewarned that there is a lengthy denoument after the climax at Mount Doom. After three hours already, some will be restless. But keep in mind that this is the ending of a giant 10-hour film. It's long, but necessary. People who just want to get the heck up and leave probably haven't invested as much in these characters as I have, and many others have. It's extremely poignant, and beautifully done.
10.0~The best movie i have ever seen andreaszakos Sign in Permalink No other movie can compare with this one. It has everything. You can feel every character and you stand next to him even when all ends, even when the fellowship takes different ways, you still know what will happen to each character and how they 're going to spend their lives. It's an action film but it has very special meanings to give to the audience. For instance that many people are doing something for one common purpose.It's an action movie with emotion. The visual effects are perfect and the direction of Peter Jackson as well. The acting is great and when you put all these in a movie you have the best. I have seen it more than ten times and i will keep seeing it after ten years. For me that's the best movie.
10.0~"Masterpiece" is an understatement. abyboom-1 Sign in Permalink ******* Might contain spoilers******** When the "Fellowship" came out 3 years before, I was not at all hopeful for it's quality. I had seen many a movies inspired from famous books, and frankly barring the "Godfather", I had been disappointed in each one of them. Especially, since around that time, the first "Harry Potter" was realised, which made a mess of such a brilliant story, though it was a simple one. Tolkein's LOTR was of course, much more complex a story than many I had read. The core subject matter maybe simple enough, but the descriptions of "Middle Earth" , characters, incidences, battles and everything encompassed, makes the book a very complex, but hugely effective one. So, I had very little/no hope for Peter Jackson's "Fellowship". However, after watching "Fellowship", I just realised how wrong I was in my assumptions. The movie not only stays true to the storyline most of the times ( a thing not found in many films adapted from novels!), but it also effectively made me feel what Middle Earth looked like with ease. When I re-read "Fellowship" again after watching LOTR1, I realised what Peter jackson has actually achieved is something near perfection. The story starts from the defeat of Dark Lord Sauran, who with the help of one powerful ring wanted to rule the whole of Middle Earth. The ring then gets lost from the face of the earth, to be retrieved much later by Smeagol. Smeagol's life is totally destroyed by the power the ring exhibits on him, and the only thing that makes him go, is the desire for the ring, which he both loves and hates. However, after a series of incidences the ring finds itself in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo. Frodo decides to destroy the ring, since Lord Sauran whose spirit had survived, was organising an evil amry to regain the ring again. LOTR (in 3 parts), describes this journey of Frodo and his friend Sam. During the journey, they are assisted by numerous friends who want the ring to be destroyed for the good of Middle Earth,and foes, who are trying to kill them to get the ring. The journey encompasses courage, cowardness, betreyal, freindship and redemption. Getting the story in a movie was one huge task, and Peter jackson succeeds with flying colours. The fellowship deals with the group destined to destroy the ring and it's ultimate sepration in the face of it's foe. The next two films namely the "towers" and "return" deals with two separate journeys. One being made by Frodo and Sam, for destruction of the ring, while the other traces the rest of the group fighting battles with the dark lord and it's allies. Some liberties have been taken in the film to make it a bit different from the book, but they are worth doing so. The one liberty that stands out is Gollum's sciznophenic nature. It's a pity that the academy didn't recognise Andy Serkis's achivement, treating it completly as a CGI, but people will know better. Also, it's a pity that the first two parts of the trilogy didn't get the recogniton that they deserved from the academy, for frankly, no other movie came as close as the LOTR's for the last 3 years in terms of perfection in every department. However, the greatest achievemnt of the LOTR films barring thier superb special effects, epic battle scences and scenery comes from the fact that every character was developed so that the audience can relate to them. And there were quite a few of them. In the "return" when everything was in place, Aragon says to the Hobbits : "My freinds, You bow to no one". And then everybody in the assembly bows in front of these unlikely heros of Middle earth. Well, all I can say is that Peter Jackson deserves a Bow from all the movie lovers, young or old, for making something more than a masterpiece.
3.0~A Self Important Yawn-Fest monkey-84 Sign in Permalink There is no reason why this film needed to be three and a half hours long. You could trim the last hour of the film that is just a never-ending farewell that could have been completed in about 15 minutes. There are also plenty of dramatic pauses and sluggish scenes that should be on the editing room floor. Even the battle scenes are redundant. Didn't we basically see the assault on Gondor in the second installment? How many times do we need to see an overwhelming numbers of Orcs being inexplicably defeated by a depleted band of humans? Everyone who thinks that this is great epic film making needs to go back and take another look at films like Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, Spartacus or even Gone with the Wind. These films use their long formats to build characters and emotion whereas The Return of the King just piles on the battles and speeches and teary-eyed goodbyes to no overall effect (plus some were kind enough to include an intermission). It's as if Jackson believed that a film has too be bloated and long in order to be important. This is an epic waste of time.
8.0~Lord of Many Endings independantyam Sign in Permalink Don't get me wrong, these movies are very well made. It's amazing that these books were actually made into films in the first place. It takes a lot of vision to accomplish that. However, as a film or even a trilogy, there are several fallbacks. Firstly, there is a lot of unneeded dialogue. Secondly, after the audience waits for the climax and then the rundown at the end of the film, the movie doesn't end. It feels it needs to tie up loose ends that most audience members won't see, such as what happens to Bilbo. All in all, the vision deserved the Academy Award, although as always, there is room for improvement.
10.0~The Great Movie of All time MoviesCraze_87 Sign in Permalink The Best movie in trilogy. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Miranda Otto, Billy Boyd and above all the one and only Andy Serkis who creates Magic on the screen by playing Gollum/Smeagol, obviously with the Help of Effects Director. The direction was Excellent. The Music is Truly Masterpiece. Oscar winning movie doesn't ends over here because Extended Edition follows with great scenes of Gollum and Saruman(Christopher Lee) and Grima Wormtongue(Brad Douriff). Peter Jackson had done a VERY HARD WORK. Over all, MOVIE IS A GREAT MASTERPIECE AND EVERYONE SHOULD ENJOY THIS Oscar WINNING MOVIE ON EXTENDED EDITION. 10/10
10.0~a true masterpiece, will be a classic for decades topdogal Sign in Permalink Long ago (in a galaxy far, far away) there was a trilogy that was untouched and unsurpassed. It was the defining point of that decade and was rated by some people as the best films ever. If you haven't guessed what I'm going on about already I am talking about Star Wars. Now The Lord of the Rings takes Star Wars and flushes it down the toilet. It literally wipes the floor with its Ewoks and Jedi knights. Some people may be put off by the fact that it's a film about goblins, elves etc but this is far from a quaint fairy tale. The Return of the King is the concluding part of Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings trilogy and unlike The Matrix Revolutions it has all the acting, script, music, and brilliant scale of the first two films. Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the one ring with the help of Golum. Unknown to Frodo though (Sam is very suspicious of Golum), Golum wants the ring all to himself and is secretly leading them to "her". After destroying Isengard, the Ents, the two other Hobbits, Aragorn, Gimly, Legolas and Gandalf must do what it takes to ensure Middle-Earth does not succumb to the forces of Mordor and Sauron. Everything about this film shouts perfection, from the perfect camera work to the undoubtedly perfect directing by Peter Jackson. Everything in this film is done to perfection. As the Rohan riders are galloping down to meet the army of Mordor the backdrop is sensational and is something only this crew could conjure up. The music in itself is an achievement; each orchestrated piece of work is so effective that it not only adds to the drama of the film but it creates emotion that far surpass any film I have ever seen. At the end of this film I was genuinely sad as I had no Lord of the Rings to look forward to next year! Each scene is individual and as riveting as the last which makes for brilliant watching.
8.0~Truly remarkable sight VitalyBe Sign in Permalink I will not go to lengths and mention the good parts of the movie. The movie at the whole is one amazing view that throws you from one breathtaking picture to another. I'll just mentioned what I lacked: * Saruman was seriously lacking as was the part of the Palantir in the war (Aragorn appearing before Sauron in the Palantir). * What the heck did Elrond do in the middle of Rohan and by what cosmic way has Arwen's life became connected with Sauron relative power (WTF?). * The scenes of Frodo being taken to the Goblin tower and the opposite scenes between the victory in the white city and the coming of the forces to Black Gate felt RUSHED. That's was really sad as the ending was surprisingly perfect and even a bit SLOW sometimes (how long does it take two hug 3 hobbits??). But really, that about what really annoyed my in the movie, the rest was perfect or almost perfect. Go and see. 9/10.
10.0~The perfect ending runirokk Sign in Permalink I hardly have the words to describe how satisfied I am with the entire extended versions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Let me say though that after the second improved so VASTLY on the movie version of the Two Towers I was confident that LotR3 would also be vastly improved from an already fantastic final movie - and it was! I forgive Jackson & co. for cutting Saruman and the final Shire-part out of the script as it is a side story basically that does not directly add to the main story, which is Frodo's journey to mount Doom and the fight to save Middle Earth. Admittedly though, it would have been wonderful to see it, if for no other reason than to extend the amount of time you can sit and watch these movies. Personally I wouldn't mind Jackson adding hours to it. Let's all hope he gets off his ass now and films The Hobbit asap (while Ian Mackellen is still alive and kicking at least, and perhaps Ian Holmes could take on the part of the much younger Bilbo? who knows).
9.0~Definitely doesn't suck... kdryan Sign in Permalink Spoilers ahead... Wow! This is by far the greatest of the three films and anyone expecting to be disappointed going in should have a hard time coming out with their expectations met. By some strange coincidence ROTK is the most faithful to the book AND the best of his three Rings films. Almost everything here happens exactly as in the book, with minor exceptions for plot points such as the exact method of Denethor's demise. I was slightly disappointed by Gandalf's out of hand dismissal of Pippin's attempt to swear loyalty to Denethor in honor of Boromir. It always seemed a well done thing and a very emotional point in the book. I will say that while Sean Astin has grated on me from the first, especially with the cheesy speeches, here he redeems himself totally without reserve. Even though I have never liked the way the character was scripted, I can't think of anyone who would be better placed as Sam. I didn't like that Frodo was allowed to be swayed so easily into abandoning Sam by Gollum, but it was well acted even if not 'in the book.' Sean Astin IS Sam, the same way I can't think of anyone else who could have played Frodo. All in all, one really fantastic film!
7.0~Better than two towers ssuominen Sign in Permalink If this is only thought of as a movie i would give 9/10. But again, they left important parts. Battle in the shire is very important part in the book. It changed a lot of whole story.
10.0~It is the one movie I would classify as "BEST" madisonpine Sign in Permalink After "The Fellowship of the Ring", I really wanted to see a sequel that goes with it, but I was afraid that it will turn out stupid. I wasn't disappointed. Same story after "The Two Towers". But this time, I was more than satisfied. For all you out there who haven't seen it, you're missing out on something. I especially liked how the soundtrack goes with the scenes. When Gandalf approaches Minas Tirith, the music makes you think of a king on high. When the army marches out of Minas Morgul, the music makes you shiver. No other soundtrack gave me such an affect. I personally think it was unfair in the Battle of the Pelenor Fields that the enemy had airborne creatures, while the goodies were only on horseback, but the eagles were a good idea. Most interestingly, the end ties back to the beginning; Frodo had the Ring bitten off, while Sauron had his Ring cut off. I'm really looking forward to the next movie in the series, if it's coming at all. 10/10
10.0~Astonishing jimspencer Sign in Permalink I have seen many films in my lifetime & this has to be one of the most impressive of all. In terms of a series, no other series can even come close in terms of storyline, fluidity from the first to the last as well as genius in completing the story. As to Steve from Alberta, I would politely disagree as to the role of Arwen in the final installment. She completes a most important love story & gives additional meaning to the life of Aragorn. Every great leader should have his love at his side.After all, she was part of his inspiration in the journey to press on. The kiss at their reunion, after his crowning, was electric. The genius of Peter Jackson gave us closure to all major aspects of this epic. I rate this one as a definite A+
10.0~Another masterpiece from Peter Jackson Roland-charleer Sign in Permalink In my opinion, this one was the best of the trilogy. The battle sequences were beautiful, the special effects were beautiful, the acting was great,... The movie starts with Sméagol killing his own brother, Déagol, who found The Ring in a pond. Sméagol is desperate to get that Ring, and he strangles his brother. And then the story begins. From beginning to end, this movie stays exciting and beautiful. To me, the battle sequence in Minas Tirith is one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed. Peter Jackson proves again that he is a great director, and the cast prove they are great actors. The Nazgul are really scary, every scene is filmed superbly, in short, this movie is dazzling! 10/10
10.0~I have seen it three times in theatres already, can't get enough! MadameGia Sign in Permalink I've seen Return of the King, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I was also blessed with the soundtrack. Howard Shore is amazing. His music for Return of the King cannot be topped. Period. How was acting? All I can say, Sean Astin, Bernard Hill, even John Noble deserves best supporting nomination. As for best Actor, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen. The beauty of this movie is its love for one another. The love was shown at the end of this movie. You won't get any spoliers from me! The sadness portrayed from the gifted actors and actresses on the screen went straight into my heart. I imagine I will cry once again seeing the movie for the 4th time. -Gia
9.0~Masterpiece sidparti Sign in Permalink To say that this is one of the best movies of all time would be an understatement. Very few movies have been able to capture a dream like concept and been able to captivate audiences over three movies and left them begging for more. Everything from the script to sets to costumes etc. have seamless integration and nothing seems misplaced or extra. However for me personally the most fascinating part of the movie is the intricate portrayal of human character and emotions. Peter Jackson did an excellent job in capturing the essence of basic human nature. It was quiet heartening to see how the characters went through phases of self-doubt to realization that all they can do is to give everything their best and fight for what they believe in even if it means giving up their lives for the cause. The movie had scores of inspirational dialogues but the one that captured the soul of the entire movie was when Frodo was suffering from self-doubts and Gandalf helps him understand the situation. Frodo: "I wish none of this had happened." Gandalf: "So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us." How apt and true for each and every one of us. The beauty of the movie is also in the fact that the more number of times you watch it the more you learn from it, sometimes leaving you stunned with a new idea and sometimes making you jump from your chair with the desire of somehow being part of a characters journey in the movie. Most importantly the message I have taken from the movie is that it doesn't matter who or what you are and that everyone has a role and part to play in this big jigsaw that we call "Life".
2.0~From part 1 to 3, completely devoid of soul, explanation and rationale deenosaar Sign in Permalink Firstly, let me get it clear that I have never read Tolkien's books nor do I intend to. As such I don't know how the real story was and what was cut out? The following comments refer only to the movie, as a piece of cinema. There is way too much presumption. The story starts off about a ring that is oh very powerful, controls everybody, is evil blah blah. All that is fine. OK, the ring is so very evil and powerful. But would'nt any rational person ask what makes the ring so powerful? The reasons are never provided. What makes it so valuable and important that people are going to wars over it, people are mutating over it and why does the villain want it? What is its secret? It would'nt be unfair to assume that the Return of the King answers all these questions. It absolutely does not. There is simply no story in this movie. It fails to explain what happened or even whats going on. As with the ring, why should one also has to presume that Sauron is so evil that hes worth fighting with all the armies of middle earth? With so much story surrounding Sauron, his appearance is restricted to nothing more than a large fiery eye. Just why is he so evil. Just why is he so feared? What did he do that was so bad? None of that is ever answered in any of the LOTR movies. Devoid of a story, the whole series are nothing more than a tour through middle earth when your, or anyone else's specific presence do not really matter. It looks more like a big documentary rather than a movie. The first two parts may have been slightly entertaining but streaching the same formula for yet another movie delivers an abysmally boring experience. The inhabitants of middle earth may have also been something original when Tolkien wrote them, but it is not so today.
10.0~My Favorite Movie AlexShelenko Sign in Permalink This is my favorite movie so far, and it seems like it's gonna remain so forever!
9.0~Not perfect, but what movie really is? (Spoilers) je4ry2002 Sign in Permalink To begin with, I think probably the only movies I could give a 10 to would be Lawrence of Arabia and possibly Raiders of the Lost Ark. Having said this, I would give ROTK a 9.5 if that was an option. Spoilers - I thought the "multiple endings" were too drawn out. For example, the viewers in the movie theatre, actually started laughing by the third fade out. So, unfortunately, I think it didn't hit the mark. I have to say it was a little too much. Nonetheless... It would be extremely difficult to cut out any one of those "endings" since the characters are so intertwined. I think Jackson made a very risky move by doing this and commend him for that. Not a typical Hollywood ending. For me, I liked the endings, with the exception of "jumping on the bed" scene, a little too childish, considering all the death and destruction that all endured. Maybe that could have been deleted. However, it does create a sense of relief after all they'd been through. I think the Shire bar scene was very good, the silent acknowledgement between the characters in their new life in the old homestead was powerful and bitter sweet. Even though the crowning scene was much more grand, I think the bar scene much more powerful and rightly so. The boat scene was not as effective. In short there were too many "goodbyes". I think the temptation of Aragon by Sauron near the end would have been better if we knew what Sauron was "saying" to him, perhaps a visual in Aragon's mind relayed to us would have made his statement "For Frodo" more powerful. Anyway, this is my first review here, take it for what it's worth.
10.0~The way all film sequels/trilogies should be made! jamesroyalty05 Sign in Permalink All film sequels/trilogies should be made like The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was made, aka at the same time. I think that if a movie is destined to have a sequel, like LOTR since it was based on an already existing trilogy, it should be made at the same time as the original. The reason for my opinion on this is because I believe that having the original cast in a sequel, is a really important factor in a successful sequel. I mean even in animation, if u don't have the same voices as the original, then it isn't the same, and the movie practically fails just because that. I mean who wants to go see a movie that is a sequel to a popular movie with a cast who doesn't know how to act like the audience likes them to act, aka like in the original. All in all people don't want to see different actors/actresses replacing their favorite characters good or bad as they may be.
6.0~Like eating chinese food, tastes great but leaves you hungry for more BeagleHound24 Sign in Permalink For someone that hasnt read the books, but loves the fantasy genre (can't wait for a Dragonlance adaptation) I am one of the few that geniunely didnt enjoy this film and trilogy. All 3 movies were well over 3 hours long and unfortunately for me... they felt like an eternity, and my distaste for these movies can be judged by the many bathroom breaks I was willing to take. Dont get me wrong, their were some great amazing sights and visuals and everyone that worked on this needs to get a pat on the back for getting this out 1 christmas after the next (Curse you Lucas) This film sorely missed Christopher Lee as a villan and made for a relatively boring and unwatchable first hour. Finally when the story picks up, it does so with a vengenace rarely seen. The massive battle scene was one for the ages comparable to Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. However what I felt lacking in this movie is what should have pulled it all together. Where was Aragon, Legolas and Gimli? while each had their hacks, none had any personal battles of note and yes, call me old fashioned but that lack of Villan here really... really... left me starving for something more. Gimli was left to shooting off tired jokes and Legolas... where was Legolas the entire film? It almost felt like he received the Christopher Lee treatment. Hardly any lines and his action scenes felt so scripted. Aragon provided his usual solid, unspectacular performance, when it really should have been him carrying this film. Gandalf... he was a wizard right? I spent the entire film wondering where all of his magic went. Frodo's quest like the rest of the movie started on life support, having the makings of following Two Towers and listening to Gollum, spout incoherable babble and Sam with his overprotective garble (I really miss the Ring Wraiths). However there is finally a twist, and the spider scene is so exceptionally well done and finally we got to see an end to the ring. Everyone survives and lives out their lives... happily ever after. Despite its many well done scenes, Peter Jackson has failed to glue it all together. Much like Lucas recently, he finds himself with so much material and lacking the courage to adapt the storyline to something watchable, as opposed to the books story. For an avid movie goer this definately makes the top 5 in trilogy history, but will not even approach the Starwars or Godfather's perfection. 7.5/10 like good chinese food, this film tastes good but will leave you hungry for more.
10.0~The Best epic movie ever miguelangel-23 Sign in Permalink This movie (I'm talking about the three installments) is extraordinary, the best epic movie ever. It's true, JR Tolkien imagination is fantastic, a master piece, but just consider how many masterpieces books have been turned in a despicable pile of trash when a director or a cast or the studio didn't know what they were doing, I bet this same story could have been a terrible disappointment with another director,or another cast. Everything in this movie went perfect. And yes people read a lot Tolkien now, but is because of this movie, 85 to 90 % of the people who said yes, this movie is good but tolkien is a genius, never picked up a tolkien book before this movie. Well the books are great but this whole cinema masterpiece is just as good as tolkien's work, in my opinion, this movie deserves a 9.9 out of 10 and that is just because I don't believe any movie deserves a 10 out of 10. Congratulations to peter jackson and all the cast, one more thing, how can movies like "a beautiful mind" and "chicago" win the oscar in 2001 and 2002 and not this great movie. I think maybe they had to wait to the last installment to give the oscar to it, otherwise they had to give the oscar to this movie three times in a row, one for every part, and that would have been unfair (the first movie winner of the oscar three times). This is not only the best production in moviemaking in a while, I'm sure it will remain in that status for various decades.
10.0~Great movie gailm10 Sign in Permalink This movie was great. It has stars like Orlando Bloom and Ian McKellen. Frodo's final journey had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. It has some great battles and action. This movie is my favorite movie ever. I would recommend buying it. It is the third of the trilogy and the best. Based on the popular novels by J.R.R. Tolkein. I give it 10 stars. It is rated PG-13. GO SEE IT! You will probably like it. The acting is great. The costumes and make-up is great. The landscaping is great. The directing is great. Everything about this movie is great! GO SEE IT RIGHT NOW. You'll be sorry if you don't. You cannot miss it. I think it was the greatest movie ever made by mankind.
10.0~Engaging & Well Written mpo0855 Sign in Permalink This installment of one of film histories greatest series is truly an engaging & deeply felt epic. More character driven than the previous two films in the series this film delivers a sparking end to a GREAT TRILOGY!!!
10.0~Perfect! Lollilockan Sign in Permalink The only thing that are negative is that the film should be longer then it is! This is a film I will see over and over again! Thank You Peter Jackson! My question now are. Was this the end? Or will it come more? Will it be a The Hobbit? That´s for the futune to tell us...
10.0~Excellent (?) SilverArrow379 Sign in Permalink Well, as far as I'm concerned this was the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. It was a lot more violent than the last two, there was a lot more emotion between sam and frodo, and the overall scope was much different from the last two films. I think I may even have liked the music BETTER! (which is hard to get since I'm such a hard-core TTT and FOTR music fan) Anywho, a few people have disagreed with me on where it ranks in the "best movie list" but all have said it ranks in their top 5, and I think that's saying alot! = D
10.0~Epically stunning: BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR earthling05 Sign in Permalink Rating: 5/5 (Caution: Before reading this review, make sure you have already seen the movie, because it contains lots of SPOILERS.) After Legolas, the slick, arrow-slinging elf, single-handedly takes out a war elephant and its armed drivers, Gimli, the stubby and ill-tempered dwarf, enviously growls, `Bah! That still only counts as one!' A great counterpart of what makes The Lord of the Rings film trilogy exceptional is the abundance of heart and overwhelming storytelling its sets. Using the war elephant stint as a prime example, director Peter Jackson has only proven to be one of the few to transplant the era of a fictional world and make it so tangible. In J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy of Middle-earth, the creator managed to uplift the confidence of several major characters. For instance Aragorn, who begins as the obscure Lone Rider, takes a stand as a prominent leader in the fight to throw off Sauron's forces. Sam, Frodo's dedicated servant, at last takes the ring's concerns in `his own hands,' rendering some promising decisions that make up for Frodo's inability to contend with Sauron's threat. Even the two childish Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, shine as assertive and heroic supporters. Along with Gandalf, these characters surprisingly rise above the lack of significance to defend the evils of the world. Secondly, the visual effects are thoroughly integrated into the plot and the various sub-plots that are held within the texture. The gargantuan war elephants, super-sized eagles, and Shelob, the enormous cave spider, are accurately depicted in movement, sound, and effect on its environment. The revival of the elf country, Rivendell, resembles the art of Thomas Kinkade in motion, while the heights of the newly-introduced Minas Tirith is a climb in cinema vision. Not to mention the return of Smeagol, this time with wickedness in his pupils, and a clever reference to his unreal transformation into the gangly Gollum. The typical villain would not meet the protagonist until the finale, but in this epic tale, Smeagol has deceptively been traveling at Frodo's side. The music only enforces the enrichment of this far-off place. Tunes of both returning and newly-created unite to insist the reality of what this world of feelings holds. Revisiting Rivendell reprised the full-scale melody of the brass and strings, while Minas Tirith belonged to a tune of courage and hope. What makes The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King perhaps the greatest conclusion to an epic is its end to all sub-plots, a mistake that The Matrix: Revolutions did not fulfill. Aragorn and Arwen? The survival of the Elves? Bilbo's return? Competition between elf and dwarf? Every character (excluding Saruman) is handed with a certain fate, whether death or survival, success or loss, marriage or another `adventure.' Under the conclusion to the ring, there is reunion, love, duty, and lots of sadness.
10.0~the reason we all go to movies darthskier Sign in Permalink i cant even put into words how much i loved this movie. This is the reason i go to movies. This film made me run the whole gamut of emotions. I laughed, i cried, i was scared, i felt everything. This was one of my best film experiences ever. You must see this movie. I really hope this gets the awards it deserves. Sean Astin must get best supporting actor, Peter Jackson deserves best director, and both Ian Mckellen and Viggo Mortensen should get nominated for best actor. There are no better words to say then GO SEE THIS MOVIE. I am going to see it as many times as i can, because this is one of the best, if not the best movies of all time
10.0~Absolutely AWESOME!!! virgo3166 Sign in Permalink Never before has a movie exceeded my expectations such as this one has. I have been anxiously awaiting this movie...and my expectations were extremely high. From the opening moments, I was not disappointed in the least! Yes, there are some parts that are different from the book...but I didn't care at all. The movie was amazing, awesome and I am going back in an hour and a half to see it again. 10+++++++ If this movie doesn't win the Oscar this year, I will never have faith in the Academy again.
10.0~well.... condom-gry Sign in Permalink Well...Let's Just say i'm 12 years old...the first time i watched it i was 7 now i still watch it every single day. NoT many words can describe Lord of the Rings some of them maybe Mesmerising Unbeilevable...But for me it was pro bely the most Effecting movie i have ever witnessed. When i watch it i always get goosebumps...ALWAYS never once have i not been star struck by it. Now to all of you Tolkien Haters out there who call LOTR nerdy lets just say F*** YOU!!!! Now honestly i recommend these movies to pretty much everyone. Now I admit that there are too many endings(6 to be precise) but who honestly gives if you spend 5 years of your life loving this movie intensely no matter how many endings it has they will all make you cry.
10.0~Best trilogy there ever will be xMFA Sign in Permalink Best trilogy there ever will be one of the best movies I've ever watched in my life
9.0~Watch the extended versions! tgincurtin Sign in Permalink This is an almost perfect cinematic conversion of the book. What I must stress though is that that the extended version is much better. I have no idea why New Line, by all accounts, insisted on a time limit for the theatrical releases. The extra footage adds context and gives a variation in pace that the movie really needs. Given that the core fan base often complain that the book ends too soon this was a misfire of some significance. But otherwise it is absolutely brilliant. Many people are hoping that New Line and Jackson eventually do a deal to do more of Tolkien's work. It is hard to imagine anyone else coming close to this level of realisation.
10.0~One of the greatest movies of all time NewSc2 Sign in Permalink First off, I'd like to say that this is the best movie out of the trilogy, and throughout the whole movie I was on the edge of my seat, full of emotions that Peter Jackson wanted me to feel. It's truly amazing how well The Return of the King stayed true to the novel, much more so than I had expected. True, they cut out a few important scenes, which will remain nameless in the honor of no spoilers, but I'm sure these scenes will be added on in the Extended Edition (reserve me my Lord of the Rings Trilogy Extended Edition DVD!). Disregarding those minor exclusions, Peter Jackson's genius shone in the last installment. Never once did I feel like the movie was dragging; in fact I wished the movie to continue - it even felt a bit rushed to me. Never did I cringe at the emotional scenes, or question the intense battle scenes. I felt like I was truly watching not only a great movie, but Jackson really made me feel like I was watching an earlier version of the world, which the great J.R.R. Tolkein had conjured. Being fully immersed in a film is a moniker of a wonderful movie, which LotR:RotK is. 10 out of 10, and many thanks to the crew of the Lord of the Rings. You've given me hours of delightful entertainment, well worth my $8 movie ticket.
10.0~Recommend this movie !! John-itc-1 Sign in Permalink I like the fantasy movie and specially like The Lord of the Rings. This movie in appear Legolas !

This movie is an exciting movie I'm recommend this movie :-D
10.0~10/10 [with explanation] frogger612 Sign in Permalink (Caution: May contain spoilers) My Rating: 10/10 And most deservedly. I shall take this opportunity to comment mainly on Return of the King, though also on the LotR trilogy as a whole. Return of the King is a stunning close to the Lord of the Rings trilogy [directed by Peter Jackson]. Having to continue a plot is difficult, but, as with Star Wars Episodes V and VI, it was pulled off brilliantly. The plot exploded with action, adventure, battles, and romance, with touching and poignant moments along the way. Return of the King involves the watcher, and speaks to everyone with a theme that shows the ups and downs of people and life, good and evil. It highlights friendship and love, loyalty and honor, courage and perseverance. It is a message of hope which is well-received. The actors and actresses are well-chosen and play their parts splendidly; in fact, I do not have anything bad to say about any of them! Those that especially pop out to me are John Noble (Denethor), Andy Serkis (Gollum), Sean Astin (Sam), Miranda Otto (Eowyn), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sir Ian McKellan (Gandalf), and David Wenham (Faramir). You notice that I named most of the cast right there... The special effects, unlike in Attack of the Clones and other such movies, do not overwhelm the film; they provide just enough magic to make it believable. Taking a world of miniatures and turning it into Middle Earth complete with cultures, battles, creatures, awesome stunts, and fantastic explosions and the like is a enormous task, but PJ and crew pulled through better than I could have ever imagined, from walking trees to the destruction of Mordor to large fighting beasts. As aforementioned, the movie not only displays epic battle sequences but also emotional moments as well--scenes that make you clap, chuckle, cry, or make you smile because of the simple message and depth of character. I'm not adequately able to describe these moments, but I'll try. The movie grabs you in the beginning, so that you are already involved with the characters and story. Thus, one heart-wrenching death feels like you yourself have lost a loved one. A deed done as a loyal friend warms you, and cold acts of greed and selfishness tend to anger or hurt the viewer. Poignant lines or desperate courage go right to the heart in a way not many movies can. [For example: '...but I can carry you!'; the entire 'end of all things' scene; Faramir's suicide ride.] The score for Return of the King [and for the entire trilogy] adds to the already compelling scenes with mellow tunes for softer moments and uplifting 'charge' music for battles and victories. Into the West [the credits song and last tune in the movie] really closes the trilogy and the theme and is perfect for those last scenes at the Havens. The entire score is classic, fitting so perfectly into Tolkien's world. I have only a few complaints, and those are minor. One--the ending. It was 20 minutes long and almost dragged after the coronation, though, upon further review, it was absolutely necessary. Just maybe a little condensing or something might have helped. Also, well...heh, I can't think of an also...guess that's it! All in all, Return of the King is a wonderful finish to a wonderful trilogy and, in my opinion, will remain recognized as one of the best movies of all time for many years to come. Enjoy. --
10.0~Brilliant! Claymore-3 Sign in Permalink Everything I expected, and more. It was a roller-coaster of emotion - everything from the fear in the tunnels to the feeling of glory in the battles, and the sadness at the end. Easily the best of the three movies!
10.0~Sonic varder1992 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War II. It is the second best-selling novel ever written, with over 150 million copies sold. The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron,who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a Hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across northwest Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck and Peregrin "Pippin" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and traveling companions: the Men Aragorn, a Ranger of the North and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a Wizard. The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two- volume set, the other to be The Silmarillion, but this idea was dismissed by his publisher.For economic reasons The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955, thus creating the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The three volumes were entitled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. Structurally, the novel is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume. Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume. The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages. Tolkien's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Although a major work in itself, the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917, in a process he described as mythic. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, religion and the author's distaste for the effects of industrialization, as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien's experiences in World War I. The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy; the impact of Tolkien's works is such that the use of the words "Tolkienian" and "Tolkienesque" have been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary. The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works,and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. The Lord of the Rings has inspired, and continues to inspire, artwork, music, films and television, video games, and subsequent literature. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theater, and film.
8.0~A Real Adventure. mcjoakimplay Sign in Permalink 8/10 Fantastic adventure. Really great movie and entertaining. Better than the Hobbits honestly.
10.0~Spectacular Finale bluzman Sign in Permalink It is hard to believe that all 3 films are out for all to see. It seem like just yesterday that i watched the first one. This trilogy is going to be a highwater mark by which other multi-movie sets are measure for countless years to come. The filming of all three at the same, while risky, has proven to be genius. The continuity becomes seamless. The momentum never lets up. And regardless of the petty snivelings of purist and self-righteous fault finders, this trio will gather at amidst the top of Top 250 of all time. If I were to find any fault in the making of this final film, I would say that the ending dragged a bit, but with so much to sew up, it was hard not to labor it. As for the absence of Christopher Lee, yes I am disappointed, but not devastated. It will surely turn up in the extended version, which I will enjoy for years to come.
8.0~A Fitting yet Flawed Conclusion allmanjim Sign in Permalink A tremendous and epic conclusion to a wonderful trilogy. However, as I left the theater I couldn't help but feel there was much left untold in the telling of the final chapter. Where I had come to care for the people of Rohan, the Hobbits of the Shire and even the elves, I felt little and knew nothing of Minis Tirith and it's leadership. Tell me more of this crazed steward of Gondor! What happened to Sauraman? What is this inferred ending romance between Eowyn and Faramir? There seemed much to be missing only to be filled in with great battle sequences and long enduring gazes between Frodo and Sam. (I say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but there is a sentimentality in this film that did not exist with the others -- even the music seemed over-the-top at times). I understand the focus on the story of the journey of the Ring and the hobbits but I felt there was so much more going on that I wasn't privy to. I did read the books some 20 years ago . .. perhaps it is time to once again. A grand conclusion and an epic in scope and scale, but my least favorite of the three. I look forward to the extended DVD edition.
10.0~Excellent !! alperenbeyaz Sign in Permalink This film was absolutely amazing. I have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed.I like it.I watched this film since 2009.But it is in the my mind still.The acted and special effects are very good. I think Orlando Bloom is the best actor in the film.Because I love archery. I like "Legolas".He killed two elephants with one arrow.He is very good archer. Saruman's army are very strong.The goods is weaker than Saruman's army.But goods are win every time.So the goods win the war with Aragorn's strong. This film very good.Really I recommend watch this film to you. This film to do who thanks.
10.0~Amazing chrislug Sign in Permalink This is the best movie ever made. Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd singing, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin with the last willpower through Mordor, Orlando Bloom, Liv Taylor and Hugo Weaving immortal, beautiful and wise, Miranda Otto and Dominic Monaghan fight together to protect the loved ones. Minas Tirith looks exactly as I imagined it to look like. And that is the astonishing part in this movie: You read the Book, you have a picture in your head and you watch the movie and it is like they put your picture on the screen. I've never seen that before with a book... If you know the book, there is always something you could criticise. But I could not think about a way of making a better movie out of this book, because it is perfect. I only miss Christopher Lee as Saruman and I miss Aragorn looking into the Palantir... The Rest of the Movie is wonderful and I do not think that there can be ever done a better movie than this...
10.0~absolutely positively superb davisff Sign in Permalink the journey is now complete and what an adventure ... I have not read the books and thank GOD for that cause I did not want to have a biassed opinion... whether PJ et al get recognised or not (in my opinion they should get the nod for BP & BD) for me they've accomplished something very special and I think it will be some time before something like this is ever repeated or attempted ... take a bow PJ et al - BRAVO
10.0~Return Of The King, Not Kong Gregbadey Sign in Permalink This Is My Favourite Film Of All Time And I Am Quite A Film Buff, Shame About Jacksons Latest, KING KONG. He Had The World Of Film At His Mercy, And What Do We Get, A Romance Film. The Ads Where So Misleading. Anyway, King Is The Best Of The Trilogy By Far And I Love All Three. In My Opinion It Goes:- 1. Return Of The King 2. The Fellowship Of The Ring 3. The Two Towers. My Other Personal Fav Films Are Star Wars(original Tril), Troy, Batman Begins, Shawshank Redemption, Matrix Tril and Gladiator. My Only problem with king is the whole shelob sequence, but when i watch the film i just skip these parts. I also wish that the witch king featured more, he was such a dark and evil character, i would have liked to have seen him in action, slaughtering some gondorians. Other than this, top film, fav seen has to be the ride of the rohirrim, genius
10.0~Greatest Movie of All Time Shrykespeare Sign in Permalink I figure I have paid to see roughly 500 different movies in theaters over the course of my lifetime, rented hundreds more, and seen a few thousand others on cable. And I can say this without hesitation: The Return of the King is the best movie I have ever seen, hands down. I won't give a long exposition about the plot, or how deserving it's Oscar sweep was; that's already been done by countless others before me. I will say, however, that if Peter Jackson never made another movie again after this, he will still be remembered 100 years from now. One of the most beloved and most-read series of books EVER, the LOTR trilogy was thought, many years ago, to be unfilmable; it was too long, too broad in scope. You'd have to cut so much out in order to tell the story. And at the time, it was true. But with movie effects and technology having progressed to the point it has, the time was right for the telling of this story. And, viewing the three movies as a whole, I wouldn't change one thing about it. There were changes or omissions from the original story, of course: the roles of the female characters, Arwyn and Eowyn, were hugely embellished for cinematic purposes; and the disappearance of Saruman from the 3rd installment is the only real niggle I have about the whole series. But I think that if JRR Tolkien had lived to see his work portrayed on the big screen, he would be more than satisfied with Jackson's work. Having read the books, I wondered just how much of the "after" story would make it into the final cut. Again, they left a lot out, but when you have a movie that is already 3 1/2 hours long, I guess certain sacrifices must be made! Of course, part of me hoped that the movie would never end.... and I know that's a sentiment shared by many. It's weird to note that ROTK nabbed 11 Oscars without even a single nomination for acting. Many would say that the story's epic-ness and volume were on such a massive scale, that it became difficult for individual performances to stand out. And that is a shame. Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood all did such and incredible job infusing their characters with warmth and inner strength that they almost became members of our family while we were watching them. The word "epic" is sometimes overused when it comes to movies. Any movie that incorporates thousands of extras, huge sets and big-budget effects these days could be called an "epic", but only history will be the judge of how it will hold up. "Titanic" was an epic, in every sense of the word. And for a year or two, it seemed to be the only movie that people saw, or talked about. But look at it now! Yes, it still stands as the #1 grossing movie of all time, a record that may stand for years to come. But it's already played itself out. Everyone has seen it, and few really have any desire to see it again. LOTR, the whole series, will not suffer the same fate. This movie will generate just as much positive buzz ten, twenty years from now as it does today. True, technology and computer effects will continue to grow, evolve and improve. There will be more "epics". But there will never, ever be another series like this one again. My score: an unqualified 10.
10.0~AWESOME koutsioumposm Sign in Permalink Best movie ever. The writing, the music soundtracks, the actors! I will be talking about this movie to my children some day!!! Afterwards every movie seemed unworthy. The special effects were something extraordinary.
8.0~Great film but frustrated at times pops1180 Sign in Permalink Well first off i should say that I have yet to read the LOTR trilogy. I think that definitely makes a big difference when analyzing the movie. As an adaptation of a book, I guess those who have read them are in awe of this movie. As a stand alone movie in itself, i felt it missed some things but was still entertaining. First off, considering the 3rd chapter is basically one battle and Frodo and Sam finally reaching Mount Doom, it essentially didn't have to be 3.5hrs long. A good 45 minutes could have been removed. ***Spoiler*** As for the ending, they definitely could have left it with everyone bowing to the hobbits and left the rest for the LOTR fanatics to the extended edition. The acting was better than the first two films, especially Sam played by Sean Astin. The rest of the cast showed better range in this last film. The battle scenes and special effects were quite amazing. Shelob and oliphants were created beautifully and all the battle scenes were top notch. As a whole, the movie was great but i kept thinking to myself "let's keep it moving..no need to slow down here". In essence i was impatient but the visuals kept me entertained. I found myself very frustrated at times watching it but that really isn't anyones fault considering it was basically derived from what Tolkien has ridden. I just found myself annoyed at times. I must confess that this movie is made to be viewed as a whole and when that's done it is truly a masterpiece as oppose to the individual films we have seen the past 3 years. There's a greater appreciation for what Peter Jackson has done in bringing us this treasured fable to life. In conclusion I give this movie a 8.5/10.
10.0~Amazing xxbabyboixx Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has done it. This film is fantastic an the best money i have ever spent on a film in my life. The picture is beautiful and the New Zealand scenery amazing. The acting is brilliant and the comedy is great as ever. This film has done the book justice. I must admit i walked into the cinema with my doubts...the fellowship of the ring was great,the two towers was OK until the last hour or so of the film when it got better and better but to me i couldn't help feeling that this film would fail to live up to mine and others expectations...I was thankfully proved so,so wrong and the advice i give to you all now is go out and buy the D.V.D and experience it yourself and realise why peter Jackson is slowly becoming my favourite director. The film itself i believe has opened up many new doors in the effects side of things as these are by far along with king Kong and revenge of the sith the best effects i have ever seen in my life and i tell you now that what stands out the most in this film is the acting and emotion that the actors put in. you really feel like they have put all there heart and skill into it and not one of them looks bored in the slightest. I thurally believe that nobody could have done the book more justice then peter Jackson has done and i hope that peter keeps on making movies based on books as i will then finally feel that film is getting better an i can forget about all the crap that we see now days e.g date movie......Watch this film now and feel the experience.
10.0~Breathtaking KWSN67 Sign in Permalink **SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD** OK, first off, Tolkienites will always have misgivings about whatever is turned out in film form to interpret the book, as will any die-hard fans of any book. But one must take this movie for what it is worth, an on-screen ADAPTATION of a FANTASY novel. There is no definite way that a Fantasy can be interpreted because fantasies are left in interpretation much up the the reader. Therefore, there will never be one PERFECT interpretation of a Fantasy because everyone has their own images in their own mind. That being said, this is an incredible film. As in the other two of the trilogy, it is visually stunning from the first frame to the last, something that has come to be expected in the series. Perhaps it is a bit overlong, but if the film is then the book is as well. A very impressive point is that there are really no truly dull moments in the film. It is not a film to take a bathroom break during, at any point. There is no fluff, all is vital to the story. There are no truly boring parts, all the heroes' quests are equally interesting. The battle scenes are magnificent, as usual, but at an even greater level in this edition. The acting is fantastic; there are no poorly-executed lines throughout the entire thing. The comic relief, when applicable, is great (Gimli's comment to Legolas after he slays the gigantic elephant is classic). This film is a certain must-see, and is destined to go down as the classic best part of one of the greatest cinematic trilogies of our time, if not ever.
10.0~Absolutely Outstanding rjhtamu Sign in Permalink This movie is truly the crowning finale to an epic trilogy that shall be remembered for as long as people watch movies. It does take a little while for the action to get going, but once it does there wasn't a single person in the theater who wasn't glued to their seats gaping in awe at what they were seeing. My only complaint if there could be one after a single viewing is that there are parts where it's rather obvious that material has been cut out in order to save running time. However, this isn't really a complaint cause I know we'll be seeing it when the Extended Edition comes along.
10.0~An incredible movie Wdragon98 Sign in Permalink Not only is Return of the King incredible, but probably the best movie I have ever seen. The characters are so great and I never get tired of watching them. I have seen this movie 5 times and I still have the same reaction to it every time I see it! The relationship between the characters, like Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legalas, and Gimli is so well done. While it is not entirely true to the book, it doesn't matter at all because it' still a great movie. In some ways it was like a whole other story than the book, which makes the movie even better. The movie never loses its momentum, from start to finish. I was on the edge of my seat and in tears constantly throughout the entire movie! A truly great masterpiece of its time that will be remembered for years to come.
10.0~The power of quality thornodor Sign in Permalink Although as a zealous and genuine admirer of the book I can hardly say the film is satisfying enough for me, I'm bound to admit it's amid the most affecting and "powerful" movies ever created. Having seen the three movies, I would rather comment the whole film (with all three parts)instead of only reviewing the third movie. It's indisputably the biggest and the most professionally ever made project, whose acclaim is completely deserved. Most of us, the "true Tolkien's admirers", cannot accept the huge discrepancies between the film and the book, claiming the film is only a money making machine, but what we must acknowledge is the power of the film that "suffers no rivalry". It's plain there are three reasons for the making of the Lord of The Rings - first is money, the second is more mone and the third is needless to add. Nonetheless the power of quality cannot be denied. moreover it is worthy of being praised. Finally I'd like to express my deepest respect to Mr. Peter Jackson, no matter there are hundred of reasons I'd rip his beard off.
10.0~Where is all the praise? dhenrich Sign in Permalink I saw this movie and thought "This is even better than all the Star Wars movies". It didn't let me down, it answered all the questions and neatly tied together of the details of the preceeding two movies. I thought the media would be plugging this one big time and that there would be talk of many awards. Imagine my surprise when I went to the theatre the first weekend and most of the theatre was empty. The costumes and scenes are gorgeous, the battles almost too real, the plot kept me glued to my seat. The message of duty, friendship, honor is missing in so many movies today. This one said it all. Then I visited this forum for the first time and I see why people didn't enjoy the movie...the friendship and honor was replaced with people who would rather argue than discuss the movie on its merits or shortcomings. How sad. I gave this movie a ten because it gave me everything I went to the movie to see and more.
6.0~Remove your rose-colored lenses NoCreamNoSugar Sign in Permalink This was an okay film. Well, it would have been good if about 20% was edited from every scene. 3 hrs 20 mins for this? And parts of the end were even in slow motion like finally ending this thing was a tease. At least give me an intermission. The first two were far better as there was actual character interaction. I recall laughing in the other films. I laughed only once during this one. ROTK felt like a giant Dragonball Z show or Pro wrestling where there's all this build up to battles with big talk and grand epic shots. Too much "it's going to be a tough battle" lines and no real characters. Where was the Legolas/Dwarf banter for example? And my lord, please I can't possibly watch so many scenes of people with tears and smiling at each other with swooshing crescendos in the background score. There was so much heavy-handed love for your fellow man in this that it seemed like a middle earth It's A Wonderful Life.
9.0~The last part to the LOTR njlewis22 Sign in Permalink Amazing!!! That sums it up. I gave it a nine cause my favorite out the three is the two towers. Um.... So I'm a total geek for this stuff. So I get worked up over this. So I need to go deeper. They had a few goofs so that was good. It has some intense violence so not recommended for younger kids but over all. It was amazing. No inappropriate scenes and no language that I know of. It's a LONG movie but worth it. Has an easy to follow storyline if you watched the first two. Definitely watch them in order OR YOU WILL GET CONFUSED! The Hobbit is also good and definitely read the books it goes deeper into the story and shows you a map of the land. The hobbit book is easier to read because it doesn't go as deep into detail of the environment. Pirates of the Caribbean is also a good series and the first one is good! That's it AMAZING!!!
9.0~(4 out of 4 Feet) BaerFoot_Reviews Sign in Permalink -By Brad Baer BaerFoot Reviews I was very eager to see this movie. The first two pictures had left me in such awe of Peter Jackson's epic filmmaking that I could barely get past the opening credits without soiling myself. I, of course, managed. I was on my way to the greatest movie experience of my short life. The cast of characters are back in full swing. We take journey with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they journey towards Mount Doom to destroy the ring, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they try to summon an army of the dead, and Gandalf and Pippin as they try to ready the forces of Minas Tirith. The battle for Minas Tirith is the most amazing scene I have ever witnessed in a movie. Thousands of troops surround the city, giant elephants act as carriages for battle hungry creatures, huge trolls pull gigantic catapults that fling boulders into the walls of the city. A scene like this cannot be explained in writing, well unless you are Tolkien. See this for yourself. I know when I finally get my hands on the DVD I will be wearing this scene out. The special effects are so real, we forget what we are watching, we marvel at what has been brought to life. Gollum is as real as his companions Frodo and Sam. Did anyone actually look at him and think `what terrible graphics?' I bet most movie goers didn't even know he was a computer graphic. This is not to take anything away from Andy Serkis who did an amazing job providing the voice and all the movements for Gollum. We also get to meet a giant spider named Shelob, which was so real, I quivered in my seat thinking of such a beast. I hate spiders. If you have not finished the trilogy for yourself, shame on you. You are depriving yourself of not only the greatest films of our time, but perhaps the greatest films ever. I do come short of calling each individual film the best ever because I don't believe they work as well as individual pictures. The trilogy is best viewed as a whole. With the trilogy over, a new standard for story telling has been set. Like the pictures before it, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Godfather, we have witnessed something truly special. Not only has Mr. Jackson brought one of the most imaginative books to life, he has given this and future generations films that can be cherished for lifetimes to come. Now all we need to do is recognize his achievement, and give him the best picture and best director Oscar. (4 out of 4 Feet)
9.0~Epic tale of greed and hope (The best of the three) johno1100 Sign in Permalink All of peter Jackson's film adaptation's of Jrr Tolkien's tell a tale of hope counter balanced with greed. And as the series concludes with Lord of the rings the return of the king the hope pays of for the heroes as Frodo and Sam finally destroy the ring despite the attempts to kill and tempt them. Many characters go through deep spiritual changes and somehow Jackson puts all these tales together without rushing the movie along. Among other things the movie is also a tale of good vs evil and as with most good vs evil movies the good win. Despite a few minor flaws such as focusing on the glory of war and not the horror. (If the movie was about a historical battle it would probably be a tragic tale and not a heroic tale.)But all in all the masterful tale cancels out the few flaws.
10.0~Simply Amazing!! dustinp43 Sign in Permalink I am a huge fan of the books. The Fellowship of the Ring was my favourite movie, I thought the Two Towers was still great, but didnt live up to the Fellowship of the Ring. But the Return of the King is trully spectacular!! Every part of the movie was amazing, and it has taken the number one spot on my list!
10.0~meaning busyboy50 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King, is an outstanding movie full of everything you could ever ask to be in a movie. There is romance between Sam and Rosie, and Aragorn and Arwen who almost could not be together because of the war, and Faramir and Eowyn. There is loads of comedy, specifically speaking of Merry and Pippin, but also between Gimli, and Legolas when in the fight scenes. My favorite quote of Gimli's is always: "Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for?" i can not help but include a small giggle no matter what mood i am in. Another scene is when Legolas just takes on the giant elephaunt, with many men in his way, and Gimli still manages to keep that as one: "That still only counts as one!" This movie is of course action packed. Thousands of blood-thirsty orcs, completely built for killing, march to the gates of Minas Tirith. after a few blows from the Gondor catapults, throwing chunks of the city, the massive army breaks into the city destroying everything in their path. just as all hope fails, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas come to the rescue. Of course they couldn't do it alone! the three heroes come to the rescue with a massive army behind them. what kind of army you may ask? A dead army. the deadly army of the dead joined forces with Aragorn, to assure their own freedom. The true meaning of the movie however, is friendship. in the darkest times of Middle Earth, 2 hobbits had what everyone in the world could have. each other, or their own friendship. it seems as though, the only hope in the world, which they were, lied with these two hobbits who berally knew how to wield a sword. carrying the one ring, and each other, Frodo Baggins, and Sam Gamgee finally save Middle Earth, and rid the world of its evil inhabitants, just by keeping hope in front of them, and holding on to each other. basically, their faith in each other, and their friendship saved all of Middle Earth. I hope that you enjoy this movie as much as i did.
10.0~The best film of the year (well, that's a given) moondoggy88 Sign in Permalink I would like to start out by saying that I am a hardcore, die-hard junkie of Lord of the Rings. I've watched both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers at least fifty times (combined). I continuously think about the movies where ever I am, and I dream...yes, dream about them also. This may seem a little strange and dramatic coming from a male, but these movies are just so damn good. I must warn you that my review may seem a little biased, but its only because I'm so obsessed with these films. I can honestly say that I've been waiting for December 17th (ROTK opening day) ever since I saw the Fellowship of the Ring. This may seem unfair to some, considering I've never read the books (though I am in the process), that I am obsessed with these films. However, I think anyone who hasn't read the books has just as much potential for liking these movies than someone who has read them. Even if you don't like fantasy at all, I believe these movies can immediately draw you in. The beautiful vast setting, Howard Shore's fantastic score, and the adventurous plot of the films are absolutely magnificent. Every aspect of The Lord of the Rings, in my mind, is perfect. The time where I felt most excited was when I bought The Two Towers theatrical DVD and saw The Return of the King preview on it. That preview literally gave me goosebumps....seeing Frodo's expressions as he tries to climb up the mountain, the battle, the setting...it made me want to see it right then. But I knew I'd have to wait another month. From November 25 to December 17 I was so anxious that I found myself ALWAYS thinking about Return of the King and how good it was going to be. And damn, was it good. Before Two Towers even came out on DVD, I was sending e-mails to my friends asking if they wanted to go with me to Return of the King opening night. By the time December 17 came around, I had gathered up a group of about 10 friends, all Lord of the Rings fans. We went into the theater, took up one whole role, and didn't say a word the entire time. I became totally immersed in the film as soon as it started. I had been waiting for that moment for over a year, and it was finally here. The Return of the King is a grandly-made movie in every aspect. The acting was awesome from all the characters, and the settings were once again totally sweet. I was a tiny bit disappointed at the lack of great music, but I can't blame Howard Shore. I know composers who couldn't accomplish half of what he did for Fellowship alone in a lifetime of music making. Fellowship of the Ring earns my best music award, but the new music in Return of the King was also very good. Some old themes from the first two movies pop up once and a while in the film, including a faster, altered version of the Rohan theme. The Minas Tirith and overall theme of the movie was the best score of the film. The acting in this movie is better than both the first movies, that's for sure. Wood and Astin's performances as Frodo and Sam are astonishingly well acted, especially for actors as young as they are. Elijah Wood's depiction of Frodo's gradual deterioration are astounding, and Sam's reaction to Frodo's suffering is also brilliant. Girls and sensitive guys be warned: the film is heavy and will make you cry. I had to try hard to hold back tears within the last 45 minutes of the film. The battle of Minis Tirith is quite different than the battle of Helm's Deep from The Two Towers. In Return of the King, the battle lasts for about two thirds of the film instead of about a fourth, and begins much earlier in the film. There are 200,000+ orcs in this film's battle, and they've bought some "technological advances" that help them in battle. Seeing this movie gives you the combined power of both the emotions of the characters and the intensity of the battles (just as the first two did). The theatrical release of The Return of the King is much longer than that of the first two films, but with good reason. Just when you think the movie's over, there is more to be explained. The ending of Return of the King is almost a fifth of the movie itself because it ends on so many levels. It's also very powerful. The ending of The Fellowship of the Ring was one of the best endings I have ever seen. It shows how the journey of the Fellowship is nowhere near complete, and gets you psyched up for the next film. The ending of The Two Towers was a slight disappointment, as it just left me hanging and wasn't as complete as Fellowship's ending. The Return of the King's ending, however, is quite different than the endings of the other films in that IT ENDS. Everything is explained and everything is ended. This was the major cause of my sadness leaving the theater, knowing that it was over. I had been looking forward to it for so very long, and now it was over. Part of me is happy, because it was such a great series of films, but part of me is sad, because I don't want it to end. That's what made the Return of the King's ending so powerful to me, but as Peter Jackson said: everybody is affected in a different way. The Return of the King's ending was indeed powerful, as well as the rest of the film. I strongly encourage anyone to see it. Now I must wait another 11 months for the Return of the King Extended Edition...then I can see even more. "For Frodo...."
7.0~You'll have more then 3 hours shortage of air! Asimovo Sign in Permalink Amazing special effects. Allthough the story misses some detaills compared to J.R.R. Tolkiens book Lord of the Rings, you'll not be disappointed! More then 3 hours of high end spectakel, breathtaking effects and Peter Jackson even put more storyline into the film characters! Start the movie, and experiences the richdom of CGI!
5.0~Disappointing solve_lora_infernis Sign in Permalink Really Disappointing, It Started well and given the 2 movies before it, it should have been a solid ending to a fairly successful trilogy which would have been (i imagine) very hard to make. The Special effects and Fight scenes are great and the acting is sound on the whole (elijah wood's screaming does get a bit annoying sometimes, but he looks the part so all is forgiven). The End is ABSOLUTELY horrendous... nowhere near the book which offers the 'soldiers returning from war to find that it can never be the same' and instead serves up a mushy pathetic 'its all OK we are back and everything is great' attitude. It really ruined the movie for me and it saddens me because it could have been a great trilogy but instead its a good trilogy. There were also some weak moments such as Theoden's speech to Eowyn at the end after she kills the Nazgul bloke... a bit weak.... a Shame
10.0~WOW - Amazing, Simply Amazing fairplayer999 Sign in Permalink I still cannot believe the awesome effect that this movie had on me. I agree with many of the positive reviews that have been posted. The movie is beyond belief, I only hope that we will see more epic movies like this in the near future. It has been a long time since I have commented on a movie, but WOW... LOTR 3 completely deserves it. Easily my favorite movie of all time.
10.0~Great movie? Yes. Great ART? ABSOLUTELY! ddpierso Sign in Permalink As one of the lucky hundreds who secured tickets to the 12:01 am screening last night, I have to say that this experience was well worth the sleep-deprived stupor I'm in today. This film was everything I hoped it would be, and more. I'm in awe for the accomplishment of the entire LOTR cast and crew -- the love and passion and creative energy and TALENT of each and every one of the 26,000+ humans who collectively birthed this epic is evident in every frame. This is an act of creation to potentially redefine cinema itself, and I can't wait to see how this film raises the bar for ALL films to follow. Few will attain Jackson's triumph, but even the pursuit is worthy. The performances are what carry this epic (again, a redefinition of that term is inevitable), and Jackson's team is to be congratulated for such flawless casting. Young Elijah Wood is a miracle: his skill and vision and fearless dedication to character are worthy of Oscar attention. Frodo's journey broke my heart in so many places, across all three films, and his portrayal of this humble everyman -- forced into heroism by circumstance, rather than choice -- rang true on every note for me. While I admit that Sean Astin's Sam annoyed me in the first two films, I'm delighted to report that Sam blossomed into a heroic figure of his own in this chapter -- and we should all be so blessed with such a brave and unwavering friend. Viggo Mortenson is a modern day Renaissance Man in so many aspects, and his Aragorn commanded each scene. I BELIEVED that we were watching a KING, and his transformation from reluctant heir to ruler was artfully crafted. Ian McKellen is a legend, and it is a testament to his skill that I only saw Gandolf on that screen -- not an actor buried under wig and spirit gum. A lesser actor could have been lost in the mythology of Gandolf: McKellen shaped the mythology to his own vision and by doing so, gave us the consummate Gandolf. Gollum/Smeagol blew me away: a treacherous creature yet utterly sympathetic in his struggle. Our final glimpse of Gollum took my breath away. Even as his fate became evident (to us), his tragic face was beaming with joy. Heartbreaking. Yet, quietly behind all these bold, lead characters, it was Faramir who truly captured my attention and heart: what a tragic character, doomed to forever compete with the dead. His return to Minas Tirith was horrifying, and his subsequent treatment at his father's hands shocked and saddened me. Congratulations to David Wenham for elevating a somewhat minor character to such glorious suffering and humanity. The effects are truly beyond description, and Jackson and WETA deserve every accolade that is offered. The breath-taking technical craft of the filmmakers supports, rather than supplants, the story and performances (and visa versa) - and that a sadly rare accomplishment these days. I'm still in awe at the sheer CRAFT of Gollum -- for the first time, here is an digital illusion so real you FEEL this character rather than just see the carefully-manipulated pixels. The creation of Gollum is a consummate, wildly successful marriage of writing, acting and digital magic. (And Andy Serkis was ROBBED by the Academy.) Is this (or any other) film perfect? No. But it soars to close to perfection as one can hope for...today. It is arguably the `best" film I've ever seen: technically, creatively, emotionally, aesthetically, and visually. In my opinion and experience, this final chapter is the most compelling of a magnificent trilogy. It is also, without question, THE most magnificent film trilogy to date. It caps the numerous character arcs honorably and effectively. These films are far more than the sum of the impressive parts, without question. I wish Peter Jackson a long life. If this is what he can create with today's technology, imagine what he might offer up in another decade or two? Let us all also send good thoughts for successful negotiations with the (bizarrely hostile) Tolkien estate so that we can line up to buy tickets for Jackson's The Hobbit someday! See this film! Then allow yourself to surrender to the EXPERIENCE of it. If you are fortunate enough to experience this film with a passionate Tolkien scholar (as we did), do so: it enriches an already breath-taking viewing experience. Read the books, by all means. Jackson did an excellent job of distilling and interpreting and yes, honoring, the essence of Tolkien's written words for the screen. The screenplays are works of creative writing that stand proudly, shoulder-to-shoulder, with the novels. I love and admire Jackson's Middle Earth as much (perhaps more) as Tolkien's. In my opinion, the two visions of Middle Earth complement one another magnificently. Surrender to the EXPERIENCE that Peter Jackson has offered, and you will be rewarded by entertainment than just might enrich your life. More importantly, GREAT art such as this should INSPIRE each of us to reach just a little higher every day.
10.0~Thrills through and through tkbaines Sign in Permalink This is one of those rare movies where I found myself hoping each time the screen went black, that it wasn't quite over. The director obliged and had several stops which could have been good endings, but it just kept going. I've heard some critiques say that it was a tad long; I was disappointed when it ended. In any case, coming from a non-fantasy fan, this, along with the first two, just kept drawing me deeper and deeper into the story with the thrills and plots and battles that rival the very best movies ever created. Much like the dreaded ring, the movie got me hooked, leave me wanting more and more and more! The greatest line in the movie was when Leggelos killed the giant elephant and its crew (a super human feat), and the Dwarf said "That still counts only as one" I, along with the rest of the audience, just about died laughing at that one. The not-so-friendly rivalry in the first movie evolved into a friendly rivalry to a friendship for the ages between those two. The second best line: At the end of the Return of the King, Aragorn asks the hobbits to rise after he was crowned king and says: Rise my friends; you bow to no one. This was not just a fantasy, or simply a high tech movie; the human factor played strong and clear. I found myself actually cheering for the human lady who sought Aragorn's heart, but alas, it was not to be. This movie is one for the ages indeed. It rivals the feeling I got when I first saw a Star Wars movie. Thank you to J.R.R. Tolkien
3.0~I don't get it... raiden1969 Sign in Permalink What a waste of time. The lack of realism was horrible. Why is it that everyone if raving about this director - his character relationships, etc. did not touch me in the slightest. I can suspend reality to belive in giants, trolls, orcs, and dragons but don't paint unrealistic human relationships and expect me to believe them. So the orc army was killed by ghosts. Uh, okay. So women are killing bad ass shadowlords. So calvary can kill orc infantry+ huge animals bigger than mamoths. So a stormed castle does not fall. So 2 hobbits are barely alive and exhausted, and they're running all around. So a hobbit can kill trained warrior. So what's up with mister baggy eyes getting all that screen time again? So we have a 80 year old wizard who seems to only be a master swordsman and not a magic user. So the humans approve and cheer when an freaky elf marries their king. So what's with all these little reminesings prior to imminent death? So how many loose ends you gonna tie up? Perhaps the most annoying thing was the emphasis on the two other hobbits (although Frodo and Sam were bad also). I actually walked out of the movie early - just as they were about to go to the 'shire'
10.0~Best movie of my life Moska1m Sign in Permalink Because of this film I come to love Tolkien. Knowing Tolkien's universe and realizing that I enjoyed reading for hours, I loved from beginning to end. Because of this movie I read the next book and knew the last movie from beginning to end.
10.0~Extremely Satisfying bix171 Sign in Permalink In this final, extremely satisfying installment of `The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, Peter Jackson confirms himself as the Cecil B. DeMille of our time, a master purveyor of entertainment and showmanship with superior storytelling skills. Jackson throughout has set out to make his own movies and not become a slave to J.R.R. Tolkien's books (awful as they are--I couldn't make it through the last one) and this episode particularly benefits from his cinematic vision and the refitting by the writers (who, in addition to Jackson, include Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) of major plot points and the deepening of the character motivation so sorely lacking in Tolkien's prose; there's a lot of emotion on display and it's frequently overwhelming. Jackson gives the audience what it wants and gives himself the pleasure of having created a work of art that is deeply personal as well, embodying, as it does, notions of chivalry and honor that go all the way back to `Heavenly Creatures'. In order to bring the massive story to closure, Jackson is forced to concentrate more on plot and battle (the film's centerpiece, the oversized battle at Pelennor Fields, is enthralling, with plenty of swaggering action drawn from the Warner Bros. swashbucklers of the thirties) and have his cast shoulder the responsibility of maintaining interest in the characters--but fortunately everyone is up to the challenge, with Sean Astin (as Sam, for whom the story is ultimately about) and Elijah Wood (as Frodo, sensitively handling the supporting role to which he has been relegated) being the moral centers. Jackson and production designer Grant Major, for the finale, have combined the best design schemes of the previous two films, the warm, colorful textures of the `The Fellowship Of The Ring' with the rocky monochromatic landscapes of `The Two Towers' and the result is a breathtaking, moving cinematic experience that delivers the trilogy into movie legend; the fact that it's now over means that audiences will feel an acute loss at Christmastime from hereon in.
10.0~The movie is too short. ixtar1 Sign in Permalink ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** That's right; too short. While no one could have included all the wonderful sequences contained in the book, there are several omissions here that diminish narrative flow and character development. The four biggest being: 1. The failure to explain Denethor's madness, and his foreknowledge of Aragorn (both born from the same source). The film wants us to believe he just went mad or that he lost it to grief over Boromir, and that just doesn't work. 2. No mention of the romance between Faramir and Eowyn. In a film with little love story, this should have been included. 3. Leaving out the development of Eomer as Aragorn's friend, and Gimli's rival. In the film version, Eomer is little more than an extra. 4. Eliminating the confrontation with Saruman at Orthanc and the Scouring of the Shire. This omission is huge. One of Tolkien's great themes was the growth of the young hobbits, especially Merry and Pippin. The chapter on their return to the Shire is the real climax of the book. It is where Merry and Pippin's growth as leaders of their people really shines. Also, Tolkien wanted to show how even the Shire could not escape the war. A definite missed opportunity. Part of the problem is that The Two Towers was cut short. The confrontation with Saruman and a short sequence on Denethor could have (and should have) been included in the middle film. That having been said The Return of the King is still a wonderful film. The action sequences are breathtaking. The character development is at the right times inspiring and heartbreaking. Easily one of the best films of the year.
10.0~Great Conclusion to The Trilogy. byron938 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Is an historic epic film in the modern age of Hollywood. The storyline is very well done. The Cinematography by Annie Collins and Jamie Selkirk was breathe taking. Director Peter Jackson and Frances Walsh has inspired young movie makers for the generations. Great story and screenplay. Four stars. Byron Ware

10.0~Beautiful movie nloach Sign in Permalink It rocked, it really did. The battle scenes are like no other, they're incredible. You can't believe what Peter Jackson has achieved with this movie. But what I thought was better than the battle scenes were how sentimental the movie was. The scenes where Sam and Frodo discuss how they will achieve their victory or recalling the days in the Shire is beautiful. Peter Jackson manages to get you right into the scene, it's great. There were a few problems though.... The one liners are terrible and how Gimli is the comic relief disgusted me. I really hate how Gimli is supposed to be the dumb, comical character. Howard Shore, once again delivers a flawless score that makes your hair stand on end. All in all, I give this movie 9.5/10. The movie is beautiful, the cinematography is stunning, the graphics mind-numbing and the acting is great by mainly Gandalf, King Theoden and most of all, Eowyn. You're all in for the ride of your life! If you thought the battle scenes from Master and Commander, Pirate's of the Caribbean and The Last Samurai were good, as a critic said, they are merely skirmishes compared to what Return of the King has in store.
1.0~The worst movie ever made formala44 Sign in Permalink Okay, Gandalf, Aragorn, Frodo are killed in the first ten minutes and Sauron is King again. That would be a good ending. But no, it drags on for another 3 hours and in the end, everything is well and all goals are reached. In between there are many fighting scenes where you easely get confused who is fighting against who and what exactly for. The fighting is overdone and in all battles, the good guys win. Boring and predictable. The strongest warrior of the bad guys is defeated by an average female warrior. It could do with some more drama. It is evident from all 3 movies together that its a story about the eternal fight between good and bad. But in these movies its never really explained why exactly the bad guys hate the good guys. Whats even more disturbing is the facial features of the bad vs the groomed faces of the good guys. As if the storyline itself simply wasn't strong enough to outline that they are really evil. The Orcs have disfigured faces, disfigured teeth, drool and have a hissing voice. Couldn't Jackon portray that a little bit more subtile? Frodo is attacked by a giant spider who has, surprise surprise, also a deformed face and only one eye on the left side of the head. Is this done to make sure 3 year old infants cannot mistake who is the scary bad guy? It was ridiculous to see. In fact i had trouble hating them at all. I just felt sorry for them. I understand its a family movie but this blatant deforming is an insult to the intelligence of people. Then there's the plot and the story. It doesn't make any sense. There's no explanation why Faramir father wants to kill himself and his son. Or why Gandalf or Aragorn do not take the ring to Mordor but trust it to little Frodo, who does nothing but squeel, cry and hug Sam in between. Why did the fellowship decide to break up and let Frodo continue alone with Sam while the other, stronger fellows try to save Peppin and Merrin? On with this movie; Gandalf and Aragorn guess Frodo must be close to his end goal in Mordor but is held up by Saurons watching eye so decide to launch a distracting attack with the last army the good guys have left. What if Frodo happened to appear a few hours later Or a few days? And Sauron itself was a huge warrior in movie 1 but now only a flame on a tower? Why do the thousands of Orcs stop fighting when the tower crumble? They flee but where to? It is just too unbelievable stupid. In movie one thousands of Orc chase the fellowship in Moria, only inches away. But none of them harm Frodo or manage to catch them. In movie 2 they ride with 5 horses through 10000 Orcs without so much as a scratch. In movie 3 Gandalf fights the Orcs in Mordor but suddenly stops for a moment of musing and while the fighting around him continues, not an Orc touches him or buries his sword in gandalfs white hair. I've seen C- class horrors that made more sense. Then there's the last 20 minutes. Frodo destroyed the ring but the end simply goes on and on and on and on. Lots of tear jerking twists appear and you simply start shouting PLEASE END to the TV screen in utter annoyance. No, this movie may have won all academy awards it was nominated for but it was a terrible, terrible series. The thing that saved this last part a little bit was the helicopter view scenery. But if i wanna watch helicopter view scenery ill watch National Geographic. Even the 'epic' battles gave me a feeling of been there, done that. Star Wars, Gladiator, Ben Hur, they all done the same and most of the time better shot, directed, edited and, more importantly, more believable. And the directing was awful. The cinematography boring and predictable. The editing confusing. The score predictable. The storyline infantile. The acting, without any exception TERRIBLE. The lenght insane. The events too much for fantasy. The CGI effects hokey. It is a childs movie a la Jungle book. It belongs on Nickelodeon between Spongebob and Johnny Bravo. In fact, there oughta be a law against Peter Jackson movies. I said borefest in the summary but that was too kind. Its a nice series when you are a child. But its outright trash if you're an adult. The one aspect that made this one better than the other 2 movies, is that there is finally and end to the endless walking and talking. The ring is destroyed. Peter Jacksons mega project too. Thankfully.
10.0~Best Of the Best adolfww Sign in Permalink Best Trilogy Ever Awesome Awesome Awesome (with 3 WOW) :) Maybe The Last Movie Won Every Awards Nominated The Words Are too Cheap to Explain This
6.0~good, not great e-1529 Sign in Permalink I felt a bit disappointed with mixed feelings. I really wanted to like it but I didn't. It was confusing and predictable. Some special effects were really good some looked just fake. The ghost army sucked. It appeared for 30 seconds and then the battle was over. The ending was endless. There are also a lot of good points: spectacular shots, great acting, lot of emotions, the spider scene , psycho gollum. Overall pretty good but if your not into fantasy mood go see something else like the last samurai.
7.0~Jackson drops the ball jedit Sign in Permalink I'm going to keep this short for everyone's sake: this is by far the weakest of the three films. Not to say it's bad, because it isn't - it just does not stand next to the other two. There is a major change to the books which just does not work, and there's some really ropey CGI shots in the latter third of the movie. You'll know them when you see them, so I won't even hint.
10.0~The greatest epic ever filmed. kegie Sign in Permalink The Return of the King has finally arrived, and it is above all expectation. I went into the theater with my hopes to the roof, but still having doubts as to whether this film would be able to reach the same level as the first film did. As soon as the film started, all fears were thrown aside. This is truly magnificent film making. Peter Jackson has managed to do just that which makes fantasy so hard to do, namely create a realistic vision of a world utterly unlike our own, and explore that world to the fullest. One sequence with Legolas and an oliphaunt will make you cry just from the sheer amazing imagination of it. The scale and grandeur of this film is so far beyond that of any other it will take many viewings and several years to put it into perspective. This film will be remembered as the ultimate fantasy film, and I honestly cannot see how it will ever be topped again. The story is the greatest ever told, written over a period of 50 years, and it is retold for the screen with so much passion and so much love for it that there is just no redoing it. By all rights, this film should never have been made, for a movie company that throws this much money onto a relatively unknown filmmaker makes such a gamble, by all logic it should have driven them to the brink of bankruptcy. It is simply amazing. Thank you, Peter Jackson.
10.0~Words can not do this film justice. terminator-3 Sign in Permalink It has been a long time since I was this gripped by a series of films, or even an individual film. The cinematography was outstanding as was the acting, special effects and most importantly the Direction. I grew up with the Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings books. Although the book of LOTR was very long, and at some times heavy going, it was still a book that was hard to put down. The depth of the story and characters was immense. It was a credit to Tolkien's pursuit of detail. When the first film was being released, I wanted to see if it could come close to gripping me the way the books had. I was not disappointed. Although parts of the story had been changed or removed, I appreciated that this was necessary to make the film flow and be marketable for the cinema. I was immediately captivated by the first film and by the characters. It refreshed my passion for the story. I enjoyed it so much that I was willing to wait for the special edition to be released before buying the DVD. I was glad to see that some key scenes had been added (such as the giving of the gifts). I could not wait for the second film. This gripped me the same way. The battle sequences were bigger and the special effects were improved. Again I waited for the special edition DVD to be released. It was like torture waiting, but the wait was worth while. It explained more about the history with Faramir and his father and brother, and also the trees and Ents. I have now watched the third film and was even more blown away. The battle sequences were incredible (as has been discussed by many reviewers) and the lighting of the beacons was very moving. I will not say more about the film as words can't do it justice. It has to be seen to be fully appreciated. If any film deserves to sweep the boards at the Oscars, this is it. As for the length, I can still watch films like Ben Hur which also swept the boards in its day and not be bored or tired. Quality film making is never boring. Peter Jackson, the cast, crew and New Line have my thanks for their contributions in bringing these incredible films to a world wide audience. They are all stars in my opinion. They have pleased almost all of us die hard Tolkien fans and also created new fans (e.g. my parents - who have never read Fantasy Fiction books). I hope they go on to make the Hobbit, as all I have to look forward to now is the next release of the special edition. The 3 films will take pride of place in my video collection.
10.0~A Grand Finale to The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) h-rabbit Sign in Permalink The Battle of Minas Tirith, the March on the Black Gate, the Quest to Destroy the One Ring. Those are the elements which make this epic fantasy film THE best in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It contains such an enthralling world of Middle-earth that for the lengthly period of time the movie takes place, you lose time in yourself to a world filled with mirth and magic. I think those fans of LOTR, Tolkien and fantasy should grab this movie straight away. Oh, and try buying the Extended DVD, it contains more scenes, Appendices and an Easter Egg below the final scene in the scene selection of each Disc. Definitely a 10/10. By HowlingRabbit334
10.0~The best film ever mysticranger144 Sign in Permalink I'm a big fan of the Lord of the rings, and of Peter Jackson. And what can I say about the Return of the King? Well it has more drama then The Fellowship, better continuity than the Two Towers, better visual effects than the first two, more action than the first two, and is it better than the first two? Yes! And more! 10/10 I hope it comes away with Best Picture and Best Director at the Oscars!
10.0~Ok, it's too long, but it was the shortest 3 hrs of my life joevittoria Sign in Permalink Yes some of scenes drag out a bit too long, but just look at the detail! It is amazing. I am not a Tolkien nut, but I really enjoyed the character development and attention to storyline. Roll on the extended (i.e. real) version.
10.0~ROTK icywhitelady Sign in Permalink It was kinda sad watching this movie because I knew that this would be the ending for the 'Lord of the Rings'. This movie sums up everything from the first two movies. Everything was great- from the acting to the special effects. The only thing that disappointed me was that the Faramir/Eowyn love story was not included.
9.0~Making of the film is wonderful SoviEntertainments Sign in Permalink I have watched the film and loved the making part of the film. All the cast and crew and even post production team have done a great job. Congrats to the Director
10.0~Perfect. FrodoLives3950 Sign in Permalink I went into this movie with high expectations.And they were more than met... This movie is,simply put,perfect.I loved each and every minute of it.And no,I was not disappointed or displeased with the ending at all.Like I said,it's perfect.For the following reasons-- 1) Acting.This movie is an acting phenomenon.Never have I seen more power put into the performances of films than these.Elijah Wood,Sean Astin,Viggo Mortensen,Ian McKellen,Dominic Monoghan (sp?),Billy Boyd,Liv Tyler,Miranda Otto,Andy Serkis,and all the rest of the cast are all spectacular performers,and should all be given special nods. 2) Beauty.This movie is beautiful.Whether it be with the scenery,or the cloud patterns in the sky that reveal a beautiful sunshine over the Pelennor Fields,this movie is pure beauty.Never has a movie been so utterly amazing with its scenery and sheer spectacle. 3) Effects.But,of course!You already know how good/perfect they are! 4)Action sequences.Simply AMAZING.Never have I been amazed by such grandeur in action than in these films.The Battle of the Pelennor fields was a perfect treat.One special moment in this battle is the charge of the Rohirrim.The sheer beauty of this scene evokes such emotion that can only be met by these films. 5)Musical Score.Howard Shore is the best music composer that has ever lived.His triumphant score proves that.The soundtracks of these movies are perfection. 6)Everything else you want to name.Script,cinematography,sound,the faithfulness to Tolkien's classic masterpiece,and everything.Perfect.Just perfect. I truly believe these movies are going to live on in history as the greatest film achievements of all time. 10/10?No.10 is too low a number. 1000000000000000/10
10.0~Best ending to a trilogy maybe ever! martin_paul Sign in Permalink This is a great film. Highly recommend. They end all the characters story in such a great ending, and the story is so emotional driven as well.
2.0~Only Orlando Bloom is worth seeing...too many ugly people Annie124 Sign in Permalink This movie blurs into the first two. There is nothing unique about it. The ugly fantasy creatures and the crescendo of fighting battles are boring beyond belief. Orlando Bloom, as the cool elf guy, is the highlight of this otherwise monotonous three hour fiasco. I can't believe this horrendously disgusting film would receive academy awards. I am so glad this trilogy is over with. Please let there be no more!
10.0~Peter Jackson does the impossible heybow Sign in Permalink The ring trilogy has long been one of my favorite books, but I thought it could never be made into a movie due to the complexity and length. But Peter Jackson (who may actually be a Hobbit) did a magnificent job of translating the books into movies and the Return of the KIng is a masterpiece all by itself. he was brilliant in making all 3 movies at the same time, no cast members died as in Harry Potter and he could shoot out of order and put it together later. I think his choice of cast is also outstanding and the character literally speak for themselves with fantastic performances. This is a must see and a collector's item since I do not think it will ever be done again.
1.0~Not Tolkien's Trilogy, not even the spirit of it. Worst of the three lavish_tongue Sign in Permalink Moves even further from the source material, more so than The Two Towers by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh. Too many elements are changed from the heart of Tolkien's work. Sam would never have been turned away, and by the way, just how did he find that sword and the light of Elendil in Shelob's lair with no light source? Also, Shelob is spider like, but not a spider. There were no webs in her lair. Even worse is the acting of John Noble as Denethor. Yes, Denethor has despaired, but in the book, his madness is related to his use of a palantir and competing against Sauron. Sauron's will was stronger, and he bent Denethor, left him bereft of hope. This movie, he is a caricature, a cheap, poorly rendered, badly overacted caricature. Faramir's character was assassinated in the second movie, but it is his father who is torn asunder even worse in this one. Aragorn had the sword Anduril after he left Elrond and Rivendell, and says so in the The Two Towers before entering the hall to meet with Wormtongue and Theoden(book). Here, it is given to him by Elrond who never came to visit Aragorn. It was Elrond's sons and the remaining rangers(who allude to no longer protecting the borders of the shire, foreshadowing the scouring) who came to him. And they brought the banner of the king, not the sword. Aragorn acts like a haughty king in the Paths of the Dead, where in the book the scenario is much more dramatic with his humility and doubts. Also, the dead were released after helping them capture the ships with black sails so were not present at the battle at Pellenor Fields. That scene looked like The Frighteners Part 2. Absolutely ridiculous. It is a pretty to look at movie with no substance when compared to the source material. Tolkien loved the Scouring of the Shire, and felt it was the true climax of the entire work. Yet Peter Jackson called it a "simple denouement" and said he hated it. The better story isn't in these movies, and I hope that people can read with a finer eye than they watch these movies with. They aren't that good, and each slips further down. The first adaptation was the best of the three, and this was the worst hands down, yet this one received an Oscar for best adaptation.
10.0~A flawless movie! Ragefeast95 Sign in Permalink The fact that I can repeatedly sit through a film that is over 3.5 hours long and still be fully entertained is somewhat of a wonder to me. There are some movies that I cringe my way through, or am so bored that I check the time and can't wait for it to be over, but not the LOTR. This movie perfectly captures the world that Tolkien created by combining several flawless elements that work to make this one of the best movies ever made. The acting, cast, CGI, wardrobe, and general attention to the simplest of details are what makes this a truly magical movie. From the mountain of books in the background of Bilbo's study, to the rust and grime on the armor of the Orc berserkers, it's the painstaking attention to detail that makes this movie endlessly re-watchable, and timelessly beautiful.
10.0~Best Movie Ever rubes2 Sign in Permalink The title does not lie. It never lies. Because this is simply the greatest movie ever made. Peter Jackson is a visual genius and an excellent writer/director/producer. Everything in the movie was flawless and it deserved all its 11 Oscar wins. There is nothing wrong with this movie. Some people found the ending not as good because it didn't have the scouring of the Shire but how could you fit that into a 3 1/2 hour movie? I think people should be satisfied with the wonderfulness of this motion picture masterpiece. This is a movie which you can watch many times without getting tired of. Peter Jackson is the Steven Spielberg of the next generation. The cast provides flawless performances. However, I wish that they did not cut the Mouth of Sauron out of the movie. I thought that would give viewers more of a "book feeling." But what can you do? Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum was brilliant and I think he should've won an Oscar for it. This is the best in the whole LOTR trilogy, book AND movie, so I suggest if you haven't watched it, watch it right away. If you have heard rumors that this movie sucks or is "gay", those rumors are wrong.
8.0~The most emotional and captivating movie I have ever seen. jtothedovez Sign in Permalink The Lord Of The Rings is the best trilogy ever made in my opinion. There is not a single flaw (maybe from book to movie, but I haven't read the books, so I can't say). This series is so perfect. Not only is it for anyone from 9 to 99, but it's just so touching. The Fellowship of The Ring was an excellent movie, probably the slowest one, but you gotta have patience. The Two Towers ups the action and excitement and after I had seen it, I was craving the 3rd one so bad. But when this film finally hit theaters and I saw it, I knew that it was the perfect movie. I cried, I gasped, I jumped, I cheered, I laughed, I clapped, I did everything. This movie will honestly stay in my heart forever. A true example of a perfect movie.
10.0~The Best Movie of the all year zitz2003 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the KIng the best movie of the all year. Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game. Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was! This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film. Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's OK. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King. The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the KIng is now three my favorite movie of all time. My Rate on this movie 10/10.
10.0~ROTK, Hail to the King! jeolson Sign in Permalink WOW! What a beyond great end to a magnificent serious of films. My hats off to the cast and crew for delivering above and beyond my expectations. Time flew by for me watching this film, and there were definitely tear filled moments, especially toward the end of the film. The movie has about 5 different endings, but they are much deserved, giving the characters closure. SFX were even more polished. There are some minor nit-picks, with pacing etc. More scenes def needed to be there, such as Houses of the Healing and the Mouth. But the EE will top it all off, and I can't wait. Over all, as far as theatrical releases go, I would rate them in this order. ROTK, FOTR, TTT. I've booked next week off to see it, again, and again. 9.5 outa 10.
10.0~We are furious!! Asklepios Sign in Permalink Yes and let me explain why we are furious, precious. Thieves! Thieves! They have stolen it from us! Peter Jackson and his crew stole our enjoyment! That fat Hobbit! How could we enjoy anymore of a movie besides The Return of the King, my precious? The Return of the King is really awesome. It is even better than the precious, yes..yes.. better than the precious. We wants it! The story, the acting, the special effects, the cinematography.....They match perfectly to each other, precious. It is an excellent end of the trilogy. The Return of the King is so fantastic that we could not enjoy anymore of another movie. That is why we are furious, precious! If this movie does not get more Academy Awards than Ben Hur or Titanic than it is a shame to the world of cinema, my dear. 10/10
10.0~Absolutely amazing! party_boy75 Sign in Permalink This film has made a dent in cinema history. People have said it isn't able to do, people said that it was impossible, but these people were proved wrong by Mr Peter Jackson. I think this film is the best that I have ever seen. I first said that "The Two Towers" was, but this film ceases the first or second. The cinematography in this film is extremely graphical and the special effects are awesome. The music is enchanting and so extraordinary. The storyline is a tearjerker and is extremely moving. I would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it, but I would also advise you to see the first two because they are equally as god-smacking as this one is. People who say this movie is bad interpret the movie before they see it; they judge it by the length of the film and don't look at the layers of meaning that are within the movie. That is why the film is misunderstood by some people and I would recommend this. I purchased the extended version a couple of days ago and, even though it is 4 hours long, the length of it is not an issue and I could watch it over and over again. I hope that my review is helpful.
10.0~Move over George Lucas there is a new King of Movie Trilogies trainspotting Sign in Permalink After seeing the third Matrix and finding it very disappointing I was a little worried about the Return of the King. But I worry no more. The final chapter makes this the best movie trilogy of all time. Although all the movies stand on there own, the synergy of them all working as one cohesive picture is spectacular. This is the best movie of the year by far and is amazing as the concluding chapter. So many series fail by the final chapter such as Godfather 3 and Matrix Revolutions but this series just keeps getting better. I give this movie my highest recommendation.
10.0~Big Fan!!!!!!!!!!!! serisefaye88 Sign in Permalink Anyone who voted this below a 10 should die!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just kidding, I respect your opinion, but I definately don't agree with it! The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an epic adventure, full of battles, hardships, loss... The Return of the King is the end of the saga, and Peter Jackson did a magnificent job with it. He did a wonderful job capturing the essence of JRR Tolkien's masterpiece. The struggles of mankind, the doom that is fated to befall us, the hope we hold in friendship and love, good triumphing over evil... This movie (and the book) is the greatest thing ever! Plus, it has two HOT guys (Viggo Mortenson and Orlando Bloom!). Sorry, lapsing into giggly teenage girl mode there. But, unless you HATE fantasy (like my mother), you will ADORE this movie. Go watch it at least three times (like me)!!
9.0~I watch this on Christmas and my birthday, scottgmathews Sign in Permalink I was so excited when this movie came out that I lived in a hammock for 15 days. I waited and waited and then I watched it and then I got the DVD and then I got the extended DVD and then I went to New Zealand on a Hobbit's tour which only cost me eight thousand two hundred dollars. I jumped off a bridge with the bungie string and I yelled, "Frodo lives!" and that was the best part of New Zealand. When I got home I played Dungeons and Dragons (I was Frodo) for another fifteen days and then I wrote my letter to Mr. Jackson asking if I could be Bard in the next movie. And I ordered my copy of my one ring (tm) with my certificate from the excellent customers at Franklin Mint.
10.0~Quick Reviews!! malkane316 Sign in Permalink The groundbreaking trilogy comes to a deservedly spectacular and breathtaking end as each character fulfils their individual destinies. The film starts with a flashback of Gollum's life- we see how he first came across the One Ring, murdering his friend, instantly captivated by its power. Eventually he becomes more deformed and monstrous, like Emperor Palpatine as the evil takes control of his being. Eventually he loses it, and immediately begins his search to reclaim his precious. Then we are pulled back into the present. Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue on their way to Mordor with Sam growing more and more suspicious of the creature, and Frodo becoming increasingly weary of his task. Gollum is of course leading them towards Shelob, a giant spider so that they will be killed and he can take the Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman has been defeated, and Gandalf meets up once again with Merry and Pip after their successful battles. However, those were tiny compared to what must come. Sauran's massive armies are heading for Gondor to destroy mankind, and Gandalf must try to convince Denethor to fight. He however is stubborn and mourns Boromir, turning his love away from Faramir. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli make their way with all of Rohan to try to support Gondor, recruiting all the warriors they can. Theoden will not help until Denethor calls him. The 3 friends travel into the darkness to summon an army of the dead who will only follow the rightful King of Gondor- Aragorn. The war begins, and hopefully the 2 hobbits can make to Mount Doom, avoiding Gollum's treachery and Sauron's minions, and destroy the Ring. But Frodo is losing his grasp on reality and Shelob is waiting. The battle scenes here are the most epic, best filmed, and exciting ever created, the effects remain stunning, and everything is as beautiful or horrible as always, depending on the place. The performances again are flawless, from the old and new characters, and the dialogue is full of quotable and inspiring lines. We now feel part of the actions of all the characters, exhausted by the travelling and feel a sense of fulfilment when Frodo reaches Doom. Everything finishes the way it should, and although there are some differences from the books, they do not matter. The final scenes in Gondor, of the King and everyone else bowing to the hobbits is heart-wrenching but not sentimental, and one of the best scenes in the trilogy. There is sadness, humour, fear and of course action, and it is all directed with a love and attention which is rarely seen. Every single person who worked on the films should be commended. It deservedly sweeped the Oscars like the other two should have done, and it is unlikely we will see a better series of epics again, until someone decides to do The Illiad, Aeneid and Odyssey properly. Perhaps those would be too great a task. We are left with the best films of our time and could not ask for anything more. Maybe a few zombies. 10 out of 10
10.0~Still can not believe this elayzer_gs Sign in Permalink It's the best trilogy of all the time movie history. Created another age for industry and nothing similar got close to this trilogy. Amazing and causes problems when you watch good films after it. When you watch really good fantastic/action movie, you can't still compare it with any of the movies in this trilogy. Everybody has expected something good after this trilogy but none has arrived. This is the perfection of movie history for a long time. It really makes me think what is wrong nowadays. Maybe we should stop technology addiction and focus on creativity as it was in the begining of 2000s.
10.0~Move over Star Wars The Lord of the Rings is here to stay! CyR4X Sign in Permalink I've waited so very long to see what would become of Frodo, Sam and the rest of the Fellowship and had always hoped that the final part of the trilogy would be everything it could be and everything I wanted it to be ... I'm so very glad that it is. Return of the King was a joy to watch from start to finish and has ended what I believe to be the best film trilogy ever to grace the silver screen and will be for decades to come. Well done Peter, that Oscar is yours!
9.0~Not a bad movie, but not as good as the other two Nick-290 Sign in Permalink I read LOTR for the first time about 25 years ago, at a time when you had to look for the book in the darkest corner of your local bookstore. It was a time when reading SF or Fantasy resulted in funny looks from your pals, and raised eyebrows from your teachers. Now Peter Jackson turned this book into a mass phenomenon, and it is suddenly very trendy to out yourself as a LOTR fan. I have watched the directors cut of the first two parts at least ten times on DVD. Both extended versions are very good, and I do not know which one to prefer. My expectations for the third part were of course very high. After all, Peter Jackson liked it best, so it should be the best part of the trilogy. However, I do not think it is better than the first two parts. It is certainly a very good movie, but there are parts, which I did not like. This review contains spoilers, is more a nit picker's comment, and may also not be very helpful for people without a certain background knowledge of the books of Tolkien. 1. Intro: Each of the three parts starts with an intro. In the first we see and here the background story on the war against Sauron with Gil Galad and Elendil. Brilliant. In the second, we see Gandalfs fight with the Balrog to a wonderful soundtrack. Brilliant. And in the third? Smeagols transformation into Gollum, mainly pretty disgusting...and not necessary for the understanding of the plot (we heard all about that already in the second part). Also, I found the acting not convincing. All together a week start, and not in the same league as the first parts. 2. Isengard scene: Where was Saruman? What was that scene for? Just for Pippin to find the Palanthir in the muck? I surely hope that we get to see more on the DVD. 3. To much of weary, dirty hobbits in the mud. The pacing is pretty slow, Gollum's schizophrenia was well established in part II. Not necessary for the plot and the movie. 4. Arwen: My most loathed character of all three movies. Named third in the credits for a few unnecessary scenes. She acts like a young American girl (what she is) and not like a three thousand year old grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-aunt of Aragorn. What a difference in the few scenes we see with Galadriel! 5. Aragorn: The title is the Return of the king. However, Aragorn does not get much to play this role. In the book, he challenges Sauron in the Palanthir and announces his return, whilst in the movie, he can barely hold the thing, and gets unconscious looking at it. I look forward to the DVD to hear Jacksons explanation of this unnecessary change. Also the path of the death story line is not convincing. If you read this in the book, it has a different flavour to it. The Death never fought in Minas Tirith, but for the movie it may have been useful, since it allowed to clean Minas Tirith of Orcs within a few seconds (Orcs, who had no business being there in the first place!). The unforgivable omission in Aragorn's character is that they did not show him as a healer. The Hands of the King are the Hands of a Healer. This is one of the most important parts of the third book, because it establishes Aragorn's right to the throne of Gondor, and gives him almost God like powers. To leave that out whilst wasting so much time on other redundant parts is very sad. 6. Battle scenes: I must admit that the attack of the Rohirim is one of the best scenes in all three movies. (and Theoden a much better king than Aragorn, it was the other way round in the Two Towers! So Aragorn did not develop whilst Theoden did). But there is too much fighting. Too many lovely details of Orc gimmicks. From a story tellers point of few, the siege of Minas Tirith (saved by the cavalry!) is a larger copy of the siege of Helm's deep (saved by...the cavalry). In the book, the focus is not so much on this battle. It is a small part of the Return of the King (albeit a highlight), but in the movie, the battle seems to never end, the Orcs conquer almost the entire city (they do not even enter in the book), and Gandalf has lost his superior, god like powers of the book (after all, he is a Maiar, a sort of lesser angel), except in his lonely charge to help the returning Faramir. 7. Denethor: What a caricature of the figure in the book! The steward is portrayed as a Shakespearean Richard III type villain, who is totally mad. Nobody bothers to explain, that he is fighting with Sauron in his personal Palanthir (just to have the power to look into such a thing repeatedly and NOT betray his people is something in his favour...) 8. The fight with the Witch king: Very good movie adaptation, but still one of Tolkien's inconclusive scenes. At Amon Sul in the first movie, Aragorn chases away the witch king and four other wraiths with a burning stick and a lesser sword (although the ONE Ring was within inches of their grasp!). On the Pellenor field, the same Witch King is almost as powerful as Sauron himself, and no man can kill or defeat him. Why and where has he gained so much power? 9. In the trailer we see Theoden knighting Merry on the top of Edoras. Did I miss this in the movie? 10. Shelop's Lair. All together a very good adaptation, three nit picking comments: Shelop smells strongly in the book, so it is unlikely she could sneak up on Frodo like in the movie. In the movie she stings him in the chest or back (clearly in the middle of his body). But there he should be protected by his Mithril chain mail! Also, Sam could not get the ring out without destroying the cocoon. 11. Finally, why on Middle earth did they not use the eagles in the first place for this quest? I am sure Gwaihir, or what his name is, would be understanding enough to fly Frodo from Rivendell to Mordor, if this would save Middle Earth. But this is of course a question, I should have asked Tolkien 25 years ago... Bottom line: I will wait eagerly for the extended DVD. Hopefully (as before with Lorien in part I and Treebeard in part II), this will add the much needed depths to the movie.
10.0~ran out of tissues halfway thru...argh!!! mrsleannemarsters Sign in Permalink of all the three films this is the best! its the one we'v been waiting for 4 years to see, and it definitely lived up to the hype. only one problem...is peter jackson trying to give us all emotional breakdowns??!!! there isn't any point in the movie, after bill (i mean pip!) and the palantir, that i didn't cry at. that DVD is gonna be well-used! extra-special moment - pip singing over the gondorian troops going back to osgiliath - that bit totally cemented my belief that mr j is a genius! star of the show - so hard too pick - was sean astin, heart-breaking stuff! (i can't carry it for you, but i can carry you - sob!) oh, and the merry and pip bits are so sweet, especially for the big fans who know how close those gorgeous men are in real life! overall, a heartbreaker, but the perfect ending for the greatest trilogy since star wars - you know what, its even better than that!
3.0~Tolkien is rolling over in his grave... jer-7 Sign in Permalink Well, the movie started off pretty slow. The middle was pretty slow. And the end was well... slow. There was not a single moment out of the entire three and a half hours that I felt any tension (except for the encounter with Shelob, but that's only because I'm terrified of spiders...) The seige of Minas Tirith reminded me of the battle of Hoth, but not nearly as dramatic. Jackson's device to build emotions is to have the characters stare at each other for a long period of time, sometimes in slow motion. In the end, it seems to me that there were different people that worked on each of the three films. I thoroughly enjoyed the Fellowship of the Ring. It had everything - two battles in which you actually cared about the characters. With the extended DVD there was great character development. And there was a comedic value. The last two films have had none of the above. I can only say that I am glad the movie was made as some of the technical achievements during the filming are amazing. But that's it.
10.0~Magnificent spatula Sign in Permalink There aren't many words that can describe this trilogy. It's sublime. Especially the Return to the King. I don't think I have ever seen any movie this good before. My hat goes off to Peter Jackson. The way he has translated the books to the screen is unprecedented. Marvelous. Christmas is not going to be the same anymore. There is no LotR movie to wait for. Thank you to everyone who has participated in this magnificent piece of work. This gets at 10/10 rating. (if I could go higher, I would)
1.0~They saved the best for the last princeirfan-76705 Sign in Permalink Obviously i am aware of the fact that the lord of the rings trilogy is a movie but since it was released in parts that's how i am judging the way of king is the final chapter and since it is not but it is in some ways so i am just saying that its about time to be aware of the movie or not but since it was the last chapter and since it is the climax and resolution of the movie which has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installment thankyou
10.0~Perfect Ending to a Perfect Trilogy poprocksfizzle19 Sign in Permalink First of all, the filmmakers must be commended for attempting the mighty feat of adapting Tolkien's epic masterpiece, especially in a country that was not known for it's films and was considered second rate. The visuals are stunning, the writing is done with special care and professionalism to capture the essence of Tolkien's words, the acting is world class (props to Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee and Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol for carrying this film), the cinematography is beautiful, the score is one of the best of all time, and the directing is next-level that filmmakers of today, like Neil Blomkamp, have built their own style upon. Sure there may be a few too many endings and there's no "Scouring of the Shire" and a few characters die in ways that aren't in the books and some things happen happen out of sequence, but this movie is greater than 99% of the films that get made and it was made 13 years ago.
9.0~Too Long danielrudy-33109 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is Good but Too Long...
10.0~Brilliantly moving RogueBelle Sign in Permalink I thought the movie was masterful. I'll grant that it was long -- very long -- and the ending (multiple endings, really) dragged a bit, but overall, it was captivating and beautiful. The best word is "powerful." Not only are the battle scenes exciting and terrible, but the emotional involvement with the characters evokes strong responses in the audience. There were many times I wept for them, or wanted to leap up and cheer for them. I really do think that this movie did the books justice. Things were changed and cut, yes, but that was to be expected. Things change in adaptation, but in RotK, they were changed so that the movie was better for it. Astounding. Absolutely fabulous.
10.0~Best movie ever mach-5 Sign in Permalink After watching the Two Towers on the big screen, I was very worried that Peter Jackson would not be able to top the masterpeice that he had created. After six min into the Return... I knew that this was the masterpeice. The film does not out shine the two films that can before it, but makes the end jouney a event that could not happen with the first two film being as great as they are. The Return Of The King the perfect end to the trilogy, as it fantastic and moving and complement to the whole that is the Lord Of the Rings.
9.0~Not quite a 10 CitizenCairParavel Sign in Permalink Loved the trilogy. Only reasons I didn't give it a 10 was that 1. there were too many "he's dead" but NOT dead episodes in the trilogy and 2. They should have cast somebody other than Viggo for Aragorn and Hugo for Elrond. Viggo too new agish for Aragorn. Elrond much stronger and noble.
9.0~An epic ending to the trilogy!... cat_ranchero Sign in Permalink The book could very easily have been made into two films; there is such a lot that happens and so many twists in the plot that it might have benefited if that were the case. But we're not here to speculate I guess; although it does depart from the book in many respects, I did find that most of the important bases were covered. A film which has some tremendous scenes of epic battles but also some very tender and thought-provoking moments as well. For me the most powerful scene was where Denethor has sent his son, Faramir, to his doom and is eating a meal while Pippin sings a haunting ballad. The intercutting of the images of battle with Denethor and Pippin safe in Minas Tirith and the haunting melody over the top makes for a scene that has stayed with me since I first saw it back in 2003. I did find it did tend to drag a bit towards the end, but other than that a very fine film that is a fitting end to a great trilogy. SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My score: 9.4/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.
10.0~TRILOGY lukasgino Sign in Permalink This trilogy is everything, it's the beginning to all sci-fi movies. It has it all, friendship, love, family, comedy, adventure. I think it's something everyone can relate to.
9.0~Altogether, a beautiful set of movies. sbigliardi Sign in Permalink Never much of a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's books, I put off seeing the first installment of this trilogy until it hit the cheap theater. The absolute mastery of these movies, however, has led me to stand in line on opening night ever since. There were a few rough points in this movie that were not found in The Two Towers or The Fellowship of the Ring that I feel must have been caused by editing (which is somewhat unavoidable in such a long movie), and in a few cases some awkward dialogue, but overall this movie was excellent and kept a sold-out theater quiet and riveted to the screen for almost three and a half hours. The only complaint I heard voiced, other than the observation that with this movie the trilogy ends, was by someone who had failed to see the first two movies and did not understand what was going on, so I seriously recommend viewing the other films before going to see The Return of the King. Altogether, you won't be disappointed.
8.0~Perhaps, in time... moviejam Sign in Permalink Saw this yesterday and it's big big big! For my money though, not as engaging story-wise as the Fellowship but more spectacular than both the previous films put together. It is possible that it is simply too long for one sitting. There is so much going on that another viewing is essential, possibly another few viewings. One can't help but feel that perhaps, in time, and after the extended cut is released on DVD, that the trilogy will be seen more as a cohesive whole rather than 3 films. It is hard to judge this film (essentially incomplete in theaters) on its own. It is however, head and shoulders above anything else released this year and is truly a magical movie experience. Not many of those experiences left these days.
8.0~a great job, but a little too pathetic matissek Sign in Permalink Fascinated by the first two movies of LotR, it was expectable that its last part would combine tension, climax and great technical performance like hardly any film before. It was simply a highlight of everything what made the two movies before so adorable, and it is a worthy finishing for this great myth. I'm sure Tolkien himself would have been proud of this breathtaking visualization of his epos. After seeing the Two Towers, I was wondering if the astonishing mass of special effects and cd-animated could be topped; it could, in a very brave way. The movie is a masterpiece. Sean Astin, Ian McKellen Miranda Otto and Bernhard Hill perform simply great, the parallel strings of the story are conducted in a furious final showdown when sauron is in defeat. Despite a very subtile and complex plot, Director Peter Jackson never leaves his audience back feeling confused or overload. The only thing about this movie what is a little annoying are the various pathetic and exaggerated scenes, eg in the battle on Minas Thirit, when you hear Pippin sing a melancholic folk tune from the Shire while you watch Frodo and Sam crying. And the closing scene, which could have been shortened for 10 minutes without any impact, was also kind of boring. nevertheless - a must! movie. 8/10
10.0~Best movie i have ever seen... ozkeceli Sign in Permalink I was, am and will always be a fan of Lord of The Rings... I have never seen such an excellent movie before... i read the books several times, i had created the images in my mind. when i saw the movie, i realised that the images in my mind and the images of peter jackson were quite the same... Thank you Peter Jackson for giving us such a chef-d'oeuvre... The success of this movie will be permanent, i am sure... With my roommate, we have seen the movie 2 times in 2 days... we are planning to see it once more before he goes to Finland as an exchange student... I really envie him 'cause he will be able to see the elven girls there:)))If i was given a chance to go to New Zealand and live there, i would take my tent with me and start to live where the Rohan is situated... I would ask for no more things but such a life... I can say that i am living in the middle-earth since the beginning of this journey and now, i am really a part of it...
10.0~Truly Epic, beyond the pale of cinematic critique stevetseitz Sign in Permalink Wonderful, awe-inspiring, totally engrossing and beautiful are the adjectives I use to describe "Return of the King". See it as soon as possible. If you haven't seen the first two installments it's time to depose that tyrannical dictator you are living under. SPOILERS Seeing the orcs catapult heads over the walls of Minas Tirith truly warmed my heart.
10.0~Hard to believe it is over dollynz Sign in Permalink I saw Lord of the Rings: Return of the King last night. What a stunning achievement - I could not write this review immediately after seeing it, I could not find the words. All I can say to those of you who have not yet seen it, is go quickly! I have read a few slightly negative comments regarding the end of the movie - I will not spoil it for anyone, but I felt the ending was completely appropriate and very moving. It was very much in keeping with the novel, and also with the investment in these characters that the moviemakers and the audience have made over these three films.
5.0~Visuals, yes. Almost nothing more. mucronate Sign in Permalink This review may contain minor spoilers. There is almost no use in viewing a movie, and merely minutes or hours afterwards rate what one have seen. It is easy to be affected by the first visual impact, and forget much else. When we rate a movie we do not only rate this visual impact, but also story, development, scenery, emotion, cinematography, effects, acting, and lots of other parameters. There has now been some time for me to ponder about my opinion on this movie, and compare it to other movies. I am very picky about them. In this review I will try to explain why this movie falls short, as does many other movies in the same category, and also explain why less is more. The third installment of The Lords of the Ring, called The Return of the King, is the last movie in a trilogy, based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien. Now, I would prefer to call this a movie based on characters created by Tolkien, because in an adaption of a book, no changes in story can really be made. As another reviewer put it, a director can choose freely in filming parts of a work by Shakespear, but it would be absolutely out of the question for the director to add scenes or change the story to his own liking. Could anyone imagine MacBeth being proclaimed the King of Ireland, and not order the killing of his best friend, just because a director thought it would be a tad nicer? Peter Jackson though, seem to have no problem in doing just that with the works of Tolkien. Less is more. In The Return of the King, we are constantly being shown the obvious, in excess. Nothing is really left for the viewer to imagine for himself. The fall of evil (which by the way is a character we know almost nothing about) and the dark powers are shown with the explosion of a volcano, the crumbling of a tower and the utter cave-in of an entire domain. All this is obviously to state the already obvious - evil has fallen. Nothing is left for the viewers own imagination. I believe this is the real shortcoming of computer graphics. Since everything is possible to visualise, that is what is done. Back in the old days filmmakers had to rely on imagination, invention, and mere camerawork to create suspense. Nowadays we get all the readymade visuals rubbed in our faces. In great detail. One does no longer need imagination when going to the huge budget movies. The acting is also one-, or at best, two-dimensional. The acting and actors are, in many cases, only used to make simple statements about the story. Everything is telegraphed in advance, from "this is an evil character", to "I am in doubt", and "He is brave". In clean-cut, simple storylines, there are simply no room for surprises. Even the good versus evil is reduced to good characters only doing good things, and evil characters evil things. In that way the viewer never have to think for himself. One never have to ponder the question "What is this persons true intentions?". I find this over-simplification of characters and acting dull. In The Return of the King, there are plenty of it. Direction in this movie overuse slowmotion, close-ups, and special effects. One could liken this to a chef building towers of beautiful decorations and details on a dinner plate, but forgetting about the overall taste of the food. Many times, the most delicious and inspiring plate is the one with only a few ingredients, but cooked and served with care and skill. This is what differs Peter Jackson from great directors such as Fellini or Tornatore. Less is more. The music score is also a disappointment. If one wants to create epic adventure movies, the music score is very important. In this case Return of the King falls short of movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones where anyone can remember and even whistle the scores by heart, or the achievements and contributions to movies of composers like Ennio Morricone. They are great examples of when emotion is picked up and carried by the music. Even now, I cannot remember a single melody from The Return of the King. The music was drowned out by the overly use of special effects. Last time I saw this happen it was in the Matrix movies. To come to a conclusion about this movie, it would be that it is a great movie in special effects and grand scenery, but apart from that it is like going to the nearest fast food restaurant to get ones belly stuffed. The only scene that really stuck with me was the lone song in the great hall while the riders set out to their doom. Actually it was the only true scene I can remember where some was left for the viewers own imagination. A big budget and special effects does not automatically make a good movie.
10.0~Greatest Story on Film? sgjacob Sign in Permalink I haven't been to a movie twice the past twenty years. The first time I watched the Return of the King, it inspired me to watch the earlier extended editions on video. I also got caught up in the Middle Earth fantasy. By the way, the encyclopedia of Arda on the web is a fascinating site for those who haven't read Tolkien's books. Then I went to see the Return of the King again. I might see it again in a week or two- it will surely be around. I also want to comment on some who say that the Star Wars series was far superior. Of course Star Wars was great, but it does not have the gravitas of the LOTR. The key of LOTR is that it is based on a wonderful piece of literature already written. Very little needs to be conjured up as you go along (i.e; Star Wars). The only thing going for Star Wars would be the score...
10.0~Can anything else be called "Best Picture?" bruce-149 Sign in Permalink I laughed, I cried, I never wanted it to end. After spending what might have been the last 30 minutes of the film nearly racked with sobs, sitting through the entire final credit sequence, and wondering what I was supposed to do next, I decided I had to leave the pages of the book that I just saw and face the world again. It was not easy. There are many scenes in this film that I forgot to breath. I remember exhaling on more than one occasion, as I was held breathless by the images that I had witnessed. I'll tell you something though...nothing is perfect. There were some scenes which I felt were actually lacking (in my desires for things to be "by the book") in places. I thought it started slow, and the opening sequence, while good, felt out of place. It needed to be somewhere, I'm just not sure where. In the battle with Shelob, I never felt what it was to be faced with that light, as she was. Or to have felt the Sting. However, just how do you convey the emotion of a giant ancient spider? I don't care. It's the Best Picture. The Best Trilogy. A Towering Achievement. Can anything else done on screen compare, in our lifetimes? I wish I could have been lucky enough to be more than just a part of the audience.
7.0~Oh for God's Sake, End Already! evanston_dad Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is a monumental achievement, I won't argue with that. The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration. But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there. After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough. I think it says something about your endeavor when the most interesting character in the film is the one who's computer animated. The person who really deserves the most credit for this trilogy is its editor(s), who had to take god knows how many hours of footage and shape it into something resembling a movie. Grade: B
6.0~Too Damn Long RedStarGuard Sign in Permalink It was an amazing movie, but it was a book. It can not be judged against other great movies. Star Wars, Matrix, and Indiana Jones are better trilogies because they were original. Peter Jackson isn't a god and this movie wasn't that powerful. It merely destroys the book for millions. I cant read the book without having my own imagination take place anymore. I think of each character as what i see in the movie. Its no longer a movie based on a book, but a book based on the movie. THe magic of reading this timeless classic is lost. I read the first 2 before the movies came out. I never finished the 3rd because it lost all magic.
10.0~Final installment a 10 Sarie26 Sign in Permalink I suppose I'd better preface this by saying that, in my opinion, The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best ever made (yes, better than The Godfather or Star Wars) and the three films as a whole combine to be what is probably one of the top ten movies of all time. And Peter Jackson is a god. That being said, I was fully satisfied with the third installment of this brilliant trilogy. I cried not only with emotion brought on by the many beautiful endings of the film, but just because the movie was over at all. No more Lord of the Rings to look forward to every year. *Sigh* Moviegoing will never be the same - at least, not for a long time. Peter Jackson has, visually and cinematically, outdone himself. ROTK is the biggest and grandest film of the three, with beautiful cinematography and seamless special effects. You can totally suspend disbelief and believe that these armies are really that big, that these fantastical creatures were once real, even that the dead people inside the mountain, in all their green-glowing glory, were real. Bravo. This movie had spectacle that surpassed any other film I've ever seen, and yes, even The Two Towers. Bravo, I say! The actors. Could Peter Jackson have chosen a more perfect cast? Viggo Mortensen continues to be perfect as the rugged, determined Aragorn who has finally taken the full weight of his destiny upon his shoulders and is ready to claim the throne of Gondor. The man, quite simply, rocks. Ian McKellen is totally bad-ass as Gandalf, and in this movie he does the most fighting and ass-kicking of the three, and to a T, I might add. You've never seen a staff put to better use. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan were brilliant as Pippin and Merry, still bringing us some comic relief but moreover showing us new facets of the hobbits' personalities. There are some very, very touching scenes with Billy Boyd, which were wonderful, especially when he sings - beautiful little voice on that one. And Dominic Monaghan has a wonderful moment with Eowyn, kicking some serious Middle Earth buttocks. Eowyn (Miranda Otto) is completely cool in this film too. We finally get to see her take up the sword and save the day a little, which, as she promised in The Two Towers, is something she completely rocked at. Legolas and Gimli continued to rock the bow, arrow, sword and axe, and provided more cheers and grins. The new characters (Denethor, mainly) and returning scenes with Faramir were fantastic and welcome. And what to say about Elijah Wood and Sean Astin? They were perfect. Both of them. Their scenes with each other and the stunning, creepy and tragic Gollum are absolutely perfect. I could rave about this movie forever. Lots of people bitched about it being too long, about there being too many endings. Shut up, I say, because Pete did the best he could have with the ending, which in the book went on far, far longer, and he paid wonderful farewell tributes to each character - in fact, I would have even liked to see more. All in all...I love this movie. I am so glad that it won the Best Picture Oscar, along with the other 10, and DEFINITELY that Pete won Best Director. I feel that it completely deserved the awards, it was the best film of the year, even if you don't like the movie you can't tell me that any other film achieved as much as well. Stunning filmmaking that will live on in history. 10/10
10.0~Fabulous! moore031 Sign in Permalink The glowing reviews this movie has received are well deserved. I had been worried about seeing it because of how much Peter Jackson re-wrote "Two Towers" and presented scenes that undermined some of Tolkien's fundamental ideas. This time, Jackson followed Tolkien more closely and the worst that can be claimed are sins of omission. It's a real shame we didn't get to see Christopher Lee in this move; he totally rocked in the previous films. Telling us to wait for the "extended" version isn't right. Maybe Jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in ROTK to give Lee some film time. That said, all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. The one new thing that I would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great Tolkien artists Alan Lee and John Howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of FOTR to the final scenes of ROTK. This historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. The LOTR enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years, and this final installment is a crowning achievement.
6.0~An Orgy of Ugliness, Death, and Destruction fha-2 Sign in Permalink As you can no doubt surmise, I was not very taken with the (hopefully) last of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy. Although I was extremely impressed with the special effects, the story itself was as tedious as reading the book. I wasn't terribly impressed with the idea of the diminutive Hobbit heroes, Frodo (Elijah Wood), a sweet, gentle dwarf and his flabby sidekick Sam (Sean Astin), from some yah-yah land called Hobbiton, traipsing across the geography while risking life and limb so that he could ultimately drop an evil ring into an erupting volcano while wholesale death and destruction rage on nearby. It seems that the film was primarily interested in exposing the violence-hungry audiences of the world with as much death, suffering, ugliness, and gore as they could cram into their painfully long (3 ½ hours) cinematic colossus. It is easy to cheer the slaughter of the adversaries since most of them were masterpieces of ugliness, decay, and disease. Some of the evil crowd depicted an orthodontist's fantasy come true with teeming examples of really bad dental decay and deformity exploited at every opportunity. To compound the repulsiveness, director Peter Jackson must have scoured the dermatology handbook for examples to create puffed out, discolored, and distorted skin tissue; lesions, cancerous oozings, and other disgusting aberrations. Of course, there were also the obligatory humpbacks or other physical anomalies to add to your visual distress so that when the heroic saviors sliced and diced them by hundreds you would not feel so bad. One cannot help but admire Gandolf (Ian McKellen), the wise wizard with his flowing white beard. He is not only all knowing, omnipotent, and full of convenient magic when it suits him, but for a guy in his sixties he rides like a cowboy stuntman and brandishes his sword in battle like a twenty-something. Since this is all a fantasy, why not do something far-fetched now and then? The good guys in this piece of prolonged carnage are extra nice and the female love objects like Arwen (Liv Taylor), are truly heavenly to look at. Frodo and Sam look like they would be terrified to walk around in downtown Carmel, let alone to take on the hideous lineup that seem to lurk behind every bush. Why they put up with the whims of the numskulls who insist on slaughtering the entire leper colony entourage is beyond my comprehension. If you see this movie just to enjoy the special effects, it is well worth the price of admission. However, if you want to see a good film, well that is another matter entirely. If you enjoy lots of blood and destruction, this piece is for you. There is enough carnage in this flick to make war films like `Saving Private Ryan' or `War and Piece' seem like a walk in the park. It is one helluva commentary on the American public who seem to enjoy a lot more violence than they are willing to admit. It is hardly a wonder that Americans so easily rallied to Bush's deceptive war cries when the Nation ostensibly professes to be such a peace-loving people.
10.0~One Movie To Rule Them All Spelmat Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is my favorite movie. It concludes a marvelous trilogy directed by the genie Peter Jackson ! This last opus has absolutely everything a spectator can dream of: incredible special effects that even in 50 years won't seem outdated, actors that believe in the story they are telling us (if you check the DVD's bonus, you'll see how all actors were deeply attached to their characters), music that will lift you up to the clouds, a story certainly inspired by Tolkien's Books, but still really catchy (but in another hand, Jackson edited the books to make movies even more interesting) and I could go on and on and on ... Congratulations to all the ones that have contributed to the making of this film !
10.0~What a wonderful end ambermoreywu Sign in Permalink It is rare that any filmmaker can sustain a great story over three movies, no matter how good the original source material. Peter Jackson succeeds. This final movie paces well, binds the separate plotlines together skillfully and ultimately satisfies you at the end. There are several "corny" one liners - but they are delivered so well that they fit the story and you don't care. I was worried that the battles would be too drawn out, but they are just right. The love triangle is the weakest part of the movie, but doesn't really detract, just isn't handled as well as it could be. I saw the first showing at midday Wednesday, and now one day later, I already want to see the movie again. Run, don't walk to the cinema to see this epic in its widescreen glory.
9.0~Best trilogy ever sharjeelahmed07 Sign in Permalink This has to be the best trilogy ever. Although there have been other amazing trilogies, such as The Godfather, Star Wars and the Batman films, I don't think any of them are as good as the Lord of the Rings. Its a must watch for anyone! The graphics are still very good and Peter Jackson has used a variety of film angles to really entice the audience. It most definitely deserved the many rewards it achieved. I recommend anyone who decides to watch the film, to watch it in chronological order. The first film, Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, introduces the story, the characters, and the situation. It also provides an understanding to the what the ring does, and why its so powerful The second film, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, allows the audience to understand the adventure while also allowing the audience to follow and root for certain characters. the introduction of new characters provides a more detailed analysis of the situation. This film summarised the story with a very interesting ending. This is a highly recommended film and I encourage everyone to watch it.
10.0~Ten years later still the greatest movie of all time lx-sosna Sign in Permalink I'd give this movie an 11 if it were possible. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King lives up to its extremely long title. Its a LONG movie. Once you've seen the extended edition, there's no going back. Many key scenes were cut from the film. Even today, the special effect hold up better than many halfassed films on the market. Epic is the one word to define this franchise. For long I have debated whether the second or the third film is the best. I can't decide. The music is beyond words. Howard Shore has crafted one of the best original scores ever, up there next to Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings shows Hollywood how battle scenes are done. If you've never seen this, die in a hole. Long live the King.
10.0~That feeling, you know... Broslet Sign in Permalink One can always discuss the details of a certain movie... was the effects flawless? Were the actors good enough? Was the movie too long? Too Short...? Discussions like that about "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" will undoubtedly be numerous in the time to come. Was the ending correct enough? Was the score fitting...? When I saw this movie at the opening night, in a small theater on the windblown heaths of Denmark, thoughts like that buzzed through my head. And the lack of sophisticated 3D sound equipment and the too small screen, hightened my critical sense somewhat more. And yet, after having dropped my popcorn twice, ungripping fists I didn't know was clenched at least five times, wiping my eyes more times that a grown man wishes to admit and forgot to breath more times than I can remember, all those thoughts were made to shame. This is one of those few films that makes critical views obsolete. once that feeling, you know, gets to you, you know there is no reason to logicalize. This is a movie experience of the rare kind, the kind you feel grips you all the way back to the mythical subconsciousness of us all. An epos that makes petty thoughts on details reasonless. Long live the King!
1.0~Not the strongest of the trilogy! fifi_fox666 Sign in Permalink Not the strongest of the trilogy! A lengthy, drawn-out "conclusion." It lacks the heart of the previous two, and lapses on awkwardly with trivial and extraneous characters while he focus obviously should have been elsewhere. I especially despised that tacky "girlpower" bit. Just goes to show, directors actually CAN drag out irrelevant tacked-on plot pieces, and the ignorant hordes call it EPIC because, hey, it's really long!You can pee 3 times , get popcorn and soda refills,answer your pager,and not miss anything. Most of the dialog is redundant expectancies of ...the end! It's got to end, right? However tediously! And it is tedious! With proper editing, this movie could have been condensed into an hour. But...Guess WHAT? The whole trilogy's been padded so extensively for length so you can pay to see 3, not just 2 films...it's most obvious in this one. Wow. This passes for classic?
10.0~WOW...What a GREAT movie! rudy1989 Sign in Permalink WOW! What can I say? I just saw this movie today (5 hours ago to be exact) and I'm still tingling! ***WARNING SOME SPOILERS MAY BE CONTAINED*** Where to start??? Well....the acting was brilliant (of course)>>> Not that it really matters but I thought Viggo Mortensen did a superb job of portraying Aragorn - in all 3 films, but this one epecially - But I do suppose I'm a bit partial to him seeing as how he's my favorite character.... Sean Astin and Elijah Wood did an excellent job conveying the emotional aspects of their characters and everything they went through... I suppose I should stop at that because ALL the performances in this film were great and I could go on and on about this topic forever and anon... But ANYWAYS... I think Peter Jackson did a great job with every aspect of creating this film, from the way he built up the scenes to the incredibly climactic ending when the ring was destroyed to paying attention to the smaller details and nuances that really give life to this film. Oh And... Special effects were way cool (but done in a way so that they didn't overpower the movie and pull your attention away from the characters.) Scenery was amazing (with New Zealand as a backdrop, how could you go wrong?) And last but certainly not least the THEMES... I think the 'Return of the King' had more prominent themes than The Fellowship and Two Towers had (not to say that they didn't.) I loved the whole 'Girl Power' theme with Eowyn: ...(to death eater) "I'm No Man!" ...I think the theme of friendship was evermore impressive and inspiring in ROTK...I'm sure there are many more that have escaped my mind but ANYWAY... ************* To close, I think that this film will go down in cinematic history as one of (if not, THE) BEST films ever created... with its endearing characters, tear-jerking moments, beautiful scenery, incredible acting, bonds of friendship and loyalty, awe-inspiring themes, and, of course, heroes of all sizes and creeds, this film will be cherished(not to mention watched over and over again) by many generations to come... I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for good bit of entertainment. Hope you love it just as much as I have!!! PS: Going home one sore bottom is deffinitely worth it - with luck you'll take home a bit more than that from you journey to Middle Earth!
10.0~Uplifting, Heartrending, a Master Work dsf1224 Sign in Permalink I feel as though a significant portion of my life has ended. Long has it been since I first feasted my eyes on Peter Jackson's visually luscious adaptation of the `Lord of the Rings' novels. Back then I was a sophomore in high school, as green to life as I was to the literary prowess of J.R.R. Tolkien. Three years later, I'm a senior in high school, and just as green and naïve about life. However, my knowledge of Tolkien is another story. If the ultimate test of the potency of a piece of entertainment is by what degree it alters your life, then `The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, as a whole, is the most effective series of films I have ever watched. Since the release of 2001's `Fellowship of the Ring,' the first movie in the trilogy, I have spent three years reading, writing, and speaking Tolkien, becoming increasingly enamored by his passionate storytelling and mastery of language. And now, the journey has ended. With the debut of this season's `Return of the King,' director Peter Jackson has officially concluded his three film adaptation of the series in such a way as will be remembered for centuries to come. A common gripe concerning last year's `Two Towers,' the middle movie of the trilogy, is that the focus of the story shifts too far from Sam and Frodo. But in `Return of the King,' a film boasting twice as many CGI effects, battle sequences, and sweeping camera movements, Sam and Frodo steal the show. I never imagined I could feel so pure while crying in a theater. In retrospect, `Titanic,' the film I had always considered to be one of the biggest tear-jerkers in existence, feels so incredibly cheap. Sure, you're sad that Jack dies, and it's an easy emotion to convey due to the natural inclination of grief towards death. But shedding tears of joy - being moved, not by a cheap death, but by courage shown in the face of impregnable odds, by unwavering devotion to a friend in a time of need - now that is quite an experience. And when it's all over, you too feel exhausted. Indeed, as my close friend put it, simply viewing this film is a feat in its own right. It has the adventurous spirit of a David Lean flick, matched with the simplistic moral clarity of an Aesop fable, with a dash of old fashioned heroism. And perhaps I'm biased because fantasy is such a fresh idea in modern (meaning recent) cinema that it couldn't help but succeed. But I assure you, the success of this film and its predecessors comes solely from the respective literary and narrative genius of both J.R.R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson. Together, they have birthed a chapter in the history of film that inspires on all levels - a refreshingly optimistic statement about hope and the power of fellowship. `Return of the King' is a must see, and a must read.
10.0~The Yardstick to Measure the Depth of One's Heart jarzan2003 Sign in Permalink Tolkien, I believe, wrote the Lord of the Rings to bring shame to mankind. Lord of the Rings shows our world what true love and friendship is. When we see the sacrifices made, we can see that true heroism is motivated by a heart that is not self-serving but based on doing what is right and true for its own sake. LOTR displays man as being weak in heart and easily susceptible to corruption and selfishness. Just like our world. The love and friendship the Hobbits had towards each other and the world in which they live in was meant to bring shame towards our world. In Tolkien's eyes, our world was driven mad by technology and selfishness. (The Orcs) We live in a world that is somewhat similar to the world of Middle Earth. Our world is saturated by orcs! When one feels that the Hobbits in LOTR were displaying something homosexual in the end by hugging each other, its only because they themselves have never experienced that kind of love and close comradeship that the Hobbits had for one another. When it comes down to it, those of you that hated this movie, hates it because it is alien to your own heart. Those who have hearts that are steeped in selfishness, lust and corruption will hate this last installment to what can only be the greatest movie of all time. The Lord of the Rings is monumental in its achievement and importance in order to make all of us look towards ourselves and be ashamed that we live in a world that is so corrupt and self-seeking. "Its a Dog-eat-dog World" I sincerely wish that we lived in a world that had the same characteristics as middle earth minus the evil that was present. Sometimes we need fantasy to escape from the "reality" that our world is steeped in. Sometimes we need fantasy to wish for a world that is better than ours. It is why so many people need get drunk or get stoned. We need to escape from the reality that our world puts us in. Face it, our world has practically lost the meaning of what Love is. Or at the very least, love isn't practiced consistently anymore. Lust has replaced love for the majority of people today. And it takes a movie such as LOTR to show us an alien world that is better than ours in so many ways. If you have a heart, then this movie will lift yours to unprecedented heights. If you don't have a good heart, then this movie will probably gag you and seem boring and pointless. BTW, The eagles couldn't enter or even get close to Mordor while Sauron lived. Sauron's power was far too overwhelming for the eagles. Lord of the Rings will endure as long as there are people who have a heart that know what love is. Looking at our world, its seems that this may be a short stint in history. Kudos goes to Peter Jackson and everyone involved in bringing to the world something as wonderful as the Lord of the Rings. I am just glad to be alive to see these amazing trilogy of movies that have set a new standard in which movies must try to compete with. ROTK is in 3rd position on IMDb, but deserves to be Number 1. At least it is, in my heart.
10.0~The best movie of all time aminziaei Sign in Permalink You must have heard the name of the famous movies "The Lord Of The Rings'' Even if you have not been interested in movies so far.Three very successful movies and award winning-films including The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers , and The Return of the King are based on a novel which was written by Tolkien. The story takes place in a land called Middle-Earth and there are many magical characters in this land such as the wizard Gandolf, Hobbits, Orcs, Elves and so on. The leading role is a Hobbit called Frodo who has to save the world from great evil. I have been seen the movies more than fifth times. The Lord of the Rings is a phenomenon and it is an all-time classic, in my opinion. Although each of these three are fantastic, the third one called The Return Of The king is the climax and ending of the epic journey and it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments. As the point, it is not strange that the third one had a big box office success. In all of them, we have excellent special effects. I think it is not easy to show thousands of digital characters, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once with that time technology.so it seems that filming the lord of the rings was a turning point for following fiction movies and series like Game of Thrones. Peter Jackson, the director of these these movies, has chosen wisely the land of filming. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly, and came away giving a good picture of the characters. The Lord of the Rings unlike any kind of similar movies has happy ending. This is predictable by all religions about end of the world. I remember a Persian poem that I used to read when I was child which described devil literally as one-eye creature. What I am wanting to say is, there is undeniable link between one-eye tower and Djjal, The Dajjal is known as the one eyed Anti-Christ in Islam. He will appear during the end of times and cause havoc, he is literally the opposite of Jesus Christ, instead of bringing purity, he will spread negativity and be killed by Mahdi, promised man in Quran to rescue world in the end of the world. The appearance that Aragón has in the movies, is the same appearance that we have for Mahdi in Islam or Jesus Christ in Christianity. To cut the long story short, my words are short to describe all deep philosophical meanings in The Lord of The Rings. Overall, these are movies well- worth watching. You may not like some scary scenes in these movies but, please don't judge a book by its cover.
6.0~Wrung Maxcyjen Sign in Permalink You kind of have to take the movie on its own terms. It is what it is...long, confusing, battles that don't matter. On the other hand there are great characters, good acting, amazing effects, great direction (esp the spider sequences). The film just sort of is...it won't change the world, won't make sense if you have not seen the others, but it is an enjoyable way to kill an evening
10.0~Best Movie in a long time Crab_Nebula Sign in Permalink This was amazing. I'm trying to put it into words, here, and it's hard, so forgive me for excess adjectives. First of all, the visuals. The FX were great. Very smooth, very impressive, very realistic. Fantastic job there. The location was so amazing. One shot of riders across a field, with mountains in the distance... so amazing. The visuals alone were enough to make you breathless at times. The relationships between all the characters were so real. Even with such a huge cast, everyone still had their own, very definite character, and very clear relationships with everyone else. It was all subtle, yet understood, with an artistry that is rare, especially in big blockbusters like this one. The directing is superb, and while watching it, you are completely drawn in, you realize later that it's almost like a very long, action packed music video. Lots of gorgeous montages that are set to music, and despite little dialogue through these scenes, so much information is conveyed you don't notice the lack of dialogue. What speach there is is direct, to the point, witty, and important. Exchanges between Logolas and Gimli are always funny, and touching, tear-jerking, or just cute between Merry and Pippin, or Sam and Frodo. Legolas and Aragorn have a charged friendship, very powerful, and Ian McKellan's Gandalf is powerful, as always. If you were to see one movie all year, this would be it. If you were to see one movie your whole life, this would be it. Far from the Matrix's conclusional let-down, this was the best conclusion to a trilogy ever. Leaving you both victorious and grieving, satisfied and screaming, "NOOO!" at the same time, it's the best seven bucks I've spent possibly ever (soon to be fourteen, then twenty-one, then...). See it. Laugh. Cry. Shout. Rage. Find something deeper. This movie is just... you have to see it to worship it.
5.0~Thank Heavens It's Over. screenman Sign in Permalink After the first Ipcress-like mind-numbingly boring episode, aka 'The Fellowship', I swore I would never watch another. But them blighters on the telly tricked me. They caught me off-guard. So; to the exquisite delight of the late Mr Tolkien's rabid fan-club, I can confirm that the third instalment is just as good as the first. Which - to those of us who live in the real world instead of some hallucinogenic phantasmagoria of middle-earth - means it's as flatulent, turgid and boring as the master clearly intended it to be. Same Stuff, different movie. Endless partings, endless greetings, endless wars, long, lingering stares of defiance, dreading, dismay, what-the-hell. It uses-up celluloid; that's the main thing. And gives v-e-r-y shallow people with s-h-o-r-t attention spans, the impression that they are watching something truly e-p-i-c. Heavens-to-Betsy that final sequence must test the stamina of Gods. Will they get the ring up the hill to that erupting volcano? Will the goodies beat the baddies. Will rational viewers fall asleep before they find out? Now that's the real test and question. We hear a pre-battle speech so blatantly ripped-off from Shakespeare, that the Bard himself might rise-up and sue for plagiarism. We see those strange midgets endlessly climbing,climbing, climbing. How tired they are, how weary; I know just how they feel. The scene cuts and cuts again so much that I wonder if I'm not watching and mixing two separate movies. A big spider appears, but to no particular purpose than to fill-in yet another boring blank with bogus drama and hand-wringing anguish. But what's this? Halfway up the volcano there's a door! How very thoughtful of the special-effects department. Pity the budget didn't extend to an elevator. And curiously, despite the fact that lava is erupting several hundred feet above, when they walk inside, said lava is now sitting passively several hundred feet below. No explanation: non needed. The 'Tolkeens' will accept the anomaly without question. Surely the most preposterous anti-climax of all time is the scene in which the bald bug-eyed midget has jumped onto the invisible bug-eyed midget. We see this preposterous CGI performing a sort of airborne one-man-dance like Master Yoda orgasmically levitating in his underpants. May the farce be with you. It's the first truly entertaining scene I have witnessed in the whole cinematic tarpit, and it has me in stitches. What happens next? I lost track. The big eye-shaped thing at the top of the tower falls down because the tower collapses. Then the volcano erupts big-time. But, no worries. This is Tolkien. The good midgets are immortal. It simply offers prelude to yet another long, tearful anguish episode, followed by yet another long, tearful, and smiling re-union episode. The credits were still rolling even after I'd had my dinner. Joy to the many tragic, deluded fans. Thank heavens Sigourney Weaver isn't in it. It's over. We're done. It's safe to put the telly back on.
10.0~Best movie i ever seen KozmikDut Sign in Permalink I been watched lots, and lots of movies but still this movie series is my favorite. When this movies came out i was little kid. I watch them while i grow up over and over. This movie was my first time going to cinema. The cast is like my chilhood friends. I still when i had a breakdown in my life i open this movie and forget the world.This movie has my memories. I highly recommend it! This movie is brilliant as the scenes and how they succsessfully show us how story goes. And best war scenes ever! Only thing is i hate Frodo.
10.0~My Favorite Movie skemble10 Sign in Permalink This is my favorite movie of all time. It has stood the test of time (so far) and really stands out as one of the best fantasy films ever created. If you haven't seen this movie or the two preceding it, do yourself a favor, set some time aside to journey through them. They are well worth the time spent.
10.0~Holy Frigging Crap! Michael_John Sign in Permalink It's awesome. To those of you who haven't seen it on the first day yet, it's awesome. That's all I need to say. Well, maybe I would have liked to see Gandalf blow up something, but just for fun, not as part of the film. Wow.
9.0~Surprisingly good - Spoilers RMFendt Sign in Permalink After two high-quality movies, I feared the worst for this one. Being the conclusion of the series, it is perhaps the most difficult one to bring into the theater. My fears were unfounded, however: Jackson did a good job. Camera work is excellent, effects range from good to stunning-- and the narration also survives. If you accept that it is simply impossible to do an adaption of the books without changes, the changes Jackson did do become almost unimportant. The spirit is what's important-- and the spirit of the books survives once again. The actors also deliver (again) very good performance (with the notable exception of Wood: Pinocchio would have been a better actor than he), with Andy Serkins ("Gollum") being one of the best. I did not feel bored at all for most of the movie. Ok, the ending could have been a trifle shorter, but you can't have everything I guess. One point of criticism survives: Jacksons almost-fatal love for too-solemn, slow-motion death (and pseudo-death) scenes. Frodo being stung by Kankra is simply a repetition of the cave troll scene in part one (with exactly the same facial expression Wood is so very good at...) and is the one point in the movie that was really, really boring and bad. In this respect, the scene falls in the same category as Aragorn's almost-death in part two. Well, thankfully 15 seconds cannot ruin over 3 hours of good movie. As I said, you cannot have everything.
10.0~Hail to the King! Merman Sign in Permalink `[Gandalf] raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice. 'Saruman, your staff is broken.' There was a crack, and the staff split asunder in Saruman's hand, and the head of it fell down at Gandalf's feet. 'Go!' said Gandalf. With a cry Saruman fell back and crawled away. At that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above. It glanced off the iron rail, even as Saruman left it, and passing close to Gandalf's head, it smote the stair on which he stood. The rail rang and snapped. The stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks. But the ball was unharmed: it rolled on down the steps, a globe of crystal, dark, but glowing with a heart of fire. As it bounded away towards a pool Pippin ran after it and picked it up' from: J. R. R. Tolkien, 'The Lord of the Rings', 'The Two Towers', 'The Voice of Saruman' Nope, it's not in The Return of the King this beautiful crucial scene in which Saruman's power is overthrown by Gandalf and the palantír is falling down on the steps of Orthanc, tower of Isengard. In fact: there is no Saruman (or Christopher Lee) at all in the movie version of The Return of the King. When I was reading the book this scene had a deep impact on me and I still cannot believe Peter Jackson decided it should not be in the movie. But. To be quite honest: despite this flaw there is still but one movie we have all been waiting for this year. And, last night Peter Jackson's closing piece of what some people call a trilogy hit my retina. The Return of the King has the advantage of hardly having to introduce new characters (the ones who already have seen the extended version of The Two Towers are already acquainted with Denethor, Steward of Gondor), and it is the only instalment of the three movies which has a real ending and no gnawing climax that asks you to wait another year to see how things end. All loose ends are tied up in The Return of the King: Frodo and Sam continue their ordeal to destroy the infamous Ring of Power, with the treacherous once-hobbit-now-schizophrenic Gollum as their guide. Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn and the hobbits Merry and Pippin are reunited and travel to Gondor to the city of Minas Tirtith, on the border of the malignant kingdom of Mordor. All hopes rest upon Minas Tirith being the last bulwark of resistance against the evil forces of Sauron. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas split up to take the Paths of the Dead in order to find an army to fight Sauron. And Gandalf takes Pippin to Gondor in order to protect him because Sauron believes Pippin has the Ring of Power. But let's get to the core. How is the movie? It is absolutely breathtaking. I went seeing it some hours ago thinking: 'please don't let me be disappointed.' That was how high my expectations were. Well, I can tell you: these expectations were exceeded. The Return of the King is definitely the best of the three movies. Everything is so much in balance. It is not just blunt fighting (that was one of the few weak elements of The Two Towers), the movie has real genuine emotion. I don't recall having seen a movie at which people started crying. At The Return of the King people did. The special effects are also amazing. If you were impressed by the armies at Helm's Deep in The Two Towers you haven't seen anything yet. The armies and battles in this movie make Helm's Deep look like a little fight at the local schoolyard. I was really impressed by the miniatures used for Minas Tirith and Minas Morgul. Sean Astin as Sam is the actor that takes the dialogues and acting performances to its extremes. Even though the movie is 'Saruman-less' it still has so much to offer. Everything is in its right place and it also has one of the most powerful opening scenes of all three flicks when we see how Sméagol finds the ring and slowly evolves into Gollum. All special effects - as amazing as they are - are used to support the story rather than to just impress. It is all so jaw-dropping that I cannot believe The Return of the King will be passed at the next Oscar ceremony. I am going to give The Return of the King more stars than I am allowed to: 6 out of 5. It is unlike anything I have ever seen and the only thing I can think of right now is that I want to see it again because I must have missed so many good details. Hail to The King!

10.0~Return of the King khesraw Sign in Permalink An absolute masterpiece. Lovely. I advise everybody to watch it. It's the third and last movie in the series. Though I have to warn not to look this withyour children.
10.0~Fiction Taken to another level michaelshone-91845 Sign in Permalink This move created the benchmark for fiction movies.
8.0~Exciting Ending to an Exciting Trilogy mattkidd12 Sign in Permalink This film had everything that the other two had. Great War scenes, interesting character development, and love between the future king and his elvish lover. If you enjoyed the first two films, you won't be dissapointed. The Frodo/Sam portion of the film shows an interesting relationship between the two, which reaches breaking point during their trip to Mordor. This is cleverly done, with the treachorous Smeagol destroying any hope for him you had in your mind. Aragorn becomes even more King like well, with his commanding speeches and actions in the lead up to the gates at Mordor. Gandalf, once again, uses his wisdom and inner strength to overcome evil. Merry and Pippin, the 'other' two hobbits, don't dissapoint in the comic element of the film, but also show courage and strength throughout the film. The Steward of Gondor, Denethor, is as evil and twisted as they come. His fear of a returning king, Aragorn, to Gondor results in his denial of aid from Rohan. However, Gandalf and Pippin, whose relationship flowers in this film, manage to overcome Denethor however. I think Denethor was a vital part in this film, as it drew enemies from within. Only minor complaints. The Faramir/Eowyn relationship wasn't told, I missed a small Saruman appearance at the beginning at Isengard, and I didn't feel as involved in the battle scenes as I did in the Helm's Deep scene in Two Towers. However, all was fine and dandy, dandy and fine. Enjoy! PS, the Smeagol/Deagal scene at the beginning is very well done!
8.0~"This is no place for a Hobbit." ryan_kuhn Sign in Permalink If you were to watch the three Lord of the Rings movies in a row, back-to-back, you would have to be in some pain, not going to the bathroom for nearly 10 hours cannot be good for you. And so it ends in The Return of the King, where we have final fights, final chances of redemption, and final chances for Frodo to either carry out his duty of destroying the ring at Mt. Doom in Mordor or failing and giving into the power of the ring. The film starts by telling the story of how Gollum originally comes in contact with the ring, and we see the evolution of his body as the ring takes over, it is truly disturbing, which is of course the point. Will the same thing take over Frodo? When not watching the efforts of the hobbits Frodo and Sam, we see Aragon, Gandalf, and all the rest of the familiar characters setting up a defense of Gondor at the steps of Mordor (if you followed that sentence, then you are a true fan of the series). And therein lies the problem, but the time we get to the end, only the true fans of the Lord of the Rings films benefit from experiencing this film. No one who had no interest in the first two films would have much interest in The Return of the King. The final struggle between a man and himself is the most interesting part of the movie, again we have a massive battle sequence that goes on and on a bit, but has a few light moments, the battle between elf and dwarf is never done. Then there is the final 20 minutes, or what I like to call "wrap-up central." While the three films in the series tells of a few months of action, the final 20 minutes of the movie tells 4 years worth of stories. I kind of wish there was a mystery to what happened next, like in Pulp Fiction, is Jules still walking the Earth. Instead, we see what happens, and I feel cheated. What can I do though? Just accept it and move on, I suppose. Will we ever see such an ambitious series such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy? Probably not in the same fashion, where three films were shot all at once, then released one year apart. But Peter Jackson did pull it off, and now he's got enough Oscars to fill a boat. Good for him! We'll see him next with King Kong in a few years.
9.0~Too long end... rafaelbarcelodurazo Sign in Permalink Great movie! But it seemed like if Peter Jackson wouldn't know how to finish it, so the last half an hour it's kind of boring, vanishing the good impressions of the whole film. Besides that, I adored the edition, the war scenes and, over all, the Sméagol performance.
10.0~One Trilogy to Rule them all bonobear Sign in Permalink The absence of Christopher Lee notwithstanding, this is truly the finest of the three LOTR films if not the best film ever made. Not an offhand remark because it is fresh in my mind from the 12:01 am screening last night in Stony Brook, NY either... I, along with 99% of the theater wept openly during the last 20 minutes of this film. Not just because we get to see the characters go their separate ways, but because we knew that this is the last film and that the achievement made here by Peter Jackson will be with us forever. We wept because we felt somehow better for sticking by these three films these last two years and we are enriched because of it. We wept because finally we have seen a perfect trilogy of films that will live on long after we shuffle of this mortal coil. We wept with astonishment at what we were seeing...captivating performances...mind boggling effects...visualizations of unimaginable horror and subtle beauty that will remain with us as long as we live. We wept because we as an audience have also been on the same quest as our heroes. We got to be part of that noble fellowship of the ring. Thank you Peter Jackson. Thank you for giving us our dreams back. Thank you for showing Hollywood how to make movies again. If this film doesn't win every Oscar it is nominated for, then something is really wrong with the film industry. (Closing the yellow door)
7.0~Jackson could have improved on the books' flaws witness-7 Sign in Permalink What won't be said about this over-exposed and somewhat over-glorified movie by now? It's fantastic that Jackson completed the series in tact, with great continuity, in an engaging fantasy -- staying true to much beloved books. [***SPOILERS AHEAD***] That said, Jackson arguably missed an opportunity to develop a movie that improved upon the flaws in the source books. The much-publicized never-ending story ending is just one. Making 45 minutes out of an appendix was more than a bit of a waste. And 45 minutes of crying, hugging hobbits tested my patience far too long. At the same time, I couldn't help but feel that these characters -- who had time to develop in the movie as little more than monster-bait -- made no emotional connection to me over the past 3 movies. And yet I felt wholly manipulated by 45 minutes of tears and hugging as if Jackson was trying to get an emotional response out of me that was never there to begin with. But at least it wasn't as horrid as the Star Wars Ewok conclusion... And then there's Lord Denethor -- written into the books, but a character whose self-immolation death wish for himself and his remaining son added absolutely zilch to the story and movie. But Jackson, staying true to the books, left in what was useless storyline fodder -- fodder that should have otherwise staved off my early rush to the bathroom by being left on the cutting room floor. My kingdom for an editor... That said, what's good definitely outweighs the flaws. A very good, albeit not great, movie.
1.0~Lord of the movie cliché schoolbully Sign in Permalink To say that this movie is overblown pap is an understatement. Like its predecessors, this flick employs just about every movie cliché in cinema history like long, long death scenes; fake death scenes (how many times did Freddo die, only to our "surprise" he's really not dead at all!); "a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do" scenes, in fact what with the clip-clop galloping of horses everywhere I thought it had strayed into a Western. "Ride like the wind" type comments abound. The mad bad king who dies a horrible death coz he's so mad and bad. The cute little Hobbits we're all supposed to cheer for. And even a Darth Vader type chief villain!Coupled with a script that was so lame, the better actors were really pushing themselves to the limit trying to make the lines sound at least half original. In fact, the only interesting characters in this enermous exercise in money-grabbing movie cynicism were the villains! The orcs at least had character. Not surprising then that the movie relies upon the gollum to sell it. In years to come, this lumbering saga of over-hyped over produced trash will be not be regarded in the same way Star Wars is but in the same way Titanic is.... bit of an embarrassment.
6.0~Breaktaking action with slow bits poc-1 Sign in Permalink For the first half an hour I was getting worried, all the messy plot elements that needed advancing put forward a rather confused start to the film. Furthermore, leaving out the death of Saruman was a crime. Jackson claimed that it would have required a seven minute section unrelated to the rest of the movie, but to me the first 40 minutes seemed just as much of an "add on". Also grating was the constant harping on how all hope was lost, we're doomed etc. Once the action started it was a real fairground ride running almost non-stop to the climax. There were a few deus-ex-machina type escapes, but that is only to be expected in the fantasy genre. After this there was a lengthy "climb down" section which involved all the characters saying goodbye and farewell. It was all a bit much for me. Frodo looks in Sam's eyes, Sam looks mournfully at Frodo, Frodo looks a Pippin. There were about five or six times when I thought the credits would start to roll, but no, there were more goodbyes, more characters to get married and live happily ever after. Still it was a fitting end to the best adaptation yet of Tolkien's weighty tome and probably worth a second viewing sometime.
10.0~The end of the greatest cinematic story ever MichaelLaffer26 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings Trilogy concludes with what is in my opinion the greatest epic in cinematic history, everything is on point here, the pacing, the visual effects, the performances. from Gandalf to Denthor and from Frodo to Gollum and of course from Aragorn to Sam. The music in this is Howard Shores best, especially during the final battle. The direction is what really makes this movie, Peter Jackson created an epic that keeps you hooked from start to finish and has characters that you truly care about. This to me is a film that stands tall above all others and one that all films that are yet to come will be judged by, truly unforgettable and unmissable, the greatest film ever made.
7.0~Peter Jackson's odyssey comes to a welcomed conclusion gregsrants Sign in Permalink The ring is destroyed! Middle Earth is saved! Hobbits and Elves rejoice! Peter Jackson's masterful odyssey that began 11 years ago is complete with the release of the third installment of the Lord of the Rings, Return of the King (ROTK). Peter Jackson's love affair with the J.R.R. Tolkien story is complete with the third film installment, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (ROTK). Audiences have waited through three years of release dates, countless DVD editions and marketing tie-ins to view what is essentially one long 11+ hour movie. And at the end of it all, I too found myself rejoicing - rejoicing that the third movie finally ended! Lord of the Rings: ROTK is both good and bad with the good being exceptional, but the bad, being prominent enough not to be overlooked. First the good. Ian McKellan as the wise wizard Gandalf is the best he has been in ROTK. Gandalf transformed from being a new generation's Obi Wan Kenobi - as all wise and more powerful after death - to being a vulnerable participant in a future unknown. A scene shared with Viggo Mortensen's Aragon shows Gandalf to be scared for Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Aragon must reassure him to follow his heart. This is Ian McKellan at his best and if he was good enough to garnish an Oscar nomination for the first Lord of the Rings, then he should be assured one with ROTK. Also showing more acting range that was expected of him is Sean Astin in the role as Sam, the Hobbit that accompanies Frodo on his journey to Mount Doom. Sean shows courage, heart and conflict and we believe in the conviction that the young actor put into his role. Also on the plus side are the fight scenes in ROTK. The great battles in the Pelennor Fields, Minas Tirith and the Black Gates are speckled with special effects mastery never before seen on the big screen. Kudos also to Mr. Jackson for the amount of humor that was absent from the previous two installments. Seeing Gandalf react to an overeager Pippin (played by Billy Boyd) put the audience into an outburst of laughter - a response not yet heard in the first 9 hours of storytelling. And finally, and most importantly, the story receives note for being the strongest of the three. With many balls in the air to juggle, Peter Jackson weaves the story through Frodo's trek to Mount Doom with the ever-schizophrenic Gollum, Aragon's journey to regain the throne and Rohan's King Theoden search for an army to wrestle the evil Orcs just to name a few. All stories are equally interesting and Jackson is able to stay true to the novel in bringing the story to the masses. But not all is good with ROTK. The special effects in the final film are average, that being, not on scale with what was presented in 2001 and 2002. Some effects actually look terrible. The scene where Legolas (Orlando Bloom) is able to get atop a giant elephant looked cheap and unrealistic, and his subsequent dismount which was suppose to appeal to the skateboarders in the audience looked like the promo for some average Sony Playstation game. And Aragon's confrontation with the ghosts of a disgraced army looked like it was cut and paste from Jackson's previous film, The Frighteners. Also notable was the amount of blue screen images used in the finale. Aragon in front of the army at the Black Gates or Frodo's gaze into the fires of Mount Doom looked terrible when compared to some of the film's other effect achievements. Then there is the ending. All of them! In a DVD world where extended versions are widely accepted as superior to the original cut, I would have enjoyed ROTK more had the last 30 minutes be struck from the record. After sitting through 3 hours, I had run out of popcorn and was restlessly waiting to use the restroom, but Peter Jackson marched each of his characters out for a curtain call of hugging, bowing, kissing and crying that I thought was completely unnecessary (Do we really need to see Sam get married?). However, for all its faults, ROTK is intended as one long film adventure and at that, it is exceptional. Peter Jackson had an incredible undertaking in front of him, and unlike the Star Wars or Matrix franchises, The Lord of the Rings was able to maintain a constant tone and feel through its multiple components. For that alone, I take my hat off and salute you. So it is finally time to take a breath. Or is it? Next year there will be the DVD release of Return of the King followed by the theatrical extended version, then the DVD extended version, then the DVD box set, then the DVD box set with all the extended features. Maybe if we are lucky, someone will rifle through the old house of J.R.R. Tolkien and find the unpublished works of Sam the Hobbit:Journey to Neverland Ranch.
10.0~Superb! But what's with all the "1" ratings? tony-clifton Sign in Permalink After I voted, I saw with amazement a number of people who voted "1". What's up with that? I reserve "1" for a really bad movie like "Hard Target" - acclaimed movies with tremendous epic value like any of the Lord of the Rings movies do not deserve a "1". If you don't like the genre - then that's not the fault of the film. Neither is it the fault of the film if you don't like the battles. Movies should be judged based on what the director was trying to achieve, and in that respect - how does Return of the King deserve a "1"?? The only reason I can think of, is some people are losers who have nothing better to do, or can't stand Return of the King out-ranking "The Godfather" or some other corny reason. Grow up kiddies! Anyway - back to the movie. I thought the movie was breathtaking! It certainly is an apt finale to a wonderful trilogy. Unlike others - I didn't find the film dragged on too long, and the length was respectful to the essence of Tolkien's story. *minor spoiler* The only thing I was wondering is: why didn't Frodo just ride on one of those Eagles straight into Mordor from the beginning in the first place? Then it occurred to me: the Eagle would stand out flying into Mordor, and would have set off too many alarms. Also, it appeared when the eye looks at you, you become paralyzed - so I guess the Eagles would have been affected by that. *end spoiler* Anyway - the wait has not ended for me. The "real" trilogy is the extended DVD set and until the extended Return of the King comes out, the journey has not really ended yet for me. Boo hoo. (man did I wait 2 whole years before I saw the end?? I bet none of you thought you could have waited that long!!)
7.0~Brilliant movie, but not for everyone. beerwine900 Sign in Permalink Now i will say without a doubt Return of the King is the best in the trilogy. The Lord of the rings trilogy has everything, action, romance, story, amazing CGI and good performances from all the cast. Unfortunately it is very slow at some parts of the movie and having read the books myself i can tell you there are huge plot holes in the story and much of it was actually changed to fit into the movie. This movie was pretty boring at some parts and a couple of my friends did fall asleep all the way up to the final 20 minutes of fight scene, one of them actually left , and i have to admit at some points i did start to nodd off. I didn't really like the character of legolas in all three movies due to fact that he was to invincible and he didn't even get dirty while fighting orcs and other demon type creatures, however the other cast and characters were done well. I think with the whole trilogy overall you ether love them or fall asleep through half of it, but they are good movies. personally though when it comes to fiction i'd rather watch Blade or Total Recall. 7 out of 10.
10.0~Incredible is one word for it. dak_83 Sign in Permalink As I sat in the cinema watching the credits roll by I knew I'd just watch movie history. This movie was amazing, so was the whole trilogy! I especially like the Ringwraiths who have an powerful look surrounding their carachters and I felt the angst come alive extensively in this part of the trilogy. The battle was just great. And not to talk about the acting. One who've really grown throughout the movies is Pippin (Billy Boyd) who really did an excellent job. I'm just waiting to see it again... and again... ...the Extended Version ofcourse.
9.0~A legitimately great movie zetes Sign in Permalink An adventure movie to match the great ones of the past, and the one to beat for the future. The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than fitting; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance. Almost nothing disappointed or bothered me. All parts of the story were equally interesting. It was sweeping, it was involving, it was beautiful. One of the few thing I would complain about is the villain. Sauron is boring and more or less unseen. He does not feel very threatening. And his army of orcs has been dull since the first film. They're just not very interesting creatures. Fortunately, The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with a gallery of better ones. Some of them have been present in the other two films, trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on. They're more present here, however. Even better, though, those gigantic elephants, ten times the size of a normal one. Oh, man, those are cool. Star Wars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from Empire, and they are. One scene where Legolas, the elf, triumphs over one of them feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack. But the very best thing is a giant spider. Everyone knows that there was originally a giant spider on skull island in King Kong, cut from the film because it really disturbed a test audience. Seeing the spider in Return of the King is like having that famous piece of lost footage restored. When all three films are finally out on their special edition DVDs, I'm going to spend a month combing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't just as good as this one, or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends have sworn they were.
10.0~Awesome movie, hugely overrated MovieFreak4702 Sign in Permalink This truly was the epic trilogy of our generation. It was done perfectly and will have a nice little slice of film history to go along with it. I have one gripe about this movie, It's high rating. Sure, this was a good film that brought the story to a completely satisfying end while still making the audience want more when the credits rolled. It was a good movie. But to say that something like this is even able to compete with such films as Pulp Fiction, Psycho, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, or even the original Star Wars, then you are gravely mistaken. This was a good movie to watch, and definitely defines the term epic. I do believe, however that people rank this film too high. It's not even close to the greatness of any of the aforementioned films or even Fight Club or Dr. Strangelove. You LoTR freaks really need to stop voting for no reason. Shawshank beats the hell outta this one as well. Maybe people will wise up.
7.0~over rated, a 7 unbalenced editing scottdupremills Sign in Permalink this film is overrated , the dying in the arms scenes ( a lot of them ) should have been shorter in length , the ending could have been shorter i respect jackson as a director but not an editor , also slow motion should be shot that way not slowed on an avid it looks like cheap tv effects. on the positive side new zealand has a great filmmaking history with whale rider and the piano as two of the best films from NZ , the lotr films are not bad but over rated i predict the effects in lotr will look like the old bw king kong film in as many years , lets hope jackson lives up to his oscar and becomes a better director in the future.
10.0~more appropriate for DVD than theater snsh Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is a terrific and memorable film, but as a viewer you might enjoy it more on DVD, because in a real theater you will be hit by four big distractions: 1) long length, 2) unconvincing CGI, 3) missing scenes from the book, 4) loud soundtrack. The length is the biggest problem -- 3 hours 20 minutes with no intermission. Anyone in a theater needs to go to the bathroom after sitting 2 hours, so one by one everyone watching this film has to sneak out and back into their seat. This includes you, meaning you might miss a scene or two (or do you just come dehydrated and risk catching the flu?). Super long movies like this need an intermission, and do better on DVD. The CGI is sometimes good but often annoyingly unreal. Especially backgrounds; you look at a character delivering a line, and you just know they're standing in front of a blue screen -- it doesn't look realistic. This happens in practically every outdoor scene. Perhaps your eye won't notice these things anyway, but on DVD problems with CGI are less conspicuous. There are scenes from the book missing from the film. New Line will include many of them on DVD. Maybe those scenes would help the film, maybe not, but at least it would make the film more true to the Tolkien book. Finally, the music is loud and formulaic. There is never a quiet moment in the film -- if the characters are silent, you can count on the music to fill in the dead air. And the music is not subtle -- they hit you over the head with the same four melodies repeated over, like hammers -- "this is where you're supposed to feel touched", and "this is where you supposed to feel scared", and "this is where you're supposed to stare in awe." The music is overdone, but it becomes less a distraction when you're watching on DVD and can adjust the volume. Return of the King is a good movie, and you're gonna see it sometime, but the theater might not be the best place. Wait for DVD.
10.0~Cheers SurlyRonin Sign in Permalink **MINOR SPOILERS** I find it especially unfortunate that a movie of this quality and integrity comes with as many detractors as I have seen. Not that they are not allowed their opinions of course, but that they cannot enjoy perhaps the greatest fantasy epic ever created, seamlessly melding Tolkien's work with the mind of a dedicated, loving director. To me, Mr. Jackson's greatest accomplishment is realizing and embracing what is at stake for each character in this movie, and not shying away from this. He embraces as much of the fantastical as he can, so that when Sam announces he'll carry Frodo, we're right there with him. For those who say this is sentimental, I say it's right there in the text, and Jackson does not shy away from intense emotional moments. Perhaps this is lacking the verisimilitude/absurdity of the human condition in something like "Lost in Translation," but who cares? We as an audience are removed from our petty situations into a world in which the stakes are much larger, and as a fantasy series Lord of the Rings tops all others in taking us to this place. Just look at the abominations of recent attempts(can someone make Star Wars just go away now?) to do this to realize just how difficult an accomplishment it is. What also amazes me is Jackson's understanding of true male friendship as Tolkien saw it, so that when Frodo and Sam embrace or sob together, it hits you right in the chest. Their love (yes, LOVE) is something completely foreign to this cynical age, established through their struggles and triumphs together. Any other director would skirt this, but Jackson embraces it, and it makes the ending all the more powerful. People talk about the "perfect" movie, or try to fix ratings to things as often as they can, or establish rankings, but I say this film will take its place with the greats, like Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, and so on. It will define film for a generation, and will become a part of our collective subconscious, and I cannot think of a more fitting tribute for its author.
8.0~Like the other installments ROTK grows on you Schweiger Sign in Permalink It's simply too much to take in for just one viewing. Like in FOTR and TTT I felt emotionally overburdened when I first saw this third part. There were so many scenes, which would have been an emotional highlight for any movie. But before I even began to care, it was off again to the next highlight. Uff! You only have two choices: To 'log out' and dismiss this movie as nice eye-candy with a simple main plot and some cheesiness. You might even enjoy it on this level. Or to watch it again and again and again, until You are able to soak it all in. I chose the second path and by now I am even moved by those parts, which seemed awkward at first. Best overall cast and special effects I have ever seen. Everything else is at least good. 9/10 I'm not sure, but this could become a male 'Titanic'.
10.0~Movies do not get better than this portersharkey Sign in Permalink After seeing this film I realized that I had just watched what was perhaps the best movie I had ever seen. The only way this movie could not be enjoyed is if one were predispositioned to not liking fantasy or Tolkien's writings. As a fan of the books, I could not have expected a better translation to film. Some Tolkien purists have been unfair to all three films but I am sure the man himself would have approved. Movies do not get better than this.
10.0~Essence of Tolkien's epic realized basson_mommy12 Sign in Permalink Tolkien's classic Hobbit's tale is realized. I cannot think of a single thing I would change in this movie. That is a rarity. I gained so much from viewing the extended version of Two Towers that my theatrical evaluation of this film may be marred. Those who have not read the series of novels, I truly hope you will go out, get these wonderful books and enjoy these stories in a whole new way. Art inspires: literature, music, sculpture, paintings. This film along with it's preceding installments brings to life all these various mediums to create a great work of art in its own self. These films are sure to be an inspiration.
1.0~IMDb Top Movie List dweezil07 Sign in Permalink This isn't actually a review of this movie but a review of the top 100 movies list here. Obviously, if the majority of users on IMDb rate Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King as the 4th best movie ever, there either aren't many users over 14 or the majority of users know very little about good film making. I'm sure I could easily come up with 100 movies that are better than all 3 Lord of the Rings movies. That's really all I wanted to say is that by rating LOTR as one of the best movies ever, you're proving to the world how useless this site is for knowledgeable critical movie reviews. How can one take the ratings on this site seriously after having realized that LOTR is the #4 best movie ever according to IMDb users!
10.0~...and the Oscar goes to... COSAguy Sign in Permalink What an extraordinary accomplishment Peter Jackson and team have created. As promised, the best of the three films. Splendid acting from Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen. Astounding effects that were completely in character. Remarkable story construction from the writers and Director Peter Jackson. We laughed, we cried, we cringed, we held our breathes, we cried again. Seldom has a film grabbed my emotions so tightly. I think a new Oscar category is needed. Best Picture just isn't adequate to describe this climax of an epic trilogy.
10.0~One of the best films ever made hkmastergaming Sign in Permalink Now, I have been reading various comments about this film. Fortunately, most are giving this film the praise it deserves. I am not a massive Tolkien fan nor am I a massive fan of fantasy 'epic' films, but this the LOTR trilogy is simply brilliant. I fail to understand why people are afraid of CGI, yes, this film uses a lot of it, but it needs to. There is nothing wrong with CGI if it is used well which it is in this film. It is personally my favourite film, although I do not rate it higher than the Godfather or the Shawshank Redemption and others, but it completely deserves its 11 Oscars, it's 4th ranking in the top 250 and every other bit of praise or award it has received. The acting is superb throughout, the performances of Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Bernard Hill and Dominic Monaghan really stand out but the others are brilliant too. The soundtrack for this film is by the far the best in a film ever in my opinion. Howard shore has really done a magnificent job. The film really does the book justice. 10/10 - masterpiece.
8.0~Emotion in front of battles Johnny_halbarad Sign in Permalink Saruman is out. Well yes...out of the theatrical cut. They cuted out to mutch...well yes in the theatrical cut. But listen, if the movie now is good, what will it be then, when the SEE appears? Emotion, in front of battles. When i saw it, i thought, the scene, or the battle on the pellenor fields was to short. Maybe it was to short, because it didn't have, that kind of background, as the battle of helms deep got. And there it was "A human side." Wether humans or orcs (Uruk-Hai) rule this middleearth. And at the pellenor fiels, minas tirith, the battle didn't have that kind of background, that humanity, which i expected from. Denethor: You can actually identify him, if you didn't read the book, by the way wonderfully well played, but he becomes crazy to early in the movie, and i din't like to see Ganalf hurt him, it was allmost like wrestling, gandalf gives him not just one knock, he knocks him down, i didn't like to see this, and espeacilly i didn't like to see him falling down from the "Zitadelle (Don't know the english word)" that was just not nescessearly! I just thought: "PETER, what the hell are you doing???" and he must be carefull, i don't expect an Oscar for best director, BUT i hope so. But now lets go to good: This movie, is much more emotional than i expected it to be. And that is GOOD. You don't go to watch "The Lord of the Rings" because of the battles. Well, some peoples do that, but i really don't like that. And at the end, almost tears came to my eyes, it was so overwhelming, so emotional, you are so touched by these two hobbits, trying to destroy the most powerfull weapon of middleearth, well the second most powerfull, the most powerfull is LOVE, and that is what the movie is about also, love, feelings, emotion. Its so strong. By the way, i do not expect Sean Astin beeing nominated for the best actor in a supporting role, but i hope so. And of course the people who didn't read the books do not understand the end, well i do. I am sure it was an epic rush, for the team of WETA Digital, and so i don't complain about some bluescreen shots, digital horses and olifants, as other people do, but "MATRIX RELOADED and MATRIX REVOLUTIONS" be in afraid of SHELOB: best animated creature ever seen. So theatrical cut=GOOD Special Exthended Edition¾ST Thanks for reading this, and Peter, i hope you get now your reward for your duty to all Tolkien readers, and to the moviefans, your last three movies, have allready written history. Thanks Johnny
9.0~A movie as epic as the first two installments. megaman821 Sign in Permalink The story begins with a flashback of Smeagol when he still looked like a halfling. This lets you in on his true nature. The plot then picks up where it left off. Frodo, Sam, and Golum are still on their long journey. The rest of the gang is busy preparing as another great battle looms. Although our heros get a majority of the screen time there are a few new and some old characters that were nicely developed. The visuals in this movie are breathtaking as anyone who has watched the first two films in the series should know. The battles were even more massive than in the second film. I do a few minor gripes though. First most noticable is the extrodinarly long ending. Trust me you could leave the movie when it should have ended and not miss anything (you will know when it should have ended when you see it). Second, maybe this was just me, but the orc seemed to have a lot of strategy to their attacks instead of just bumrushing their outnumbered opponent. Third, this is somewhat related to the second, despite their strategic decisions they seem more easily defeated than in the second movie. Finally, Aaragon's sword should have played a bigger role other than proving he is the king. Overall, this is a great film. Anyone who enjoys epics or action will surely enjoy this movie. 9/10
10.0~The Return of the King - Peter Jackson's Magnum Opus Comes To An End. Amyth47 Sign in Permalink My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠ Part III of one of the best trilogies and one of the best fantasy movies ever made. A bit more intense than the previous instalments and perfect ending to the trilogy. Peter Jackson is a genius and 'The Lord of the Rings' is undoubtedly his magnum opus.
1.0~just do what others tell you spam2-7 Sign in Permalink "I KNOW this movie is garbage" -Casey Glendening and its an insult to humanity that it be ranked so high on the best films of all time. It is a boring cash cow for Hollywood only strangling real films from ever getting off paper and into the aperture. I would like to thank the academy for my opinion because they decide what is righteous and unmarred. I would like to thank the millions of non-thinkers who voted this so high and voted for President Bush. I know you must be all one in the same and statistics show you thirst for mindless violence more so than anyone else, so why not make a pointless three and half hour yawn fest your favorite film when the production studios final destination for bunkum such as this is a video game. Feel free not to have an opinion, just do what others tell you.
9.0~A perfect ending to a perfect trilogy robert-710-767167 Sign in Permalink There seems to be a set line with movies. On one side you have the movies that are okay, nothing amazing but nonetheless okay. Sometimes people try to make a sequel but it either sucks or was just unnecessary. Then on the other side are the movies that are pure win. Epic, awesome, amazing. They capture the audience's attention. They are just perfect. And even better is if sequels are planned, they usually end up either as good as, or better than the original. Only a few movies have made it to the latter. Toy Story, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean. This is another one of those. Despite the fact that it was intentional to have the same actors, and to keep the story to the book, regardless, the movie as itself was very well made. The first was okay, confusing but near the end I started to "get it". The second seemed to be slightly a filler, however it was still well done. This final one... wow. I got teary eyed several times. I rarely do that. I know it was suppose to end everything, and it did it perfectly. The emotions were captured perfectly. The story ended perfectly. The special effects were real, but weren't distracting. All in all, it was very well done, and I rate this 9/10.
10.0~Best movie ever !!! BlOoDySpIt Sign in Permalink I wont give any spoilers, I'm just gonna say this is the best movie I've ever seen and the best movie based on a book ! I cant say which is the best cause I just loved the 3 of them !! I hope all of you will like it, and probably most of you will think it's the best of the trilogy and it deserves it ! Good movie to everyone who wanna see it, you wont be disapointed ! I could go like this for hours but I'll let you decide what you think of this movie !
10.0~Excellent ekatze21 Sign in Permalink It was wonderfully adapted from the book, and left just enough in to keep book fans happy, but left enough out to prevent non-book fans to stay interested without being confused. The dialogue was wonderfully scripted, and they didn't overload on the action scenes. It flowed nicely from storyline to story line, and only a few of the plot lines were left open at the end, which is completely understandable, given the complexity of the story.
10.0~The best of this brilliant Trilogy! r-downey1 Sign in Permalink At Last Frodo and Sam's long and deadly journey to destroy the one ring comes to an end as they reach Mordor in this outstanding work of art by Peter Jackson. Aragorn the true good king of Gondor has taken his place as the king and became who he was born to be in order to defend his people from the evil dark lords growing armies with the help of the land of Rohan and Gandalf the White wizard. The battle scenes at Minas Tirith are by far the most ingenious peace of film making I've ever had the joy to view in my life of movie watching. Back to the hobbits Frodo and Sam. I have to say that Gollum is great in this film as we get to see his true love and passion for the ring and what evil things he can really do just to steal it back for himself. As he leads Frodo and Sam to the lair of the giant spider Shelob, which was also done perfectly in filming. Also I loved the way we found out about Gollum's past life and how he first came upon the evil of the one ring in the opening scenes of the movie. The music is Fab! I own the soundtrack on CD. The ending is very happy but at the same time heartbreaking and very unforgettable. This is a must see movie watch it as soon as you can and if you have already seen it then watch it again as it only gets better every time you view this work of art. This film has to get 10/10 stars. Truly Outstanding!! I would just like to give my special thanks to the writer and creator of Lord of the Rings JRR Tolkien for making these excellent movies possible by giving us such a classic series of novels as inspiration. This epic easily deserves its 3rd place in the top 250 films on IMDb any day. The Return of the King has now become my favourite movie of all time and to me this is the greatest masterpiece ever made in film history. Oh and in fact I would say that this film along with the other two parts of the LOTR trilogy are ten times better than the Godfather trilogy!
10.0~Can't wait to see the extended edition on DVD franzwinkler Sign in Permalink In my opinion "Return of the king" is the best picture of the three, as is the book. So my expectations where high. Very high. Because I loved "The Fellowship" and liked "The Two Towers" very, very much. Peter Jacksons movie is brilliant! Full stop! Everything fits perfect, but for one reason, I can't wait to see the extended edition on DVD: It is the ending. The movie ends several times and in the "short" running time of 200min these 20min feel like a chewing gum after you chew 3 hours. Before someone cries out "stupid idiot", let me explain: The movie is so fast(except for the parts Arwen is in), so intense, that this theatrical cut only needed one ending. All the slow motion, all the hellos and goodbyes were not necessary in this version. Everybody knows that there will be the extended edition, which will be far better and which will contain all the interleaves. So why not place the several endings there? That would, in my opinion, have been better. Although, in joyful expectation of the DVD I give it a 10/10! Congratulations Mr. Jackson!
9.0~Extremely good, but not the best movie of all time spacemonkey17 Sign in Permalink Okay, I just saw this movie last night, and it blew me away. I really have to give it to Pete Jackson. Awesome job man! But, people are saying that this movie tops every other movie... EVER! Well, this movie is definately the strongest installment of the trilogy, and it does top the first two (not by much), but the greatest movie of all time? No... sorry people. A couple flaws that I saw, was the fact that the ending was too long (I don't care if Pete was trying to stay true to the books), and did anyone else notice the overusage of close-ups?! I had to turn my head back and forth just to see Aragorn's eyes! Okay, maybe I'm focusing too much on the negative. This movie is excellent. Definately a timeless classic. I was moved by Sean Astin's performance, he did an acceptionally good job. And the direction topped it all off. But people, let yourself cool down for a week before you start screaming that it is the best movie of all time. Cause the truth is... It just isn't. Peace
9.0~The Lord Of All... Thanos_Karagioras Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is the third and last movie of the trilogy of The Lord Of The Rings. All the movies of this trilogy were unique and one better than the other. For one more time Peter Jackson directs a masterpiece like the two previously movies of The Lord Of The Rings. This movie has more action than the two other movies because we have waited for this battle so long and finally it's so close. Such as the two previous movies we can see the beautiful landscapes of New Zeland and what can I say about this beautiful music which follows our heroes to this movie. It's a really good movie that all have to see it and for us who have seen it every time is unique...
10.0~Just excellent, pure movie bliss reijo-hiirikoski Sign in Permalink This is the stuff that miracles are made of. Every scene bursting with outstanding feast to the eye. I never thought that Peter Jackson could pull this off, but he has and how ! This trilogy surpasses even my wildest dreams and is by far the strongest contender for best movie Oscar.
3.0~LOTR III - A great unfinished work tdepoerck Sign in Permalink I loved & adored the Fellowship and Two Towers. I repeat. They are my top favourite films of all time, even above Star Wars & Blade Runner. These films had furious pace, plot unity, the characters had gravitas, the dialogue had consequence, the language was masterful and elegant, the music either beautifully dominated the scenes or perfectly underscored them with gracious subtlety. Return of the King was a bitter disappointment and a terrible movie. Gandalf "the White", seems no longer the wizard who defeated the Moria balrog! The Witch King of Angmar, whom Aragorn had stood against on Weathertop seemingly without much effort, and a few swings of this torch, seemed about to kick Gandalf into the dirt and make him eat it. The Orc general was pathetic as a disabled elephant-man. Most of the dialogues are utterly disjointed; the voices of the actors who had acted so brilliantly in the previous movies had no weight. I also felt what they were saying was pointless. Take the scene in which Pippin finds Merry on the Pelennor Fields - one says "I found you", the other replies "yes, I knew you would". How does that advance the plot at all?! The Black Lieutenant was a misguided attempt at comic relief at a crucial juncture of the film, when all seems despair. Some of the shots in Mordor were dubious - the sky behind the hobbit scenes a light grey, whereas as viewed from Gondor the sky is black!! What's the deal about Sauron becoming a light-house?! The soldiers of Minas Tirith are a bunch of incompetent poster-boys I wouldn't trust to defend against a poodle. What are the women and children doing still in the city after the orc armies have broken in?! Pippin seems to be able to run all the way from the Citadel to the lowest city level and back, twice, just to ask Gandalf to help him save Faramir. The Saruman scene was dreadful and the dialogue repetitive. The musical score had no soul, no uniqueness: it could have been the music in a 100 other films (and probably will be). The opening scene was pointless, badly acted, not believable, and served no other purpose other than delaying the beginning. What was the point of that Indiana Jones-Temple-of-Doom-skull avalanche in the mountain of the ghost army? The falling in love between Eowyn and Faramir is completely unsubstantiated and not believable. Alas, I could go on and on. I just don't understand people who liked it. Sure, it had superb CGI action, but frankly that's all. I suspect it appealed to Independence Day/ Alien vs Predator all-action-no-brains Jerry Bruckheimer fans. I do understand Peter Jackson - he was tired after working so, so hard, so many years on this single project. He just let his focus slip on the last straight-line (editing it, while already preparing for King Kong). A great pity. For me the trilogy is unfinished. In my opinion it could benefit from a complete re-editing but I doubt it will ever happen because of its Oscars. The first two should have been so recompensed - this one doesn't deserve being shown in a Tijuana whore-house as side-entertainment.
10.0~The best movie that i have ever seen. Eowyn8252 Sign in Permalink Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen are wonderful singers. I loved every part of this movie. i really enjoyed the endings. I liked the action, adventure, and emotional status of this movie. It was truly breath taking.
10.0~Thank You Peter Jackson & Co. for a wonderful experience! sss-1 Sign in Permalink Wow! I'm lost for words. I saw this film at a 7am screening and i have spent the whole day numbed by an experience similar to the one i last felt many years ago as a child caught up with the struggle of good vs evil in star wars' empire strikes back. Incredible. Too many jaw-dropping moments, compelling and moving. I'm literally lost for words. Thank you peter jackson & co for creating a cinematic masterpiece!
1.0~This movie is terrible tomplaysbaseball Sign in Permalink This movie is awful, the ending was longer than any battle scene. The entire final battle was completely meaningless, the humans might as well have stood there because the only ones that did any fighting were the ghosts, very anti-climatic, and the ending was about 35 minutes too long. Even the most hardcore of fans has to agree on those two points, the only good part about this movie was the final battle, it seemed, and then the ghosts came and completely dominated everything, therefore making the previous half hour meaningless. I want my 3 hours of my life back and also my ten bucks. In all, the action was meaningless, and the movie would have been much better had it been about 2 hours long tops.
6.0~A Great End To One Of The Best Trilogy's Of All Time! bingtau Sign in Permalink The final part of LOTR was as good as the anticipated wait for this film. The film itself, was one that you just knew would be fantastic before even seeing it. And thankfully it was. I must admit that at first, back when the Fellowship was coming out that I was just so-so about the films. But oh my God, what I wasn't expecting was the 3 year treat we were all about to recieve. Kudos to everyone involved with LOTR, and it's sad that's it's all over and done with. This was the best of the 3 movies.
8.0~Well done, but . . . . psychprofessor Sign in Permalink I've read the books, and now I've seen the movies. Like the previous ones, this movie was an enormous accomplishment, with sweep and grandeur and pageantry and fantastically creative monsters. Unfortunately, they should have left about an hour of it on the cutting-room floor. I'm sure it'll win a bevy of Oscars and other awards, but for my money a movie such as "Mystic River" is "better."
10.0~The greatest film of our time! maitreyee_mishra Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is a masterpiece, one whose magic and emotion we will not see in a film again. The Return of the King continues from where The Two Towers left us; Rohan's victory against the armies of Saruman at Helm's Deep and where Frodo and Sam follow the deceitful Gollum into Mordor. The film starts with a flashback where Smeagol and Deagol are fishing...a perfect shift to the past and then the story is back in the present, where darkness prevails and then...the magnificent story unfolds as it takes the audience to every corner of Middle Earth, through the eyes of the characters. I think what is the most admirable thing in these books and films is that the real physically strong characters with kind hearts are not the true heroes. The true heroes are physically weak but are the most determined and the most mentally and emotionally driven. Peter Jackson, the deserving director who got The Director's Guild Award and three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay brings to life one of the most difficult books of all time. This is perhaps the first fantasy trilogy which is in its essence, very human. There is greed, betrayal and evil but on the other hand, what dominates the brilliant story are themes of friendship, love, determination, trust, hope and the power of good. The beloved book is brought to life by the brilliant cast and crew who gave marvellous performances. It is so easy to laugh with the characters, so easy to love and to hate them, and especially, so easy to cry with them. The entire cast perhaps contributed on one of the best ensemble you can see in a movie (that is why they got the SAG Award for Ensemble acting). Frodo is played to perfection by the brilliant Elijah Wood. If you see the pain in Frodo's eyes, it is only because Elijah Wood understood it and put it as his own. There definitely couldn't be another Frodo. His loyal companion and faithful friend, Samwise Gamgee is played by Sean Astin. I would say this is Sean's breakthrough. The third movie shows us what he is really made of. His flawless portrayal of Sam brings you to tears. Then there is Gollum, excellently played by an incredibly talented actor, Andy Serkis who didn't only give voice to Gollum but also drove the CGI creation through action. Magnificence is also brought into the movie by the irreplacable actors Viggo Mortensen and Sir Ian McKellen, who played Aragorn (the one who contributes to the name 'The Return of the King') and the latter played the wise wizard Gandalf. I haven't named the other actors, not because their perfomances were not worth noticing but because the list would be endless. I thought all actors were so brilliant, that they cannot be replaced. I think the movie was one of those rare movies which are flawless. Why I recommend this movie to you? Well in the words of Samwise 'There is some good in this world and it's worth fighting for'. And not only that; if you want to think and appreciate the person in you, I believe it would be good to feel with the characters and understand them. Judge yourself and believe that 'even the smallest person can change the course of the future'. The trilogy ends here, a great pity for me and millions of others. I loved all movies and anticipated their release. Now it is over. There couldn't be a better end though than having the Return of the King win 4 Golden Globe Awards, 5 BAFTAs, an SAG Award, DGA for Jackson and the best of all, 11 Academy Awards plus many other awards! I think back to what Frodo said 'How do you pick up the pieces of an old life? How do you go on?...There are some things that cannot mend.' I think this is so true. All lovers of this movie probably feel like this now. To those who haven't watched this...go soon! This is the greatest trilogy (and a few of the greatest movies) of our time. You can't afford to miss the end of the trilogy! To those who don't like the movies, I can't imagine how you failed to see all the elements that make these movies timeless masterpieces of all time. The complexity of these themes and the reality in the story are unparalleled to any other. To those who have not watched a single movie from LOTR, I recommend that you watch all and love them because I can assure you that they are undoubtedly the greatest achievements in cinematic history in our lifetime.
10.0~The Best of the Three stgregor Sign in Permalink I was incredibly impressed with Return of the King. The first two films were fantastic, but this final installment was (in my opinion) by far the best. The effects and scenery are stunning, the battle scenes are gripping, and for the most part, the story was well recounted from the book. I truly loved this movie, and of the three, this is the one that I could watch again and again. The acting in this film was also far superior to the first two movies. Not until Return of the King did any of the main characters really come to life for me. Even Gollum seemed to be more expressive and impassioned in this tale. This movie, like the books from which it was adapted, is definitely worth watching - and also worth buying!
9.0~The Journey Ends With a Bang! EmperorNortonII Sign in Permalink "The Return of the King," the third installment of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, has been anticipated by many fans. The first two installments had raised the bar very high for the third movie. And, fortunately, "Return of the King" has proven itself worthy of the trilogy. The visuals are very impressive! Such incredible sights include the breathtaking facade of Minas Tirith, and the awesome sight of the Mumakil and trolls lumbering along with the massive Orc army. Some memorable moments include the opening scene of Smeagol's acquiring the Ring of Sauron, and his subsequent transformation into Gollum, as well as Gollum struggling with Frodo on Mt. Doom. Peter Jackson deserves many kudos for creating the trilogy, making it a true epic, an instant classic and a new legend of cinema.
8.0~Can I Pass. Loathe_IMDb Sign in Permalink Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum. Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs. If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film. For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent. Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well. I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film. Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by. Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either. Also: Thousands of comments have been made on this outstanding production and there is little left to write that has not already been written or said. Again, not surprisingly at last night's 'Oscars', the third film in the trilogy took most of the awards. Like others I could give glowing comments about content, acting, production, direction, visual effects etc. but will instead, convey what I consider to be equally important; that is the realistic and accurate portrayal of a classic masterpiece of literature from one of the world's most imaginative authors. I have tried and failed three times to completely read the book and I enjoy reading, but feel that I could now do so and have a better understanding of the story - only because I know that Peter Jackson set out to retain accuracy of the story. Sometimes our own imagination lacks the ability to see exactly what the author intended and if a film can help that, then it only adds to the experience. By timely coincidence as I write this my computer screen saver has put up a picture of a mountain valley in New Zealand - it must know what is in my mind. That beautiful country was perhaps the ideal setting for the film with its mystical landscape punctuated with mountain valleys, rivers, forests and open spaces. It cannot be far from what may have been in Tolkien's own mind. I would perhaps add one comment about content. Although there was much reliance on computer visualisation it was well-balanced by emotional acting like the characters Gollum and Gandalf. Although Gollum was a villain, I actually was made to feel sorry for him at the end. Too many potentially good films are spoilt by substituting acting for over indulgence in special effects. This is an art that the producers and directors of this film had exactly right. I hope that the success of this trilogy will herald a new era in film-making of classical stories. Our literature has a wealth of candidates, and even ones that have been tried could be re-visited now that such experiences as Lord of the Rings have proved financially viable and immensely popular
10.0~Amazing dehumanizer Sign in Permalink In short: amazing. Every bit as great as the first one, and probably better. Sure, no Saruman, no "Scouring of the Shire", and a lot of important scenes have (much like in the first one) been moved to the Extended Edition, like Faramir's healing and he and Éowyn falling in love. Still a lot of "come on, kiss, already!" long looks between the hobbits. Mordor isn't as dark as it should be, and I think it looked darker in the other movies. Gimli is still used for comedy, although it's not as bad as in TTT. Andúril should have been reforged in the first movie, and Aragorn should have had it since leaving Rivendell. And, as tao commented, Merry and Pippin should be quite taller now than the other two hobbits... Ok, that's it. All the bad parts are there, IMO. The rest is... perfection. Loved the intro, Sméagol's slow transformation into Gollum. "Corruption" is the right word here - and it's very, very well done. Minas Tirith looks incredible. Shelob is the "best" looking giant spider I've ever seen in a movie. The part before she first appears, when Frodo is running alone in her tunnels, is brilliantly scary. The speeches from Théoden and Aragorn before the two battles are some of the best I've seen - short, inspiring, and accompanied by great music. I'd have followed those guys, if I was there. The lighting of the beacons... Wow! Some of Gimli's lines are great: "it still counts as one!" "may the best dwarf win!" :D Denethor... twisted from the start (and we never see that he's been corrupted by his Palantír, that's for the EE, I guess), but what an actor! Miranda Otto looked a lot better in this movie than she did in TTT. ;) Pippin's song, interposed with Faramir's futile charge... wow, again! Elrond: still makes me think of something like "hear that, Mr. Sauron? That is the sound of inevitability." :) And the battle of Pelennor Fields... makes Helm's Deep look like a pillow fight, or something like that. Now... still a year before the EE. Damn. :(
10.0~WOW! ric_bains Sign in Permalink A spectacular and moving conclusion based on one of the greatest epic stories ever written. Definitely one of the greatest adventures committed to celluloid. In spite of the fact the storyline was changed for the movie, Peter Jackson and all those involved have done a fantastic job in bringing this story to the big screen. I hope they bring "The Hobbit" to the big screen as well. Admittedly there were a few scenes in ROTK where the visuals were less than perfect. Overall though, the special effects were astounding. On a scale of one to ten I'd still give it an eleven.
10.0~Wow. ramspott Sign in Permalink This movie is good. It is now my all time favorite movie. I had extremely high expectations for these films. I like to read, and LOTR is my favorite book, so I didn't want them to F it up in movie form. I thought FOTR was good, but not quite as good as I was hoping. TTT was awesome, and a little better than I was hoping. ROTK is incredible, and is obviously the best movie of the three. The only thing that might make it not the highest selling movie ever is if people didn't like FOTR, or didn't see one of the other two, because you kind of need to see those to get what's going on. Ya know? Anyway, if I was going to die right now, and someone gave me the option of watching one movie before I sail into the West, it would most definitely be the Return of the King. This movie is 3 hours and 20 minutes of brilliance. The whole entire thing. IF, and I mean IF, I had to pick a scene or confrontation that I thought was the least well done, I would have to say the whole part with the dead army. I would have liked to see a bit more hopelessness with that part. But I guess when I read the book, I didn't feel hopeless there, either. I'd say the best part for me was the Crack of Doom, and the cathartic moments between Frodo and Sam before Gwaihir comes, and any time the Nazgul are cruising. Amazing. SEE THIS MOVIE. 10/10, and then some. Makes the Godfather look like the Grandfather. Makes The Empire Strikes Back look like the Phantom Menace. You get the point.
9.0~A Great Movie To Watch tyronesanders-89706 Sign in Permalink I really enjoy watching this movie with friends and family.
1.0~Why is this film in the top 250 of all time chess_rockwell Sign in Permalink This film is about a clan of midgets fighting a burnt King Aurthur. Come on now people, I know we evolved into a society of losers, but can we stop the insanity. Sergio Leones "Once upon a time in the west" is sooooooo much better. Jesus Christ would say the same!!!). Also the walking trees, what the FU**, those actors must of been like "I cant believe what were doing, this is ridiculous"!!! Don't waste your life watching this trilogy of filth. OK some of the scenery is amazing, but send Tim Burton to New Zealand with a 35mm camera and see what happens, I dare You. Stop the X-Box,Nitendo, and Gamecube crap as well, there melting people brains, there going to take over the WORLD!!!!!!!!!! You heard it here first! Were all going to die!!!! Help ME PLEASE. In conclusion Mr. Jackson "Brain Dead" is probably the greatest horror/gore film I've ever seen. So you're still the MAN!!
8.0~Part 3 in the Epic Trilogy!!! Pumpkin_Man Sign in Permalink The film begins with how Smeagol became Gollum. Later, we see Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Theoden heading to Isengard to get information out of Saruman. At Rohan, Pippin sees in the Palantir that Sauron wants to strike at Minas Tirith. Gandalf and Pippin travel there to warn them. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum continue their journey even closer to Mordor, where Gollum has a trap waiting for them. All the war scenes and beautiful scenery are awesome! Will Aragorn become King? Will Frodo destroy the ring once and for all? If you love epics, wars, and fantasies, you'll love THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING!!!
10.0~. shenagoogabloga Sign in Permalink That was one of the best movies I've seen so far... I give it a 10. Peter Jackson is a genius. Some parts were really emotional and almost made me cry, especially the end, when I realized it was the last movie of the three. It's kinda sad that it's over.
10.0~Best movie you can see cubile1 Sign in Permalink It is 2014 and I still don't get tired of seeing this movie. And by this movie I'am not referring to the third part but all of them. It is a movie that has everything you'd like to be in a movie: it is the movie with more body count (836 only in this part!!), it has action, adventure and even you could see romance between some characters.It is impossible to get bored with this film, it is full of epic quotes, epic scenes and epic wars, all this complemented with a good story. All in all, this movie deserves a 10 and in my humble opinion it is the best movie you can see ever. Many years will have to pass to see a movie better than this.
10.0~I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED bbrasher1 Sign in Permalink I went to see FELLOWSHIP and was impressed with the quality. Peter Jackson put a lot into it, and it shows. Last year, I was sure to catch TWO TOWERS on the big screen. It made FELLOWSHIP bland by comparison, which is still saying a lot. Today, I went back to the Pickwick Theater expecting ROTK to far surpass FELLOWSHIP and TWO TOWERS. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I was never a Tolkien fan, and I have yet to read the books, but for my money, this was some of the best three-and-a-half hours I have ever spent in a movie theater. I have no complaints whatsoever. The performances are superb, the character development phenomenal, the special effects virtually flawless. Tolkien would have been proud. I cannot recommend ROTK highly enough-whether you're a Tolkien fan or not. All I can say is, it would be a crime if this doesn't take home the Best Picture award tomorrow. The other contenders in comparison are nothing but steaming piles of Ork dung. Especially SEABISCUIT. Rating; ***** out of *****
10.0~A solid 10 kahfay Sign in Permalink If this is not a 10 then what is. The return of Peter Jackson is wonderful. This film contains everything. It will make you laugh, cry, cheer for the little guy and sit in awe of the beauty. The three hours goes by quickly. You won't feel that you wasted the money to see this one.
10.0~Just watch it. heidypost Sign in Permalink The BEST!!!!! A perfect slot of the triologie. What a pity that it is over now. Let's wait for the Hobbit!!! Thanks Jackson!!
9.0~Best picture academy awrd is arguable... It's a great film any ways... udanafonsseka-1 Sign in Permalink I agree to what shane has mentioned on city of god being a better contender for best pic. than return of the king. What I've realized by reading many comments on movies is that most of the critics just like to hammer and talk bad about a good film. maybe they want to feel special about them selves. Rarely you would come across a fair comment which explains the positive and negative aspects of a movie with an open mind. Nevertheless lotr is a great achievement in epic film making... level of creativity, innovation of vfx, the budget, making 3 films in a row, challenges of marketing etc. etc. + the level of acting compared to a huge movie like star wars is far better in all three movies. Peter jackson is one ,man after all....! He did a enjoyable movie for every one who admires the fantasy genre....
10.0~A great end to a great movie cycle newton7 Sign in Permalink After The Two Towers, it was difficult to imagine how Peter Jackson might out-do himself in the grand finale to Tolkien's saga. He has done - and has done so magnificently! A few minor niggles remain, mainly concerning the loss of the Saruman sequences (the banishing of Saruman by Gandalf and Saruman's surprise appearance at the end of the story in the 'Scouring of the Shire' chapter deleted from the film version)- however, this is a movie and something had to go. For the rest, one is constantly amazed at the way Jackson and his devoted team brought the story to the screen. The Shelob sequences were outstanding and the final defeat of Sauron just breath-taking. 11 Oscars? It should have won more! A great end to a great movie cycle. An unqualified 'bravo!'from all lovers of Tolkien's work.
10.0~A true masterpiece... lo_payaso Sign in Permalink What can i tell about this movie, it made me cry and feel soo many emotions, usually watching the whole trilogy once every 2 years
9.0~At Last! jc2k2003 Sign in Permalink At last, a third film in a trilogy that actually lives up to the other two! Move over Star Wars (even the original!), the pap that was the Matrix 2 and 3 and make way for the King! When waiting to see the others, there was always a sense that they may disappoint, but with ROTK you just knew that it would be great. Saw it for the first time last night and am completely overwhelmed....speachless when coming out of the cinema and will take another view before things will be clear. Small criticisms, which in no way distract from the experience, as in the theatrical cut of the Two Towers, it is rushed in places, with the occasional moment that makes you wonder what was removed for times sake. TT was a completely different film in the extended cut and one can only imagine this one in that version. Effects are top-notch all the way through, with the exception of the end in Mount Doom, where things, although better than most films, are not quite as good as the standard set by the rest of the film. As for the ending, compared to the end of the book which seems to drag on for half your life, it really is short and sweet and all you see needs to be there. Basically just go and watch it, and I bet you won't actually feel like you've been sat there for three and a half hours.....
10.0~One of the greatest epic films, if not THE greatest, to ever grace the screen Maverick300 Sign in Permalink My statement holds true. If you don't agree, go find baseball bat and beat yourself silly. Anyhow, Return of the King is the third part in Peter Jackson's epic trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The third nearly picks up where the Two Towers left off. We see the broken Fellowship making their way to end their quest to destroy the One Ring. Frodo and Sam make their way towards Mount Doom, led by the nefarious Gollum. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli take their path towards Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, where Aragorn is destined to become king. And Merry and Pippin go their separate ways; Merry travels with the Rohirrim while Pippin goes with Gandalf by a different road to Minas Tirith than Aragorn. Everything about this film is nearly perfect. The characters, the dialogue, the scenery, all done in the most professional manner I have ever witnessed. The movie truly shines during the battle scenes. These scenes (particulary Pelennor Fields) are some of the largest battles ever witnessed on film. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY! And ultimately this movie is really all about Sam. I mean this guy owns the last 3/4 of the film! WARNING: you may need some Kleenex for that part of the movie! To sum it up, Return of the King is one of the greatest epics ever. Out of the three films, this one is truly the finest. Overall, this film is a serious contender to other greats out there. I very highly recommend buying this movie immediately! It is worth the 3h 20min of film. If your very enthusiastic, go buy the Extended Editions of all three films! P.S. Best to view this movie on some big screen t.v. with surround sound. Especially when it reaches the Battle of Pelennor Fields, you will want something with a kick!
10.0~Peter Jackson´s contribution to the mankind eccs2003 Sign in Permalink I really don´t have words to say about this masterpiece,there´s emotion in every frame of it,you can feel the heart and the passion of the actors,and most off all,the movie is honest. It´s not a blockbuster cash machine,without plotline,with "songs-to-make-you-cry".No,this piece of fine art is simply the best movie of the last ten years,if you doubt,go and see for yourself. The fellowship of the ring is a great movie,the two towers is a great movie too,with more action,but this one really makes you fly,when the title appears and the music starts,there´s no countryes anymore,we are all together in the same expectation:"Will this movie be greater than the first two"? In the first twenty minutes i noticed that this one is the best.The Smeagol story is a great start,a wonderful idea.There are some moments in the movie that i will never forget,i can´t say to you ,you have to see for yourselves,there´s one with Sam and Frodo near the end,when Sam seeing Frodo almost fading out,he...no,i can´t say,words can´t describe this amazing scene. I really want to say some words about this genious,mr.Peter Jackson. If you don´t win the Academy award this year,mr.Jackson,i will never watch the Oscars again.This movie will be remembered forever,and you will be remembered as well,as:The man that made a whole generation smile,cry,cheer and,most of all,dream again. Speaking for my country,i say:Long live to Peter Jackson,..Long live to the King!
9.0~An Unbelievable and Unmatched cinematic experience - Spoilers wirestone Sign in Permalink And it was an incredible thrill to watch it. The cinematography of The Return of the King dwarfs everything and anything that came before it, including even The Two Towers. The battle scenes are exhilarating to watch, and unlike the siege of Helm's Deep which takes place mostly in the dark of the night, the battles at Minas Tirith and the Black Gate happen during the day, and you can marvel at every little detail on screen. Compare to the claustrophobic underground city of Zion in Matrix Revolution, the open plains of Gondor are just far more grandiose to look at. Just like the end of The Two Towers, when the Rohirrim riders charge into thousands of Orcs, I couldn't help but feel my own blood boiling. Yet the giant spider Shelob is still more terrifying than all the orcs, trolls, mammoths, including even Aragog, the giant spider in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. There are so many elements in Book V and VI of The Lord of the Rings, I was afraid that a lot of story would be pushed away by the special effects. I should've trusted Peter Jackson and the actors to know better, as the acting is top-notch and the plotlines never seem rushed. A couple of times, I even feel the movie drags a little, but that's a very minor complaint. There are couple of things missing in the movie, and I'm positive that would show up in the extended version of the DVD. One is the fate of Saruman and Grima Wormtongue is not revealed, in fact, both are MIA in the final chapter of the movie, contrary to the book. Second is the relationship between Eowyn and Faramir is also undeveloped, leaving yet another open subplot. Third is how the Rohirrims arrives at Minas Tirith with the help of the Woses, the Wild Men of the Woods. Then there's Denethor, who, in the extended edition of The Two Towers, reveals that he wants the ring for himself and hopes that Boromir would retrieve it. However, since Faramir releases Frodo and Sam to destroy the ring, he feels betrayed by his son. This would better explaine his behaviour later on, but is cut for obvious reasons. Some minor characters and story elements are cut, like Beregond and the Scouring of the Shire. Of course, adding the last few chapters of the book to the movie will drag it way too long and totally interrupts its flow. Some final thoughts: As I watch men, elves and dwarf knee before the four small hobbits, I realize that even though Frodo and Sam are the ones who destroy the One Ring, both Merry and Pippin are also instrumental in the battle against Sauron ¨C they convince the ents to fight against Saruman the White, Pippin helps Gandalf to defend Minas Tirith and saves Faramir's life and Merry helps Eowyn to slay the ringwraith leader Nazgul. All are heroes whom would've been brushed aside at first glance. Bravo!
10.0~Awesome! Worth seeing again and again! royhamlin Sign in Permalink As I exited from the premier showing, I could not get over the storyline from beginning to end. Most sequels get worse, but these are built on each other culminating in the final episode being the best of all three. Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Arwen, Theoden and the whole cast could never have realized the epic they were creating for all. These three movies will go down as the best series, fantasy, action films of all time. Like the books that became timeless, JRR Tolkien story was created visually by Peter Jackson for all to dive into and live through. The best movie and trilogy ever.
9.0~This unbelievable masterpiece will live on in the history of greatest films ever produced! danielmiller1985 Sign in Permalink This unbelievable masterpiece will live on in the history of greatest films ever produced! I consider the film to set a new level of special effects that probably no other film could emulate. Every battle scene is a gob smacker to the wide open eyes of everyone that has the pleasure to see one of the greatest films ever. The only criticism in the whole film is sometimes its so dream like, (I know the genre is fantasy), and also there is about 5 different endings which by the end really drag on and are quite cheesy at times. Also as you will notice the film is far far far too long to sit in comfort, but that's far enough of the bad points and there is really no other negative point of the whole production. The third one of the trilogy really ends it in a way that no one could do any better. I have seen loads of films in my time that have many amazing special effects but none really compare to this spectacular third instalment. The 3 Best Main trilogy's ever are The Matrix, Lord of the Rings and The Terminator, but as a huge Matrix fan I personally consider The Matrix to collect the gold medal followed by Lord of the Rings collecting Silver and finally The Terminator collecting bronze, but of course all three are completely stunning. But a few final words of advice be prepared to see one of the longest films in recent years, but trust me it's damn sure worth every second, so God Bless The Lord of the Rings!!!.
10.0~Funniest ROTK moment Bluddymonkey Sign in Permalink (slight spoiler) By FAR the funniest scene in this movie is when Frodo wakes up (after being rescued off the magma-surrounded rock) to the laughter of Gandalf as Merry and Pippin come charging in and appear to tickle and otherwise molest Frodo with joy. Enter Gimlee, clapping cheerily. Whaaa-aaaat??! I almost died. My favorite is Merry jumping on the bed. Honorable mention: "Still counts as one!" -Gimlee
10.0~Amazing movie giselemedeiroseng Sign in Permalink This movie is the best ending that The Lord of the Rings could ever have. I watched it today and i am just impressed about it. Masterpiece!! My rating 10/10
8.0~the most thrilling war franchise veriena Sign in Permalink In my opinion "the lord of the rings"is one of the most if it wasn't the most successful franchsie in the mean while,the war that the cast perform they roles and the narrating of the story events make you super excited and put you in the events. and also the graphics and the many places where the story takes place prevents you from getting pored easily which happens when there is few places in the story ,but it shortens in the unexpectedness as there many events you can figures it out in your own .. this is my own opinion and every one has his own taste .
10.0~One of the best movies of all time GLouise0317 Sign in Permalink This was one of the most brilliant films I have ever watched. It had everything you could have asked for in a movie and more. I could watch this movie a million times, and still be in awe and shed plenty of tears. This movie helped me learn so much about so many things including myself. I would recommend this movie to anyone whether or not you have read the books or if you don't like fantasy.
10.0~wow anonymou38 Sign in Permalink i sat in awe when i watched this movie. at about 20 different times i just sat and there said "holy f**k". it took words away from me. it doesn't follow the book perfectly, but who cares? this is what movies are supposed to be. as a trilogy, this is the best one out there. it edges out the original star wars in my mind because it stayed consistently good the whole way through, where as star wars didn't. this is the best movie i've ever seen
1.0~This movie absolutely SUCKED! upshaw_se Sign in Permalink Waste of my time and money (and the studio's). Multiple endings were irritating. Battle scenes gave me motion sickness. Women's roles were disgraceful. No plot. Overdone computer graphics. Popcorn and coke were good.
10.0~Wonderful conclusion - not perfect, but excellent. sak007 Sign in Permalink Saw this in Minneapolis as part of the Carleton College fund raiser. Barrie Osborne (one of the three primary producers, along with Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh) is the Carleton grad who helped make this event possible. He truly is an exceptional person -- which comes through immediately upon meeting him. Without his intellect, skill, and ability to overcome logistical nightmares and get the most out of people, it is questionable whether this prodigious achievement would ever have become a reality. Although expectations were impossible to meet, the movie on its first viewing is still exceptional. I am quite sure that it will improve with additional viewings. The first 15 minutes and the last 30 minutes are superb with the middle 2.5 hours very, very good -- though so loaded with action and plot advancement (as in the book), it is extraordinarily difficult to appreciate fully. I am not going to give any details because I don't want to spoil it for others, but, suffice it to say, that it is a must see because of the superb story, emotional impact and phenomenal cinematic achievement. Some random thoughts -- Sean Astin must seriously be considered for a supporting actor nomination. Gandalf (through the masterful Ian McKellan) combines the warmth of the Fellowship while exceeding his warrior excellence in the Two Towers. Gollum/Andy Serkis continues to amaze. The writing, direction and attention to detail are astounding. Peter Jackson's accomplishment is without peer. Is it perfect? No. (More special effects than I would have liked -- although probably unavoidable.) Would I like to have seen some things improved upon? Yes -- and I fully expect they will be in next year's extended edition DVD which will make this movie a 10.
10.0~The best movie ever made aragorn53 Sign in Permalink In my opinion, The Return of the King is the best movie of the history. The cast, the history and the special effects are great. Peter Jackson did an amazing job. I feel really grateful that The Return of the King has finally been considered by critics as the best movie of the year. However, I think that the critics should have nominated at least an actor of the movie. Sir Ian Mckellen and Sean Astin did a great job and they should have been nominated. I am really expecting the release of The Return of the King DVD, so I can have that amazing story in my hands
10.0~Best movies ever! matthew-801 Sign in Permalink -SPOILER WARNING! THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!- I first read the Lord of the Rings books in third grade. Saw the movies not long after. I love them both. The LOTR trilogy is easily the best book-to-movie adaption I have ever seen. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be Return of the King, but I consider the trilogy one long book/movie in three pieces. I found no flaw in any of the books, nor with the movies, except for one picky little thing that's really just me in the Fellowship movie. Peter Jackson and many others brought the Lord of the Rings to life on the silver screen better than anyone else could have. The movies are long, to be sure, but they are so wonderful and absorbing that it's worth every second. I cannot praise these highly enough, but I'll try. First off, the cast. Completely perfect and beyond. If I had to pick out a single favorite, it would be Ian McKellan as Gandalf, but I still love everybody. The whole Fellowship is perfectly suited to their roles. Elijah Wood is extremely convincing (and sometimes creepy) as Frodo, and Viggo Mortensen is superb as the rugged, hard, yet inwardly confused and gentle Aragorn, just to name two that I thought were especially good. Another was Sean Astin as Sam. I just love it in the Fellowship when Frodo gets in the boat and starts to row off. "Sam, I'm going to Mordor alone." "Of course you are! And I'm comin' with you!" My God. Merry and Pippin are laugh-out-loud funny, and of course have all the intelligence of a brick, yet they do it very well. Orlando Bloom is the perfect Legolas, and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli is also brilliant. Gimli, I thought, was somewhat like Merry and Pippin with a beard and an axe. Lastly, Sean Bean as Borormir. He actually, in my opinion, delivered the best performance. Boromir constantly has a slightly crazed look in his eyes, and it flares every time he sees the Ring. So when he dies, you really feel it, and can't help cheering Aragorn all the way as he cuts off the Uruk's maggot-ridden head. And the other characters are just as good. Cate Blanchette and Hugo Weaving are wonderful as Galadriel and Elrond, the two elven rulers. Hugo Weaving is particularly great, seeking to shelter Arwen from any harm and make her leave, yet, I think, slightly reluctant to give up hope completely. Liv Tyler as Arwen is also great, though she never does much more than look pretty. Still, if you want someone to just stand there and look pretty, pick Liv Tyler. And the men (and woman) of the West: Denethor, Faramir, Eowyn, Eomer, and Theoden, are perfection. Denethor is the slimiest tick-infested, low -down biased deuchbag ever to walk Middle-Earth. And kudos to John Noble, 'cause not many people could make you hate them that much. Faramir endures Denethor with a pained resolve, which sometimes causes him to behave irrationally. But he has great self-restraint. If I were him, I would've chopped off Denethor's head when I was a toddler. What a ********! Eowyn is much like Faramir: Reckless, ambitious, and has to endure one of the people closest to her not even knowing who she is. Eomer is also great, though he doesn't have a ton of character development to work with. Not so with Theoden. Bernard Hill did the best anyone could do, and you feel his death almost as much as Boromir's. Finally, the villains. Lawrence Makoare makes a very menacing Witch-King and Gothmog, but he can't do much apart from look ugly and smash stuff. (You see Gothmog's teeth and you wish Sauron was a dentist.) Christopher Lee is also great as Saruman (has he ever played a good guy in his life?) Same with Brad Dourif as Wormtongue. (Where's the nearest sink?!) And the plot. They stuck with the book's storyline almost completely for the whole trilogy, making only a few alterations and cuts, and I think some of the former were actually better than in the book, like the elves at Helm's Deep. (I never quite got who the heck those mountain men were in the book.) And the music! Quite possibly the best score I've ever heard for a movie! Ba-Da-Duuuuuum! Dum-Dum-Dum-Dum-Dum! Every note is perfect. Overall, read the books and see the movies! Then do it again. And again. And again and again forever and ever. P.S. Get the extended editions for the movies. They're much better.
10.0~Best Movie Ever, Bar None swanmj Sign in Permalink The entire Lord of the Rings saga deserves to be immortalized as such an epic incarnation of great fantasy. This whole trilogy was the reason why I became interested in the fantasy genre as a young adult. I remember seeing The Two Towers and The Return of the King when they were respectively being released in theaters. Both of the movies blew me away. They were unlike anything I had ever seen in my life. This was a driving force to me, because now I wanted to read not only the Lord of the Rings and other Tolkien books, but also the R. A. Salvatore and Dark Sun World books. This was such an influential movie to me, and I hope that it is movies like this that are passed on to the next generation. Good acting, epic battle scenes, convincing dialogue, well-done settings, and an awesome story all comprise the entire LOTR trilogy. I say this as a die-hard fan of the fantasy genre, first baptized by Lord of the Rings!
3.0~Pretty Good Ending---6/10 Sfpsycho415 Sign in Permalink Some of the more devoted and insane people will claim this movie perfect and what-not, but it is pretty good. Return of the King concludes the trilogy in a battle-packed finish. When i heard the movie was 3 and a half hours long, i was skeptical that i could keep my interest, but the pacing is done well for the most of the three hours and then crawls for the final 30 minutes. It just didn't know when to end. I never read the books, but i'm sure you can't cram every detail into a feature-length film. Other than that and the fact it tried to be too emotional, it delivered exactly what it should: an entertaining conclusion. The battle scenes were fast and furious and there were some very suspenseful moments. However, it is really nothing more than a good trilogy. Some people are taking it way too far. But that's just my opinion. 6/10
7.0~Gollum disappoints! Pippin doesn't. Growlyted Sign in Permalink Gollum & Pippin are my favourite characters in the books. While Gollum was superb in Towers, he was surprisingly weak here. (Except for the opening & the "wouldn't harm a fly" scene.) The remainder were disappointing. The Gollum/Smeagol exchange was a pale reflection of the one in Towers. ('scuse pun) Even the sequence I most love, "Sneaking!" seemed to lack something. (See animation for better rendering.) All respect to Andy. That voice is incredible. I just felt they could have been done better, given more time. Pippin however was marvellous. He finally got the screen time he deserves, rather than just being comic relief. In fact he gets far more to do here than in the text, thankfully. A true hero. I'm an arachnophobe so I confess to having my eyes shut during certain scenes. I'm not a battle fan so I only paid attention to scenes involving hobbits. The other characters don't hold my interest. (This isn't the fault of the actors. They're just like the book. I simply prefer the hobbits & ents.) Weighing up the evidence I award ROTK ......... 6/10
9.0~Now I understand. Spuzzlightyear Sign in Permalink For the longest time, I had no idea why 'Lord Of the Rings: Return Of The King" (ROTK) won all these awards and was #3 on the IMDb #250. Well, duh, I guess I had to see the beast didn't I, then maybe I would. I had seen the previous 2, albeit, I am sure I saw both on DVD, and once again, I chose to skip it at the theater, and see it at home. I am not the biggest Sci-Fi/Fantasy guy in the world, so this was a great place to see it. After watching it, yes, I'll agree, this WAS a great movie that deserved every award that it got. Full of amazing vistas, amazing battle scenes, and plenty of eye candy, we can only thank New Line for entrusting Peter Jackson with this tri-project (when his last two movies were The Frighteners and Heavenly Creatures, not exactly heavy sci fi lore). Anyways, I am sure you know the whole story leading up to it, eg, Will Frodo and company be victorious in their quest of getting rid of a piece of jewelry everyone wants? Funny how I've recently seen 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' and laughing at Elijah Wood's character (he was so good in that), and then returning to his elfin character here. I am sure Elijah will be just fine in getting other movie roles. Ian Mckellan is fine as well as Gandalf, but oddly, his character hardly changes in the movies (well, except the first one, when he's a prisoner in Mordor Castle). Viggo Mortensen plays the mini-hype machine the movies gave him (and quickly crashed with Hidalgo), and he's quite fun to watch here, although there's not much emotion coming from him as well. As a matter of fact, the only characters that were allowed to show emotion here it appears were the elves. And you wonder why there weren't any acting awards given to these films.. Technically, the movie is a godsend, full of interesting sets, animations and cgi effects, the movie sends up a lot of great movie battles (namely Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi). The battle scenes, as you probably know, are just awesome, with a blend in of CGI and real actors so seamless, it's hard to tell whats what. So, yes, I did enjoy it, even though the first 45 minutes is filled with magical gobbledygook, the remaining 3 hours were fun, albeit, it WAS 3 hours. So yeah! Best picture! Absolutely! #3 out of 250? well, that's stretching it.
1.0~awful michelordo Sign in Permalink This movie is a pain.Simply horrible, boring, too long, bad acting, bad writing.Pratically i don' t save nothing of this pile of garbage.The fake-looking special effects are some of the worst i have ever seen.The sad thing is that this overrated turkey won so many Oscar:quite a testament of the low level of the academy awards.Terrible.The editing is a complete mess, the only saving grace are the wonderful New Zealnd landscapes.How many ending it had? 10, 20, come on, it's simply laughable.In conclusion, a very bad and overrated movie.Another thing:this movie is number 3 of all the time? IMDb webmaster, it's time to change the IMDb vote modalities.
10.0~Film making at its most daring... CubsandCulture Sign in Permalink Jackson's splendid adaptation of the Lord of the Rings comes to a fitting conclusion in this multifaceted emotionally draining work. I could discuss how every aspect of the production is utterly engrossing. The best feature of this trilogy is the way in which the film transports you to middle-earth as a fully alternative reality. I could discuss the great cast, several of whom give career defining performances; and how they each give operatic and Shakespearean performances that are really work. Or I could discuss the complexity of the screen story and the script largely preserves the board outline of a great myth. But I rather discuss how this film is incredibly daring. Jackson pushed the then cutting edge special effects to the breaking point. (Indeed a few dozen shots standout as just beyond the tech's ability). But more than that he risked much by breaking the rules. There are model shots that last for over a minute. There are CGI shots with hundreds of elements. Certain excesses in the design, i.e. the witchking's mace, are so strident and so stark they could have fallen into camp. And yet Jackson dared to go there because he knew it would work. And work it does. But beyond that Jackson and company wrestled with a highly complicated text that is riddled with issues that could have sunk an adaptation. Large swaths of the book don't work on screen (or on the page in some cases). This film makes the necessary changes because Jackson and company dared to stand up to criticism. It is a remarkable testament to Jackson's convictions that he took on this project at all. This is a grand film.
10.0~Best epic movie I've ever seen seven_productions Sign in Permalink This is the best epic trilogy I've ever watched. I want to see Salmarion book of Talkin and battle with the Sauron...more about The Lord of the rings.
10.0~the best film ever! ktgahagan22 Sign in Permalink I saw the LORT Trilogy on Trilogy Tuesday. It was a great experience to wach all three films in the theatre in order. Plus i got to see the ROTK before it opened nationwide. This was one of the best acting that i have seen from a cast of great actors especially Elijah Wood & Sean Astin.
10.0~Epic heonke Sign in Permalink You do not need much to understand the movie to understand what Jackson did a herculean job, starting with a rigorous selection of the actors and ending with realistic scenery, computer graphics skillfully diluted. That came to an end, the greatest, ambitious and epic story of Middle- earth. All three films have flown in the same breath, despite the fact that going for 3 hours. I'll be very bored through Middle-earth, Shire, will miss on all the characters, and of course will never forget this great trilogy. I will definitely reconsider. It's so epic, big, exciting, touching film that just simply absorb the viewer completely. I never tire of praising the entire production team, each person put his hand in creating this trilogy. All 11 Academy Awards, have been obtained absolutely deserved. The film is made up of an incredible amount of detail, all those who participated in making the film the big fellows also like to mention the excellent music by Howard Shore, who sinks into the heart. Those who are of Middle- earth was not enough, I suggest to get acquainted with a new trilogy of Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit."
10.0~Excellent...but... mtdavies Sign in Permalink Anyone who has read Tolkien's book knows that Peter Jackson took some dramatic license. Its obvious he's a fan of JRR's Book and does well to keep much of the story intact. I do however wish he would have kept "The cleansing of the Shire" with all of its disturbing bits as well as its joyful and hopeful moments. The ending is not what it was intended to be and I wish he'd made an alternate ending. I do however like the pageantry of the coronation and the recognition of the hobbits as the saviors they were. It show well how the littlest person can make the biggest difference which is one of Professor Tolkien's themes in the book. It isn't often that a movie is good enough to live up to the book. The three movies as a whole do that and more. Where they come up short they more than make up for it in other ways. Great job Peter Jackson & the entire cast.
9.0~A remarkable end to a classy trilogy Dragoneyed363 Sign in Permalink WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment. To tell the truth, I was actually very sad when I finished this film because it meant the fun of the Lord of the Rings series was over. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was no doubt about it the best movie in the series and an excellent way to end a wonderful, captivating adventure. The acting from all three was A+, the suspense was A+, the battle sequences A+, and everything else was practically perfect in a sense, and I enjoyed it from beginning to end because of how well done it was. I loved how this movie makes you actually notice how all the characters have roughly changed through out their journey and how most of them's true colors show in this final film. Plus, the whole thing about Frodo writing a book and letting Sam be able to finish the last pages was an awesome script choice. I also loved how Smeagol takes a turn for the worse and battles it out with Frodo for the ring. Everything about The Lord of the Rings series is absolutely wonderful and this movie is incredibly incredible. I watched all three in one day, when I wasn't even expecting to like the first one, and now I consider them superb and well worth all the acclaim they receive. They'll remain in my mind for years to come, and I plan on watching them many more times in my life. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I love the Lord of the Rings!
10.0~One of the greatest movies ever made neonwolf Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson and Wingnut films have created what may very well be the best movie trilogy in history. And, having just seen all three movies in a row at a marathon showing, I find it safe to say that The Return of the King is the very best of the lot. It goes all out on the technical level, outclassing just about everything else out there, but it also showcases Jackson's talent as a filmmaker. The final chapter of The Lord of the Rings is tightly cut, stunningly beautiful, well acted, and captures the essence of the book it's based on so brilliantly, it's uncanny. I say this both as a film student and a literature student. However, if you find this movie to be seriously flawed, you have a problem with Tolkien's source text, and not with Jackson's adaptation of it. This is perfectly reasonable; after all, high fantasy is not everyone's cup of tea, even though everybody seems to like these movies, or pretend that they do, because that's what you're supposed to these days. I say it's a matter of taste, but I really doubt there will be many that dislike this extremely impressive film. Purists will notice a lot of changes in the storyline, just like with the two previous chapters, and find this somewhat annoying. I felt like that with the first movie, but then I realized that these changes are implemented purely for cinematic reasons. After all, if what we wanted was a perfect rendition of the trilogy in every little detail, why not just read the books instead? Some things just don't work on film, and we're lucky that Peter Jackson knows this very, very well. I also like the way he dares to add extra bits not present in the books. If you still think that the movie is missing some parts along the way, well, you will most likely find them present in the forthcoming Extended Edition. That, however, does not mean you should not see the current version. It feels very much complete as it is. I give it my highest acclaim.
10.0~So it comes to the climax ... npr77 Sign in Permalink This movie is groundbreaking. We've seen the good acting, heard the brilliant soundtrack, and have been banned to our seats by the amazing movie making before. Without spoiling I just can tell you that you have seen 'but a taste of the terror that [Peter Jackson] will unleash'. Just one hint. Go to a BIG movie theater with a GOOD sound system and reserve the BEST seats. This piece of art does deserve nothing less. And for those complaining about missing/edited scenes - wait for the Extended Edition. Even though the movie already runs for more than three hours there is a lot potential for additional material. We haven't been disappointed before, have we, my precioussss? Nick P. (December 10th 2003, European Premiere Berlin)
9.0~Worthy of the King *SPOILERS* heathermalone Sign in Permalink I am fresh back from ROTK and still on sensory overload. I have to start with a small disclaimer. Seated next to my husband and I were 2 teenage boys with severe ADD and were quite rude, and distracted my concentration on the film quite a bit during the emotional scenes with there snide comments and sounds. It annoyed me to the point of compromising some of my enjoyment of the film. I suppose that is the price of seeing a film on opening night. First off, I did LOVE the film. It is a fine achievement for PJ and a fine conclusion to some of the best film making witnessed in the history of filmmaking. There were moments of sheer tension, terror, joy and love unparalleled by any film of its genre and most movies period. I was so impressed with the opening with Smeagol, the battle of PF, the Paths of the Dead, Shelob as well a the destruction of the ring sequence. It took a while to get cranking to high-end drama but there was never a boring moment. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin were AMAZING and deserve Oscar nods. I also was moved by Billy Boyd's performance and Pippin's song. Dom Monaghan was also rock solid. Gollum was technically uncompromised and perfect. Ian's Gandalf also took center stage and dazzled. My problems are mostly with the editing as I felt the pacing was off in some of the committed high points of the book such as the fall of Sauron and the Ascension of Aragorn. These I felt could have been tightened up and capitalized on more. I know I sound whiny by complaining that some of the emotional highs of the trailer went missing in the movie. While I did not miss Saruman's end as some did, I missed the Houses of the Healing and I felt the presentation of the Sword of the King was a weak spot. It seemed at point you could feel PJs frustration with having to edit the film down for run time in some abrupt cuts and scenes. Viggo REALLY need more airtime he almost got relegated to a supporting role, and the end, end, end was a bit drawn out. I was disappointed that PJ chose to alter the casting of the ring into the fire. He should have left that alone. I fully expected to cry my face off but didn't. I still don't know if the chatty idiots sitting next to me were partially responsible for that. A lot of others in the theater cried like babies for the last hour and I was jealous. I wanted to cry, and be moved by ROTK like that. I fully intend to see it again when the crowds die down and I can see it in a quieter setting and hope that it will strike me the way it should. Folks cheered and laughed and bawled and clapped and hooted and hollered all the way through, no other film that I have seen in the theater has evoked that kind of crowd response and emotion. People clapped wildly at the end. It was kind of beautiful. All I can say is I cannot WAIT for the Extended version. PJ could make it 6 hours and I wouldn't blink. Overall it was mostly freakin' fantastic.
10.0~Unprecedented Masterpiece blenderlg Sign in Permalink This film is the culmination of a tour de force. It will be a long time before any other trilogy of this magnitude comes out, and it will be a long time before any film can match "The Return of the King." This shows what even the most unassuming director can do if he is guided by his passion and artistic integrity. The extended version is awesome! There are lots of cool new scenes, like Gandalf's confrontation with the Witch King of Angmar, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli's spooky trip through the corridors of the dead--John Rhys Davies adds a humorous element to this scene when he tries to blow away the ghostly hands that are grabbing at him. The acting by all characters is superb. The music goes splendidly with the film, and the visual effects are breathtaking. "The Return of the King" can be watched over and over again, and it is just as moving every time. Of course this is some pretty intense stuff, taxing on the emotions, but that is why the movie is so great. It is a wild ride that takes the viewers' hearts and mind through every twist and turn of this last and grueling leg of a long, long journey to destroy the One Ring forever. The few complaints about this movie are generally directed at the many so-called "endings." Even Jack Nicholson complained to Elijah Wood about this. I personally think, however, that the film would not have been as good without the thorough closure that the last few scenes bring to the viewer. Bravo Peter Jackson, and all those involved with "The Lord of the Rings." Because so much went in to this film, more than can ever be fathomed just by watching the "Return of the King." The actors and producers put forth exhausting efforts to create this masterpiece. The makeup crew, the miniature team, the visual effects team, the musicians, and the stunt team all worked so hard to create this truly awesome movie. They be thanked enough for creating this lasting work of art. Bravo and thank you to all.
10.0~This is the end... zaff_ Sign in Permalink This is the end of a great adventure, epic and movie. Return of the King is just amazing. It has it all. Action, drama, horror, comedy, adventure, tears, emotions, friendship and most of all - hope. Peter Jackson has succeeded. Period. We have now been given his version of Tolkien's great work. And his achievement is almost as great as ol' J.R.R. With a combination of an awesome cast, WETA digital studio and everyone else involved in this huge project they have all created movie history, for people like you and me. To watch Return of the King on the big screen (and that's where it should be seen) is a delight. I can't even remember when I had so many different emotions in one single movie. Oh wait, maybe last Christmas...and the Christmas before that. However, the Lord of the Rings is one single movie. Let's start with Shelob. Amazing work there. I usually don't get scared when watching spiders, but she freaked me out. Gollum looked even better (how's that possible?) than The Two Towers, you really hate him this time. Away is all the pity for that little weasel. Sam really grows in this part, here's our real hero. I wish he would get really reconized for his role. The whole battle of Pelennor Fields was AMAZING. I sat on the edge of my seat the whole time, with my jaw dropped down. It actually followed the book really good there, like the scene with Eowyn and the Nazgul. Minas Tirith was just beautiful done, and alot of airviews of it. This is why I go to the cinema, you can't experience this movie-magic on your own TV. The flow of The Return of the Great was great. Not many slow parts at all, this must have been the fastest 3 h 20 minutes in my life. The only minor complaints are some missing scenes that will hopefully show up on the Extended Edition. A great ending of a fantastic story. Thank you again Peter Jackson.
10.0~THE BIGGEST, LONGEST AND SIMPLY GREATEST FILM EVER MADE!! thomazz_1989 Sign in Permalink THE LORD OF THE RINGS changed my life. When the first one came out in December 2001 I didn't even bother to see it. From the looks of the trailer this was just another fantasy film, which I by the way don't like very much. so I didn't see the first one until I borrowed it from a friend who just got it, this was in September I think 2002. I saw the film and knew right after the first scenes that this is a film to remember. And it was just then I found out that this was just the first film of three and that it was based upon an old book. My mom happened to have an old copy from 1973, but I didn't want to read it cause then I would spoil the next films.I give it 6/6 stars. When THE TWO TOWERS came out in December the same year I just had to see it. I got to say I had high hopes for this one and I was not disappointed, not by a long shot. This one was even better than the last one. I like realistic pictures right, so it seemed as this one was a lot more realistic than the first. THE TWO TOWERS was very medieval. The new Riders of Rohan and king Theoden were very medieval. And like every good medieval film it featured a battle. A very impressive one too. Ya know, if I gave the first one 6/6 stars and I think this one is better, what should I give it? Actually I give it 7/6 stars. After waiting an entire year for the final piece of the puzzle. I go to the movies expecting a phenomenal film, actually the best film ever. And I can tell you THE RETURN OF THE KING is perfect. it made my cry. In fact in multiple parts of the film.I give this one 8/6 stars. Final result: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING + THE TWO TOWERS + THE RETURN OF THE KING = THE BIGGEST, LONGEST AND SIMPLY GREATEST FILM EVER MADE!! I consider it the best, but I'm not alone. This film (it's actually one film just in three parts) made almost 3 billion dollars, earned 17 Academy Awards + multiple other awards around the globe, and is probably the film with the most Fans, if not STAR WARS have more. THE LORD OF THE RINGS changed my life, I've gotten a lot more in to film, I saw movies like LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, GANDHI, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, SEVEN SAMURAI and I've also started watching Scorsese films, Robert De Niro is my favourite actor and now I'm making amateur films with friends. + it even got me to read more. Final summary: Just don't you dare miss it! P.S. Remember to buy the long versions, or should I say the real versions. The theatrical versions should really be called the short versions. Remember this is not a 9 hour film it's a 12 hour film!
10.0~Great finish to an epic trilogy (Possible spoilers) ncoakl01 Sign in Permalink i would like to say that this film is truely a good conclusion to the lord of the rings trilogy. furthermore, Peter Jackson's direction of the movie's was also great. with that said i would like to move on. i have heard a surprising amount of negative things about this movie from many people and truthfuly i am dumb founded by this. First i would like to address those who have said that the film has no plot, to these people i would like to say that i dont think they know what a plot is. Spoilers it seems to me like steady movement through sequences motivated by some identified purpose would constitute a plot. perhaps i saw a different version of the film, but in the one i watched Sam and Frodo were attempting to destroy the one ring, while at the same time avoiding the dark forces of Mordor. Then there are the other characters, the remains of the fellowship. they are on a quest to prevent the free worlds of middle earth from being overtaken by Sauron and his minions. perhps that is not enough, there are also the themes of the movie that run throughout the plot to strengthen it. for example the theme of trust and companionship that can be found in the Sam and Frodo section. this theme not only helps to strengthen the plot by providing depth and motive but also provides the story with critical character developement. Another point that some have found it important to critisize are the battles. these individuals claim that these battles are all the same and that they are boring. well in response to that i would say that to find the battles boring you shouldn't have watched the movie in the first place, the movie is about war what would you expect. continuing on the two main battles in LOTR trilogy are far from the same. the battles take place in vastly differnt locations with different heros and different enemies. furthermore the purpose of the battles are completly different. Finally, others have argued that LOTR 3 was not deserving of 11 academy awards, claiming that other movies were infact better. well, in america, american style movies win best picture. if you love anything that comes out in a european arts cinema move to france. i do not mean to say there is anything wrong with films like 21 grams or lost in translation, these films can be really great and in fact they are. but just because the styles are different does not mean that one is worse or that it is a lower form of cinema, though there is plenty of that. In conclusion stating that lord of the rings: return of the king has no plot or themes or development is just petty, you dont have to attack good american cinema in order to be a psuedo-intellectual.
10.0~An epic saga. A magnificent feat. Unprecedented. wayne-107 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's gut-wrenching, bone shattering conclusion to this massive three-part epic has it all. It succeeds everywhere, and stands out as the best of the three movies. Now familiar characters grow and mature. The plot quickens, and then races to its thrilling conclusion. What else can be said? Go see this movie, then take a deep breath and see it again.
10.0~The most visually stunning experience you will ever have Green_Acres Sign in Permalink After about 5 years since seeing The Return of the King, I finally saw it again, and I saw it like I had never seen it before. I had never been a big fan of the trilogy, basically because I was young, and I had never really gotten 'into' them, but now, I was able to see it in a whole different light. First off, I will start with it's visuals. They were just amazing, and based on how many visuals it had, it is probably the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. Sure, there were just little flaws in them, only like when the hobbits had to be reduced to size, but other than that, the visual effects is flawless. The tone of the film really lets us experience a whole new world, so it's Art Direction Oscar win is of course, very well deserved. It's costumes and make-up are simply amazing. This is a top-notch film for anything possible. What I also really liked, that it has garnered much fan and critical acclaim, is that, it is a fantasy,action,epic war film. The Fellowship of the Ring was more fantasy, and The Two Towers was more war/epic, and this 3rd one has all those elements put together. The weakness of The Two Towers was that it had too much lingering in dialogues with characters we hardly knew, and were hardly given development to, and the editing in the 2nd I thought was very choppy. Well, the editing is this film, has improved about 100%. It is edited in the right moments. What is amazing, is that we are able to go from scenes with Frode,Sam, and Gollum, and then to scenes in Minas Tirith, to Aragorn and Gandalf. The acting from all of these actors is well-suited for a 'big' film like this. Even the acting from the Hobbits(which is sometimes over done) seems like for this film it needs to be done. Andy Serkis, who plays Gollum's voice and movements, should have gotten an Oscar nomination, for he created probably the most memorable creature of the last decade. Overall, the 11 Oscars this film won were all very well deserved. It is not overrated in any way, because the amount of work and the amount of risks that had to be taken to do this film is incredible, and I believe this film will always be remembered as the mother of all epic films.
1.0~IS THIS A JOKE? HSaid Sign in Permalink wat the hell is good about this movie? its too streched out, silly, stupid ending, every second you think its going to end but NOOOOOOOOOO one more scene to go...too long for nothing, 3 hours can be smidged into an hour and a half...the pervious 2 are much better...that film is SOSOSOSOSOS OVERRATED its pathetic
10.0~I've waited for this since 1975 armandocourtois Sign in Permalink Excellent...what more can I say ? I read the Hobbit and LOTR when I was about 15 years old (for the first time) and re-read this magnificent story several times. I saw the Ralph Bakshi version (only part 1) beginning of 1980 and found it worthless...but at the same time I was happy someone tackled the idea of creating the story for everyone to see. Peter Jackson is a magician and will remain one of my favourite people of all-time. Star Wars is nice...but LOTR is so much more ! Peter Jackson for PreZZZZZ !!!!
10.0~GREATEST CINEMA's HISTORY EVENT DavidCarey Sign in Permalink How wonderful when you went to the theater for this movies and 4 hours later you walked out with such a good feeling and simply forgot to realize that 4 hours had passed.This is such an amazing experience. The movie is such a great epic with good and evil, great battle, spectacle landscape, characters with great spirit. From one of the greatest books, which had many details, the masterful adaptation of Jackson and Co bring them all to life without loosing the heart. The visual presentation is breathtaking, sure you have never seen things like this before, and it will be the greatest challenge for the next generation film makers to beat (tough work, for sure). All the art work is as good as the first two, and HOWARD SHORE masterful music simply be everything the movie score should and suppose to be, wow. Though overall the acting is not that excellence, but it is really really good enough to be part of and a supporting for this instant-classic final installment. ........SEAN ASTIN........as SAM is the most memorable character from this cast, he grab the audiences heart with the goodwill and loyal of his character especially the scene at the mount doom, and OSCAR NOMINATION for him will not surprise me. And yes, I love to see more of Blanchett's Galadriel, the first class screen performer in such noble and powerful looks, but even a very small role here she still be as great as she is always be, why you are so unlucky with the Oscar...SO UNFAIR. Dear Peter Jackson, thank you very much for guided visionary, your highest ambitious and strong will to achieve it, and of course you did it remarkably. Many may think like me, what is your (genius) brain looks like..; ). A thousand kisses and million thanks for you. A VERY MUST SEE, A GREATEST CINEMA's HISTORY EVENT...
10.0~incredible!! best movie ever glockj Sign in Permalink Saw an advance screening last night. It's hard to put into words all the reasons why I loved this film. As a fan of the Tolkien, I can't believe how well Peter Jackson did these movies. This movie by itself was the best movie I've ever seen, and it makes the entire trilogy a timeless masterpiece. Without spoiling you, Peter Jackson stays true to the book. The acting, cinematography, costumes, plot, gollum, creatures, etc etc are all superb. If you enjoyed the previous films, you will definitely not be disappointed. The acting/emotions between Sam, Frodo and Gollum are intense. Merry and Pippin are believable heroes. A huge thank you to all the actors and production people in making such an incredible film. I can't wait to see it again.
10.0~One of the best movies ever made dsmith-45 Sign in Permalink Forget the Passion of the Christ. Religion seems to cause more harm than good and a guy being whipped pales into insignificance to the number of people mutilated, tortured, shot, stabbed and dismembered in the name of God and Allah! Now the LOTR shows the goodness in the face of adversity, it shows real faith and the rewards it can bring. It shows the human spirit at it's best. How people of difference races, religions can pull together in a time of need and how this is a far greater reward of some being that we have limited evidence exists, Even if he does the bravery, the selfless actions and the support would be worthy of God and Allah. LOTR shows more about how humanity should act than Passion of Christ, all it shows is we should feel guilt becuase God sent his son to die for us. To date I am waiting on Humanity to change their behavior as a result. I feel more inspired by the actions of the characters in LOTR than any of the murderous, corrupt indivduals in Passion of Christ (with the exception of Christ of course). Anyway had my say.
7.0~Best. Movie. Ever... tck42 Sign in Permalink ... well, maybe not. BUT certainly the most immersive movie big budget, special effects film created so far. And definitely the best third installment ever made. This is a new type of film, a new experience, a turning point for the use of special effects in film. Look out, Oscars, the king has returned...
10.0~AWESOME X 10 slicentime Sign in Permalink PETER JACKSON DID IT, he made the movie of the century. Never thought that the Lord of the Rings could possibly be made into a movie that did it credit. Peter Jackson proved me wrong. All the actors, designers, music makers, custom makers, CGI experts, all need to win at the Oscars. If Hollywood (Judges of Oscars) do acknowledge this great feat in moviemaking there is something terriably wrong with their opinions.
10.0~WOW!!! gypseerose69 Sign in Permalink I just got out of the final LOTR movie and I am still in awe!!!! I didn't think that it could get better, and I must admit that i was worried it wouldn't live up to its hype...but I WAS SO WRONG!!! Everything about it is wonderful and I can't wait until I can go and see it again :-)
10.0~The best achievement of all time blackmamba99971 Sign in Permalink From my reading the books in school, all the movies were kept as true as possible. And it was like following the books in synchro. The return of the king was the greatest movie of all time, the beautiful land scape's and character builds kept me riveted through out the entire trilogy. Peter Jackson by far right now, is quite possibly the most elite director to come to Hollywood. He is now next to James Cameron and also Cecill B Demile for Oscar wins from a movie. Gaining 11 wins with numerous other awards that has helped mold his career even more. This film is absolutely breath taking in scope as well as the deep camaraderie in the story line where not all soldiers are only made to fight. But they are made to understand life through combat. To see each others struggles and hopes and dreams nearly smashed by an ultimate evil. Yet triumph through poise and audacity, to look evil in the eye and come through with a friends life in one hand, and a sword in the other. A true pinnacle in movie making.
10.0~Remembering the best moments of childhood lukasbucinskas Sign in Permalink This and Harry Potter are still the go to movies if you are in fantasy!
10.0~The Last of the Great Epics caseyt-48511 Sign in Permalink The epic is one of movies most profitable and believed genres. The golden age was during the late 50s to mid 60s. I'd say from The Ten Commandments to Doctor Zhivago. There would be more excellent epic movies of course; The Godfather trilogy, Reds, Dances With Wolves etc. All of these films are fantastic in their own way. Lord of the Rings took the epic and raised the bar once again. Peter Jackson created arguably the greatest film trilogy of all time based on the greatest literary trilogy of all time. Return of the King is, in a way, the last of the great epics. No film of the same kind has come after. It truly is a masterpiece. It's use of special effects are perfect, the locations and cinematography are stunning, great acting and characters and a musical score worthy of being called one of the all time greats. Return of the King isn't only one of the best epic movies, or fantasy movies, it's one of the greatest movies ever made. Yes, this is Godfather, Citizen Kane and GoodFellas levels of greatness, in different ways of course. It never gets old. It has aged amazingly well and this movie along with its predecessors will go down in history as one of the best movies of the modern era. Honestly, it may have raised the bar to high since I have yet to see a movie of any kind that was released after it that was better Return of the King.
9.0~Really liked ROTK, wish now I'd seen other two LOTR's in theater johnmtracy Sign in Permalink I have to say I really liked "Return of the King" and that it is one of the best fantasy adventure movies ever made, along with its prequels "Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Two Towers". I saw it right after Christmas 2003 at the theater and was like "WOW! Great movie. Excellent battle scenes with about 4,000,000 Orcs and humans fighting over the fate of Middle Earth outside Minas Tirith of Gondor. And a killer soundtrack to boot as well." Slight plot twist alert: Gollum, not Frodo, as we all should know by now, is the one who actually destroys the One Ring after he bites it off of Frodo's hand along with his finger. How fitting that the malicious one, Gollum/Smeagol, who was poisoned by the ring all those years ago, would be the one who actually melts it the Mount Doom's fires, but hey, he died happy in the process. He died with the Precious in his hand and was smiling while his body was consumed by the magma. One thing I liked about "Return of the King" was that the return of the king was not the end of the movie and here came the credits. Too many other similarly themed movies end that way. The king returns and everyone lives happily ever after. Not this movie. It wrapped up the characters' adventures when they returned home. Aragorn became king, Samwise married his sweetheart (BTW that was Sean Astin's real life family), and Frodo, he got to go into the West to the Grey Havens with the Elves as the hero of Middle Earth. If you thought Annie Lennox's song "Into the West" sounded more or less like a eulogy, you were not mistaken. Annie Lennox dedicated that song to the memory of a young man named Cameron Duncan, who died of a rare bone cancer in November 2003 about a month before "Return of the King" premiered. He was a budding movie maker in New Zealand and star athlete. It can be seen in the extended DVD version of "Return of the King".
10.0~The greatest battle ever! elnur_r Sign in Permalink The best movie ever for me. Must see! Nothing can be like The Lord of the Rings, in terms of strategic battles and this old times of horses, elephants and great battles. Only Game Of Thrones tried, but even after 16 years, we can't compare TV show with the movie, and there is no such movie like this. So this movie is just incredible! Plot is amazing, actors' actions are great, atmosphere is awesome. Battle scenes are almost whole movie, but you don't get tired of them. So watch it, and you will not regret!
7.0~The Return of the Fluff King digitalbeachbum Sign in Permalink I've changed my review after having watched The Hobbit all the way through on all three installments. I sat down on a Saturday afternoon and watched them together finishing later in the evening. While I still enjoy the cinematography, the makeup, FX, costumes and the acting, I enjoy the direction less. I'm less enthusiastic of the added excessive fluff to the story so they could stretch it out over the three installments to make more money. The entire Trilogy could have been edited down to (2) movies with (3) hours each. The fluff could all be thrown out and it wouldn't hurt the trilogy at all. I'd love to see some one edit the (9) hours down to (3) or (4) hours, much like The Phantom Edit did for The Phantom Menace. 7/10 is my new rating for this movie and the other installments.
10.0~Arguably the greatest film ever made! Movie Nuttball Sign in Permalink May contain Spoilers. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is arguably the greatest film ever made! The Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers are two great films no question about it but I think this is the one that has the most epic happenings! The cast was as great as before! I really like John Noble as Denethor! What a great actor playing a great character! Paul Norell was awesome as the King of the Dead! He is arguably the neatest character in the movie! Lawrence Makoare was very good as the Witch King! The music by Howard Shore was excellent again! The battles were so dynamic! I can't explain it! The creatures were fantastic! The Fell Beasts caused much more havoc this time and the Trolls wore armor and I loved how they played those huge drums marching into battle! They were something else! The giant Elephants, Rhino beasts, Wargs, and Thunderbird like Birds were awesome! Shelob the giant spider was great and she is really a villain! It is so incredible how all of this action was filmed! You get to see how Gollum became Gollum! The armor all of the characters wore is so realistic! The scenery is beautiful! The battles and every thing was spectacular but there was one part that is so extraordinary and that is when Sam and Frodo are in Mount Doom! I admit I can't explain it well but I believe it was the way it is filmed. I have never seen anything like it before in a movie! Gollum comes behind Sam and attacks Frodo and gets the one ring! Gollum is dancing in victory with his precious! Frodo makes a return and battles him! I won't tell you what happens! When I saw this entire scene I just couldn't believe it. Maybe I'm the only one that this large scene amazed in disbelief but in My opinion it is one of the greatest scenes ever filmed if not the greatest scene ever filmed! There are shocking moments in the battles and especially when the creatures are fighting! I was disappointed that Christopher Lee and Brad Dourif was not in the film but even though they weren't in the film the film was still epic! If you love The Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers then this is a must see! I strongly advise you to see The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the movie that is arguably the greatest film ever made!
10.0~An epic for the ages... jeremy-175 Sign in Permalink Well, Peter Jackson and company have done the near impossible. They have sucessfully created a trilogy that actually ends on a superb note. Words cannot describe these three films that give it justice. It will be a long while before we see something like it again. Jackson has truly created an art form in making this beautiful trilogy. I applaud him and all who helped make it. If he does not win an Oscar for this, something is truly wrong.
10.0~Probably the best movie of all time! jjbelcher116 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings is one of them trilogies that are so good its very unlikely anything this good will occur again. The Return of the King ends the trilogy on a high featuring big battle sequences that mostly still hold up to this day. Epic speaches, and the most satisfying climax in movie history. Worth watching the Extended Edition as its the best Extended edition of the trilogy for what it adds back into the movie. 10/10 I think this will be my favourite movie of all time for many years to come.
10.0~Yes! The last of the "LotR" series, and this one's the best! sethn172 Sign in Permalink Before I started college, I watched a bunch of DVDs, including all the original versions of Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. I liked part 1: "The Fellowship of the Ring," and part 2: "The Two Towers" was not the best of the trilogy, but at least everything was set up for this movie - the final chapter in the trilogy! Back when I saw this for the first time on DVD, this was the third best movie ever made (now this is the 4th best movie ever made with "The Godfather: Part II" taking that spot, another movie I plan on watching in the future) and this is the best action movie ever made according to this website. I definitely agree - all the action sequences are breathless! However, the very last 20 minutes of this film were too slow for me - but at least that meant that all good things must come to an end, huh? It also shows that the three parts had a connection which flowed very nicely: starting at the bottom, then going up to the climax, and then going back down again. Before you watch this movie, I must warn you that this movie is 3 hours and 20 minutes long! Here's my plan: watch a part a day; this will make watching "Lord of the Rings" more exciting! And be sure that you're watching the original movies first. If you like DVDs and watching action films, then these movies are right for you.
10.0~easily outdoes Matrix in terms of trilogy finale ryster86 Sign in Permalink ROTK brings us the true "revolutions". Sitting down to watch the final installment of Lord of the Rings on opening day was the most exciting theater experience of my life to date. Having already read the books, I knew the outcome of the adventure but that didn't stop me from relishing every minute of it. I can easily say this is the best movie of the trilogy in every way. Acting, writing, special effects, action, directing, everything was simply amazing. An easy way to describe Return of the King is simply to say it was a cinematic masterpiece and the final 2 hours contained the most thrilling moments of film I have ever had the privilege of viewing. If you thought the battle scenes of The Two Towers was awesome, just wait till you witness the battle at Pelennor Fields. I won't say anything more because my description of this spectacular film wouldn't do it justice. Peter Jackson is to be commended for doing what many people thought impossible: translating Tolkien's epic adventure into one of the most incredible trilogies every. So go to the theater with the biggest screen and the best sound, and enjoy yourself. It's the last time you'll see the One Ring on the big screen.
10.0~Fantastic Visuals!!! Great Story! Best...Movie...Ever? joevideo1 Sign in Permalink This movie blew me away visually. Return of the King stands alone its 2 predecessors, clearly demonstrating that sometimes you CAN see a movie sequel without seeing its prequels. The plot is so simple, you've probably seen it in a dozen other sci-fi/fantasy epics - notably "Star Wars," which seems to borrow heavily from Tolkien once you've compared the two: A group of ragtag hearty souls from unlikely walks of life band together to defeat a dark enemy in a grave moment for the fate of their kind's existence. Award-Winning acting by Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee and Sir Ian McKellen won't go unnoticed by the upper crust of Hollywood Judges this awards season. One of my favorite moments from the film is the scene with the giant elephants attacking Gondor. Legolas (Orlando Bloom) singlehandedly takes down 3 of them in a single swoop - EXACTLY like Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill) does in "Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back" - aim for the legs!!! The ending(s) of the movie are a bit much and sappy, and the movie is probably about 20 minutes too long for the traditional moviegoer. True LOTR fans won't care or notice though, and will savor what will likely be a 5 plus hour Extended Edition DVD that will come out next year.
5.0~From masterpiece to hack job in two years... mentalcritic Sign in Permalink On December 26, 2001, I was excited beyond belief because a film arrived in Australian theatres that didn't pander to the lowest common denominator and insult my intelligence. That film was called The Fellowship Of The Ring, and its director gave me hope that somewhere out there, truly creative people could still be given the funding to make their art. Unfortunately, somewhere about halfway through the editing of The Two Towers, some jerk at New Line must have tapped Peter on the shoulder and said "we've made back our money, we can trash the story all we want now". In the furore that followed the editor's cut of this film, Jackson was quick to assure the fans who'd had their hopes so built up by Fellowship the previous year that of the three films, Return Of The King was the one he changed the least from the text. By the way, you might want to stop reading now if you don't wish to have details of the film revealed. Peter Jackson, I am calling you a liar and a fraud. I hope you've got a lot of footage saved up for the Extended Edition, because you will need to insert at least another hour for this mess to so much as look coherent. You are also a liar because you claimed that you cut Shelob's Lair out of The Two Towers and inserted it in Return Of The King because the battle of the Pelennor Fields and Frodo's encounter with Shelob occur at the same time. Your other claims aside, this brings up the question of why you then chose to magically teleport Frodo and Sam from the tower of Cirith Ungol to Mount Doom, having them hang around the outside of Mordor for hours, taking most of the running time just to get them to where they were at the end of The Two Towers, only to appear at the proverbial crack of doom in less time than it takes Aragorn to gain the allegiance of the King of the Dead. Considering that you only observe your own storytelling rules when you want to, and use the Star Trek convention of telling us a plot detail rather than showing us, you really have no business directing an adaptation of an epic, classic novel. You certainly won't get any work directing adaptations of my work when it gets published. I also want to take the time to address cinematographer Andrew Lesnie. Take a good look at Fellowship's photography, then compare it to that of The Two Towers or The Return Of The King. Notice how much easier the battles in Fellowship are to watch because the camera doesn't shake like a crack-addled monkey? It seems that the writers have also forgotten the Istari mandate, in that they are only meant to muster forces through counselling, advice, and encouragement. Then again, given that they never make it clear that Saruman intends to rule in Sauron's place, I guess it is too much to ask that they not contradict the Istari mandate (and Gandalf's behaviour in the other two films) by having Gandalf bash Denethor over the head with his staff. Speaking of Saruman, the big Star Trek moment of the film comes when Gandalf makes the big "he has no power anymore" speech. Okay, you're supposed to show us the reason why, not just tell us and expect us to take it as read. It is important to contrast this by pointing out what does work in the film. The prologue explaining how the One Ring entered Sméagol's life and turned him into Gollum worked wonderfully, but I can think of at least two places in The Two Towers where it would have fit better. The sequence in the Paths Of The Dead also represent a rare moment where the film is rocketing along at a Herculean pace, and isn't brought to a screaming halt by exposition. A major, major part of the problem with this film is that it has been hamstrung by the previous episode's inability to pace itself. At least they demonstrate in this one sequence that they can mix battle scenes with exposition and make it work. All in all, this final film makes me wonder why people are so surprised that Christopher Tolkien was so unwilling to give his approval for a museum of film props. Obviously, the man has had to go through a lot in order to preserve the integrity of his father's work, and he wants to hold out some hope that the mangling which occurred with the latter two parts of this trilogy will be forgotten by the time his grandchildren die. Unfortunately, with all the attention that was paid to the merchandising and marketing (even though the Games Workshop models are absolutely awesome), it seems the story got left behind. This is not The Return Of The King. It should have really been called Let's All Fight A Lot.
10.0~One of the best films I have ever seen. Bhoboghuray Sign in Permalink Anyone who likes fantasy movies, and special effects should watch this movie. This is the only movie I have seen who's third sequel is the best of the three and who's first two installments are a must see also.
2.0~An Overlong Violent Video Game annmason1 Sign in Permalink This part three of the trilogy was boring. It was geared to overaged adolescents who love vicarious fights...with digital demons. Ho hum. "Enough! I wanted to shout," "We Get IT! They had to fight!! Get this blinkin' film over with! I surrender!!" And just when you thought your bum would see the light of day again, wham, ANOTHER ending! My mother and father once (in pre Vatican III days) attended an Italian Catholic high mass wedding. Being Quakers to boot, they had no idea they should have ordered out for pizza and left a wake up call. Each time the congregation rose, they breathed their own silent "Thank God" and started to file out, but the guests then en masse kneeled, addressed a different station of the cross,and off things went for another hour. "The Return of the King" echoed that oft told experience to me. And I wasn't even in a theater. I could have left at any time, but where to file out to at 1AM? It became an ordeal, my own quest to see the turkey through. Now I ask you, Peter Jackson, WHY all the endings?? Another thing I noticed in the DVD versions of these three movies; the guy who played Aragon did not do commentary, and did not appear to be pleased with the whole deal to me. He and Liv Taylor had zero chemistry, and I got the sensation he was glad to be done with it. Did anyone else catch this? If I had seen one more, just one more, animated monster, I would have...well, I can't think of anything worse than sitting through the whole darn movie, and I did that anyway, so I will end this diatribe on that note.
10.0~Absolutely Fabulous jlunghi Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's epic comes to an end with the character building of Citizen Kane, the action sequences of Spartacus, the special effects of Star Wars, and a masterful musical score, this truly is one of the best movies ever made.
10.0~A long way since Meet the Feebles... trouserpress Sign in Permalink As the poster for the recent Scary Movie 3 boldly declares - "All Great Trilogies Come In Threes". And thus comes to an end one of the greatest trilogies of all times. No, not Scary Movie but LOTR. I have been to see this film twice now and all I can say is "Incredible". There aren't enough words available to describe how I felt at the end of this movie. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Peter Jackson is a genius. He seems like a quiet, overweight, unassuming, slightly eccentric character (Fact: he never wears shoes, which is all well in good in nice clean New Zealand, but he goes barefoot even when he visits London!), but he has had the bravery and audacity to pull off the unthinkable and create three of the greatest cinematic works of all time. The thing that saddens me the most is that it's entirely possible that there will never be films again as moving and breathtaking as these. One of the trilogy's strengths, The Return of the King in particular, is that not only does have it have amazing special effects and completely unbelievable sound design (this film more than any other makes me want surround sound at home), but at it's core it has heart and emotion. You care so deeply about the characters that you cry when they cry, laugh when they laugh and feel fear when they are in danger. This for me is Jackson's greatest achievement. It would have been easy for a lesser director to lose sight of that in a large spectacle picture like this one (think Pearl Harbour), which just proves that Peter Jackson truly is one of the all time great directors and deserves all the praise and accolades that can be heaped upon him. But he's not interested in any of that. He's just happy to be making movies that audiences enjoy. His hobby is now his full time job.
10.0~Breathtaking rebeljenn Sign in Permalink 'Return of the King' was one of the best films that I have seen in a long while, and it has helped to fill a void and get audiences more interested in fantasy films. Like the previous two films in the trilogy, the photography and use of scenery is amazing. The cast of characters and the battle scenes were also done extremely well and set to an equally-beautiful soundtrack. This is one of the best films in film history and almost equal to 'Star Wars'. It has a good mix of action, adventure, and character development. It's also the most emotional of the films. The main problem that I did have with this film is the lack of an answer regarding the evil wizard. In fact, this was cut completely from the cinema release. The wizard was the face of evil in the previous two films, and he suddenly disappears, leaving an empty and unexplained face of evil. Despite that, the film is excellent in every other way.
10.0~Far surpassing my highest expectations foamyqna Sign in Permalink My history with Tolkien's great work goes far back into my childhood when I read raptly and wished I was Frodo carrying the Ring to Mt. Doom, or Aragorn leading the ghastly forces onto Pellennor Fields. Even in that time of imagination I wished that a movie was made that would do the classic epic justice. When i found out (about 1998?) that my wishes were indeed going to come true, I waited with baited breath following every move Jackson and the whole production made. Each opening midnight showing found me there wholly engrossed in the tale. Each film surpassed the previous one; delivering a more delightful, more mesmerizing, more awe-evoking experience than the year before. Well, the end has come, and what an end it was. Just like Theoden in Helm's Deep. But 10 times bigger. 10 times better. 10 times more sweaty palms, lower jaw drops, and "...(stunned silence)...". Jackson got Tolkien's vision for Middle-Earth just right for film. My recommendation is to see the movie ASAP. Then, make time to read the books before the Special Edition ROTK comes out. Then take off work/school, get some rest, some Dorito's and dnL and watch all three Special Edition DVDs back to back and you could possibly come close to what I'm experiencing right now. Tolkien rules. Jackson is Prime Minister. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is the best darn Manifesto ever made. Hands Down. Period. End of Transmission.........
10.0~Outstanding Rectangular_businessman Sign in Permalink Even when this trilogy of movies directed by Peter Jackson isn't entirely faithful to the books in which it was inspired, I think that it does capture the essence of the monumental epic written by Tolkien, managing to be solemn and magnificent, but keeping all the exciting fun from the original story. All the elements that made the original book a timeless work in the history of literature are present in three movies, from the epic background to the most subtle subtext elements, a quality that makes this trilogy of movies being something more complex and significant than any other fantasy movie that I had seen before in my life. The production values are superb, being able to recreate all the grandeur of the Middle Earth. Every single scene from this movie has an incredibly level of beauty without comparison, having all of them the perfect mood and atmosphere for each part of the history. All the scenes are wonderfully directed, showing a great love for the original story and the characters from it: The music, the performances, the visual effectsEvery single elements fits perfectly, creating in that way an outstanding cinematic experience that possess the timeless greatness and magnificence from the original books. While "The Fellowship of the Ring" serves as an excellent introduction to this fantasy world and the main characters of this story, "The Two Towers" works incredibly well as an inner exploration of the personalities of the characters, as they struggle against their personal conflicts. Finally, "The Return of the King" closes the story in a more than satisfying way, with a moving resolution that is happy, sad and nostalgic at the same time. Those three films will always have a very special meaning for me, being not only a great trilogy which is incredibly well done and its very entertaining to watch, but also, a unique cinematic experience that, at least in my opinion, couldn't be matched. Personally, I consider this trilogy the ultimate example of the genre of fantasy in the history of cinema. 10/10 (I would rate the 3 films with eleven stars if I could.)
9.0~FLAWS ASIDE! A FANTASTIC FINALE! rcavellero Sign in Permalink Well I'm sure many people will be like flaws, what flaws and you're too judgemental. But the truth of the matter is That although a bit lengthy in the end. The film is truly great! This is one hell of a crazy chapter finale in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It picks up exactly where the second had left off. When they speak of days in between the two films you realize you've been waiting a whole year and it's increased your excitement. Frodo and Sam take the ring to be destroyed where it was made while followed by the multiple personality Gollum. While the war rages on as the armies of darkness draw near and have a final feud between the evil and the people of middle earth. That is pretty much the film simplified. It's most ultimately about the struggling forces of good and evil and this film has quite alot to say about it, and everything. So much that sometimes it's a bit confusing and your led a stray. The film is packed with thrills, emotions, suspense, laughs, tears galore. But it has so many charachters to feel strongly about all of them is quite a task. And you as the audience do manage too for a while. But some stories eventually loose their steam and some charachters never fully develop but are given heroic climaxes. However no face is never completely unknown to you, it's the names that are the problem. On the techinal side the film is just beautiful. The cinematography is gorgeous, the direction is fast paced, the score is epic, the spfx at their best and the acting is good for what the film demands. With of course another standout performance from the gorgeously perfect hearthrob Orlando Bloom. Sean Astin also does his finest at playing Sam but his charachter is given a bit too much screen time. Flaws aside this is indeed a fantastic finale. As with any trilogy the last episode always offers dissapointments in some way or another. But What has been done here is truly a feat it stays completely true to the book trilogy even when needing to extend certain things longer, or explain others in more depth. Overall don't walk rush out and go see this film event! It may not be a perfect film but it is most certainly one of the most entertaining.
10.0~The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King matthewmews Sign in Permalink "This movie is one of the best pictures to explain a plot with Battles, Love, and the will to protect and fight. Aragorn will prove that there is a King inside him that is willing to protect the ones he love.Along with his friends they will save Middle Earth form destruction. Get ready for a thrilling experience that will last throughout the ages. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves when The Good Guys Win. Lastly, this movie is well constructed, it has a wonderful, heart gripping, attention grabbing, thrill seeking picture that one should have.Once you watch this motion picture, your life will truly never, ever, be the same and you will want to go out and join the adventure yourself. While as well finding it hard to believe that it is a movie, feels like really life. A movie one can relate to and enjoy again and again." "-Matthew Muse"
6.0~From a huge Tolkien Fan mithrandir39 Sign in Permalink First thing I will say is as a straight movie it is a very good one. I am sure the public will turn this into the third huge success for the trilogy and that most people will love the movie. That being said, anyone that is a true Tolkien fan is cringing and I am sure Tolkien himself is turning over in his grave. linnett100 had it right for their part about the characters. She, (I am assuming linnett is a female name here) has a good grasp of what Tolkien ment in his books and to his fan. As you can tell from my handle, I am a Tolkien fan. I own the books, the audio books, and the BBC plays for both LOTR and the hobbit. I was horrified at the changes in this third part. Very very little other than the very broad storyline was even followed in this movie. Right from the very beginning of the movie, until almost the very end, they messed up the whole story, changing characters parts and stories and exploits even in a few cases. It totally changed the story I have to say until almost the end though as they got MOST of the story of the Grey havens correct. one of the few parts. And I had such high hopes for Mr Jackson. He changed some in the first two movies, but for the most part kept to the story. I do have to add on to Linnet100's comment though. he sure did ruin Aragorn. Viggo should get 3 oscars for pulling off such a great character in the 3 movies. Aragorn was never undecided as to who was king. he knew he was, his time just had not come yet. As his wedding to Arwen was fortold when she was said to marry only the king of the north and of the south. Oh well, I guess it was too much to expect from someone who is NOT a Tolkien fan BEFORE they make the movie to actually come through in the end. It does leave open the door for a friend of mine to some day make a TRUE trilogy of the books now though I am sure the Oscars will finally give Best picture to Jackson, and I shall die a little when I see it happen. Oh well, as they say.... SH** Happens Mithrandir
6.0~POSSIBLE SPOILERS - It gets 9 but it's not as faithful to the book as it could've been Deb0206 Sign in Permalink This is truly a fantastic film but, if like me, you're a fan of the book then you will be slightly disappointed/insulted/offended. It pains me a great deal to say this as I was all set for a 10/10 and the most fantastic review ever but I just can't do that. And that's possibly why I'm still so disappointed. However, go and see it - it's a wondrous film with the most incredible acting. The special effects are truly awe-inspiring and the Battle of Pelennor Fields is amazing - you feel as if you're there. Yes the ending could be described as long and drawn-out. But, compared to the book, it's a trifle short - and utterly different. Ok, I'll give it a 10 as a film but I'll always be slightly disappointed.
10.0~A CELEBRATION OF TOLKIEN'S VISION sciwhy Sign in Permalink While I will concentrate my comments on this third installment of The Lord of the Rings, to my mind it should not be separated from or compared to the previous two. This was not a sequel or an afterthought after the success of the first two. It took off right where the previous one left off without bothering to rehash the plot for "new" viewers. In effect The Lord of the Rings is simply a 10+ hour movie divided into three parts. ***WARNING**** -- POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** As an avid reader of Tolkien and at heart a "purist" when it comes to the story I am aware that Peter Jackson was forced to take some liberties in order for this film to appeal to those who have not read the books. Therefore I will refrain from commenting on the changes that are sure to exasperate those who unrealistically feel the movie had to reflect the prose in all ways. The strongest point of this film (and the other two) were the physical images. Minas Tirith, Minas Morgul, Shelob's Lair, the Oliphants, The massing of the armies on the Pellanor Fields, Mount Doom and everything else was pretty much as I had visualized it in my mind's eye; an astonishing achievement to me personally. Second was the spirit of the film. The arrival of the Riders of Rohan and the valor of King Theoden and Eowyn captured perfectly the essence of deliverance that Tolkien so adeptly created. The Heroism of Sam (the TRUE HERO of the quest) was revealed for all to see. The transformation of Aragorn from Strider to Elessar and Frodo from simple hobbit to tormented soul were a testament to great epic storytelling. The Love of Sam for Frodo, Eowyn for Aragorn, Elrond for Arwen and the great sacrifice of Arwen for Aragorn were all done with heart wrenching mastery. This (the 10 hour movie) was the greatest film I have ever seen. Having said that of course I must now give my little petty critiques on what I think could have been better. Attempting to view it with the perspective of one who has not read the books, I think it might be a little confusing to see the great victory on the Pellanor Fields be instantly followed by yet another battle where they are once again being overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the enemy. It was not explained that the assault on Minas Tirith was but a finger of the "Claw Of Mordor" so some viewers might be confused as to the extent of the overwhelming superiority of Sauron's Military might. The madness of Denethor is not explained so viewers might be wondering just why the Steward of Gondor is such a basket case. The Houses of Healing were not shown so we see Merry, Eowyn and Faramir suddenly healthy and happy after their grievous wounding. Hopefully all of these will be dealt with in the Extended Edition and resolved. Again I consider this the greatest 10 hour movie ever made and if it does not get awarded with Oscars I will no longer give any credibility to that Institution. Particularly deserving are Peter Jackson for directing; Sean Austin as best supporting actor for his heroic portrayal of SAM; Bernard Hill for Theodon; Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn; Ian McKellen as Gandalf and MOST DESERVING is SMEAGOL/GOLLUM for whatever category he fits into. BEST PICTURE is a GIVEN and it should be presented to include all Three Movies as one monumental undertaking. In conclusion I strongly urge anybody reading this to see this 10 hour film as soon as they can so, like so many others, you can get a chance to live in Middle Earth and experience all it's wonders and mysteries. Then, to complete your experience and be treated to the astounding depth of the works of Tolkien - READ THE BOOK. May the Stars shine on your face.
10.0~Amazing!!! sunsetb423 Sign in Permalink I have read all the books (including Appendices), I own all the theatrical versions and the extended versions, so I think it is safe to say I am an avid fan...and this movie was amazing! The music, the acting, the scenery,the story, the battle scenes...absolutely phenomenal!!!! In my opinion, this movie surpasses the first two (which were wonderful in their own rights)...even after 3.5 hours, at 3:30 in the morning, i could have watched two more hours worth! I will be going again this weekend. Amazing!
9.0~The Moose Hole - Review of The Return of the King JAKastner Sign in Permalink `This is your test. Every path you have trod through wilderness, through war, has led to this road.' Every film this year, both the good and the bad (or in some cases the atrociously horrible), has led to this film. Back in late-2000, there was serious doubt to whether The Lord of the Rings series, the $300 million-budgeted trilogy, would be accepted at all by the movie-going public, let alone the hardcore Tolkein fans that would critique every single move Peter Jackson made on the film adaptation. With the release of The Fellowship of the Ring in December 2001, those fears were finally put to rest with the domestic gross topping $300 million. The question would then be, will it last till the final film? At the end of The Two Tower's theatrical run, those rumblings were beginning to be quieted as the first sequel managed to out gross the original by nearly $25 million in domestic sales. Along with large box office numbers both domestically and internationally, the previous two films managed to nab numerous nominations and awards but the one thing they both weren't able to accomplish was being declared the number one film of the year they were released. The Return of the King faces little competition for the coveted spot with The Matrix Revolutions failing to surpass even the original Matrix film and Finding Nemo stalled at the $340 million mark. Considering the first sequel's achievement of surpassing the original, it more then reasonable to assume the same here but stranger things have happened in 2003. The story starts off with the tale of how Gollum came upon the ring of power and how he became what he is in the time of the Lord of the Rings films. After a graphic beginning, the plot focuses back on the developments at hand and picks up where The Two Towers left off in December 2002 with Sam and Frodo moving ever closer to Mordor unknowingly being led into a trap by Gollum. The burden of the ring of power is slowly but surely taking over the young Frodo Baggins and manipulates his mind into believing that Sam wants the ring for himself, creating further tension for the already tumultuous group. Meanwhile, Sauron's forces have been defeated at Helms Deep but the battle for Middle Earth has barely begun. The moving eye now focuses his attention on Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith, the place where Aragorn must go and take his place as the rightful king of men. Unfortunately this is easier said then done as the steward of Minas Tirith, who has guarded the throne for many years, has grown power mad and refuses to see a ranger take his place as the king of men. Many conflicts crossing every area of Middle Earth collide together as large forces, both good and evil, fight for the fate of humanity and the world. The story for The Return of the King is so wonderfully played out in such a way that you can't help but be in awe by the events that play out. Most of the credit has to go to J.R.R. Tolkein, who wrote the original books, but respect should also be given to Peter Jackson. Any other director with the level of filmmaking experience he had may have killed the purpose of the film and it's messages but he kept true to the author's vision and nobody can be more appreciative then those Tolkein fans. Most of the characters are the same as they were in the previous two features except a slight few that are introduced in The Return of the King. Elijah Wood, as the ring barring hobbit, Frodo Baggins, brings the character to a whole new level. Wood does an absolutely fantastic job at presenting a character that, not only in this film but in the previous two films as well, slowly deteriorates as the journey continues not only physically but emotionally as well. Frodo, in the third film, falls deeper into madness as the ring of powers corrupts his senses and his mind and Elijah clearly shows that development in the feature. Special praise for acting ability should also be given to Sean Astin who presents quite a few tearful sequences as Samwise Gamgee. As Frodo is changed dramatically by the ring, Sam is always there for him but this film showcases the true determination of this little hobbit and the care he has not only for his friend but his home as well. Miranda Otto will give a few feminists out there something to cheer about with a particular sequence at the battle of Minas Tirith that won't be given away here. And Sir Ian McKellen continues his magnificent performance as Gandalf the White showing not only wonderful speaking skill but quite a few good fighting hits as well. Overall, King makes many leaps and bounds above most of the films this year but fails to achieve the consistency and magnificence that The Two Towers accomplished. The biggest burden for the feature film is its excruciating three hour and twenty minute time length that feels even longer in the last fifteen to twenty minutes. There were several spots where the screen would go black or white or a particular scene would end giving the impression to the audience that the feature was over at that point until suddenly it would start a new scene seconds later. This got quite annoying after the second time and could have been done a different way. In fact, the last twenty minutes could have been cut down a lot more since it is practically the characters just saying good-bye to each other. Other problems consisted of complications based on characters and separate story developments. In the Two Towers, the audience was made to feel sorry for the creature Gollum but all those feelings can be completely thrown out the window in Return of the King. It was quite disappointing seeing the character developed into the way he was here. Whether this is done in the book or not doesn't matter, either way it was a disappointment. One loose end that wasn't quite cleared up was the romantic tensions building between Aragorn and Eowyn that is just abruptly ended by Aragorn saying it's just a false dream. They aren't seen again together till the end and there is nothing said or done to show any remaining emotions. Considering the way they built it up in the Two Towers, this just seemed incomplete and disappointing. There are other problems but focusing too much on the bad would give the impression the film is horrible, which is not the case overall. Overall, The Return of the King is a magnificent artistic achievement that is clearly not perfect but doesn't have to be to give the people what they paid for, which is wonderful action and the message that hope will survive when all else is lost. If this raises the inspiration of just one movie-goer out there, the films' message will have gotten through and achieved victory. My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A)
8.0~Great finale, why not make four? mgruebel Sign in Permalink Is this the first time Hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of "Heavenly Creatures" and "Dead Alive" did not exactly have mega-credentials. When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the first film. I must say I was mesmerized from Kate Blanchett's opening narration to the end, when Frodo sails into the West and Sam returns to his Goldilocks. The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother). There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book. All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's "By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath)" - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a "10"). Jackson forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale. In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. Even the young Frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where Dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age? With all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its Oscars and other accolades. It will be a long time before this story is remade.
10.0~Return of the King does Deserve #4 status hshowe Sign in Permalink In an era when filmmakers of mediocre ability can get financing to do grunge slash thrillers or sex-pie college comedies of Farrelly-manque nonsense, this poll serves to illustrate the gratitude of fans everywhere at being served such a luscious 9 course meal of a film. Or 3 of them. At the Director's own insistence, the writing, the production, the editing, the art design, the sound planning, the actors/characters, the costumes, the music, the effects. Everything was delivered until the limits almost gave. None of these and ALL of them are the stars. To say this vote reflects only appreciation of the special effects is to disingenuously shoulder aside the leadership and dedication and commitment from ALL teams required to produce not just one but all three films to such incredible standards of consistency to the books, while pleasing worldwide fans, and new audiences, as well as all ages. Schindler's List was not Spielberg's story by authorship any more than Tolkien's was Jackson's, both borrowed a cultural event, one historical, one literary, story to exploit on the big screen using the appropriate talent. That's what filmmakers do. And if they're smart, they get the right material. I don't think Spielberg could have delivered LOTR. But I have a funny feeling PJ might have come close to SL. Both proved their genius by traveling outside their closest strength positions and moved to new arenas. Both borrowed from past projects and knowledge of film to create the dramatic impacts they engineered in those films.You cannot say because one was historically based then it was by that ilk superior. Schindler's List may be the most sociologically impactful movie ever made, but it was not the best. There was exploitation, and the Nazi's character was colored fancifully, and Schindler was not the spitting image of Liam Neesam, etc etc. You can read history without the women prostituting themselves and children lying in outhouse filth. Spielberg made the same kinds of decisions making that movie Jackson did making rings, but each used "special effects" of a different kind. Did Naziism happen in black and white? That anyone would seek to disprove Rings popularity by citing the more proximate (and non-disputed) sociological consciousness raised by SL is gaging on the wrong scale. I would not pay to see SL again, once as enough. But I've paid a dozen times (X3)and for the extended DVD's to relive Tolkien's world, because like those characters "I believe there's something good in this world worth fighting for". And Jackson's world gives me and others a place to go to encourage us. The films are about Hope. Wasn't THAT the message from Schindler as well?
7.0~Entertaining, but not as half as good as the book rvs_dmr Sign in Permalink First of all: I liked this movie, and i could watch it an awful lot of times. But that is mostly due to the great special effects . The point i rated this movie a 7 is because of the stupid story mistakes Peter putted in his movie. Especially the ghost army is a huge, huge mistake. Everybody who readed the book knows the ghost army does not take part in the huge fight, but only conquers the pirate's fleet, so Aragorn and his men can sail to the battle. The orcs think they get some backup when they see the black sails, but then are overrun by Aragorn, not the ghosts. Like the thing above there are more things which i do not like. Like the snowboarding Legolas in the battle for Helm's Deep (not this movie, but still). Legolas is indeed quite handy on his feet, but snowboarding on a shield? These are just the things which made me personally think Peter could have come up with a much better movie of one of the best story's ever written.
8.0~Excellent Movie - Best of the 3 adambutcher Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson did a great job on this movie, it is packed with action and adventure, and doesn't lag at any stage as the previous 2 may have (in some people's opinions). I saw it at the midnight screening, as I did FOTR, and everyone appluaded when it finished. I won't go into too much depth about the movie itself, because I'm sure many, many more people will... but I really enjoyed this movie. 10/10
10.0~So much action and suspense I thought my eyes would fall out. laura_p52 Sign in Permalink All I have to say is, this movie has the perfect combination of action, suspense, drama, romance and comedy. It was fantastic, I hope Peter Jackson and the rest of the cast get the Oscar they have earned. The Lord of the Rings movies have entered my hall of fame of trilogies along with Indiana Jones, Star Wars and the Godfather.
10.0~Spectacular film, Arguably the best of our time! emily_16 Sign in Permalink SPOILERS THROUGHOUT! I'm not a big Lord of the Rings fan. I saw the first two, and liked both, and maybe I could say I "loved" the second one, though that might be stretching it. Then my friends (some call themselves "Lordies") dragged me to the movie on Friday, and we were first in line. I was looking forward to seeing the movie, but I wasn't jumping up and down or hyperventilating like some people. Now I think I'm a Lordie, because I LOVED the Return of the King! Every scene was either amazing or interesting, and the characters were phenomenal. I loved it how at the beginning of the film everyone loved Golem, and then by the end we all hated the evil little creature. I loved how the ring was turning Frodo against Sam, and how you were just waiting for Frodo to either go mad or get the ring to Mordor. I loved it how the special effects (which didn't seem like effects, they seemed real), the acting (FABULOUS, especially the hobbits), and the amazing story all rolled into one to make a wonderful film. I can proudly say I cried three times in this movie, first when Frodo made Sam leave and then when Merry and Pippin were seperated, and then in the end. I loved everything about this film, and it will be a shock if it doesn't recieve the Best Picture at the Oscars. Everyone I talked to loves it and the movie got a standing ovation! SPOILER ALERT The only thing I didn't like about the film was that I kept thinking it was over, and then there would be another scene. I thought the movie ended when Frodo was in bed, then I thought it was DEFINITELY over when everyone was at the castle. But I think Peter Jackson had to make sure he didn't leave any loose ends, and fans were totally satisfied. 10 out of 10! A fabulous movie, go see it now! I'm going tonight for the second time, and then I'll rewatch the first two! :) -Emily
10.0~Can it ever be topped? Should it? ve3thx Sign in Permalink As I watched RoTK on opening night it became clear that this was to be a film -- and trilogy -- for the ages. Those three hours may yet redefine my middle-agedness as Star Wars: A New Hope defined my teen and early adult years. My only regret is that I now sincerely doubt that in my remaining years I will ever see its equal; the bar is now *that* high.
10.0~Very, very good horsecd Sign in Permalink Overall, this was a very, very good ending to the trilogy. Sam was just great! However, a warning to those who get easily motion sick (like me): don't sit close to the screen. Some very mild teasers, so watch out! And don't take these comments too seriously, because it was a very good movie. However, I will say I was vaguely disappointed in two areas. First, I dislike jerky or fast whirling camera moves in any movie. I know it's a chaotic battle, okay? Next, Gondor seemed kind of emotionally flat for me. I probably wouldn't have noticed, but they played Helm's Deep so perfectly that I did notice it here. That, and pretty much every other scene in the movie plays out so well! Anyway, we personally know quite a few Rohan, so you root for them. You love the heroes, so you root for them. (Though every time they survive an impossible situation, the harder it is to truly worry that they will die.) But, in the final attack on Gondor, the city itself was populated almost exclusively with unknown, helmeted people you had no emotional investment in. I only rooted for them because our heroes worried about them. Also, I kind of wondered why they so willingly followed Gandalf's orders and, later, follow Aragorn 'to certain death.' We never even see them question who these guys are. LotR usually takes the time to answer these questions a little better. (It might have been obvious that Aragorn was the king, but no one comments one way or the other.) However, I do understand that they already had a 3.5 hr movie and couldn't add much more new character development. Probably the extended version of this film will take care of this problem. I think the movie would all around be better if it was.
10.0~Super hakanpatirer Sign in Permalink Very fantastic film. The most beautiful fantastic movie I've ever seen. 5 stars, number 1.
10.0~Great movie! You must see!!! ahryshyn Sign in Permalink Even though I had been spent more than three hours I did not notice that. Movie is great. Movie is much better than the book. It desirves several Oscars. But only one question. Why it took so long to end that movie? And one comment. There are so many children in New Zeland, why the same boy was in Helm's Keep in The Two Towers and in Minath Tirith in The Return of The King? He looks older but it is the same boy.
10.0~INCREDIBLE asherwiegartz Sign in Permalink This is a masterpiece. Absolutely no flaws. Great acting, Writing, Directing, VFX, cinematography, etc.
1.0~An absolute dud in the world of movies adamz-5 Sign in Permalink Holy Smokes, this has got to be one of the most pointless trilogies I've ever seen. I do not even know how it scored this high, there was nothing that made it stand out at all. Throughout the 9 excruciating hours of watching Frodo turn into a mentally disoriented fool, I cannot recount a single moment in time where I said, "Wow, that's interesting." First off, the plot is simply unenjoyable; it has no twist, no character building and for god's sake, its about a possessive ring. Watching the characters go through pointless trials to burn a single ring is not something i can find appealing. In fact I was ready to watch any of these uptight Hobbits meet their end. That is a huge problem in this series, not one character was tragically killed in the midst of any orc battle. OK, there was that no-name in the Fellowship of the Ring, but the audience didn't give a damn as to what was going on with him. What made me even more angry was that these fools looked almost invincible. When Legolas and Gimli were slaying orcs left and right as easily as brushing snowflakes away I was ready to step out of the theater. I can see why people liked this movie. The action was indeed thrilling and had great deal of special effects thrown into it. I remember Legolas' first arrow being launched smoothly into an orc, what a marvelous scene. Then I looked and he was launching another arrow in a similar fashion, then another one, and another one! Sure it looked great, but it was so repetitive I got bored. Every battle in this movie is almost exactly the same: swords swinging, arrows launching, and people screaming, I just can't see what was so special about it. I also could not get through my head the final battle scene. Honestly an army of the undead destroying the orc forces, gee that must have been a difficult victory. It was so predictable and unfair I simply hated this movie. For all of the action attempts and turning a really old trilogy into a movie, I was considering giving this film two stars, but then I remembered the conclusion. Frodo and Sam were being saved by a bunch of hawks or something and everything seemed to be at peace - not a bad ending. Then the story stretches into farewells and goodbyes, good luck and god bless - OK I can tolerate this. Now Bilbo is going into a boat and heading off to god knows where - When is this bloody movie going to end? By the time I got out of the theater it was nearly half an hour after the part where the movie would have made an effective conclusion, my behind sweating like an oxen from boredom. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you are amazed by a couple of special effects. I don't know how this movie did so well, I think one critic said it was a good movie and it spread like wildfire or maybe there was simply nothing else to do but worship elves. Whatever the reason, I do not want to see this ever again!
10.0~All Hail The King WheezyJoe Sign in Permalink It honestly does little to his stature by mentioning that author J.R.R. Tolkien was a genius, but it's as true as anything I know. His words told a story but it's what they leave behind with the reader that made all the difference. Something deep touched director Peter Jackson's heart when he first read it and I know this because I felt it too when I read it, and again, the same feeling when I saw the movies. Say what you will about the integrity of events or characters in this adaptation but there's no denying the passion and solidarity to Tolkien's work. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is the point where all lines (characters, story, events) from past to present draw together and complete the picture, so wide in scale, so epic in its execution, that it takes more than just a few minutes to truly appreciate the complexity of this giant film. I have seen nothing like it before in my life, and remain in awe of the gift of success that came at such an enormous risk. Much that was once doubted or criticized has been washed away in a sweet tide of victory from the filmmakers. But aside from all the obvious technical and narrative achievement of each film the most amazing feat that Jackson and company was able to accomplish was bringing these three continuing films together seamlessly, as one free flowing tale. As the camera lens widens with epic visuals of massive armies and battle scenes the story simultaneously narrows in on the relationships and character struggles. On one hand it's about the peoples of Middle-earth and on the other it's about the individual characters whose fate is entwined into these horrific circumstances. Neither one overshadows the other as Jackson manages to juggle everything with such care and expert deliverance. Much of the films success is due to the intricate development of so many wonderful characters that remain at the foreground of Jackson's film versions. Superb casting has seen this become the most beloved element in the films, something you remember strongly toward the end when we see them saying goodbye, there is a genuine feeling of loss and accomplishment as we conclude this journey together. Peter Jackson has worked hard, its plain to see, and the rewards are more than one could wish for. What he has done with this legendary tale is go far beyond just making three movies. He has ushered in a new era in film with outstanding quality and approach, ever vigilant of the viewers. These films are for the fans by the fans and he has done all this without taking his eye off the ball as a filmmaker. It is over now but the films are instant classics that will live on through the test of time. I am thankful for the chance to see these movies in my time and will be forever grateful for Peter Jackson and his good heart. Here at the end of it all I look back, spellbound. `The Return of the King' is an amazing conclusion not only to the hard long journey but also to the captivating world of Middle-earth. So much has gone into these films and so much has come out of them, to the lives of the people around it. I am touched by Peter Jackson and the work from his amazing visionaries who knew above all else that what they had was something special to tell. Every frame is littered with detail and splendor. Not a moment is lost to carelessness or brevity. It's loving and frightening. It will take you on the trip of your life, into golden fields and dark tunnels. Overall it just tells a fantastic story. It's a story that has lived on for generations and will continue to inspire and entertain. We will never see the likes of it again as it respectably slips into history as the great trilogy that ruled them all. For the Quest is achieved, and now all is over. I am glad to have been there, too. Score - 5 out of 5
10.0~The best Movie ever made! glamdring01 Sign in Permalink This movie is the best! This is the movie to end all others! This movie is now the standard all other movies will be compared to, forever. It is so good, I don't know what else to say about it.
10.0~An answer to all those who did not understand!!!!!!!!!! Madguitarmurphy Sign in Permalink To all those who did not 'get' this film. I'm not going to preach to you about how wrong you are, your opinion is your opinion. I'll say this though, We who liked the film saw the same thing that we saw in the book, and that is pure escapism for a small amount of time into a place where things are right are wrong, where we see people and characters that we want to aspire to be like for there ideals and nobility, we see these things because well in these times we find them less and less in the real world around us. Is that just plain geeky? Well there are a whole lot of us out there.Are we all wrong? But hey thats just my interpretation.
10.0~One tale touches thousands wizard-man Sign in Permalink It's hard to imagine one movie, which would touch so many spectators, turn sceptics into fans, and draw such a wide following across so many different cultures of taste. Jackson's silver screen interpretation of Tolkien's saga has done the impossible and will remain the standard to which others should aspire, especially for a passion-driven film-making. To those of you who haven't seen it - please do, starting with the Fellowship, or -- better yet -- by reading the original trilogy. I will not dwell on the storyline, which I'm sure others have spent plenty of time explaining, instead I will give it a 10 star rating and say: this is the only film in the blinded-by-profit dedcade of "making magic" deserving a perfect score.
10.0~Perfect conclusion for the greatest trilogy parkerhaller Sign in Permalink The story, the action, the heart, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King has it all. No matter how many times you watch it you will get goosebumps every time. Frodo and Sam are getting closer to Mordor with their guide, Gollum, while the rest of Middle Earth prepare for the great battle of their time. Other critics say that the movie uses excessive battle sequences and visual effects to fool the audience by blowing their minds. But the massive epic battles show the significance of the story. Gollum tricking Frodo to let Sam go, Faramir facing inevitable death to earn his father's love, Aragorn finally stepping up to become king, and a loving using friendship, loyalty, and courage to defeat evil. Not to mention Howard Shore's masterpiece music.
10.0~A tribute and anticipating the prequel/sequel dinerouk Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings was a unique film made by a director and cast that were in tune with the book from which it was taken. It has been a privilege to see all the 3 movies almost impeccably true to the spirit of the book. It is with great anticipation that I look forward to the Hobbit, to be made in New Zealand and know that sir Ian Mckellan is looking forward to spending a year there reprising his role as Gandalf(he has just said so - 20 minutes ago on BBC news). I'm sure it will be made with the same dedication to detail that marked the sequel, LOTR.It will be made more enjoyable now I have a large screen with which to view the spectacular scenery of New Zealand once again.
10.0~wow, totally mint hobbleit Sign in Permalink wow, this could be one of the best films that i have ever seen. I was completely amazed from beginning to end and i felt that it never once became boring in the entire 3 hours i was sitting there. Everything was perfect: the acting, the special effects etc.. Shelob the spider terrified me so much i had to watch the scene through my fingers. The ending was so sad i spent ten minutes afterwards crying, why'd it have to be so sad? The film was totally perfect in ever way and i can't think of a reason to criticise it, it totally deserved to win 11 Oscars. I don't feel that there were too many endings, as the ending of the book is far, far longer than that of the films and all in all i think it wrapped up the trilogy nicely with a (sort of) happy ending. The best character in the film was gollum, he was absolutely brill!!
10.0~The Greatest Film Achievement Ever! brandon_crow_14 Sign in Permalink This is the single most greatest movie i have ever seen in my life If you get to only see 1 movie in your entire life, this is the one u must see. The Return of the King finishes off the amazing lord of the rings trilogy which i believe are the greatest movies ever. I guess u can see how much i love this movie but how can you not? Its got amazing acting, stellar screenplay, gorgeous visuals, massive battle scenes and an amazing fantasy world that enthralls you into the world of Tolkien. Peter Jackson did an absolutely phenomenal job on this movie to say the least. This is a movie u cannot afford to let by, it is a must see for anyone interested in seeing "The Greatest Movie Event of our Time".
10.0~best ending xxjasontubbsxx Sign in Permalink This is one of the best installments of this trilogy. it was very captivating in all aspects to final installments and based off the books it was very similar but also had it downsides pretaining the book.
10.0~The greatest epic ever made Monotreme02 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is, hands down, among the most spectacular and magnificent films of all time. A short run-down of the plot: After the battle of Helm's Deep and Saruman's imprisonment in his tower Orthanc, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf re-group with Merry and Pippin in Isengard. There they learn that the army of Sauron is planning a full-scale attack on the largest city of men - Minas Tirith in Gondor. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to warn Denethor, the steward of Gondor, of the threat from Mordor. Defenses are built up as the army of Sauron marches across the Pelennor Fields towards Minas Tirith. A distress call is sent to Rohan, still recovering from Helm's Deep. Rohan manage to muster a large army, and set out for Minas Tirith, but the battle has already begun. In the meantime, we continue with Sam and Frodo on their quest to destroy the One Ring. A major achievement of this epic film is the character development. Gollum becomes more cunning and sneaky than ever, and manages to turn Frodo against Sam, who is desperately trying his best to get his old Frodo back. Merry and Pippin are no longer just a source of comic relief, both of them prove themselves worthy as they are split up for the final battle. We learn about the true bravery and potential of hobbits as Merry helps cut down the Witch King. Eowyn also proves herself in the film, as she defies her uncle and sets out to Pelennor fields with the other Rohirrim, and eventually destroys the Witch King, and makes a very feminist remark while doing so. We learn to loathe Denethor because of his hatred of his last remaining son, Faramir, who really hasn't done anything wrong. The peak of our hatred for Denethor is reached in the scene where he tells Faramir that he would have preferred it if he had died instead of Boromir, his brother. And then, right after that, Denethor sends Faramir into certain suicide, and Faramir immediately accepts the mission he is appointed to, in a final attempt to please his father. And of course, Aragorn learns to accept his fate as the true king of men. In fact, the character development is so powerful that we actually participate in the character's feelings. We FEEL Frodo's exhaustion and agony as he literally drags himself across Mordor. We feel Sam's pain as Frodo is turned against him. And, just briefly, we participate in Gollum's triumph as he finally gets the One Ring. We are actually happy for Gollum and just for a brief moment, Frodo becomes the bad guy as he tries to take the ring back. All in all, Return of the King contains the most moving, emotional and touching scenes in the entire trilogy, and some of the best acting, especially from Sean Astin (Sam), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Ian McKellen (Gandalf), John Noble (Denethor, he is very successful in adding depth to his character), Miranda Otto (Eowyn), and of course, Andy Serkis (Smeagol, and top-notch at it, just like in The Two Towers). The battle of Pelennor fields may be THE most spectacular and epic sequence in film history. Unlike Helm's Deep, Pelennor Fields shows the true cleverness of Sauron's army. Orcs are not the only participants; trolls are heavily used in the battle, as warriors and as beasts of burden. The nazgul are very significant in the battle, and while the Witch King didn't actually lead the battle as he did in the book, the nine ringwraiths and their fell beasts still play a key part and do lots of damage in the battle. We see just how powerful the nazgul really are. And of course, the men from the south and their massive oliphaunts play a significant part. While in Helm's Deep we felt triumphant, in Pelennor fields we only feel the triumph briefly, as the Rohirrim make their charge into the horde of orcs and trolls. The triumph in Pelennor Fields almost immediately dissolves, as the Rohirrim are trampled down by the oliphaunts. The battle is won, but we're not happy, we're grieved for all the destruction, all the losses. It's a totally different feeling than Helm's Deep, and makes this battle all the more superior. Return of the King features the most magnificent visuals in the entire trilogy. Whether they are of Minas Tirith, Pelennor Fields and Osgiliath, Mordor and the slopes of Mt. Doom or the climb to Shelob's cave near Minas Morgul, Peter Jackson really shows us the true impact of these landscapes and images. Many people may complain about the changes in the movie, especially the significant cut of Saruman from the end, but you must realize that if they would have featured the whole part with Saruman the movie would have continued another hour and a half. Don't fret; Peter Jackson said the scenes will all appear in the extended version of the film. The ending is long enough as it is, and the film continues at least another half an hour after the Ring is no more. The hobbits return to the shire, and Sam marries Rosie. Aragorn meets his fate and is crowned king, and is finally reunited with Arwen. And of course, one of the most moving scenes in the movie, in which Frodo gets on the last ship to the Undying lands with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the last of the elves (Galadriel and Elrond to name a few), and must part with his three hobbit friends for good. All in all, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one the most fine-tuned, cinematically perfect films ever made, it's absolutely flawless in every aspect. The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole is a spectacular achievement in film making history, and all three movies are together, without a doubt, the greatest epic ever made.
10.0~The (nearly) flawless trilogy comes to an end. troyputland Sign in Permalink In the epic conclusion of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Return of the King sees Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), well, return as the king. Him and his allies attempt to draw out the orcs that surround Mt. Doom, so Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) can destroy the One Ring. The last installment upholds the other film's themes, values and reputations. The battle on Pelennor Fields outdoes Helm's Deep's in scope and scale. The film's tone and feel is darker. Brutal enemies lurk the lands, dark and dank locations drain all hope and fills me with despair. The odds are heavily stacked against the remaining Fellowship. Howard Shore's score is just as beautiful and emotional as it's ever been. The Return of the King's art and design is intricate work, with incredibly detailed locations and costumes. J.R.R Tolkien would be proud of the coming to life of his book. Not even the long, drawn-out ending can hurt this flawless, incomparable trilogy.
10.0~SINGLE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! wookie10 Sign in Permalink As i watched the battle before the black gate a single tear streamed down my face exactly like wormtounges before the army of saruman. The true beauty of this movie trilogy shall never be forgotten in my time, they are truly the greatest set of movies ever created, to go along with the books similar reputation.

1.0~Worst possible fdarcy Sign in Permalink While the first two films of the trilogy where very good in my opinion, the third one is a complete catastrophe, in every aspect one can think of. Its attitude towards the book (and without the book, no one would have heard of Peter Jackson, except few admirers) moves between insult to ignorance - almost no text from the original survives, and the characters and scenes are terribly distorted. Even the climax scene is changed from the genius of Tolkien to a bad Holiwoodic cliché. The most disastrous is what the movie does to the character of Frodo, which, from the original tragic hero, becomes a stupid and gullible fellow, which does nothing (expect stupid things). The "go home Sam" scene, should be candidate to one of the worse movie scenes ever. Other characters, such as Denethor, Faramir, Aragorn, Theoden or Elrond, are either inconsistent, irrational, stupid, badly acted, or all of the above. In addition, unlike the beautiful design of the middle-earth in general in the first movie, or of Rohan in second, there is nothing left from Gondor, except one picture of Minas-Tirith and few fires. It amazes me that not only this film is considered "excellent" by many viewers, but that it is considered the best of the three.
10.0~Quite Possibly the Greatest Film Ever Made dreamlessv Sign in Permalink "The Return of the King" is one of the few movies ever made that truly transcends its medium. By weaving together an amazing tapestry of characters, plot, music, and setting in one magnum opus, Peter Jackson has cleft a breath-taking adventure that sees every path cross in this third chapter. Despite its minor flaws, "The Return of the King" hurtles "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy into the stratosphere of film-making. The heroism and humanity of its characters evokes emotions I never thought possible in a movie. From the opening scene with Deagoul and Smeagoul to the final cosmic battle for Middle-Earth, "The Return of the King" enthralls the viewer every second. When Thomas Edison made the first movies over 100 years ago, did he ever imagine a film could move us as "The Return of the King" has?
10.0~THE GREATEST FILM OF OUR TIME stanclimbfll Sign in Permalink WOW. I had been waiting sooooo long for that day--December 17, 2003. It stands above all other days in history as the day The Return of the King came out in theaters. I went to see it expecting A LOT. I got a lot more than expected. I expected a great, phenomenal movie. I got the best movie I had ever seen. I won't tell you what I thought about parts in the movie--I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't seen it! But I will say it IS amazing, and it IS sad. So go prepared to be amazed and...bring a Kleenex box. "My friends, you bow to no one..." Aragorn, High King of Gondor

10.0~Incredible r-mcharg Sign in Permalink I had waited a hell of a long time for this film. After a year of persuasion I finally came round to the first two and was blown away. So when I had paid £5 to see this I expected nothing less. Then I fell asleep. Not though, you understand, because I was bored rather I was up all night yakking. But when I went to see it again it shot instantly to Number 1 on my all time favourite movies. The battle scenes are breathtaking and Sam's courage and bravery fills you with hope. The scene atop Mount Doom "I can't carry it, but I can carry you." sent shivers up my spine. A fitting end to the best trilogy in movie history. Thank you Peter Jackson.

10.0~A Very Excellent Movie Splintercelldude Sign in Permalink Warning, the following DOES CONTAIN spoilers for the Extended Edition Let's start with the obvious. This is one of the best fantasy stories, EVER. J.R.R. Tolkien was an absolute genius in creating this world, and while the films leave out some and add some, the same story still prevails and it is excellent. Next, to the movie itself. First the bad.... Die-hard fans will find quite a few things to complain about, in terms of remaining canon to the books. Things like Gandalf meeting the Witchking at the top of MT, not at the gates, Aragorn just now getting Anduril, etc.... There are things to complain about. And continuity does become an issue in the later parts of the movie. Gandalf's staff is destroyed by the Witchking during the Battle for Minas Tirith, yet it magically comes back for the rest of the film. And the people are very fast at dismounting and sending their horses off, because in one shot they are mounted, and in the next, they aren't. Also, I think Legolas climbing up and killing the Mumakil was a little over the top.... but now that is all out of the way, let's talk about all that is good... and believe me, THERE IS A LOT. I don't believe there has ever been a movie with such high production values. In the Special Effects, CG, and blue-screen department, very few shots are not completely convincing. Things just look top notch. And let us not forget the quality miniatures. You would think that the wide-shots of Minas Tirith and the Black Gate are CG, but you would be wrong. They are all done with miniatures, and let me say they look GREAT. And the concept art by Alan and John is just amazing. Looking at those sets makes me feel like Middle Earth is alive, not just some fantasy land. Now to sound. The sound crew has just packed layers upon layers of sound to make one very convincing sound scheme. Arrows are no longer a simple swoosh, but a sound for every release, shaft movement, arrow-head movement, tail movement, arrowhead impact, shaft impact, falls, misfires, the whole ten yards. Everything is just amazing. And then there is Howard Shore's score, which is arguably one of the best in the history of movies. The music for when Frodo and Sam are climbing Mount Doom is just UNBELIEVABLE. It is almost like the music is enough to convey what the screen shows. The Gondor theme, one that has been hinted at constantly, now gets to play in all of its glory. Oh and did I mention Into the West? Perhaps one of the best vocal piece in cinema history. There is so much good here I can't say it all! Now a fancy looking movie does not guarantee success. Only a top-notch story and delivery can. And guess what... it does it. While Peter Jackson does fall back to his low level horror roots on some things (like in Shelob's lair when the camera is twisting behind Frodo as he runs), the camera is used effectively. And then there is the story. Like I said, I would not stutter when I say that Tolkien's work is the best literature of the 20th century, and while Peter Jackson did not give you the same ride Tolkien did, he still gives you one heluva good show. Everything about it is good. Sure I would have liked to see more book reference in it (like the many other forces that defended Minas Tirith) but he did expound on some things like Gormothag or whatever the Orc captain is. People say it does not deserve the 11 Oscars it won, yet I think it won every single award it did fair and square. By far the best movie of 2003 and a treat for almost anyone.
7.0~A satisfying, well-rounded ending to the trilogy andrewroy-04316 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King continues to nail the things that make the Lord of the rings beloved: great score, cinematography, and acting. I didn't think the character development and themes were quite as explored as in the two towers, and generally didn't feel the intensity and emotional intensity to be as consistent throughout, but the ending was very good. A good movie, but not one I'll remember as an all- time great.
9.0~Very good movie but missing a little magnusavr Sign in Permalink The opening with Gollum's history was not necessary. We got this explained well enough in the first movie. If they had wanted it better it should have been placed in the first movie anyway. Missing out saruman. He should have been in the beginning and the end of the 3rd movie. Besides that it was a perfect movie. Thanks guys.
10.0~Shocked!! ninafortner Sign in Permalink I've just finish watching Lord Of The Rings today (all 3) and I'm really shocked! I'm shocked because I didn't know the movie earlier and that's a big mistake. The movie is AWESOME, WONDERFUL and AMAZING. That's the greatest movie I've ever seen. The return of the king is the best of third. It should be no.1 at IMDb top 250. It has a very strong plot (of course), cool characters, beautiful scenes and full of emotions. Oh, and we can't forgot that the soundtrack is good,too. I don't write a lot because I think there's no word can describe full the movie. So, go and enjoy it yourself. Anyway, great movie... If you haven't seen it yet, you should buy or rent a DVD right now. Trust me, if you don't, that will be your big mistake!!
10.0~What a pleasant breath of cinematic fresh air! danpas47 Sign in Permalink I have never been a fan of fantasy, nor have I read the "Lord of the Rings" novel when virtually everyone did in high school. I knew many people loved the book to the extreme, but I never gave it a second thought. However, the films that were translated from Tolkien were magnificent, in particular this concluding one! This trilogy is about as perfect as we can ever expect from movie-making, and I was even sad to see it end. Wouldn't it be great to see movies like this come out every year?? We've certainly been spoiled by this one, that's for sure! I relished in the action, adventure, romance, and mythology of this series. The music, cinematography, characters and scope make this trilogy one for the ages. Even if you are not a fan of fantasy (like me), do yourself a favor and go on the "Rings" journey!
10.0~Awesome wjackson1974 Sign in Permalink Loved the movie. Thought it was awesome. I do wish they had not cut Saruman out of it thought. I really would have loved to see the confrontation between him and Gandalf. Also wish they had done the scouring of the shire. But those are just tidbits, overall the movie was awesome.
10.0~Lord of all movies cuberian Sign in Permalink My friend asked me before I watched the movie: "would you be mad if it didn't live up to your expectations." I wasn't sure how to answer that because I was so convinced that it would blow me away, that I didn't think of how I'd feel if it didn't. BUT luckily, not only did it live up to my expectations, it exceeded it. Wonderful acting, excellent moments and the battle scenes were just spectacular. I won't write anything to spoil the movie, but all I can say is that I could watch it a million times and never get bored. It's not only satisfying, it's entertaining, and in parts, comical. Bravo to PJ and his team - it has to win the oscar! So if you're not doing anything, go and see it. If only it was longer. 3 hours and 20minutes isn't long enough!!!!!!! Bring on the extended edition
10.0~One movie for rule them all... mike_castillov Sign in Permalink This film is wonderful. The special effects,the makeup and the cinematography in this film are one of the greatest on the history of the cinema. The plot and storytelling are truly amazing. "The fellowship of the ring" is good, "the two towers" is better but "the return of the king" is the best. This movie is one of the few examples when the movie is better than the book. Gollum shows to us that we all have good and evil side in our hearts. But at the end the good always triumph over evil. Is important to say that IMDb forced me to write 10 lines but this movie left me speechless. So from this time forward i gonna say you the plot. Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Théoden to Isengard where they reunite with Merry and Pippin, who helped the Ents destroy Saruman's forces. With Saruman himself defeated, Gandalf retrieves Saruman's ball which is viewed by a curious Pippin, allowing Sauron to attack the Hobbit's mind. Gandalf deduces Sauron will attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith, riding there with Pippin. They meet Lord Denethor, steward of Gondor, and Boromir's father. Pippin declares his service to Denethor after Boromir died protecting him.
10.0~Best movie ever lee-148 Sign in Permalink I'll have to come right out and say it. I have seen quite a few great movies but I went into the movie theatre for this one with the highest of expectations and was not disappointed one bit. Save for the fact it could have actually been longer, but PJ will be sorting that out for us saddoes with the DVD next year. I know a few people would have had tears in their eyes towards the end but I was actually crying at charge of the Gondorian light brigade. Never have I seen such a thing of amazing beauty and passion. I was shaking when I left the cinema. I don't think this movie can be topped.
10.0~Nearly perfect in all regards andersdd Sign in Permalink A truly stunning movie to finish the trilogy. The Return of the King has surpassed the effort in the previous two movies. The story was told with perfect pace, the action sequences left you breathless with heart pounding, the emotions drew you in, the screech of the Fell beasts scared the living daylights out of you. It is obvious that immense love and passion has been liberally poured into the making of these movies and the result is most evident in the Return of the King. History will mark this movie as one of the greatest ever!
10.0~Overall, an excellent movie michael_jeffris Sign in Permalink If you liked the first two movies, then you'll love this one. As with the others, the cinematography was excellent and the battle scenes will leave George Lucas with deep-seated special effects envy. The acting seemed to convey more emotion and urgency, and the movie itself maintained a better pace than the previous two. The musical score, however, seemed somewhat less inspired. Hopefully the extended edition will wrap of more of the loose ends (you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie). It not only gives a satisfying end to the trilogy but raises the standards of excellence for science fiction and fantasy movies in general. Congratulations to everyone involved with this production, as you did an excellent job.
8.0~Awsome manishmohire Sign in Permalink I really love this epic movie n I hope next some parts will come fast in waiting
2.0~Could this film take longer to end? livf Sign in Permalink I loved the first Lord of the Rings, and The Two Towers was okay (the Director's Cut was better), but this film just dragged and dragged. The seven scenes around the funeral pyre were about six too many for me. (That wasn't a spoiler. You don't know who or why or where.) Actually, it shouldn't be possible to write spoilers of this film. Who doesn't know the story? Actually, even if you don't, the film is stupidly predictable. I left midway through the film to go to the bathroom (and almost didn't come back) and despite spending about 20 minutes procrastinating returning to the theatre, apparently all I missed was PEOPLE GETTING FROM POINT A TO POINT B!!! A truly disappointing finale to the series.
10.0~A dazzling masterpiece aharmas Sign in Permalink Mr. Jackson has created the perfect ending to an amazing adaptation of the classic literary masterpieces. He has taken an unmanageable array of literary devices and narratives to present us with incredible visual passages, emotional journeys, and seamless blends of new technology and old-fashioned storytelling. Just like its two previous chapters, RTOK is of epic proportions. With the assistance of adept editors, the different story lines are integrated and keep us engaged for nearly 4 hours. We get to the rewarding payoff where all will be resolved. ROTK is a nearly perfect film, and some people might argue that its various endings might lessen the impact of its conclusion. It's hard to walk away from such magnificent storytelling with a simple ending. It's at least interesting to at least explore the many possibilities that such a tale might lead us to.
10.0~One day it will be #1. calltheball8 Sign in Permalink There's probably no such thing as a perfect movie, but 'the Return of the King' is very close to being one. Anyone who says this movie 'sucks', should know that it is currently #3 in the top 250 movies list. There must be very good reasons for it to be so high up there. I believe that eventually it will become #1 as more people discover 'The Lord of the Rings'. Many people say it is too long, but for me, when it is over, I feel that it was too short. The time goes by very fast when a story is so interesting, and the imagery colorful and realistic. I have never thought this so much about a movie, but the music is one of the best elements. Howard Shore won an Academy Award for Best Score, and he definitely deserves it, in total, the film won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. I have never felt so satisfied with a movie as I have with all three in the trilogy, I can seriously say, that these are the best movies ever made. I have read 'The Lord of the Rings', and I don't think that a book has ever been made into a movie so successfully. Not many movies can be made from a novel and be just as good as the original story. To describe the trilogy in a word: Masterpiece!
10.0~AMAZING bookworm9531 Sign in Permalink This was a spectacular film! I mean, I've read the books and all, but this one tops it all! The first and the second movies left out some parts to be desired, but this one literally followed the book chapter by chapter. They started out the beginning very well and ended it well, too. I can't wait to see it again!
9.0~25 MINUTES OF BORING GOODBYES aesqu98840-1 Sign in Permalink Movie was fantastic.But there is about 25 minutes of long goodbyes at the end boring.Great action scenes, best action movie i seen so far this year.Sam should be nominated for best supporting actor, and it should be nominated for best picture and best director at the academy awards.
10.0~The Return of the King Review: Extended Cut MoffatLP Sign in Permalink For the first time since its theater release I have just finished 'The Lord of the Rings' Trilogy. Which is by far the greatest trilogy ever made. There were too many spectacular traits of this film that it was almost impossible to remember all of them. There was a terrific musical score, epic battle scenes that last for about a 1 hour span time, great characters and greatly succeeded on making you feel the worst of everything then comes back around for all hope to be regained. This is basically speaking upon the entire trilogy since it is pretty much one big film. It is completely understandable why this film won every single Oscar for which it was nominated in, but one thing that was wrong was that it wasn't nominated for enough things. This film should have been nominated and won all categories that it would be qualified for. There were amazing visual effects and spectacular set design. I was blown away by the fact that I thought such effects and designs could ever be achieved by anyone. There were no flaws in any part of the film, no revealing mistakes and it was absolutely flawless. The characters in 'The Return of the King' were the same as always, marvelous. There was a spectacular build up to feeling the proper emotions in which were meant to be shown and perfectly developed them in every way possible. There was hatred, feelings, and emotions attached to each character to feel everything that was meant to be felt. Each actor was phenomenal in every aspect and seemed to be a perfect fit for everything. The greatest thing above all though was the epic tale. There were subplots that made the movie much more epic and entertaining than anything I have ever seen before. There were suspenseful moments with a giant tarantula attacking the characters, battle scenes that last for a seemingly eternity and made you feel the very worst of everything that could happen. This truly is a masterpiece that can be seen over and over again but will keep you right where you sit and you will not leave your seat until the very end. Despite its length, it is still %100 worth the watch, even the 4 1/2 hours extended cut needs to be seen.
10.0~No Oscar for this! jayman_30339 Sign in Permalink Nothing will ever be made in our lifetimes like this trilogy, and ROTK is the best of the three. I just hope it doesn't win an Oscar, this movie can't be compared to anything else ever made in mankind's history and an Oscar would tarnish it and bring it down to the level of dreck that typically wins. Besides, the first two didn't win best picture which destroyed any shred of credibility the Academy ever had. What beat the first 2 films? A musical and a me-so-crazy flick, proof that this Oscar 'award' is a wart, not an honor. I cry for NO OSCAR, it would be a blemish on the cover of the DVD. This movie will be around LONG after the past winners are forgotten forever, you can count on that! I suppose there is really no need to continue watching movies after seeing this, once perfection is achieved it is time to move on to another medium. Perhaps I'll learn to play an instrument or take up painting. See ROTK but DON'T watch the Oscars, the people 'honoring' it are not worthy enough to rub Peter Jackson's feet!
10.0~Great film, best of the three tomrito Sign in Permalink This was really a great movie. It had everything you could ask for in a film. If someone said they didn't like it, then take away their movie pass and let them watch the Ya, Ya, Sister Club on DVD. Having said all that, what was with the last ten minuets of everyone looking at each other, was there some kind of telepathy going on that I can't hear? Or was that just super sapp?
10.0~the perfect ending for a perfect trilogy infernis Sign in Permalink Just came back from the theater, this movie is amazing. I loved the first 2, and had high expectations for this one. It's everything I wished for, and even better. The action is massive, the emotions are strong. In a nutshell, best trilogy .. ever. 11/10
9.0~Long, but worth it. adam111111 Sign in Permalink To be blunt, it is difficult to keep anyone's attention span for more than four hours, particularly given the fact that the film spends hours covering the trek of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum across the volcanic wasteland of Mordor. However, every minute of the film bristles with artistry. It is a beautiful movie, and the vistas between Minas Tirith and the Black Gates of Mordor are visually stunning. The soundtrack seems like a character as well, and it adds a much appreciated richness to the film. I have a standard set of complaints about this movie, and its less-skilled imitators. The battle scenes go on for far too long, some characters (Gimli particularly) can often devolve into caricatures of themselves as the plot moves forward, and plot elements (like the eagles to fight the Nazgûl) seem to drop into the plot out of thin air. Despite those flaws, "The Return of the King" is well-done from start and finish and deserved every one of its prizes and accolades. Note: I watched the Extended Edition, and it was an absolute delight. I haven't seen the shorter version in several years, but if you can spare the time, I would recommend the longer one.
10.0~wow wow wow wow wow ramair350 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson - THANKS. Dedicated cast - THANKS. Crew - THANKS. Anyone who had anything to do with the making of this movie - THANKS. The only bad part of this movie is it was a little embarrasing to be shedding tears in front of your wife ... but I wasn't the only one! Fantastic movie folks, probably my favorite movie of all time. Go see it.
10.0~A perfect ending to a perfect saga Hexodus Sign in Permalink Ah, what can I say. I've only seen the first two on a 20" mono-tv, so this was the first with good sounds and a large screen. And boy, did it blow my mind! From the first minute to the very end, I was nailed to my seat, although my butt went numb after ca. 2 hours (lousy seats, Maxim!). After huge disappointments with Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions (they sucked in ways that movies have rarely sucked before), this was The Movie of the year, and the trilogy is The Trilogy of the decade. P. Jackson & Co. have really captured the feeling of the original story, I've stared at the screen many times thinking "I've seen that place before". I apologize if this review of mine isn't very deep and profound, but I'm still in the process of digesting everything I saw. The only thing I am certain of is this: Even though the obtuse morons in the Academy don't appreciate these movies, most of the people of the world will. The ones who don't: I feel sorry for you. You're missing out on something spectacular.
10.0~Out of this world sauravsen_21 Sign in Permalink Hmm, Firstly the movie was out of this world. Peter Jackson has indeed shown his mettle one final time. The adventure of middle earth as we know it on screen has come to an end.But what an end it turned out to be. If the first two were amazing, this one is magnificent. Anything one says or writes will just not be enough for this film. Middle Earth comes alive yet once again in our imagination through the lenses of Jackson. deserves an oscar definitely, and will prevail as one of the best made movies of all times, and I am really proud to say that I consider myself lucky that I got to see this in my lifetime. The movie will be etched in the minds of our generation till the end of our lives. Hope the world feels the same.
10.0~Intense and Magnificent hillynige Sign in Permalink This movie is absolutely captivating from start to finish. After the first two movies, my expectations for this one were very high. But this film has exceeded my expectations. There are so many things good about this movie its difficult to single out the best bits. The lighting of the beacons is wonderful. The battle with shelob is frightening and suspenseful. The army of the dead sequences are brilliantly executed. The climatic ending on Mount Doom is better than anyone could wish for. You will also see the best battle sequences ever put on film. The acting is also very good. All of the performances are totally believable and heartfelt. Watching the trilogy, I feel that the actors have really grown into their characters. If I had to single out a few, I would say Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have excelled in this movie. I can't ever imagine anybody else playing their roles. You really feel for them. Some people have said that the ending is overlong, but I felt that it was just right. We've been through a lot with these characters and I actually wanted to see the Shire again. The ending was rather emotional and to me was the perfect ending to the trilogy. A big thank you to Peter Jackson, Cast and Crew. Next December just won't be the same
3.0~Down hill flibs Sign in Permalink After the glory of the first film, and the almost-glory of the second, I was expecting better from this film than Peter Jackson delivered. Up until now he had been fairly true to the storyline. Not so with this film. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book and/or seen the film, but all I will say is that the ending to this film is, shall we say, different. A three hour film is fair enough, and I can happilly sit through one. Except when the last half hour or so is as bad as this one. It could so easilly have been cut down to a reasonable length, just by following the plot. Instead Mr Jackson, in his wisdom, decided it would be good to change the ending completely and extend it by about 30 minutes. I was on the verge of walking out it got so boring to the end. A bit of a disappointment really. Such a shame as he started out so well with the other two parts.
1.0~CrapCrapCrap iheartdanradcliffe731 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings is an overlong piece of crap from one of the biggest hacks in Hollywood. Peter Jackson used to make low-budget horror films that were amazing. Now he makes big Hollywood movies with big Hollywood stars. His aim now isn't to make good movies. His aim is now to make as much money as he can. Why can't Hollywood start making films that are actually good instead of films that they make to reel in cash? Who needs so much money? Why does Peter Jackson need more money??? Seriously, Peter Jackson needs to stop making movies. He ruined King Kong recently, and he made three films that are ENTIRELY TOO LONG based on a crappy OVERLONG series. Get this film off the top 250 of all time. IT SUCKS.
9.0~Almost brilliant mac-hawk Sign in Permalink This is a review of the trilogy. Doesn't faithfully follow the book - why should it, it's a film - but carries it's essence throughout. Across the 12 hours (extended versions) there's very little to criticise really. Using John Rhys Davies (who plays Gimli) as the voice of Treebeard wasn't a great idea and in the parting to the Grey Havens (end of 3) the hobbit stand-ins are really awful - you just know they're kids - I'm amazed they didn't see fit to shoot it better. I suppose a Scottish & American accent, both from The Shire, well, you soon get used to it. The acting is top rate and the special effects, at the time of production/cinema release, are stunning. This is a score of 9.75 for the trilogy to me. Incidentally, if you can, check out the BBC Radio play version of LOTR directed by Brian Sibley, it's fantastic.
10.0~Five out of five decapitated orcs eviltimmy Sign in Permalink This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*. The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films. The special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few little things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on DVD, there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen. The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer. There are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on, getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to look into real estate purchases now. Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the series. Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly, and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed to be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of the movie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the ever-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered well; my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings leading to scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls everywhere, had a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned girls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much tested by this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance; he's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at it. For the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book, although they did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking of the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith. Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD. Shelob's attack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was shortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision. My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The incredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual effects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the action, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field of battle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a backdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a large screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas Tirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps it from being dreary or heavy-handed. Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some scary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly great date movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie. Five out of five decapitated orcs (and trust me, there were a lot more than that).
10.0~It worked Alia_Card Sign in Permalink Thank you, Barrie Osborne, for bringing the movie to Carleton College. Wow, what risks they took -- and the controversies surrounding them. Yes, individual parts make you wonder whether it will ever work, but it does. It's simple and beautiful, and all my fears were for nothing. Even with the books fully in mind, there are moments of genuine suspense. Some of the moments of high emotion lacked the subtle touch that I appreciated so much in the first movie, but that did not dampen my enjoyment.
10.0~You improve on this by... MarkB-11 Sign in Permalink ...well, you only do so by including the remainder of the extended footage whose absence is so obvious: the walk from Minas Tirith to the Black Gate, Frodo's time among the yrch, the palaver with Saruman. That's the only way. So, given all that does exist and was only cut for time, that means that what's left still rates the rank it would have if they'd been included, which is a ten of ten. Sometimes, you just have to think these things through, you know? Cheers!
9.0~An excellent film and a wonderful story cande995 Sign in Permalink In my opinion, these one of the best film of ever. The reason is obviously the story: Tolkien is a master in telling adventures and this is his masterpiece; but the most important fact is that LOTR is not only an adventure: it is a great life's metaphor and the end of this trilogy complete the sense of life that Tolkien want to tell us: never stop searching for new experience, never think of having arrived, there is always something you can discover, and it can be both good and evil. The last image of the film, when Gandalf, the elves and frodo are leaving the middle-earth, is the perfect conclusion of the greatest and the most epic saga of all time.
10.0~Without a doubt, best movie I have ever seen Targe Sign in Permalink The theatre was sold out, so I sat on the stairs. All through the 3 1/2 hours this movie captivated me, and I didn't realize I was sitting on cold metal stairs. All three of these movies have it all, Peter Jackson is a god, or was, for this one time, with these three hits. He pulled it all together, firstly by not mucking much with what was essentially the holy grail of fantasy writing from Tolkien. He threw in: - Amazing soundtrack - AMAZING costumes, best fantasy costumes EVER done, so they should be good for three movies. - AMAZING backdrop scenery. Doing it in New Zealand was brilliant! - EXCELLENT writing, dialogue. Not sacrificing on the obvious camp and cheese present in fantasy stories to begin with, he relished in it, pumped it up to 11. Way to go Peter. It's called NOT SETTLING, having the balls to play it the way it was meant to be played. The final in the three has it all. I mean, you have scenes that you will never again see in movies. Amazing scenes, creatures, all of it, I scarcely breathed through it all. If I can fault Jackson AT ALL, and it's difficult, it would be cutting Christopher Lee out in so many edits. Lee did an AMAZING job of Sauroman, on par with the portrayal of Gandalf, and he deserved more screen time. Screw the limits, let the audience sit for another 15. I treasure this collection of movies as my central prize in my DVD library. I also rank LOTR: TFOTR as # 2 greatest movie of all time, and LOTR: TTT as #3.
10.0~Lord Of the Rings- a real WORK OF ART! masterf Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings-The Return of the King is surely the greatest movie ever made. I consider that is has the most fascinating plot ever written.The universe of the movie is unique: a fantastic world which includes almost every mythical creature we heard of. Elves,orcs,trolls,hobbits,all these make up a charming atmosphere. The idea of a Ring that can submit the will of it's bearer is surely unique is recalls all throughout the movie.Also, the love story between Aragorn and the immortal Arwen is the most original one seen in the entire history of movies. The fate of king Debethor reminds us of Greek tragedies and the film contains great moral learnings,most in the words of the wizard Gandalf. The fantasy and the charming, sublime atmosphere make me consider this movie the greatest work or art ever created by mankind.
10.0~Unbelievable. BKriebel Sign in Permalink The Third Installment Of The "Lord Of The Rings" Trilogy is by far the best of the three films. The Cast Of 'The Return Of The King' Make The 3 and a half hour film fly by in what seems like a matter of minutes. In Seeing The First Two Films We already know That The Chemistry Of These Actors Is Amazing, But in the third and final Installment we see the characters at the climax of their on Screen Performances. The Relationships Have Grown So Tight throughout The Trilogy That These Characters are more Realistic And Believable Than Ever. The Film Yet Again Shows Us Astounding Visual Effects And Some Of The Best Action Than Any Other Movie Of 2003. This Film Will Leave You Captivated And Wanting To See More And More. The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of the King is without A Doubt One of The best Films Of 2003.
10.0~I never experienced such a great movie PiccoloX32 Sign in Permalink The last part of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is fantastic. I've never seen such a bombastic movie in my life before. Everything I wanted to see after reading the book was shown in the movie. Peter Jackson did a great job and it would be a crime if the Oscar for the Best Director does not go to him. You can see how much work he has put into the movie. The acting is superb. Especially Elijah Wood and Sean Astin did a great job. I love this Trilogy.
10.0~The Greatest Trilogy of our time CLAW-5 Sign in Permalink Having recently watched the third installment of the Matrix, (and been bitterly disappointed) I needed something to lift my spirits. my expectations were exceptionally high. I had thought that the first Lotr was fantastic, an 8.9 rating in my book, the second installment was infinitely better, and i would have given it a 9.5. This movie, however, cannot be rated on any given scale. never had I been so easily manipulated by a film, regardless of how good it was. Rotk did that to me and more. i was engulfed in middle earth and its lore. i cheered and celebrated, i loved every moment, and was completely detached from the real world for the entire duration of the movie and for the evening afterwards. never had i been "drunk" from a film, and it was a an experience to remember. Many have noted that the movie slightly departs from the book. and that is true. but a complete rendition of the Lotr would never have been innovative, and would have a soul-less feel. Peter Jackson has given us his vision, and it is one that i thoroughly enjoyed. Mr. Jackson, if you win an academy award for this film, (and you should), don't bother thanking anyone. we should all thank you for giving us a reason to watch movies again. nothing will ever compare to this brilliant gem. for those of you who would undermine this movie: good luck; your words will fall on deaf ears.
10.0~A great ending to the greatest trilogy of all time! BlAdE_X Sign in Permalink Frodo and Sam attempt to destroy the ring, but encountering many difficult challenges along the way, success seems hopeless as golem intends to carry out his plans. Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas head for the cursed mountains to get aid from a cursed army, while Gandalf and Pippin head to Gondor to offer thier assistance. Great acting...Amazing effects that dont interfere with the natural quality of the film..and the storyline is incredible. The best of the series and could very well be the greatest ending of a trilogy of all time, If you havent seen this movie, you are missing one great film.
7.0~Good, but not that good timsecker Sign in Permalink Spoilers for sure. A great film, but does it really deserve to sit in the top 250 at No3 beside the likes of Godfather 1 & 2 - I think not. The star of the show was a part CGI character (the future of acting??? again, I think not), and although sticking closely to the book, the closing 30mins were completely over indulgent and unnecessary. Hopefully the test of time will bring it down to a more respectable level, ironically, in line with the IMDb staff. An unfortunate consequence of an open vote where trigger happy teenagers are let loose to superhype. 7/10
10.0~No need to beat around the bush. Simply put... spwetter Sign in Permalink ...this is the greatest film ever made. No Gone With The Wind. No Citizen Kane. No Godfather. Nothing has transcended the medium to such a degree. Sure, you already care about the characters due to their development in the first two films, so it's at an advantage there. But no film has provided such raw emotional power coupled with the most breathtaking visuals I've ever seen. Brilliant.
1.0~BORED OF THE RINGS Gergely Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has successfully completed his evisceration of THE LORD OF THE RINGS by removing the heart of Tolkien's THE RETURN OF THE KING leaving it void of humanity or pathos. Jackson continues his confusing and odd choices in this film revealing no confidence in the source material relying instead on more comfortable Hollywood clichés and tired camera setups which are augemented by the Playstation effects that younger audience members have come to expect and which leave others hungry for the versimilitude of Tolkien's mamoth and respected, at least by some, work. To paraphrase a touchstone phrase from the '60's `Frodo's Dead,' and Peter Jackson killed him.
10.0~A majestic and exhilarating piece of film-making ptcommish Sign in Permalink I was late on to the Lord of the Rings bandwagon. Having not read the books and having seen the first film on DVD, I did not get into the "hype". Thinking the first film was good, I was still not riding the LOTR bandwagon. Then "The Two Towers" came and wrapped me up. I was officially on board. It all culminates with a stunning, beautiful and fiercely exciting chapter. The Return of the King might be as close to perfect film-making as I have ever seen. Beautifully shot, with marvelous environments and spectacular CGI, this is a well-crafted body of work. I do not know much about Peter Jackson, but he has vaulted ahead of George Lucas and perhaps even Ridley Scott into the elite class of filmmakers. It is that good. Balancing emotion with special effects and staying true to the source material is an enormous undertaking. Jackson pulled it off with a trilogy that few can deny is the strongest in cinematic history. And Return of the King is the best of the three, and worthy of the enormous praise it has received.
1.0~Look, despite satisfied nostalgia, this movie, and I refuse to call it a film, has little to offer. Hatrickster Sign in Permalink I don't wish to offend any one but to protect the integrity of the rating system. Honestly, if you enjoyed the film it was more because you read the books and have been avid about the story for a few decades than it was its cinematic quality. I'm sure it was wonderful for what it was, but people- was it really the second best movie ever released? Saying that The Return of the King was of better quality than Network, Dr. Strange Love- or any of the greats is naive. It's story is not its, so if you voted so highly for its story than you were voting for the book. Visually: impressive, but think about the pictures budget. So what was it than, it was unoriginal- and certainly not worthy of second best film on IMDb.
10.0~Great but Flawed... Elendil87 Sign in Permalink I have seen "Return of the King" three times now. The first time I saw it was on opening day with a few of my friends. I liked it, but I withheld back real judgement due to bad theater conditions (second row seating and bad sound). Then the following day, the chance came to see it with a few other friends so I did. Overall the theater and the seats were better, yet I was still unable to really state my verdict on the film and its merits. I could already point out things I liked and didn't like, but I couldn't put my finger on the real problem. On my third viewing, I finally came to a decision, although my thoughts on the film will still not be complete until the Extended Edition is released. To start with, "Return of the King" is my favorite of the books. I also deem it the hardest of the books to convert into a film since it's narrative becomes fragmented into various sub-narratives, which are hard to cut together. This is where, in my estimation the film fails. For for all Jackson and his crew's hard work, the film is not edited well enough to really make it feel cohesive, or for that matter complete. This film does not feel complete. Throughout the movie, there are some incredible moments of cinematic brilliance and some heartbreakingly moving scenes that it really does have the material to be a great if not one of the great epic classics, such as "Lawrence of Arabia". It's level of meaning and depth also support the film in comparison to more artistic endeavors, such as "Ran". The fatal flaw here however does not allow it to achieve its rightful place. Its pacing feels at times off and certain scenes which might be incredibly powerful are underdeveloped. For example, in the scene where Frodo is attacked by Shelob, it is painfully obvious that the scene is too short and much too fast. Tension was lacking and that sense of fear that was so chilling when Gollum first hinted at his plans at the end of the "Two Towers" was lost. Certain scenes as this and times when you wish there was more emotional development here or more action here or more build-up there were missing. Gandalf declares that the Battle of Pelennor Fields will be the "Great Battle of Our Time", yet for lack of build-up before the battle and too little actual footage of the battle shown it feels smaller than Helm's Deep (where the odds are much better and the consequences much less dire). Moments in the battle which are filmed brilliantly such as the Death of the Witch King and the Charge of the Rohirrim feel out of place and anti-climactic because of this lack of battle 'filler', and the despair of the people within the city of Minas Tirith is not as clear as it was as in Helm's Deep. Finally when the heros arrive with a great undead army, there is a sense of anticlimax. So again although each of these individual sequences were wonderful and although what was in the film was magnificent, what was cut our and/or left unfilmed is painfully missed. In short the film could've been much longer. In terms of what was actually in the film, the only real part that felt ridiculous was when the gates of Minas Tirith are broken open and three Trolls storm through. I missed greatly the operatic moment from the books where Gandalf and the Witch King meet face to face. In my opinion, there was simply no need to reinvent the wheel here. In terms of everything else, this film was superbly crafted. With a much stronger script than the first two and therefore much stronger acting, this one really does close out the trilogy beautifully. Andrew Lesnie's cinematography is now fully developed and full of wonderful imagery and power. And most notable of all, Howard Shore's score has really come to a high point in "Return of the King". The themes now all fully developed and orchestrated feel more full, vibrant and at times truly menacing. In a scene where all these qualities come together perfectly, Gandalf and Frodo say farewell to the hobbits as they sail away into the west from the Grey Havens. In conclusion, everything about this film is bigger and yet more intimate and powerful than the first two. Were it not for the one flaw in the editing, this film really would be one of the greats. Perhaps with the advent of the EE, it will make the distance. Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is rated PG-13
10.0~Epic and heartwarming. weezer222 Sign in Permalink This, the finale, is the best of the Lord of the Rings films. The cinematography, the score, the editing, and the acting were near perfect. However, the real strength of the movie comes in its execution of a storyline that demands attention to two very important elements - the epic battles of the humans and the tests of the hobbits' determination. "The Return of the King" represents a return to the story of the hobbits. The movie opens with an unexpected but enlightening prologue telling the story of Smeagol and his deterioration into Gollum. Many action-seeking moviegoers may complain that there was perhaps a bit too much set-up. There are several epic battles in the film and none happen in the first hour. However, we learn more about the characters in these scenes than we could in a hundred sword fights. The mood of the characters starts on a high note, fresh from victory at the battle of Helm's Deep. As the warriors learn of the coming battles, they grow more and more worried to the point of almost total hopelessness. While this is happening, Frodo and Sam move closer to Mount Doom. The ever-treacherous Gollum is plotting all the while and trying to set Frodo against Sam. This represents a slight deviation from the Tolkien text, but an appropriate one for building all three characters. Frodo and then Sam come to battle a giant spider named Shelob. The special effects are perfect and the true nature of the hobbits becomes the focus of the remainder of the film. The great battles between men and orcs don't require a play-by-play, suffice to say that they are epic without being overwhelming - a line that Peter Jackson and the team of filmmakers have been walking since "The Two Towers". A few new enemies show up for the battle, and some unexpected allies. The orcs have enslaved more trolls and created more siege weapons - a combination that puts fear in the heart of the now-connected audience as well as the men of Gondor. One aspect of this movie that was particularly moving, even more so than in its predecessors, was the score. Solos from hobbits and men accentuate an absolutely perfect musical accompaniment to the heroic bravery of the human warriors and the emotional tenderness of the hobbits. Whereas the score seemed to be along for the ride in the first two films, it commanded as much sensory output as the visual elements at many crucial moments. As the three-film story comes to its climax, the attention of the audience is more and more on Frodo and Sam, as it was in the first film. The friendship that was an afterthought in the other films becomes the focus of the movie as wills are tested in the final minutes of the quest to destroy the ring. The acting performances that stood out were by Sean Astin as Sam and John Noble as the Denethor. Astin pours his heart into the eyes and ears of the audience as he struggles to keep Frodo moving. The best execution of all came from Noble, who played the barely-sane Steward of Gondor. Denethor, not heroic like Aragorn but not evil like Saruman, represents the most difficult role in the film and the best performance by a cast member. This film will surely be a success not only among fans of the novel but also with anyone who appreciates a great film. "The Fellowship of the Ring" tended to be emotional and "The Two Towers" was a movie about war, but "The Return of the King" achieves both and successfully intertwines them in the mind of the audience.
10.0~Absolutely Perfect!!! DrFridolin Sign in Permalink I can't exactly find the proper words to describe this unforgettable legend of our time. After seven years of film making, I think Peter Jackson achieved a point of success that couldn't be higher or better. What I watched as "The Fellowship of The Ring" and "The Two Towers" was also brilliant; however my admiration for both the director and all the crew became deeper when I witnessed "The Return of the King. Also crowned by 4 Golden Globes and 11 Oscars, I'm absolutely sure "The Return of The King" was the best film I have ever watched. Not only because of its epic story, fantastic characters or visual effects (which was also the most magnificent work of its kind), also because of the perfect performances of the actors and actresses, the conversations, individual scenes etc... It's not only a fantastic movie either; it bears the elements of drama, romance, self-sacrifice, friendship and even a little bit of comedy; placed properly inside, without damaging the spirit of the tale.. Shortly I think it was a film was both a thrilling adventure and a work of art. And nearly 400 million dollars prove its worth as a thriller while 11 Oscars show its artistic side (set aside 11, how many fantastic movies do you know to have taken an Oscar?). And I mustn't deny the splendid work of J.R.R. Tolkien by writing one of the best novels I've ever read; which became the most important cornerstone of the film. Both the film, the actors, the director and the producers; along with Howard Shore, the talented composer of the original soundtrack, and lastly all the crew working for visual and sound effects, art direction and many others, placed the film, the trio and the novel in the unforgettable sections of many places. Many fantastic movies were produced (there are more then 3 movies named as "The Lord of The Rings", and I'm talking about big productions), but none brought this kind of films where it is nowadays. Therefore I don't quite agree the title "Best fantastic movie of all times" for this film. "Best movie of all times" would be more appropriate...
9.0~It's overrated Jordan89 Sign in Permalink I think that this movie is overrated, it's a great movie, clearly worth seeing, but it's overrated, to ment people hasn't read the book by J. R. R. Tolkin and so they think that the end of the story is like it is the movie, but really there are missing about one hundred page from the book, that in the book are some of the best part I think, when they return to the shier and finds Salomon how has "destroid" the peace in the shier, it's a great part of the book, and it isn't in the movie. In the movie they are just retuning to the peaceful shier they leaf, and Tolkin is in the book trying to say (after my opinion)that there personalty chanced a lot, and also did the world around them, so he tried to say that, you aren't the only thing that chance in your life. So I think that Tolkin is turning in his grave. Not that Peter Jackson didn't make a great movie that will go over in history as one of the best, I just think he leaf out a very important part of the story. I gave it an 8, I think it's fair.
10.0~Great film and great end to trilogy gorflax Sign in Permalink This was a great film on its own and as part of the trilogy. If you thought Fellowship and Two Towers were amazing prepare to be blown away. Not only is this film bigger and more ridiculous, it also ties up the story and manages to do it while paying homage to the source material. I think if Tolkien were alive today he would be happy with the trilogy after seeing this film. Fantastic work all around from the cast to the set designers, the programmers...Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens. Just extraordinary work all around. If you liked the first two films then you will love this one. An oscar is definitely deserved.
1.0~Could this have been any longer if it tried? raypdaley182 Sign in Permalink How long was this awful film? Almost 4 hours? The last 30 minutes were really taking the mickey in no uncertain terms. The ring gets destroyed, that's it, movie over. We really don't need to see sam & frodo get saved by eagles or them return to hobbiton or see bilbo & frodo leave with the elves (does that even happen in the book?). The end of the film drags on far too long. Also the build-up to the 2 main big battles drags on far too long as well. If you are going to adapt a very long novel, learn from Frank Herberts Dune which originally was 8 hours long when Dino DeLaurentis shot it. Don't Bother.
10.0~The Best of the BEST ! MatejAdzic Sign in Permalink The lord of the rings ... Best trilogy and movie ever made. The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent. Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship. Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch ('that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension). Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role. I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things. Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy. His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny. Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish. He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way. It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.
10.0~Movie is very amazing tvelasco-99555 Sign in Permalink The movie is so amazing, I like the first battle and last battle. 10 out of 10 movie this is so amazing!
10.0~Epic conclusion darknight44 Sign in Permalink This was probably one of the greatest movies ever. The only downside was that they cut out too much of the movie, you could tell at times. Although what that tells me is that the extended version of this movie will be incredible. Once I see the extended edition, I will be convinced that this WAS the best movie of all time. This was the epic connclusion to this amazing tale.
7.0~Desperately in need of an editor - the third and final installment has its moments - decidedly! movieman-200 Sign in Permalink In scale, ambition and extensive use of the latest CGI director, Peter Jackson's "The Return of the King" effectively brings to a close his awe-inspiring adaptation of J.R. Tolkien's legendary "The Lord of the Rings." Tying up the loose ends: Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) prepare for their massive battle at Minas Tirith; Frodo's (Elijah Wood) mission to Mordor grows more dark and sinister as he nears the molten lava of Mount Doom; Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) confronts Gollum  certainly one of the most compelling bits of subtly nuanced computer animation ever. There are a couple of curiosities, including the inexplicable absence of Saruman (Christopher Lee) who appears in the extended version DVD but not in the theatrical cut, and the reduction of several roles that were previously rather weighty, now cut to mere cameo status. Jackson had a lot of ground to cover in this final installment and his editorial acumen was working overtime. The film is slick and polished, masterfully told and faithful to Tolkien's vision. Still, "The Return of the King" does tend to suffer from too many endings in its attempt to be loyally inclusive to all of the characters. THE TRANSFER: Stunning. No less was to be expected and no less is offered in this beautifully rendered picture. Truly, there is nothing to complain about in this anamorphically enhanced presentation. Colors are stylized, bold, rich and vibrant. Contrast and shadow delineation is nicely rendered. Blacks are deep, rich and solid with an incredible amount of fine detail present, even during the darkest scenes and battle sequences. The audio is 5.1 and extremely powerful. The rich musical score sweeps across all audio channels with an enveloping presence. Dialogue is very dimensional. EXTRAS: As with the previous two films, this one comes with a host of extra features, including three substantial documentaries (the National Geographic one being the best) and six extremely short "featurettes" which play more like extended trailers for the film. BOTTOM LINE: Is this the BEST PICTURE of last year? Arguably, yes. It certainly is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy and an exceptional DVD presentation for your home theater. Add this one to your collection today.
1.0~awful ilker2307 Sign in Permalink However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute. The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With 'Return of the King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes 'Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topless. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialog and characters. Think of 'Return' as a mix of 'Fellowship' and 'Two Towers,' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude. The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest film-making ever put to screen. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic film-making.
8.0~lord of the rings codycorrell-43544 Sign in Permalink Saying that this film starts where 'Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. 'Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of 'Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in 'Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.
10.0~The return of the king Tomasito90 Sign in Permalink It is a work of art that is going to happen to history, non single being a trilogy of enormous special effects (the case of Star Wars), but so that the quality of the film is excellent in general. Let us speak of music: He is something that inspires emotions and that make you live the moment on the film, Howard Shore to the very same John Williams, so sounded in him world of the cinema by its musical compositions. The scripts, very you are obtained, are beautiful and very poetic, which makes think me are not removed directly from the book? It is not a too direct adaptation of the book? I would say that no, because I have read the book several times, I have compared the book with the film (something difficult, because still being called in the same way two works they are very different, favoring to the book, of course). There are metaphors, forms of express feelings that I never had obtained, scenes of Maxima emotion... I believe that one does not go away to make a film of so high quality in long time.
8.0~Spoilers. This was not what I was hoping for. rlparrt Sign in Permalink Spoilers!!! I have never seen a film so badly rushed before. I know that only so much can be done with three hours and that the extended DVD will be better, but that doesn't make up for the fact that much of this movie was done in a poorly thought-out and hurried fashion. (I love the books. I may be a creepy Tolkien fanatic. Keep that in mind.) The acting was all very good, when considering that the script was a hodgepodge of modern language and humor thrown into together with the wonderful and beautiful language that Tolkien originally wrote. Viggo Mortensen was a much more compelling Aragorn, but then, he didn't seem to talk as much. The four actors who played the Hobbits were terrific, especially Billy Boyd (Pippin) whom I thought seemed out of place in FotR. David Wenham deserved more screen time -- there is a large section of the book that would have given him this. His portrayal of Faramir was spot-on in my opinion. I never expected Miranda Otto to be a good Eowyn, but she did very well with the role, if only her parts had not been oddly and badly edited. Andy Serkis (Gollum) was brilliant as ever, and since he was really in the film this time, maybe he'll get that Academy Award (though his voice performance was better in TTT). Hugo Weaving (Elrond) gave a stellar performance too. He breathed a life into his role that may not have been there in the books, but certainly looks good on screen. No one acted badly in this movie. The real problem was trying to stuff too many things into too short of a time frame. Something will inevitably be lost. But many of the things that were lost ('the hands of a king are the hands of a healer' stuff) were so interesting (in the book) while stuff that was dull (the fall of Osgiliath) took up too much time. I enjoyed a lot of the unnecessary stuff, but was it worth it to see Smeagol kill Deagol if it meant there was no time for Faramir and Eowyn to fall in love? Gah! That just sucked for me because they were among my favorite book characters. The animated version of RotK gives a more accurate picture of the book. All of that to say, when you leave the theater you will feel as though you have seen a three hour trailer for the real movie (which will be out of DVD in November, I guessing). Additionally, a lot of the battle scenes seemed shoddy compared to the bar set by Helm's Deep in TTT. It goes without saying that the most irksome deviations from the book were found in these scenes (the Oathbreakers helping to free Minas Tirith from the siege). There was also a serious and consistent problem with stupid and inappropriate humor. It was a distraction from what would otherwise have been a much better movie. A lot of this centered around John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) whose character was never supposed to be a source of amusement. And there were also scenes that were humorous and shouldn't have been (Denethor on fire, for instance; Denethor being pummeled by Gandalf's staff; Denethor eating ... you get the picture). The worst moment in the entire film was when Gandalf (Ian McKellan) hit Denethor (John Noble). I think that was when everyone should have got the idea that the director has/had no understanding of the books (if Haldir at Helm's Deep didn't do that already). It was one of the stupidest things I've ever seen, which now, unfortunately, also includes Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and Celeborn (Martin Csokas) leaving Middle-Earth together. Read the books! The best moment was when Arwen (Liv Tyler) asked Elrond to reforge the sword of kings (which is so far from the book that ...) and he starts to walk away. That was wonderfully done, mostly thanks to the caliber of the actors involved. Wonderful scene. Eowyn and Theoden (Bernard Hill) did a similar, far more book-consisted scene, though with far less ... something. I think the uncle-niece chemistry was wrong. It was not a heinously bad film. It was not exceptional either because of how it was edited and directed. Some of the effects should probably win awards. Some of the actors as well. But it just isn't as good as it could have been.
10.0~Phenomenal Film!! cuzzinman Sign in Permalink Absolutely phenomenal acting, cinematography, character development, plot, writing, production, etc. It is a renowned and fantastic film! I highly recommend this film to everyone!!
7.0~Probably the greatest movie this year. squallyk Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King had to be the greatest movie this year. It was probably also the only 3rd episode in a trilogy that was created this year (Terminator Series, The Matrix Series) to have a good and wholesome ending. Peter Jackson deserves a pat on the back.
4.0~End it already! vertigo_14 Sign in Permalink I'm beginning to agree with the viewers who remarked that this movie is overrated. Overrated, indeed. I have never been a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I admit, the first movie was visually stunning and used some novel techniques for example, to make characters appear much larger than others as actors moved with the cameras to sustain the illusions. It was really something different that came out at the time, especially considering the number of awful movies produced in the mainstream that year, Lord of the Rings really found a good following in a period of utter cinematic slump (at least among the mainstream and partly in the independent features). I think those idiots at the Academy Awards were dumb to pass up recognizing it for one of the top awards that year, probably best director if nothing else. As the first in the series, I think it was given the best treatment as far as writing, visuals, and editing (which would be the bain of the remaining two in the trilogy), and everything else. Again, it was a refreshing change in mainstream films that year, and certainly one well-deserving of the recognition. But the remaining two films, the Two Towers and now, Return of the King, were disappointing for one major reason: there was never enough in the movies (I don't know about the book) to sustain two movies at lengths of three hours or more each (not to mention the additional "bonus" footage feature on the DVDs). Someone here must've been so proud of their CGI creations and the time and money spent developing the sets that they must've felt like it was just bad manners to leave most of it on the cutting room floor. There is far too much repetition going on in the remaining too movies that could've easily have been made into one three hour film, rather than two. The Two Towers spent an ungodly amount of time with those epic battle scenes between the billions and billions of Uruk soldiers and the few good-willed soldiers lead by Aragon and others. I found myself aching for the movie to be over with, and was sadly disappointed considering my interest in the first one. We are left with a story of fleeting interest: Sam and Frodo on their journey to toss the ring in the fire (though the introduction of Gollum, that ugly little bugger, was quite an interesting part of the story), Aragon and his gang were out to battle the relentless Uruk army, and Merry and Pippin literally got to be tree hugging hobbits. If the filmmakers didn't worry so much about pleasing the audience with epic CGI battle scenes and concentrated on developing each separate story of the various characters in their journies, it probably would've been a much better film. Although, considering that the third movie, 'Return of the King,' contained a nauseating amount of repetition as far as the story, and dragging on time with endless amounts of boring, dreamy dialogue and even more endless battle scenes, I still think it should've been combined into one movie. Not only endless dialogue of the fortune tellers and soothsayers, but also an ending that never seemed to end. Once again, it was like the filmmakers tried several things and liked every single ending and just stuck every single one in the movie, whether it was relevant or not (such as Sam and his hobbit daughters or the 'Wizard of Oz' ending where Elijah Wood puts on his queerest happy voice as he greets his friends 'round the bedside). The viewer who suggested that they should of ended it after the coronation was right, there was no need to drag on the movie for another half-hour of fade-ins and fade-outs of one happy ending after the next, as they did enough stalling throughout most of the movies, anyways. Return of the King is definitely overrated and was hardly deserving of the 'Best Picture' Oscar, nor for every other Oscar it snagged this year, leaving little to be anticipated during the awards knowing that the Lord of the Rings team would win whatever award was announced. The Academy was stupid for not recognizing it with top awards the first time around, and instead, waited for the third anti-climatic cult fest to finally give Jackson and his crew their dues. There were far better movies nominated for Best Picture and nearly every other award this year (save the special effects nominations). Once again, though, I do think that Peter Jackson and his crew did good with their efforts to recreate Tolkein's stories cinematically. That kind of undertaking for a trilogy filmed simultaneously over 18 months is quite incredible. I just though that, save for the Fellowhip of the Rings, the filmmakers failed to capitalize on the things that would've made the remaining two films in the trilogy something really great, especially if they weren't so bogged down in special effects and cheesy dialogue.
10.0~This is a great moment in my life! jvanodijk Sign in Permalink What a great movie is this. A great end to a successfull beginning. Especiall the beginning with Gollum was brilliant. The great battle for Gondor is a moment that should be remembered for decades. Peter Jackson shows us how to end a triligy. Now hope he will get an Oscar for his great work. Looking forward for 'The Hobbit' and 'king Kong'.
9.0~Fantastic experience- but Tompo-1 Sign in Permalink I first read the LOTR when I was 15-16 (thats 30 yrs ago). I have read them again from time to time- so yes I'm a bit sad as far as the book goes. The film was a great experience, and I watched it with my 2 sons (boys aged 15 & 13) and they loved it- the eldest one has read the book. However, the part that worries me the most is the part of the film we enjoyed the most (a bit of a paradox, I know)- namely the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. It just doesn't end like that- Aragorn does not arrive on the battlefield with a bunch of ghoulish knights, but with men from Gondor's outlying regions. I let the absence of Tom Bombadil go (I understood the need for brevity), I turned a blind eye to the Glorfindel/Arwen controversy in the race to the Fords at Rivendell (not that important), but the need for brevity or the director's elevation of the romantic interest does not explain this deviation. I think Tolkien wanted the decisive element of the battle to be the work of men- just as the book's final chapters show that the Hobbits can sort out their own problems without the intervention of wizards and kings. Anyway enough of my paranoia about faithfulness to the book- if you watch the films in isolation it has to be 10/10- otherwise 9.9.
10.0~The film that made me a Rings Maniac! brownish33 Sign in Permalink before i saw ROTK in theaters, i had no idea what the big deal was. i remembering seeing the first 2 on VHS years ealier and enjoyed them, but never really GOT into it. however, that all changed when i went with my mom to see ROTK in theaters one day......and i was changed. i cried! i laughed! i felt moments of terror, i FREAKED when frodo fell off the cliff with gollum....only he didn't fall in! it gripped me like no other movie has since! and it instantly made me a fan. now i am a rings maniac, all due to this film. i will admit, fellowship has since become my favorite, but i will never forget the experience of ROTK. the battle scenes were gorgeus and epic, and it was just so GREAT! i waitied for an entire YEAR for the extended version on DVD with baited breath! i read all 3 books that summer (and they were actually like the films were! talk about faithfulness)! the ending made me and my mom cry buckets! stunning, absolutely stunning.
9.0~The Fellowship of The King! magicmansd007 Sign in Permalink When I sat down to watch Viggo Mortenson play Aragorn in The Return of The King, I was so grateful to see him living the role. A stronger performance has never been done by any actor that ever breathed and I don't think a better movie will ever be made. It has the love story. It has the drama, action, and mysticism that any seasoned viewer likes. The art direction is superb and Alan Lee who was the original artist for the book shines his colorful illustrations to our eyes with his incredible art design. The whole cast should celebrate for the rest of their lives because they convinced me that there is beauty and good in the world and it's something worth fighting for. Watch it please. Take a date.
10.0~Best war movie ever made. mesutiskitoglu Sign in Permalink I think we won't see that so much quality job like thiis in any other movie again..
10.0~Excelsior!! efournierswire Sign in Permalink This movie is one of my all time favorite movies, with flawless action seqeunces, touching drama, and well-placed comedy.
10.0~Waw, that is really wonderful ! SpiderBen1966 Sign in Permalink Great movie to end this trilogy. It cannot be better... except if it was longer to include more and more of the books. Even in my dreams, I never hope such an adaptation. Peter Jackson and all the others have made something really outstanding.
10.0~Love It samnot Sign in Permalink One of the Greatest Movies of all time!!!!!!! this movie is an instant classic and amazing! I love the story and characters behind this amazing trilogy of movies! The fight scenes are very well made and the acting is flawless. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy movies that has a good plot, adventure, action, comic relief, and being able to watch it over and over again. This movie got 11 Oscars for very good reasons and it deserves every single one of them. In order to watch this movie you have to watch the first two movies of the Lord of the Rings trilogy which starts with The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by the Two Towers. The Lord of the Rings is and always will be one of my favorite stories of all time! If you have not seen The Lord of the Rings, go to a store and buy all 3 movies to watch them immediately it will be worth your money and time!
8.0~This is how film making should be done ... jackmaaa Sign in Permalink On Lord of the Rings in general: This is how film making should be done, this beautifully woven piece of cinema deserves all the praise and attention it gets, it is truly a labor of love and care, the tremendous amount of effort put into these films makes it a must see for anyone wanting to see how a big budget fantasy blockbuster SHOULD BE MADE! There's nothing bad about this film, and if there is then people would be looking for things that are bad, and that's just knit picking. Everything from the writing, casting, acting, production design, art, cinematography, lighting, music, sound EVERYTHING is spot on with this these films. On this film in particular: The best of the three, that's right, this is the first time I have watched a trilogy/ sequel and can put my hand on my heart and say that these films get better as they go along, mainly because it reaches the ultimate climax it possibly can without losing any momentum and steam from the first films, and has the best pay off you could ask for, changes have been made from the books of course, but every change Jackson has made from Tolkien's novels is completely justified for it's use in a cinematic context, I honestly cried at the end of this film, and that's not an easy task for me, to get me as invested in this world and it's characters as Jackson's trilogy has, well lets just say, it takes a lot, only Pixar has achieved the same with me, and I'll be lucky if any other film is capable of making me do so again. What is there more to say, a beautifully made film, with a wonderfully dramatic climax, you really do get the feeling of being on a journey with these films, you feel enticed with the characters as they embark on it, and for a 3 hour film to do so without losing any momentum (as with all three of them), well that's an achievement in itself. It honestly deserved every award it got and then some.
3.0~3rd part is the worst part (of the movies) schmuller-1 Sign in Permalink I love the books of Tolkien, and I think it's hard for every director to use such a draft for a movie which has to satisfy millions of expectant viewers. But sorry, I don't see the brilliance and own style of Peter Jackson, which in my opinion has to be there for rating this movie so good. An important point is the missing "atmosphere" in the film. In the most threatening situations, the characters are still able to joke around and so destroy the atmosphere (I also don't want to see Michael Myers talking in Halloween, or make some jokes about his victims - that would destroy the atmosphere). Well, it's true, the books have also such scenes, but I think thats deliberately exaggerated to create this atmosphere like it's in f. ex. Beowulf. Thats not important and not meaningful for the movie... OK, because I think every mediocre director can make a worth-seeing movie out of such great books, I can give the books 10 but the movie only 3 points. And in fact, the 3rd movie is really good in this digital stuff, but this incredible dialogues -thats really like Hollywood! Thats for the 3rd part, in my opinion the first part is the best one.... bye fans
10.0~Amazing aludwig10000 Sign in Permalink I don't know how to put this, but I love these LOTR movies. This is one of, if not the, best LOTR movies I've ever seen! The action scenes are very gripping. You're like "Oh, that's not good" when Grond comes in and then you're like "Yeah, that's awesome!" When the Army of the Dead arrives. I highly recommend watching this, but miss out on the previous two movies!
9.0~The Best of the Trilogy. anaconda-40658 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (2003): Dir: Peter Jackson / Cast: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis: Easily the best of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and certainly an improvement over the spectacles that came before it. It is a film about promise as Aragorn leads the battle against progressing evil forces. Frodo and Sam quest to rid the ring into a fire. There are giant spiders, hovering dragons, towering ogres, trolls, and multi-tusked elephants all aimed at the film's exciting finale. Perhaps a few battles long, yet everything comes together with so much more meaning. That is all thanks to director Peter Jackson who seems to be adding not only the finishing touches to the trilogy but also a much needed crown jewel. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf the wizard who oversaw this quest from its core beginning. Solid returns by Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Sam who conflict with the Gollum while questing to finally destroy the ring. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn finally becomes King but not without a number of massive battles to prove its worthiness. Andy Serkis steals every scene consumed within the visual character of the Gollum, out to deceive our heroes and possess the ring. It drives a message of good over evil with courage, honor and glorious special effects. An impressive finish deserving many pleasant returns. Score: 9 / 10
10.0~Execellent treino Sign in Permalink Must admit that Part 3 did not disappoint me at all. Actually I think it was better than the 2 others even though it is difficult to compare them. Though some things are missing in the movie compared to the book, PJ has accomplished to have the most essential parts within this masterpiece. I look forward to see the extended version where Fraramirs love to Eowin is shown. What a great movie, a must see !!
10.0~Unbelievable...in more than one way. RF1972 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is undoubtedly the most magnificent movie to ever grace the silver screen. It always helps when you have a great story, and being a fan of Tolkiens work for over 20 years I can safely say that Peter Jackson has turned my dreams of a trilogy on film to match the trilogy on paper into a wonderful, visually visceral reality. The special effects serve the story, not overwhelm it. The acting from the ensemble cast is perfect and the inaccuracies in the story can be forgiven as the right amount of emphasis has been placed on each scene to captivate and exhilarate the audience. I am quietly confident that all of cinemas most loved trilogies have now been eclipsed. The original Star Wars trilogy, the Godfather trilogy, the Back to the Future trilogy, the Indiana Jones trilogy or indeed any noted trilogy cannot compete with Peter Jacksons superb realisation of Tolkiens masterpiece. I was simply blown away by the entire movie, the laughter, the tears, the rollercoaster of emotions that I was subjected to was immense and no movie in history has ever made me feel, literally feel, with the characters and the story to such an extent. Hopefully the Academy Awards will pay some form of testament to this tremendous movie and adorn it with numerous awards, but should it fail to win a single Oscar, suffice to say, I award it Best Picture, not just of 2003, but of the entire age of cinema.
10.0~Lovely move alamgirhosseen Sign in Permalink Its really very nice movie. i watch at least 10 times
10.0~Sam at last! Iphigenia-of-Arden Sign in Permalink I am not going to repeat again everything that has been said about this movie. It was just great! I don't know if it was better than "Fellowship", but it is far superior to "The Two Towers". Personally, I was really glad to see that Sam was finally developped as he deserved to be. I read the books only once, but he was definitely my favourite character (with Eowyn, I am a bit of a feminist...) and I felt that he had been a bit let down by the two previous movies. So I was so happy to see him in this movie! Sean Astin really does a great job, I just loved him! And now it is over. It left me a bit empty when I left the theater. It had happened to me with books before, but never with movies. But I love it when it happens.
8.0~Very nicely done, too bad they changed the story teowulff@hotmail.com Sign in Permalink The last episode of LoTR is also the one with the greatest battles, I think never before in the history of cinema such great armies were rendered by computer animations - and successfully! The movies has some great features which are all worth while seeing. For me personally, the major annoyance of the whole series - which also takes away the logic - is the fact that they changed the way the siege of Minas Tirith is lifted. *SPOILER* Now in the BOOK, Aragorn summons the undead army at the stone of Erech. The undead don't have any physical form but the mere fear they spread among the Umbar pirate ships cause the pirates to jump overboard. The undead are then freed form their vow by Aragorn and finally find peace. Aragorn then takes the ships and then proceeds to collect the garrisons from the Gondorian cities west of Minas Tirith who have stayed behind to fight the pirates (yes, Gondor isn't just Minas Tirith). He then sails to the battlefield, where they help the Rohirrim who are vastly outnumbered. The Mordor armies flee in terror, as they expected the ships to bring allies, not fierce foes from Gondor. The coming of the ships is also accompanied by a west wind (no doubt symbolic for the return of the kings of Númenor), which blows away the foul fumes from Sauron/Mordor, thus causing the orcs on the battlefield (who hate sunlight) to flee. Now in the MOVIE, the undead accompany Aragorn all the way to Minas Tirith and actually fight with the armies of Mordor. If Aragorn would have collected the undead army a few days earlier, no man from Gondor or Rohan would have died at all and the heroism they showed and pain they suffered unnecessary. The undead would easily have defeated Sauron's forces on their own. In the movie, they can kill orcs and even trolls but simply can't be killed themselves, which effectively makes them an invulnerable army. This was a major disappointment, I see no reason why this was changed in such an illogical way.
10.0~Brilliant, mind-blowing, masterfully crafted - re-defines the word EPIC and should receive multiple Oscars! iamsonoa Sign in Permalink I have just returned from experiencing "The Return Of The King" for the second time, and it still is "mind-blowing". I am in awe of the combined creative talent of Peter Jackson and his crew and their commitment to excellence. This movie is outstanding on all levels: storytelling, acting, production... you name it. The third "Rings" movie is a crowning achievement and brings the trilogy to a very satisfying conclusion. (It more than makes up for the disappointment of the Matrix sequels.) It also outdoes the previous two "Rings" movies on all levels. (And I thought it wasn't possible to top "The Two Towers" when I wrote my comments about that movie a year ago ... I'm sooo glad I was wrong :-) Just a few examples: Were you impressed by how Legolas mounted the horse in the fight sequence with the Warg Riders in "Two Towers"? Wait until you see him do his Olyphant stunt in this movie! Did you perceive the battle at Helm's Deep as an epic battle sequence? (I did!) Compared to the "showdown" at Minas Tirith, Helm's Deep merely feels like a minor skirmish now. As far as realistic CGI is concerned, I thought that the Gollum CGI of the second movie was something very hard to top. Not only is Gollum even better in this third movie, but wait until you see the absolutely life-like rendering of that nasty giant spider Shelob. Oh, and see if you can spot even the tiniest hint of CGI when Gandalf rides into the white city of Minas Tirith ... I couldn't, and I know for a fact that they used CGI "big time" for those scenes, simply because the cost of creating all that with actual sets would have been prohibitive. (That's CGI at its best: when you can't tell that it's CGI and it just serves the purpose of telling the story.) I've given all three movies a 10, simply because the ratings system here does not allow for 9.9 ("Fellowship Of The Ring") and 9.99 ("The Two Towers") ratings. If this movie does not receive "a truckload" of Oscars, it would terminally prove to me that the Academy simply does not acknowledge movies in the fantasy genre on principle. There have been a few other outstanding movies this year that will make for a tough competition in the acting department ("Mystic River" comes to mind, in particular), but IMO this movie takes the crown in pretty much all the other categories. Here's my personal Oscar list for "Return Of The King" (in alphabetic order): Actor in a leading role (Ian McKellen ... or would the supporting actor category be more appropriate? This is really an ensemble cast movie where leading and supporting actors/actresses are hard to sort out, which will probably have the effect of sending the leading role Oscars to other movies.) Actor in a supporting role (My vote clearly goes to Andy Sirkis for bringing Gollum to life on so many levels, but Sean Astin certainly deserves a nomination, too, for those heart-wrenching scenes when they get "up the stairs" into Mordor, and when he finally carries Frodo up Mount Doom.) Actress in a supporting role (Miranda Otto) Art Direction Best Picture Cinematography Costume Design Directing Film Editing Makeup Music (Score) ( Thanks, Howard, for putting themes into my head that I can't get out, anymore ;-) Music (Song) (The great Annie Lennox - the voice of the "Eurythmics" 20 years ago - still has that magic touch of passion and precision that very few singers even get close to ...) Sound (Make sure you see this movie in a theater with an excellent sound system with the volume "cranked up" quite a bit ... and be prepared to cover your ears when the creatures the Nazgul ride begin to scream!) Sound Editing Visual Effects (Now, that's a REAL no-brainer!) Writing (Adapted Screenplay) If my math is correct, that's a total of 14 of those "heavy golden boys". Now, PJ, how are we gonna top THAT? Give me a call!
10.0~3rd time's the charm (don't get me wrong; the first two were equally good). lee_eisenberg Sign in Permalink It all comes down to this. The humans and hobbits now have their final battles to fight with the forces of evil. I can't actually say anything about "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" that does it justice, except to say that it is a great movie in the true sense of the word. Everything that we've awaited in life is summed up in this piece of cinematic history. Every one of the cast members does a masterful job. Therefore, it makes sense that this movie was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture, and won EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. "LOTR: TROTK" is THE movie that you have to see to believe. It is everything that we like about movies.
10.0~It's over, and nothing will ever be the same again. (SPOILERS) mlshoe Sign in Permalink It's over. It's over. And now, somehow, nothing will ever be the same again. That pretty much sums up the ending to "The Lord of the Rings" (both the books and the films). And it also turns out be how I'm feeling right now, after FINALLY getting to see "The Return of the King". (Why did it take so long? Well, I was teaching in Cedar Rapids this week. Doesn't Cedar Rapids have theaters? Yes, but not many. Only one of them was showing "Return of the King", and only on one screen. And oh, to complicate matters still further: it turns out that Elijah Wood lived in Cedar Rapids until he was nine years old, and many of his relatives still live there today, leading to a rather large fan base for this film. And besides that, as one of my students said: there's just nothing else to do in Cedar Rapids. So ALL showings were sold out.) That wasn't how I planned to start this review. But it's what keeps echoing through my head. It's over, and nothing will ever be the same again. No, here's the opening that I originally planned: If you're a Tolkien purist, just stay home. Pretend you never heard of this film. Pretend there was a nasty fire at the studio, and all the master prints were incinerated. Because far, far more than the first two films, this film differs from the book. There are a lot of little differences, a few larger differences, and one great big difference... It's better. OK, before you break out the tar and feathers, realize something about me: I read "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" something like twelve times in middle school and high school, and around three times since. I read every book of Tolkien commentary I could find. I actually read "The Silmarillion" once, cover to cover. While I can no longer read and write Elvish, I once was pretty decent at it -- using the Tengwar script, no less. I once reread the entire series just so I could create a list of all the really memorable quotes. I once wrote musical scores for all of the songs in the books, even the ones in Elvish, because I wanted to capture how they sounded in my head. I'm not just a casual reader, I'm a Serious Fan (just not as Serious as I once was). And I'm telling you: AS A MOVIE, this last movie is better than the last book would have been if it had been filmed verbatim. (Conversely: as a book, this movie couldn't hold a candle to the real book. The richness and depth of the original is what makes the book a classic.) The pacing is better suited to a movie: fewer long introspective scenes, more of a sense of continuity from scene to scene. As with the second film, Jackson chose NOT to follow Tolkien's example of splitting the story into two halves: the Frodo-and-Sam half, and the everybody-else half. Instead, he intermingled the scenes, and did so masterfully. I had a better sense of what was going on with one group while the other group was doing such-and-such than I EVER did with the books (and the books included a calendar in the appendices, so you could go look this up if you wanted). Plus the two parallel story lines let Jackson play with the mood: fast and furious action scene on the Pelennor fields; cut to tense conflict between Frodo, Sam, and Gollum; etc. In the book, the fast and furious action was broken up by long, involved discussions that just wouldn't have played well on the screen. Jackson managed to break up the pace in a much better way, given the time frame and given the fact that the audience probably isn't as interested in the history of Numenorean kings as I am. There are other changes. Lots of them. Again, purists, stay home. There are some fairly major new scenes, usually included as a way to dramatize or bring to light some essential bit of characterization, history, or mental struggle. Some are fairly drastic departures from the book. (ELROND showing up in ROHAN? Arwen falling ill from the Shadow?) I noticed a lot of them at the time; and yet now, two hours later, I can scarcely recall them. They just fit into the narrative so well that they don't stand out as "wrong", in retrospect. And did I say "fast and furious action scenes"? Oh, man, the battles here make the battle for Helm's Deep in the last film look tame! I cannot recall a previous cinematic battle where there was so much going on at once, and yet I could follow the course of the action so well. Helm's Deep in "The Two Towers" and also the battle for Osgiliath were relatively constrained areas for battle. Here, we had the battle of the Pelennor Fields, a great, big, wide open space, where the tactics changed: and the operative word was "motion". No, make that MOTION! Oliphants rampaging all over the Fields, and then going berserk when attacked. The charge of the Rohirrim, and how those swift horsemen just chewed through the ranks of the orcs. The way a war troll could hit someone and send him flying. And the way the Nazgul and their Fell Beasts scattered around, swooping up hapless victims and letting them fall from great heights. These weren't just battles, they were collisions. Oh, and did I mention the special effects? No? That's because there aren't any. I just couldn't notice the special effects. I was watching the story, and the effects were in service to the story. I normally yawn at films that are special effects extravaganzas. (If you want an earful some time, ask my opinion of "Terminator 2".) If there's a story there, you don't need the effects; and if there's no story there, the effects won't impress me. Well, here, all I saw was story. And on that subject: Minas Tirith is just absolutely incredible. I couldn't begin to tell what parts were models, what parts were CGI, and what parts were actual sets. But I can tell you this much: once again, Jackson got it perfect. If you had shown me the various angle shots and never told me what the film was, I am absolutely convinced that I would guess what city I was seeing. Jackson took Tolkien's detailed description of the city and very faithfully brought it to life. Now all this admiration doesn't mean I couldn't have liked it better. There are things that were cut from the book that I would like to have seen: * Gandalf and company debating Saruman in his tower. (I'm told this is slated for the extended DVD.) * The romance between Faramir and Eowyn. (Again, slated for the DVD.) * The orcs in Mordor. I think that, overall, Jackson made a wise choice in cutting down on the Mordor scenes. Those couple of chapters were always the most tedious to me: page after page of struggling over barren plains with no food and water and with danger always close by. It just seemed to go on and on; and actually, that was how the journey was supposed to feel, but it made for tedious reading. But there was one scene, where two orcs discussed their post-war plans, that I always thought was profound. I really got the feeling that these two orcs might be just ordinary guys, if they hadn't been raised as orcs. They wanted the simple, mundane life, just like hobbits; but because they had orc perspectives, their "simple lives" involved setting themselves up as minor bandit chiefs somewhere. I always felt like this scene showed some promise for orcs: if they hadn't been corrupted by Sauron, maybe they wouldn't act like, well, orcs. * The Scouring of the Shire. If you've read the book, you know what I mean. If you haven't read the book, you'll never miss it. It's a post-climactic echo of the larger conflict: the hobbits return home, and find that the Shire has been turned into a little mini-Mordor, with outside thugs and a few bad hobbits running the place for their own benefit. The heroes have to inspire and lead the other hobbits to overthrow their occupiers; and in the end, they find out that this was all a big scheme by Saruman to grow his empire and also exact some revenge. This served a purpose in the book: it showed how far-reaching evil was, and contributed to Frodo's sense of loss. And I absolutely loved the way Merry and Pippin, warriors of Rohan and Gondor respectively, just laughed off the Shirriffs and the thugs. After you've stabbed the Lord of the Nazgul or looked on Sauron in a palantir, what threat is a mere ruffian? But I also understand why this part never made the film: the book has something like six or more chapters of denouement AFTER Sauron is defeated, and a film audience wouldn't want to sit through that. The Scouring would have been at least another 30 minutes, including another battle scene. (And compared to earlier battle scenes, there's just no way that scene would be as exciting.) So this chapter had to go. But I missed it. Now for some comments on individual characters: * Gimli fans: I'm sorry to say that once again, the dwarf is used mostly for comic relief. On the other hand, his line that got the most laughs was straight from the books (right before he entered the Paths of the Dead). * Legolas fans: if you thought he was cool in combat before, wait until you see him take on the oliphant! * Gandalf ROCKS! He's a more active combatant than in the books. And I mean physical combat, not magical. He swings around sword and staff in ways that are really effective and really scary. * Eomer never becomes Aragorn's close friend, and thus there's never the joyous reunion on the Pelennor Fields. * Merry and Pippin are both more active in battle than they were in the book. Plus Pippin's lighting the signal fire was a really fun, tense scene, and it made Denethor look even more defeatist than in the books. * Shelob: very effective. Brrr! * And finally: Gollum. He's much, much sneakier than in the books, even making Frodo distrust Sam during a major scene. But he's also part of probably my only disappointment with the film. In the second film, there was a constant struggle between his meek, good side and his evil side. In this film, there's a struggle; but it's about whether to attack Frodo and Sam directly, or to leave them to Shelob. The good side is gone. That's OK in itself: by the third book, Gollum's evil side had won out. But along the way, Jackson transposes some dialog from the second book. In the original, Gollum's sides debate, and the good side almost wins! But Sam disturbs him, accuses him of "sneaking", and inadvertently pushes the victory to the evil side. Gollum rightly gets offended when his efforts to do good are turned against him. I actually felt pity for him when he told Frodo, "Smeagol's a sneak," in a rebuke at Sam. In the third film, the same scene -- Sam accusing Gollum, Gollum taking offense -- with almost the same words does not lead to pity but to dread: for what Sam interrupted was a debate between evil Gollum and eviler Gollum, and Sam's accusations were completely justified. The ending is pretty much exactly the ending from the books. That disappointed some people seated near us, because it's really rather a slow ending, and a little on the downer side to boot. But that's exactly how it's supposed to end. Not to spoil it for anybody, but "Sometimes, the hero doesn't get to enjoy his success" was a major point of the story. And now it's over. And now, somehow, nothing will ever be the same again. I'll see these films again, many times; but I'll never again get to experience the surprise -- so strong in this film and the first, less strong in the second -- of seeing a picture that formed in my brain almost three decades ago suddenly appear on screen just the way I imagined it, but with far richer detail. Nothing will match that experience. And that, really, is how these films are MOST like the books: nothing will match them. While I have enjoyed other fantasy books and series on rare occasions, no book or series has ever engrossed me in the same way. Long ago, I came to the realization that there simply was no scale on which to compare. There was Tolkien, and there was everyone else. It really came down to this: there's only one "Lord of the Rings". But now there are two. Thank you, Peter Jackson.
3.0~Quite Weak Actually... aquinofgv Sign in Permalink I didn´t like this movie, because it´s story is pretty much based on Clichés, and the target for it are children with 14 yrs - less. While the photography, the music and the especial effects are really good, the acting (if there was any) and the history itself are plain lame. I can´t understand why it´s so overrated, there isn´t really anything that good on this flick...
10.0~See it to believe it!!!!!!!! maz4u61 Sign in Permalink I was still in high-school and first LOTR:FOTR came out. I watched posters all over the place, on the bus stop, in subways and everywhere. I went to watch a movie and saw the trailer. it has very ancient type look and has no interesting feelings. The only part that looked very surprising was the end of the trailers with humongous army. Then, one day i was surfing the web and hit the download link on Kazza (if people may know what Kazza was at that time). AFter few hour the download was complete. So i sat on the chair in front of the 15 inch computer screen with video size of iphone screen (600*400). After more than three hours my mind was lost in that small screen. I could not believe what i saw. I was a spectacle of life. A sheer journey to the land of fantasy, warriors, and elves ( I kind of fell in love with Arwen at that time). Then i realized that some how the end was not complete. It stuck in my mind for few days, then started surfing the web again. Eventually, i found out that it was the first part of the trilogy. And after 10 years its is still the best movie ever made. The movie rewrote the scale ad scope of making movies. I hope The hobbit turns out to be of similar calibre.
10.0~Movie of the year, and the final part in the best trilogy ever! catohagen Sign in Permalink So the journey ends. No more epic Christmas movies to be looking forward to. Then again, do we really know this? What if in 2008, Peter Jackson and the rest of his marvelous crew return with "The Hobbit". Or some other filmmaker decides to honour Tolkien and Jackson, by creating another fantastic fantasy film. No doubt one of these two things will happen, preferably both, but still it would not be able to compete with "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Just as the books were, and still are, pioneers in the written fantasy genre, these films will forever stand as the best "book-to-film" trilogy ever created. Obviously others will try to copy and steal from these movies, but will they ever reach the same level of excellence? No. Many have spoken of Oscars to Viggo Mortensen and Sean Astin, but to this I disagree. Not because their performances are not worthy of it, but simply because all the actors and actresses in this trilogy should be honoured. They all contribute in making these films as good as they are. No, do something special and give the Oscar to all, not just one. When it comes to directing, there is not much doubt. If Peter Jackson does not win this year (he should have won the two previous years as well), the Academy is making a fool out if itself. Again. This man directed THREE movies at once. As far as I know, this has not been done before. If they all had been crap, or just one of them, you could discuss whether or not he deserved this prize, in spite of the historic achievement in directing. Then again, why even bother thinking this, when the trilogy is the best ever created? In short: Peter Jackson IS the best director of the year! I could go on about every member of the crew, but you would not bother reading it all, so I'm not going to. What I want to say, is this: Three movies to rule them all, one crew to create them. One Academy to bring them all, and in public honour them. CCH out.
10.0~The Journey Ends....sadly :( him_bam_cky14 Sign in Permalink yes well sadly the journey must come to and end. I love these movies. They are amazing. All of the details are just so well put together. The actors do an excellent job portraying Tolkien's characters. But by far Return of the King was my favorite out of the 3. I loved the action sequences the best because it gives off so much energy. well I am so very sad that its all over but it was worth it. these movies will live on forever.
10.0~Absolutely fantastic! mtanderso Sign in Permalink Excellent film! The battle sequences in this movie were as Peter Jackson predicted - 100 times more gripping and mesmerizing than the Helms Deep battle in The Two Towers. Jackson has remained true to the spirit of the books in all aspects of the story he has told. He couldn't have done any better!
8.0~Great and Epic ending spaceboy-9 Sign in Permalink Last night I saw all three in a row and it was truly excellent. The Gollem Flashback was a great idea (and tribute to Andy Serkis). The travel continued and it was nicely visualised how hard it became for Sam and Frodo to go any further. You see the characters grow in the movies and the use of humor is well-dosed. I expected a bit more work with Aragorn's sword but it was ok. I also agree with a earlier comment about the ease of defeating the Orcs. But hey ...they are no Uruks. In 2 words: Great Work
10.0~I want my money back... NaughtiusMaximus Sign in Permalink ... so that I can pay for another ticket and go and see it again, and again, and again... I was stunned. Literally. The film is incredible. Only someone with a psychological aversion to fantasy won't be able to see at least one thing great on the big screen when this film is runnig. Those who dismiss it as 'popcorn fair' may have a point - there certainly is a lot of spectacle up there - but you fdpn't have to read between the lines, or look deeper, because it's not the special effects or sweeping visuals that carry you along (although, that helps!) but the characters, the drama, the intensity... Sod it - I'm off to see it again. Later.
8.0~The End of the Trilogy and it's good, except the end! mjw2305 Sign in Permalink The first 2 films were very good and not having read the books, i really wanted to see this, everyone seemed to think it was the best of the three movies and I didn't know what was going to happen next. I sat down expecting to be enthralled for another 3 hours, and to be fair i wasn't disappointed, that is until the end, unnecessarily it tainted the entire point to the trilogy. I'm not sure if this happened in the book but, here we go - Frodo reaches Mordor, has a pretty good wrestle with his conscience and with Gollum, and finally throws the ring into the fires of Morder. Great nothing wrong there, so end the film. But no, we then see the world collapse all around poor Frodo, (who's already had a pretty bad time) and he finds himself trapped on a rock surrounded by the fires of Mordor. And there it is, in flies Gandalf on some winged beast and whisks him to safety. What a crock of s**t! Why didn't the sadistic git's who sent poor Frodo on this voyage, just give him one of those winged beasts in the first place and save him a whole boat load of trouble. This ending really tainted the entire illusion for me, and a trilogy that i could have loved, left me feeling a little cheated. For its attempts at greatness i give it 8/10, but it would have 9 or maybe 10/10 if it had ended a few minutes earlier and not contrived to achieve a bigger climax.
3.0~They read a different book... bob-26 Sign in Permalink There was so much love and hate from me and my friends for the first two movies: Nearly perfect visualization, but some really bad interpretation of the main characters. Watching The Return of the King was unbearable and I left the cinema when I saw Gandalf and Frodo giggling after the fall of the ring and making themselves ridiculous. I guess Return of the King totally missed the spirit of the book. All the highlights of the third book went wrong in the movie: The fight of Eowyn against the Lord of the Nazgul; Aragorns and his way of the death; the relationship between Gandalf and Denethor; when Gandalf saved Faramir of the Nazgul; the relationship between Pippin and Denethor; the meeting between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgul; Aragorn healing the people of Minas Tirith after the battle; ... But mostly I was disappointed about the behaviour and attitude of some of the main characters: I think that Gandalf, Legolas, Eowyn, Pippin, Merry and Denethor don't match with the characters in the book. And that is really a great disappointment for me. Sorry for my bad english...
10.0~More than ready Nerwen7 Sign in Permalink Usually I don't want to see a movie more than once in a theater let alone a movie this long. But I just want to see it again, as well I can't wait for the extended version to come out on DVD. However i know that it will be a while with how good and popular it is.
10.0~Simply Fulfilling eternity_phoenix Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's directing of the final installment to the trilogy is nothing short of a miracle. The battle of Minas Tirith was stunning, the CG is highly realistic and the characters integrate very well into the scenes. The dialogue of the characters mostly correspond to Tolkien's portrayal in the book; however, it is a requirement that the dialogues are made to be easier to understand rather than being kept in the original Tolkien style since you cannot 're-see' a scene like when you can 're-read' a part of the book if you did not understand. The choice of actors are, undoubtedly, most suitable while the costume and prosthetics are as realistic as it gets. Howard Shore was great and words could not describe the sensations that flow out of each of his pieces. I do not understand why some people actually accuse the film of being terrible in any aspect. The length of the film is a necessity in order to be able to portray the depth of the story and do justice to Tolkien's masterpiece. If it was to be any shorter then the film would be missing essential elements required to bring out the majesty of Middle-Earth. It is simply unfair to say 'that and this is missing therefore it is not worth watching' because if Jackson was to include everything EACH of the trilogy would be over 10 hours long (assuming it took everyone that long to read). I for one will not be sitting in a chair for 10 hours and I believe it will also be unpractical to produce a movie that is 10 hours long. It follows that there will be minor discrepancies in the plot but it did not deter the storyline, keeping in mind that this is an adaptation. Despite some criticism of this film being overrated, I believe that it deserves to be ranked as one of the best films ever produced and its grandeur unmatched. Overall, this is a very enchanting film that is worth watching especially for fans of the Lord of the Rings. The Extended Edition is also a personal recommendation as it includes some missing elements that were not necessary for the progression of the plot but adds nicely to the storyline.
10.0~A Brilliant and Magnificent Masterpiece fallenadvocate311 Sign in Permalink As a movie virtuoso, I have seen nearly over hundreds of movies dating back as far as the mid 70's. However, it is sometimes difficult to find a movie out there that is worthy of anyone's 95 minutes of their day. With all the nonsense, exaggerated, repetitive, and culturally degrading pieces of work out in the movies today, I can come to agree with that. However, as many titles that may leave your eyes bleeding, there are some that leave not only your eyes, but your ears begging for more. In Summer 2003, I was already impressed by the opening trailers to the icing of the ingenuity cake. I had no idea how much better the presentation really was until I walked into the theaters that Winter, only to be overwhelmed by the beautiful opening music as the title was being presented. 'The Return Of The King', focuses on many life ordeals at the same time keeping it's creative fantasy structure into perspective. Troubles such as betrayal, deception, disloyalty, greed, and malice are all shown in this work, showing how our lives can relate to a world so very different than reality. Not only did the flowing dialogue allow viewers to validate the setting similar to the medieval ages, but that the soundtrack used in this masterpiece was not only original, but absolutely beautiful and astonishing. The instrumentals along with the vocals throughout numerous scenes in the film, made it so much worth watching. It had almost been as if someone had made a visualization of an epic poem and combined it with an exciting and interest-grabbing plot. My recommendation to this film is pretty strong. This film has definitely earned it's 11 academy awards as well as it's box office high. I can clearly say this film, inspired by Tolkien's brilliant novels, is one of the most exquisite and most beautiful pieces of literature turned into a pure illustrated masterpiece. Bravo, Peter Jackson, bravo.
10.0~An excellent conclusion to the trilogy. MortiZ_01 Sign in Permalink I must of enjoyed this one of the most out of the 3 LOTR movies. It has it all action, story, drama, the list goes on. You feel yourself forming emotional bonds with the characters and when its all over you find yourself feeling sad that the journey has finally come to an end. Peter Jackson has created something truly monumental here, and dare I say the best Trilogy ever made, If you can call it a trilogy as it is in essence one movie. I urge you to see this movie as soon as possible.
10.0~Thrilling end to a brilliant trilogy! pj304 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson should well and truly be proud of himself. He has directed one of the best trilogies ever to exist. Return Of the King sadly marks the end of this epic adventure and it certainly doesn't disappoint. My only grievance with the movie is that two important charcters were cut out completely - Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Grima Wormtongue (Brad Douriff). It seems as though these two characters just disappeared off the face of Middle Earth, with no mention what of happened to them! Of course, from the book, we know that they both die but it would have been nice to see the scene in Return of the King. But if I am not mistaken, the scene will appear in the Extended Edition when it comes out next year. Despite this minor blip, the movie still deserves a solid 8.5/10
10.0~The long farewell Dockelektro Sign in Permalink And so it ends. The world of movies has written another chapter of its history, and seals it with gold. One of the vastest literary works ever has its hommage payed in a set of movies that not only are already groundbreaking, but also are the dawn of so many things. Maybe that's the reason it is so difficult to say goodbye to all those things we cherished so much. All those characters and situations are now in history, and everybody that made them come to life are also in the memories of moviemaking. And this movie is such a long goodbye that, if you spend some seconds thinking of everything that these three pictures have given us, you will not be able to hold the tears. I wasn't. I was immersed in another world, thinking of so many things like "How can they do this? How can they create such a world and not losing grasp of it even if briefly? How can they sum the whole purpose of movies in one single feature, and give you some of the most unforgettable cinema experiences of a lifetime?". And the eternal feeling of being in front of living history, in front of everything movie-loving people like me are after was so much to handle. The door is now closed. All the people we cherished on that silver screen will live now only in our living rooms and in our imaginations. In the end, the bitterness of the inevitable "so long" is hardened by one single fact: Tolkien's work was one of the biggest achievements ever of human imagination. I have no doubt that the unique feeling these movies provoked in us will be lived again, but unfortunately many years will pass until humanity achieves such a ride through the realms of imagination. All we can do is hope that this trilogy enlightens all minds and prove once and for all that nothing is impossible as long as you can picture it in your mind. Thus, goodbye. Shall we live to see other movies like this one.
10.0~Like all Great Classics, it's worth everyone's while to see these films. DragoonKain Sign in Permalink I tend to find that the people who have not seen these films yet are people that assume they will not like it, or feel intimidated by its epic scale, running time, and/or feel turned off by the fantasy genre in general. Do not let this deter you from seeing these films, they are definitely worth your time for one viewing as they are great movies, and destined to be classics. I would go as far to say that they are the best book adaptations to film, but this is, of course, all a matter of opinion. (And as a long time fan of the books, I'm a bit biased). First of all, I highly reccomend seeing the extended editions of these films as opposed to the theatrical versions. You may want to wait for the EE of RotK to come out on DVD before watching these films. The Extended Editions are simply far superior versions because it more closely captures the pacing, and feel of the books. There is also more depth of character and development introduced in the Extended Editions lacking from the shorter theatrical versions. Whereas the theatrical versions are simple, but good action/special effect movies, the Extended Editions are grand epic adventures that have far more depth and intelligence to them. Secondly, unless you are watching them for the first at a LotR buttnumbathon type party, I do not reccomend watching them all at once. All together, these films clock in at about 12 hours not including breaks. Your rear will probably be hating its existence by the time you get to Return of the King. Instead, I reccomend watching it small doses. The Extended DVD Editions split the films over 2 discs and are perfectly designed for 6 90-120 minute episodic viewings. This is the length of an average film, and allow for much less of a time commitment. Still, I reccomend you not wait too long before seeing the next part, as these films essentially are one story with many characters, place names, and plot lines that can be easily forgotten. It's best to watch one DVD per night over 6 nights. Treat it like a really good TV mini-series that you don't want to miss each night. Lastly, turn off the lights, pump up the volume, and TURN ON THE SUBTITLES. There are many strange words in these films, and it helps if you can see them written in front of you. The films are pretty easy to follow, but the plot is also complex and deep. You will enjoy the films more if you understand as much as you can, as one of the main appeals of Tolkien's story is its attention to detail. I can guarantee you that if you give these films a chance and take my reccomendations to heart you will not be disappointed. Enjoy.
10.0~WOW!! Unbelievable! 10/10 BUT VERY SCARY IN PLACES!! stamp1 Sign in Permalink When I left the theater today, I felt the same emotions that I felt when I saw "Star Wars" opening weekend back in 1977. Unbelievable! Magnificent! Mind-Boggling! WOW!!! In fact, I said the word "WOW" out loud maybe 10 different times while watching! My previous favorite movies this year, "Finding Nemo" and "Pirates of the Caribbean", although still great favorites, are not as good, in my opinion, as the masterpiece epic "LOTR3" was. The audience reaction to the movie was very interesting. The audience clapped and cheered numerous throughout the film, just like with the original "Star Wars" and very few other movies during the past 25 years. Several times people stood up and were yelling and shouting at the screen. The lady next to time began crying several times, one time she just lost it, and was crying hysterically. And I got worried sitting next to her. At the end of the film, I found that sometimes my eyes started leaking a little also, despite my best efforts to stifle such emotions. The audience was talking about how great the film was as they were leaving. And it was VERY SCARY IN NUMEROUS PLACES! Which made the audience jump out of their seats or hide under their coats!! (Me too! I was scared several times, the fight with the spider was INTENSELY NERVE-WRACKING. And the dragons flying overhead were CHILLING AND EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING. This is when the audience kept jumping out of their seats the most. There are several scenes where the evilness of Sauron's wicked army of minions is clearly shown to us, they are very scary scenes, and some of the wicked creatures are very horrific to look at. The fish scene with Gollum at the film's beginning is a real gross-out. Parents, this film is too SCARY and INTENSE in my opinion, for children under age 9 or 10! If your young children have been brought up on a steady diet of horror/slasher movies, maybe they won't be as scared. But I doubt it! The scariness is most intense in the scenes were the SUSPENSE IS UNBEARABLE!! I won't say which scenes those are, but there are several. I DO NOT THINK parents should allow their kids to see this movie without accompanying them, and if necessary, holding their hands, or putting your arms around them when it is at it's most intenseness. The most important aspect of the movie was it's EMOTIONAL IMPACT. This movie was an EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER right from the start, and it never let up for 3 hrs plus running time. I was gripping the armrests on my seat for almost the entire time. If only there had been some boring scenes to give us a chance to catch our breath, and let our nerves get over the latest fright, but I don't remember any places in the movie where you could relax! YOU MUST GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE THIS FILM STARTS, BECAUSE YOU WILL MISS A LOT OF PLOT AND EXCITEMENT, IF YOU LEAVE IT AT ANY TIME, except maybe the last ten minutes or so. Be sure to bring tissues, most of the audience sitting around me was crying or sobbing, or weeping through parts of the film. Women were crying more than the men it seemed like. Can a movie win an Oscar for background scenery? It was probably the most magical backgrounds and beautiful locations EVER FILMED!! (HAS TO BE IN THE TOP 3 ANYWAY!) The battle scenes were UNBELIEVABLE! It was just amazing! There were references to some other films, especially the "Wizard of Oz", when the ringwraith meets his end. The movie was full of allegories, dripping and soaking in them, especially religious and historical ones. But unlike "The Matrix 2 & 3" you didn't feel like someone rubbed your face in them. In this movie, they were obvious, but in the background, readily noticeable, but never distracting from the screen action. If only "Matrix 2 & 3" could have been directed by Peter Jackson!! Speaking of direction, if there is any justice in this world, Peter Jackson would win every award this year for best director. The actors were all great, even the evil ones were fantastic! Standouts were Sean Astin, and Andy Serkis. Sean Astin's acting provided much of the rampant emotionalism in the theater audience. When he was angry, the audience got angry, when he cried, everyone around me seemed to also start crying. He would signal to the audience what they should be feeling, and the audience FELT IT! When Ian McKellan was on the screen, YOU JUST COULD NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF HIM. HE WAS MAGNETIC!! But everyone was just great! Every actor in this movie should be proud, most have probably been in the best movie they will ever make, and given the best performances they will ever give!! As for the adaptation of the book, I read "LOTR" 30 years ago, so I don't remember the little details, but I thought Peter Jackson and any other writers WERE VERY FAITHFUL to the classic book. Far more than most other movies are. Especially "Cat In The Hat", where the movie was not at all what Dr. Seuss wrote or intended. I felt like J.R.R. Tolkien would be very proud of these filmed adaptations of his books. And I think his heirs should be proud of this film too. Watching it on a giant movie screen, the time just seemed to fly by, no one seemed to want to leave when the words came up on screen, "The End". I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN ANY BETTER, I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT AS PERFECT AS A MOVIE CAN GET!! (I know, I said that about "Finding Nemo" also!) I voted it a 10/10. I asked my friend who went with me, if he thought it was as good as the first 2 LOTR's. We both agreed, "LOTR3" was the rare sequel that was better than the original! We thought it was the best film of the trilogy. This movie, for people over the age of 10 maybe, was Definitely Worth the price of admission. (I saw it at the matinee price, not the evening price.) Take the time to see it, I am certain that you too, will be saying WOW!!
10.0~One word - Perfect. dgeer80 Sign in Permalink In my opinion, this movie is absolutely flawless. Never have I witnessed such a perfect movie. It doesn't get any better than this, nor will it ever again. But some people still think there are flaws. Well, I suppose people are entitled to be wrong. The long ending needs to be the way it is. Not just because that's how the book is (actually, the book is longer at the end), but because we have to have an ending that ends the story of all the important people involved with the Ring. It is ONE ending, about the people involved with the ONE Ring. The absence of Saruman. Not a flaw. It's about how much Peter Jackson is allowed to put in theaters. He has a time limit. Saruman's only filmed scene in the movie was 7 minutes long and all dialogue and at the beginning of the movie. That's seven minutes that we could be getting on to more important things. Let's face it: Saruman is not the main bad guy. Sauron is. Saruman was defeated at Isengard by the Ents, because Isengard itself was destroyed and his army was destroyed at Helm's Deep. He is now imprisoned inside his tower to live in misery. He got what he deserves. Now it's time to deal with the real bad guy. It's also kind of a chance for redemption for Saruman. Remember, he was once good. He only turned evil because he was corrupted by his lust for the ring. But even so, he DOES get the torture he deserves. Death is too good for him. Let him rot. So what if we don't see him? Besides, he will be in the extended version released later next year. This is truly a great film. After it was over, I thought I was dreaming because movies are never THIS good. A lot are really great and all, but none come even close to how good this one is. Nor will they ever. It's absolutely incredible, and no complement I give it will do the movie justice. It's untouchable, and will go down in film history as the greatest film of all time.
1.0~Mediocre ,boring,and highly overrated Josh20 Sign in Permalink Yes,this movie has great production values,but it is artificial,false,without a single remarkable performance(I adore Ian McKellen) and cheese lines from the most commercial and stupid Hollywood.The humor between Gimli and Legolas is so simple and stupid that i had to laugh and the hobbits jumping in Frodo's bed at the end is one of the most ridiculous moments of my spectator's life .The battles are a poor imitation of Lawrence of Arabia.Peter,i prefer you in Heavenly Creatures,your great masterpiece.This movie is only for fans,not for me.I will say this movie is the worst of the five nominees to Oscars(Mystic River and Lost In Translation are great movies ,much much better than this piece of crap for male teenagers)
9.0~Extremely good, fairly long, a few graphical flaws. Bartholomule Sign in Permalink I don't think anything I'm posting here will spoil anything, as clips of it were used in the TV promos. As I have only seen this movie once (early screening), any complaints here (though there are few) may become more apparent, or less so, after more viewings. I thought this movie was very good. A little long, especially the end, which seemed to drag on--cleaning up all the loose ends and giving closure. I enjoyed the action scenes with the computer generated characters. The notable ones were Gollum/Smeagol, and the spider. They had very good blending between CG action and the human actors. I also liked the close-up shots of Gollum, where his lip motion more correctly matched his speech than in the distant shots (the close-up shots were almost lifelike). My only complaints about the movie as a whole would be the dragging ending (although it seemed to produce quite a few wet eyes in the audience), a few CG action sequences where the physics did not seem quite correct, or the shots from one angle did not match that of another. Only read on if you wish to see details of my few complaints. The first of these were the large boulders being hurled from the trebuchets; the acceleration through the lifting and throwing seemed reasonably believable, however the impact of those rocks did not. Only one of the rocks (I'll have to watch again to be certain it was only one) had any tumble at all after impacting the ground, the rest didn't even appear to move any dirt. I suppose the sound effects did a reasonable job of covering for that. The second CG sequence complaint that I would have is when Legolas is mounting the elephant. Like the scene in "The Two Towers" where he mounts a running horse (swinging up one side, then under the neck of the horse to mount on the other), this section was humorous in it's impossibility. His ascent to the top of the elephant looked worse than riding it's trunk until he could step off. My third and final CG complaint would be the integration of the ghost army in the fight sequences with live actors. I know that this is a difficult section to perform, but all of the ghost action appears to be happening only in the background against computer generated orcs and other "bad people", instead of trying to place some of those ghosts among the live action in the foreground. Thus, the wave of ghosts visible from the high-overhead shot did not match that of the near-horizontal shots of Aragorn running along the field. The overhead shots seemed like the ghosts were trailing him, and on both sides, the side-view shots only showed them at a great distance over his left shoulder. Again, I thought the movie was great; it is deserving of all the plaudits it will receive. I only feel that it is fair to bring forth the good and the [little] bad for fair comments.
10.0~10/10 Excellent thebenjaminhuynh Sign in Permalink If there were three words to describe this they would be: Epic, ,Inspiring and Original The lore behind the books is amazing and to see it go on the big screen is a wonder to behold. The movie was captivating and every moment was one to cherish. This movie used music that fit in with the theme and helped create a whole new genre of fantasy, not only in movies but also with video games. The acting was excellent in my opinion as the characters were lifelike and vibrant. This movie is a must see movie and an amazing finale of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy that started with the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers in an almighty battle to end it. Very well done Peter Jackson
10.0~oh what a wonderful world tolkien weaves. noreensabby Sign in Permalink hands down, this is the best movie i, or anyone i know, has ever seen, based on an amazing, yet until now under-rated, book series. the graphical engineering put into the special effects, are more lifelike than almost any i have seen, and make most movies, (ie. matrix revolutions) look like an 80's arcade game compared to the fmv sequences in ffX. the plot is flawless, and the script takes that to a whole new level. the casting, all but perfect, though i cant think of anyone better for any of the roles, (perfection is just unattainable on earth).
10.0~A Masterpiece in all Levels guiblasco Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson as made THE film where all the knowings of Cinema converge to a single point where is the defenition of beauty and authenticity.
10.0~Amazing! duasyed16 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie! It was amazing, i especially liked the ending/war part of the movie! When Aragorn became King i was just so happy! There were a lot of interesting parts in the movie. Gollum was very well portrayed in this movie, it really showed how he struggled in life before and after the ring came to him. Andy Serkis did very well. I liked that it had a lot of action in it because there is a lot of action in the book as well. I think that Frodod should have struggled more in destroying the ring rather than having Gollum cast it into the fire so quickly and happily. Return Of The King was the best out of the three LOTR films, although i liked The Hobbit trilogy better.
10.0~Great! - Spoilers Ryan_Masters Sign in Permalink This is a GREAT movie. Even better than the two previous parts, which also deserved kudos. The end of the story was an open end, but in the book this was the same, although if I remember correctly this happened much later. Also there were some details which could have been better. Some examples: The sorcerer Saruman just didn't show up in this movie anymore. What happened to him? Also of course Gollem had a chance to get the Ring back much sooner. But here the movie kept in line with the book. The ghost army was too fast. It almost spoiled the battle. Anyway, let's not run down a superb movie, which deserves to be watched over and over again. Also, don't forget to read the books!
10.0~A superb cinematic treat scotchtape Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is an utterly superb film. As a reader of books, I love the way the film displays a visual interpretation of such an evocative novel. As a watcher of films, I adore the cinematic spectacle and the luxurious use of stunning images. The film is a cycle of emotion. It is distinct from the other two films in the trilogy in that its pathos is genuinely moving and as a consequence its humour is relieving and funny. Between these two peaks of emotion there lies fear, ever-present in the desperate and threatening context of the events of the film. The acting was generally superb and the script likewise. Though flaws and complaints are to be found, they are trivial in the face of such a wonderful piece of cinema. The utter devotion and bravado of all the film-makers who were involved is clear, and it translates into the best film of 2003.
10.0~So, So close... exitmusic99 Sign in Permalink I will start by saying that I am foremost a longtime fan of the book and I have enjoyed the first to very much. In fact, I enjoyed this one a great deal as well. Probably even more than the first two. It was an absolute thrill to see the characters and events that I have read about come alive on screen with such skill. I will keep the praise limited, since there is no shortage of it here, and mention the few things that disapointed me to a degree: ***Possible spoilers if you have not read the book*** 1. The confrontation between the Witch-King of Angmar and Gandalf at the gate of Mina Tirith. I got chills the first time I read that passage and was SO looking forward to seeing that on screen. 2. The absense of the Mouth of Souron outside the gate of Mordor. I couldn't wait to see Weta's and PJ's interpretation of his appearance. 3. And of course, the truncated Isengard scene. All in all, I say thank you very much PJ and New line for putting your necks on the line to bring us this quality piece of film history. 9.8/10
10.0~Boring vox-sane Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings" is not three features but one film broken into three parts. The first two parts, "Fellowship of the Rings" and "The Two Towers" were impressive and interesting. In "The Return of the King", just as with Hobbiton, Moria, Rivendell, Lothlorien, Rohan and Helm's Deep, the new sites like Minas Tirith and Dunharrow were impressive (and Minas Tirith got a "Wow" from me). However, as with the other films, the characters are unengaging and, while the battle scenes are moderately more decipherable than the first two installments of the film (in this one, you can at least tell who is killing whom), there's odd variations from the book (where is the Scouring of the Shire? What on middle-earth was that unnecessary spectacle of the death of Denethor?) and movie cliches that seem to be derivative of such sources as "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Taken as a movie to itself, the whole was unengaging and while it's pretty to look at so that it wasn't altogether tedious, it was three and a half hours of (mitigated) boredom. Perhaps when the DVD -- with extra footage that may explain such things as the inexplicable disappearance of Saruman, and when the three parts are seen in some sort of continuity -- maybe then the film of the greatest (fictional) story ever told will be engaging. Otherwise, "The Return of the King" had all the wonderful and antiseptic spectacle of a freshly scrubbed art museum.
9.0~this is the best movie out of all three theguys1 Sign in Permalink Let me explain the action sequences in the first two Lord of the Rings movies. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there wasn't much action, just mostly running. In The Two Towers, it was fighting without much gore included. The third was simply mind-blowing with amazing fight scenes, and pretty much all the violence you could imagine. Don't get me wrong, violence truly isn't everything in a movie. But this had excellent special effects and fight scenes. This is a movie that will thoroughly spend 200 minutes of your time, and it's usually hard to find a movie like that. This movie is rare, adventurous, and enjoyable. Not a kid's movie.
10.0~Hooked a_sailor_girl Sign in Permalink After watching this movie last night, I now regret not seeing the first two movies while they were in the theatres! I have never read the books so I have no idea how true to the book the Return of the King is. Others in the theatre mentioned that there were gratuitous small changes. Sam and Boromis are two of the characters that were mostly neglected in the previous movies and are developed massively in this last chapter of the epic: the acting and emoting were so real that I wanted to cry at times. Frodo, Aragon, et. al are wonderful as usual. Battle scenes were, as usual, spectacular: seeming hundreds of thousands of orcs and humans clash in the most fantastic war scene I can imagine. Remember that in this battle (spoiler if you haven't read the book), the dead come to fight, as do war elephants, and giant orc-like things! These seemed so very real. ************************************************* Slight spoiler if you haven't read the book: the giant spider thing is very realistic. As an arachnaphobe, I was freaked out. On the other hand, it was shot so that I could hold my hand up and cover my eyes enough to miss seeing it but not Frodo most of the time. Other spoiler: Remember Legolas's gorgeous horse scene and rampart surfing scene from the previous films? One of the scenes from this movie trumps even those! Final spoiler (large): The ending, in remaining true to the novel, seems to never end...
10.0~A great finish marissathompson2012 Sign in Permalink One of the best movie series I have seen in a while. This one is though by far my favorite. Not just the ending but the final battle as well. Through all the movies you see the struggles that each character, especially Frodo, goes through. And to see in the end such a remarkable battle followed by Frodo and Bilbo leaving together on the boat; just made for a perfect ending. Through all the movies you see the characters go from complete strangers and in some cases enemies, to close friends. Only the strongest friendships are formed in the toughest of situations. This series shows that perfectly. To see the struggles and the victories brought to life so well is amazing. I would definitely recommend this and all the other Lord of The Rings or The Hobbit movies to any fantasy movie lovers.
10.0~A fitting end to a perfect trilogy bryanlaszlo Sign in Permalink The best way to sum up the impact and quality of this movie? It was everything that the Matrix trilogy wanted to be and couldn't. In deed, this trilogy will likely eclipse the original Star Wars films as the greatest film trilogy of all time. It strikes me as one that will be timeless, appealing to generations of film lovers. TRotK is a masterwork in every sense, bringing the series to a triumphant, breathtaking conclusion. It continues the pace of growing ever larger, while simultaneously becoming more intimate in terms of character growth. It is, in short, the perfect visual realization of JRR Tolkien's vision. Congratulations to the new king of moviedom, Peter Jackson, and the wonderful actors that breathed life into the biggest cinema gamble of all time.
10.0~give us more Faramir and Eowyn bionic_hobbit Sign in Permalink A big fan of the trilogy, I liked this movie very much. I hope that the extended version will bring us a bit more of the characters Faramir and Eowyn, which were nicely developed earlier, but somehow didn't make the cut here. Pippin's song was my favorite moment.
10.0~Best Movie Ever joshdykens7 Sign in Permalink I have seen a lot of great films in my day and in my opinion this is one of if not the best film ever made. Peter Jackson does an amazing job as a director. He creates the siege of minas tirith perfectly. He uses the best effects that money can buy and they look fantastic. Having nasgul fly down and rip a trebuchet off a massive wall is true cinematic art. On top of this there is an epic story that everyone can fallow. Every time I view this movie I am amazed by what I see. I am entertained begging to end. This is by far the best film of the series which is also amazing to watch begging to end. 11 well deserved academy awards for LOTR RTK including best picture and best director. If your a movie fan then watching the Lord of the Rings series is a must.
10.0~Jackson's crowning achievement gheremond Sign in Permalink Just like the book it was based on, the third Lord of the Rings movie towers above its siblings and brings the series to a cataclysmic conclusion, in every sense of the word. From its gigantic battle sequences, to its heartbreaking personal moments, Return of the King redefines what is possible in cinema and sets the impossible bar every other masterpiece must be measured against from now on. Clocking in at almost 3 and a half hours in its theatrical cut, it covers most of the material in the book and wins every point for its immensely satisfying coda. Howard Shore gets another two Oscars and Jackson and co are finally paid their dues. I have never been happier on an Oscar night.
10.0~Good fantasy literature can make for great fantasy films dragonlady Sign in Permalink Quite simply, this is the height of an excellent blending of literature and film making. Most adaptations are either so faithful to the written material that you wonder why you bothered to go to the film or you watch the movie and wonder to where the original story disappeared. Every aspect of this movie is a joy to experience. The language, the beauty of the locations, the solidity of the cast and the soaring grandeur of the music combines to make a film that is largely faithful to the text and, yet, transcends the written word to bring the heart and the soul of the trilogy to life. I am amazed at how I fall into each of the films every time I watch them. It is tribute to Peter Jackson that these movies can pull us into the story and the lives of the characters no matter if you have seen the film once, twice or twenty times. I remember thinking when the first film opened, "Please don't let this be crap." Not only was it not butchered, it can hopefully become the standard from which other fantasy literature can be adapted for film. I hope that the Trilogy will be re-released periodically in the theaters because the big screen is truly the best format for watching these movies. Thank you Peter Jackson and everyone associated with the three films, for creating a moving and memorable movie experience. I am truly grateful that this happened in my lifetime.
9.0~This is a masterpiece of filmmaking and Jackson truly deserves an Oscar. pacharacfc Sign in Permalink In Return of the King, the battle for the very survival of Middle Earth and all its fantastical creations will be fought, and unless you are a congenital buzz-kill, you will feel the urgency, terror, and sweeping import of it all.
7.0~could they drag out that ending any longer????? hot-chocolate Sign in Permalink That ending was the worst! It dragged on forever and reminded me of one of those chick flicks looking for you to wipe a tear from the corner of your eye... c'mon! The fight scenes are too long and take away from the story and they interject the oddest scenes fraught with melodrama but no real good acting!! *case in point... that scene with Gandalf and Pippin are having this heartfelt moment, with impending doom on the other side of the door -- its so full of over acting and forced emotions* I am stuck going ???? what was that all about? In general I would have to say these movies are riding on the notoriety of the books and just the grand manner in which they were produced... because the acting surely wasn't going to win them any awards!
10.0~Stunning & Inspiring series, & What a Way to End! rauffenstein Sign in Permalink I used to hate fantasy & sci-fi, especially Lord of the Rings. Of course, at that time I'd only seen the first film and barely payed attention to it, passing it off as rubbish. However, I'm a huge film buff. So, my friends and I decided to start having Movie Nights every week. One of them brought 'The Two Towers' over & I figured, I'd give a shot to actually sit down and watch one of these films seriously. Well, after it was over, I was amazed. I couldn't believe that I had shrugged off such a fine piece of cinema for as long as I did! Then, I got to see Return of the King, excited to see another good movie come out. My jaw dropped when I first saw it. Never before had I seen such fine use of computer technology & live action together in a film. It was so believable, so REAL. The scene with the Paths of the Dead absolutely blew my mind. It's probably one of the most visually stunning scenes of the 21st Century. The costuming, the sets, the entire WORLD created in this film out of pure love & passion for a man's novel is just inspiring. Now, I've read the books and have to say that yes there are differences. However, the films capture the spirits of the characters and hearts of the stories immaculately. I do believe it would bring a tear to Mr. Tolkien's eye if he were alive to see it. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is now one of my favorite performances of all time. Another stellar performance is by Bernard Hill as King Theoden. Most people in the film give their all & it shines; there is nothing lackluster here! My biggest props to the set/costume & technical designers. These people have officially raised the bar for the future of film-making. Just a note to the doubters of the film: you will not be disappointed, but truly blown away. The Return of the King is the greatest of the the three, using cinematography & computer technology together like never before. However, this is done so seamlessly that you might miss it the first time around. A film worth watching a thousand times, I still get goosebumps during most scenes, & of course I recommend the Extended Edition just for the extended Paths of the Dead scene-- it's fantastic! 10 out of 10.
10.0~I'm still out of breath... Baerbel_W Sign in Permalink Wow, what a ride! I guess it will take some time to really absorb and digest everything seen on screen. There is just so much going on that it will also take another one, two or even three visits to the cinema to watch the film again and again and again. Sean Astin for sure deserves an Oscar for his role as Sam, dragging and carrying Frodo through Mordor and up Mount Doom: if that isn't worthy for best actor in a SUPPORTING role, I don't know what is. Everything fits together very well: the actors, the battles, the locations, the music, the special effects (you know that they exist, but they just blend in). I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Peter Jackson and his team finally get the Oscars they deserve!
9.0~yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet danielfawcettdf Sign in Permalink Urnmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

6.0~So long ch-de-hon Sign in Permalink More than 9 hours (for the 3 films) to watch the final kiss. Special effects seems of an other age.(King Kong - old version) I agree, it's not easy to recreate the world of Tolkien. But here is a bit annoying. Too long to watch.
10.0~The best movie I've ever saw! electronicparty Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a absolutely perfect movie. Fellowship of the Ring was great, The Two Towers was even better, but the Return of the King was outright awesome. I'm not a fan of this genre, I never read the books, so I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a jaw dropping, heart pumping, eye tearing emotional ride. This wasn't a movie I merely watched, but became a part of. The actors played their characters perfectly. The quality of the makeup, wardrobes, special effects, sound, sets, battle scenes, beasts, and everything else was superb. There were no loose ends and I was satisfied. I didn't feel there was anything left to tie up. It's ending was great. I normally have a complaint or two about movies but I didn't have any about this movie. It was wonderful great in all aspects. It's a movie for everyone with a heart. This is how movies should be done. We probably won't get another movie of this scale for a long time. If your not a fan, you probably will become one after seeing it.
10.0~Is it just me sgcamil Sign in Permalink ** Potential Spoiler ** Didn't anyone else notice one major diversion from the book?! Why did the Army of the dead have to enter Minas Tirith. This goes against the grain of the book and detracts from the importance of such characters as Eomer and the men of Gondor. These latter are shown as wimps (especially with the total exclusion of Imrahir), and solely dependant on an army of dead guys. These were just meant to illustrate the irony where forces of evil are often defeated by forces they may deem to be allied by their very nature. In the movie, we have the battle going in full swing. Within a minute, in swoop the ghosts and out go the orcs!! Whooshhh.... so flat. Sorry Pete, but I had to bring this up! This was the only real flaw in the whole trilogy; all the other 'glitches' are just that. If only you had given us Tolkien's rendition here.
7.0~Fun Movie with Flaws naylor-3 Sign in Permalink This was a fun movie with a lot of cool stuff though I feel it was not as strong as the first two LOTR Films. This film used slow motion to death as it seemed every other scene had a drawn out slow mo sequence. I found the lighting quite bad in many shots which is too bad. While much of the CG was great, I also found that a lot of the CG wasn't very realistic looking which takes away from my personal enjoyment of a film. Legolas on the Elephant was a cool scene, but really, didn't look at all realistic. The use of total CG in one shot, no CG in the next, and then a bit of both prohibits this film from having a standard and consistant look to it. At times it looks like a national geographic film and then it will resemble a comic book. I am a fan of the more realistic looking shots than the alternative. People who disagree with me will probably understand in about six years when CG is much better and harder to detect. The best thing about this movie was that it was completely different from the first two, offering new settings, creatures, costumes, and general atmosphere. Although the trilogy works as one large story, I feel these films also stand well each on there own as seperate films similar to the way the original Star Wars films did. I feel the film could have ended with the boat leaving the harbore and that that whole scene looked very fake and could have been done much nicer. Over all, could have been a little better, but you definately are entertained and get more than your money's worth when you go to see this film. 7/10
10.0~This tops every movie I have ever saw! flyers3410 Sign in Permalink From the time Lord of the Rings was flashed on the screen I was amazed by the entire movie all the way to the end of the Credits. I have seen some movie battles in my day but the battle at Minas Tirith was the greatest. If you are a hardcore Lord of the Rings fan or if you never heard of this movie I would recommend this to everyone. It was that good.
10.0~No Question: Superb Enrique-Sanchez-56 Sign in Permalink Undeniably, one of the greatest film achievements ever - perhaps the greatest. Who would have thought that the film-going public would subject itself to three movies that all last more than 3 hours each? I can't forget watching the full 5-1/4 hours of "1900" back in 1977 - luckily with a 15 minute intermission! It was completely absorbing. Trust me. If 'Return of the King' had been 5 hours, I would have watched the whole thing. I remember walking away at the end of "Kings" last week and wanting more! I must be nuts?! But, I'm not. And I'm not alone. How does this film/film series get away with this? Quite simply, there are legions of reading fans and viewing fans which find this movie absorbing. It takes a special brand of filmmaking to pull this off. Like "Gone With The Wind", "Spartacus", "Dr. Zhivago", "Lawrence of Arabia"...and several others that test our limits quite nicely. And - Peter Jackson has pulled it off. AND - I am still amazed at the whole. Such mastery, focus and continuity...are rare. Even in more modest length movies. I'm not going to repeat all of these spoiler reviews I've seen here. I find this rather cruel...don't you think? I'm even going to make paragraphs out of what I write and not these annoyingly long ONE paragraph treatises - that seem to go on and on. :) I shall simply say that if you like movies, adventure, love, mystery, wonder, honorable values and characters with which you can really love and feel a kinship, this is it. This is THE movie. Instead of just reading these reviews, just go and see this movie. It will stay with you forever. One a side note: Let's campaign for Sean Astin to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He almost stole the whole movie with his heart-tugging admiration and loyalty to Frodo. Sorry, rest of cast, I loved you all - but this is a stand-out performance to remember. Thank you, Peter Jackson.
7.0~Too long fredfredish Sign in Permalink The end was too too long! It breaks the rest of the movie. For the rest, that was pretty cool! I was glad to see it 'cause I've seen the two others (as everybody in the world!!!) That's a great movie anyway but I prefer the second chapter. That's my point! But I really appreciate the work of the entire crew of P: Jackson: Hope this time, I'll get a Academy Award!
9.0~Another triumph for Jackson grahamsj3 Sign in Permalink I finally saw this film and it's spectacular, but perhaps just a tiny bit less so than "The Two Towers", which is my favorite of the trilogy. This film is still fantastic. Much has been made of the leaving out of Christopher Lee, but the truth is, his part was unnecessary to the Return of the King. I would have liked to have seen him again but I'm sure he'll be in the DVD version (yes, he is). I also missed seeing the scouring of the Shire. However, overall this is a great film and one that I believe should certainly garner Best Picture honors! The cast and crew, special effects, costume, makeup, Howard Shore's score, and everything else that makes up this film are all first-rate. I believe these folks have done some career-best work in many cases. Jackson will certainly be hard-pressed to top this trilogy. I hope that many of these actors don't end up typecast. It would be a pity to see some of these folks not be able to find good roles because of their superb work in these films.
10.0~There Never Was a Better End lucas-42 Sign in Permalink To put it simply... "wow." I could write another long review of the movie like everyone else and be lost in the sheer number of postivie things I'm sure everyone has to say. But I'll cut it short. It's a tear jerker, it's a visual wonder... it's heartwarming and really cares about every character it has. You'll see. I was particularly impressed by the last few visuals inside Mt. Doom, breathtakingly beautiful. The acting was flawless and Sam shows just how brave he can be. I loved this movie. ... one of the best stories of all time and now one of the best film trilogys as well. Hats off to Mr. Peter Jackson.
9.0~A Thing of Beauty is a Joy For All GenesisMechius Sign in Permalink So we come to it at last, the end of the great trilogy of our age. Our parents had Star Wars. They had The Godfather. They had Indiana Jones. We have The Lord of the Rings. And what a wonderful trilogy to have. Many people will not like The Lord of the Rings and they will have their reasons however irritating or ignorant they may seem to fans but nothing is without reason so don't pester them. Now I suppose I should talk about the movie. Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. What a Movie. WOW. I don't fancy myself a film critic so I am going to do this like a fan, like it should be. This movie is action yes, but its beyond that. Its at least five diffrent stories which meet at the end. Five stories which are no greater then any other. Without each piece there would be no success and so no one is more important in the end. I don't seek out meaning in a movie I intend to enjoy. I watch it, enjoy it and then go back to find out what I missed the first time. and I tell you after three and one half hour I have no doubts I have missed ALOT. There is just too much to absorb in one sitting. You have to go back and revisit Middle Earth again. Maybe Again? It won't really matter, I love it vastely too much to say "Meh..saw it, it was good but I will wait for it to come out on video." Its just too much. Too much to ever put into a review and have it mean anything. Atleast for me. I have it 9 stars. There is always room for improvement but so far as I am concerned it has well earned a 9 star rating. So go and enjoy the end of the journey. Its nothing short of Satisfying. You can leave the theatre, take a breath and accept it. The journey is over and by god what a journey it was. So Thank You Peter Jackson. If you win awards for this movie or not your still a hell of a director with a hell of a cast and ONE HELL of a team which made this Middle Earth a reality.
1.0~science friction jonsered2 Sign in Permalink how can people vote for this one I dont understand, it has no political, sociological or human qualities whatsoever, it may be entertaining but its scope is more like a football game or time spent playing a video game, entertainment pure and simple.If this ever wins an Oscar it will only serve to cheapen the value of those awards, how can people pick this over Schindlers list or Sunset Blvd is beyond me.It may be good entertainment value but it will never be a classic in the classic sense.
10.0~Must watch! mjrsurprenant Sign in Permalink Let me tell to whoever is viewing this review. This is a MUST see movie series. But, The Return of the King stood out the most to me. Perfect beginning, perfect halfway through, and perfect ending which I will not say. This movie has been out since 2003 and if you haven't seen it by now, it's never to late. For Frodo!
10.0~Absolutely Amazing! stormchaser711 Sign in Permalink I cant even describe how good this movie is! But i guess i have to try. Voice acting: Superb. Peter Jackson really made this movie a good one in this category. Visual effects: The best part of the whole movie! The effects are amazing! The budget really helped make the effects great. Story: I have never read the book, but if this movie was this good in story, i will go straight for the book! The story is paced perfectly! Overall: I give this a 10/10. This is a film i recommend to everyone, but i can't imagine somebody not seeing this movie already! So go see this movie on DVD or extended edition! It doesn't really matter which one you want to get.
10.0~Thank you BENARES-2 Sign in Permalink I could try to convey the sheer magnitude of this film, but there isn't really much more that can be said that would do it justice. Just a thanks to all those involved in the creation of the greatest film trilogy ever told, a thanks to bringing to life a world that has since passed into the lands beyond the seas and into our dreams along with Frodo, Gandalf, and the elves. I don't know if this story's closure can ever truly be captured in film again, for it was carried so masterfully to the big screen that anyone else would be hard pressed to best it. Perfect story, perfect closure. Thank you, to all those who told this tale with such uncanny brilliance.
10.0~Incredible story telling! icu2r4me Sign in Permalink The wrap up of the Lord of the Rings trilogy with the Return of the King was amazing. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens kept very close to the stories as written my J.R.R. Tolkien or at least as close as they could, to do the 1,000 plus pages justice. Of course in some instances the order had to be altered so the movies would flow nicely and fit within a reasonable theater time frame. Personally, I can't wait for the extended version of the Return of the King to come out so I can have an all day Ring review. The story is a very good one and one I wish our society would pay more attention to. This movie deserved all of the nominations it has received from the academy and very much deserves to win the Oscar for best picture, best director, and best visual effects. Anything else will just be icing on the cake. A superb job was done by the entire cast and crew.
10.0~Loved it all up until the final scene gmchaney Sign in Permalink As a very old fan of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and having suffered through a couple of miserable screen adaptations, I can now say that Peter Jackson's three Lord of the Rings movies are my all-time favorite movie. I felt as though I were really there. New Zealand was the perfect choice for locations. All three films were excellent in every aspect of movie-making art. Warning, spoiler: I could understand all of the changes made by the movie makers to the book except for the very last scene, when Sam comes home after seeing Frodo off at the Grey Havens. In the book, Frodo had invited Sam and Rosie to live with him at Bag End and had bequeathed it to him when he left Middle Earth. However, the movie shows Sam returning to #3 Bagshot Row, his old home. There was no theatrical reason to change this. They wouldn't even have needed an extra scene explaining Sam's return to Rosie and baby Elanor at Bag End. After such a magnificent film adaptation of the book, this final detail was jarring and left me less than enthralled. But overall, the movies are truly outstanding and will be classics for as long as movies are being made.
10.0~sooooooooooo amazing!!!!!!! gpd1991 Sign in Permalink now this was the best movie of the year! it is absolutely amazing! the wars were directed so well that I enjoyed it so much but it was a little bit boring in the end but all of it was absolutely stunning! it must be the best film throuout the history! and this is so much better than The Godfather.. The Godfather is so rubbish compared to ROTK
10.0~the greatest film ever made cosapphire Sign in Permalink When I saw the first film I fell in love with LOTR and quickly read the books, which were amazing. I couldn't wait for the second and third instalments in the trilogy and they didn't disappoint! this story picks up where the two towers left off as we follow Frodo and Sam on the journey to mordor, accompanied by Andy Serkis' Gollum (who is superb). Also you see how Aragorn journeys to try and reclaim the throne of gondor and gandalf battling to save Minas Tirith. Though not everything in the book is included Peter Jackson has done the best he possibly could and quite frankly it is unbeatable, i would argue with anyone who said this film isn't Oscar worthy and not a great epic never to be forgotten. the special effects are amazing, the best to date, and the acting is good and emotional all round, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellan and Sean Astin give stirring performances. The battle sequences must be the best ever filmed as many a critic has said and i agree. They are mostly computer-generated but are still awesome, i loved the Mumakil (Oliphonts). Though this is your good old good vs. evil it isn't too predictable and even the multiple endings aren't out of place. As the tag line goes 'there is no victory without loss' and as you watch the film this will become apparent. The story is in depth and you have to watch to follow the plot. The film is lengthy but how else could you fit everything in? It was done superbly and could have been six hours long and i wouldn't have cared. This must be one of the best movies ever made and i am sure many people-would agree.
9.0~The Series is a 10 gro Sign in Permalink I'm grappling with the overall view of this final piece of the series. The initial 90 minutes were in general not up to what I expected. All the involvement of the prior movies was missing. I can recognize Jackson's desire to set up the final character developments but as a stand-a-lone piece, I believe he would lose an audience that wasn't already committed to the series. So how do you rate the movie by itself? I love the multiple conclusions because they address the issue of how someone who experiences something so outside the realm of anyone else can continue to "live" in the world of everyone else. Pippin and Merry didn't in the book. The moral turmoil resolutions for the main characters where they decide who they are and what they want to achieve are great. I agree with everyone who says Sam was the best character and should be up for an Oscar (not that Hollywood matters). I was less impressed with Gollum after the not so good piece in the beginning where he kills the character who actually finds the ring. Did Jackson think that furthered the development from the hints from prior movies? Battle scenes: amazing. Scenery: wonderful. CGI: good but problems with size again: look at the elephants and Legolas. Superb performances by the Rohans and Gondors. Still find Liv Tyler weak. I really wanted to love this movie and despite some expected tears during the various conclusions, felt I hadn't got what could have been based on both the prior movies and the books. So still the best epic that has ever been done but I suspect that someone someday will surpass this. Until then, here is the mark, beat it.
10.0~An astonishing achievement jmcleod_5 Sign in Permalink What can you say about the third movie in the trilogy. Bloody marvelous for one. Peter Jackson takes the credit for the trilogy but let's not forget the contributions of Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens. Jackson is good at the blood and guts and the spectacle but Walsh and Boyens are obviously the heart behind the quieter, yet no less emotional scenes. There's Richard Taylor's almost impossible monumental undertaking of every detail behind the scenes. There's Howard Shore, Andrew Lesnie, John Howe and Alan Lee, Grant Major and numerous others. Too many to name here. The flaws I saw with this film were it's final twenty or so minutes that seemed to drag on for too long. That's pretty minor though considering the tripe that usually ends up on movie screens. Although Return is the least of the three movies it still has some of the most emotional. Sam and Frodo's moments at Mount Doom are some of the best in recent cinema. Also when Aragorn tells the four Hobbits that they bow to no one. It still brings a tear to my eye. The trilogy is probably best viewed as one whole movie but will always be seen as three parts due to the fact that it took us two years to view them. The best reason in years to go to the movies.
10.0~Best of the three films, needs to win Oscars Laheara Sign in Permalink This movie was amazing, it was only a fraction of what we'll get in the Extended Edition, which I CAN'T wait for, but it was great. Seeing the White City up close finally was memorable, I loved it in the books. I think the scene with Merry and Pippin saying goodbye in Edoras was very touching and they story in this movie in general was so sad but great. I think it's just a given that everyone hates Denethor, I actually ordered his last surviving son into a battle that was basically a death sentence and then when he came back he tried to burn him alive! EVIL man! "You wish not that our places had been reversed, that I had died and Boromir had live." "Yes, I wish this." "Since Boromir has been ripped from you I will my best in his stead. If I should return, think better of me father." OMG I just wanted to jump through the screen and SMACK Denethor and hug Faramir and tell him not to go. Then you saw the people in the streets throwing down flowers as he was leaving, everyone loved Faramir but his father. I'm sorry they left out the Houses of Healing scenes because the ones with Eowyn and Faramir and then meeting and falling in love would have been good. This movie gives you a new appreciation for Faramir. Pippin singing was lovely. The passage through Mordor was well done with Aragorn diverting the Orcs to the Black Gate and away from Frodo and Sam. Eowyn taking down the WitchKing was GREAT!!!!! And Pippin saving Gandalf was too. The fight in the fields was wonderful, the troops, the siege towers, the trolls, the Haradrim and Easterlings with their LARGE transportation. I really loved the lighting of the Beacons of Gondor, the music in that scene was so good, and then Aragorn running through Edoras to tell Theodon Gondor needed help. Then Arwen becomes ill and Elrond does as she asked and reforged the sword of Kings to take to Aragorn. "Put aside the Ranger, become who you were born to be." GREAT line. "Sauron will not have forgotten this sword of Elendil." Aragorn at the Paths of the Dead was unusual but fun, him convincing the dead army to serve him and then they flood off the boats and save the city. The coming of the Eagles and taking out the Nazgul was GREAT. BaradDur crumbling and then exploding and Mount Doom blowing and the ground falling away under the Orcs but staying firm under Aragorn and his group. GREAT effects. And then Gandalf flying in and rescuing Sam and Frodo and taking them back to Minas Tirith. The reunion scene was touching, everyone was happy. Then the coronation was great, Aragorn and Arwen finally got to KISS and we heard Aragorn sing again! The people of Gondor bowed to the Hobbits. And the return to the shire was bittersweet, the four had been through so much it was hard to "pick up the threads of an old life" like Frodo said. But the real tears were during the goodbye scene where Frodo left with the final ship to Valinor. They changed it because Celeborn didn't leave with Galadriel and Elrond in the books but it was a nice happy ending for the movies. When the Hobbits were all crying because Frodo was leaving it was SOOOO sad. Then we got to meet Sam's children. "You can't always be torn in two, you have to be whole. You're part in this story will continue." Overall this was a GREAT movie and I'm glad it is making great money, I've already seen it 3 times and am going back again very soon. They really deserve to win some awards this year, both Golden Globes and Oscars. Go luck ROTK and can't wait for the Extended Edition. Forgive any bad quoting above, but I'm going by memory on how they went.
10.0~Great stuff lynnmcarthur Sign in Permalink It was a great movie. I would love to play a part in it! I am a huge fan of all of the Lord of the rings. I love how each one leaves you wanting more. You can't stop at just one. You must keep going... It's infectious It's got plenty of mystery,love,friendship,battles,magic It's really just a great set. Good verses evil as most movies have but SO much more,I am a die hard fan of Lord of the rings ALL of them and that is including the new Hobbit is awesome!!!!!!!! I can not wait to see the next one! I will be at the theater as soon as it comes out!!!!!!!! Everything i imagined as a small girl comes to life in these movies. It's such a beautiful fantasy,adventure movie for every child and adult who has an imagination.
10.0~Peter Jackson is the best adaptation of a book to film the movie history , The Lord of The Rings is epic. miguelneto-74936 Sign in Permalink Epic is what The Lord of the Rings: The Return of King can be summarized after the excellent The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Peter Jackson excels, and can make a movie even better, the Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King closes with golden key out, what I consider the best trilogy in film history, the film is even longer, the scenes are so spectacular that you do not looks not going, you twist pro film does not end, that is eternal so good, the battle scenes are spectacular, the speech of Theoden is one of the best i saw ever seen in my life, you shivers, especially with this track sound impeccable, the final scene is good, the opening scene is great, you do not know the time of the great battle begins, the visual effects are excellent, Nazgul scenes from the is very good, the costumes are amazing, the soundtrack is spectacular, 11 Oscars were more than deserved, the Lord of the Rings: the Return of King is awesome, epic, spectacular, Incredible, etc., we have an epic clash, more than satisfactory. note 10 Théoden: Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin....and the world's ending!
9.0~The extremes of the series on full display theanimatoradam Sign in Permalink My theory with the Lord Of The Rings films has always been that the stuff that is good gets better with each film, but the stuff that doesn't work as well unfortunately gets worse. So by movie 3 we have some of the very best that this series has to offer, but unfortunately we're also treated to some of its most cringe-worthy moments. Definitely a glorious and triumphant conclusion to the trilogy, but not my favourite film from the franchise as a whole.
10.0~The Best Movie Of My lifetime icollect Sign in Permalink I don't want to spoil this adventure of a lifetime for anyone, so I'll keep it short and sweet. This is the most amazing human creation I've ever witnessed next to the actual writing of Trilogy by Mr. Tolkien. Just as the books did, this movie will tap into your soul and all your emotions will be the on the ride of their life. Thank you to the cast and crew of this movie for remaining so true to the spirit of the books, and bringing each character to life. Just as the books did so many years ago, I walked away a lot more human, than when I entered into Middle Earth.
10.0~Absolutely Everything This Earth Could Hope For paulie08 Sign in Permalink if you've seen the trailers, this is spoiler free- First thing's first, this movie was brilliantly directed, castled, and acted. Not to mention the Fx which also were amazing. Now, to the review... I was beginning to doubt that this third part of an epic trilogy would live up to be as good as the first two. In fact, I looked into history and found that it was quite likely that this movie would be nice, but disappointing. The only hope I had was found in the fact that they were all filmed at the same time.. so they all may be similar and thus all similarly good. Let me say that despite the history of third parts not living up to expectations with the Aliens, Star Wars, Godfather, Matrix, and other trilogies.. this third part of the Lord of the Rings may be the best one in the series or at the very least it was worthy of the past two. The movie was brilliantly shot as in the past two movies and the landscape is beautiful. The action scenes were well done and the special effects were great... gollum and the spider were not disappointing at all. The only complaint I'd have was that the ending was a tad drawn-out and could've been shorter but nonetheless, it was a satisfying conclusion. Also, I read the trilogy before I saw this part of the series and I'd say it stays true enough to the book that I was satisfied. There were parts where I though to myself: umm... that didn't happen like that or umm... where's that scene? Yet, overall I was very pleased with the accuracy. All of the essential scenes were kept in. So, if you liked the first two, I'd say it's a guarantee you'll like the final part of this epic saga. Now, in fairness, I wouldn't call it the best movie ever because it hasn't stood the test of time but at this point, it does deserve the buzz of such a ranking. 9.8/10 -pch
9.0~Not to be missed! (Possible Spoilers) randall2 Sign in Permalink This film recaptured much of the feeling that 'Fellowship' created, and that I felt was missing from 'Two Towers'. The spirit of the story, the emotional engagement with the characters, the feeling of being part of the struggle in Middle Earth were back; and the areas in which the film differed from the book did not detract from it. There was a lot of action (enough to keep my action/adventure junky husband interested) but it did not overwhelm the plot, and the encounter with Shelob was really fantastic! I was sorry that they had to cut so much of the ending ... what happened to Saruman, the struggle in the shire and the aftermath ... but I understand that they'd have had to make 4 movies to include it all. I'm really looking forward to getting some of that back in the extended version DVD. Overall an excellent movie and well worth 3 1/2 hours in uncomfortable seats!
10.0~A perfect fantasy to watch singh-sanjay Sign in Permalink first of all a great thanks Peter Jackson to make people to re-live Tolkien's EPIC-Lord of the Rings trilogy. All the 3 three movies comes with a great cinematic experience, an experience that rule the hearts of millions forever, an experience that take you back to the middle earth. The direction of the the movie is perfect and the acting is treat to watch specially Sean Astin(sam) and Viggo Mortensen(aragon). All technical aspects of the movie are good. The war scenes are so perfectly created that people will love to watch. Although the movie is not as good as book but it is the best that can be created out of book and also you can't expect everything in 200 mins movie.
10.0~A second look after 5 years. michaelgs Sign in Permalink In this space five years ago, I wrote a mostly negative review about how I thought the movie was slow-paced, especially towards the end. I watched the film again the other day, and I wanted to offer my thoughts on it. What can I say? I am a Peter Jackson fan again. Yes, there are sometimes when you get impatient with this film. But the extended cut is four hours of pure exhilaration. I also found that it helps to give yourself an intermission with this film (after Pellenor Fields was when I took mine). Sucking on garbage for many years made me long for true art and entertainment. Return of the King is a crowning achievement to a classic movie franchise. This movie may be in a sense too good. I forgot that about Peter Jackson, he is one of those directors who makes movies that blow you out of your seat. Instead of the special effects overwhelming the plot in this movie, everything overwhelms the viewer. It's overdone. It's meant to be overdone. The result is amazing. In retrospect, Lord of the Rings never caught on as a pop-culture phenomenon the way Star Wars did. It exists instead as a modern throwback to such epic spectacles as Ben-Hur or Laurence of Arabia. Rarefied air indeed, but may have been the dying gasp of epic film making. People just don't go to see 3 hour movies anymore, and gone are the days when special effects will drive people to see movies. All crap and the occasionally good art-house or foreign flick. Ah, well.
10.0~One of the greatest movies ever made! johnsmith_007 Sign in Permalink I've been a fantasy and Tolkien fan for many years. Lord of the Rings Return of the King may be the best piece of cinematic art i've ever witnessed. LordoftheRings.net has a great deal of info about the movie. I have also been an avid rpg'er and play quite a lot of Lord of the Rings Risk at home and online, there's tons of similarities to the movies in the game. A lot of times, the battles that are fought in the game, happen very closely to how they happened in the movie. Great site for it at LordoftheRingsRisk.com . Overall, this movie was incredible!!! Thank you's and congrat's go out to all those that were involved in the making of all of them....and of course the other ones weren't bad either.
8.0~One Movie to rule them all. kschroeder24 Sign in Permalink I had been anticipating the premiere of this movie for almost a year and after seeing it, I never expected it to live up to all of the hype. I was sadly mistaken. The Return of the King is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and definitely the best of the trilogy. The special effects were incredible, the acting was brilliant, and it was by far Peter Jackson's best work. See this movie as soon as possible!!!
1.0~what is everybody thinking? marrlin Sign in Permalink I have seen many movies in my time, a lot of bad movies, and a lot of good movies. I like movies from all genres. This is easily one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. I cannot comprehend why this movie is considered good. An overacted, badly directed, self-important, repetitive, uninspired, shallow, video game of a movie. Not a single character of depth (ok, smigle slighty). What was the point? No imagination in the directing, acting, set and art design. Slow motion. Oy, am I sick of slow motion. Now that was creative. Editing? What's with the ending? That was a 30 minute goodbye. Get on the boat already! Die already. Die, die, die, die, die. How long does it take to die. Gandalf, all powerful wizard. Nine hours of movie and all he can do is shine a light in the dragons eyes. Ooooh, scary light. Not recommended for anyone. And those who liked it are wrong..Wrong!
10.0~If you have not watched this I question your humanity........ sean-muir007 Sign in Permalink Greatest fantasy movie of all time. I have watched it at least 63 times and can't get enough! best movie Of all time 10 out of 10. The movie is a masterpiece made by a master of film. The only bad thing about this film is that it does not go for long enough..... 3 hours is to short for a movie. My favorite character was Aragon because he is the definition of badass. Legolas was also badass but gimli was lacking in badassness but that is was defined the characters. Peter Jacksons sneaky cameo appearances in these movies were also another highlight of the best trilogy of all time. Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of 10. If you have not watched this movie then I spit in your general direction! I like turtles. #HALAMADRID
9.0~Pure Magic Ashlevine Sign in Permalink Sheer brilliance, pure magic...etc. are some of the adjectives I would elect to use to describe this film. Jackson was able to reignite the first moment I saw the first film in my life and immediately fell in love with cinema. Here again, Peter has brought that special feeling that you crave every time you go see a film hoping it will induce you with such magic. The casting of this film could not have been more perfect. Woods will surely be an Oscar winner not to far in the distant future. Sir Ian is always a pleasure to watch. The productions design, the cinematography, the music have all unified and served the film very well. My hat off to you all!
5.0~Good movie but it brings nothing new and the end takes toooo long... raduking Sign in Permalink The third movie brings nothing more than the second... It has more goofs than the second i won't enumerate them here. The end is so boring that when I went to the cinema to see it, all people stood up about 3 times in the last 20 minutes to go home... It also misses one important chapter when Saruman destroys the Shire... Some characters have no meaning in the movie (Faramir, Witch King)... Witch King has very big orientation problems trying to hit Eowyn with that big weapon rather than use some witchcraft to kill her... Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) doesn't have the voice of a King when he tries to encourage the army to fight (see Braveheart (Mel Gibson) or Gladiator (Russel Crowe))... It would have probably been a great movie without the first 2 parts, but this one brings nothing new or extraordinary except the Undead army which kills all orcs BAAH ! If you are interested in special effects then go watch the movie, if you are interested in how the story ends better read the book. 6 points out of 10.
8.0~The multiple endings don't dampen its effect; it's the best in the trilogy by far. Pjtaylor-96-138044 Sign in Permalink 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King (2003)' is the best of the three mainly because it is, for the most part, so pacy and persistently forward-moving. It's constantly engaging and does a good job of wrapping up its story in a suitably epic and entertaining way. It does suffer from multiple endings, though. These could each have done the job (except for the one that's particularly silly) but none of them wrap up the picture especially well in conjunction with one another. There's also an occasional feeling that there's less plot this time around, with more emphasis placed upon phenomenally epic battles - some of the largest in scale I've ever seen. However, this one is more of an ensemble piece than the others and it intercuts between its main stories just often enough that you always care about each of its never-more-interesting dangling threads. Although the emphasis of this picture does seem slightly less on our protagonist's journey to rid Middle Earth of the one ring than you'd perhaps expect, it strikes a balance between all of its characters - especially those who were sidelined before - and makes sure that they all have something important to do and that you care about them while they are doing it. Because of this, it's the most character-focused in the trilogy, even if some of the 'main' players are given slightly less to do. Thankfully, it also means that Sam, who is clearly the most heroic of the hobbits, finally has his day as a hero (even if most other characters don't acknowledge it) and it is incredibly satisfying. 8/10
10.0~Great Job! frodo56us Sign in Permalink I was pretty impressed by the job that PJ and company did with this film. As a long-time fan of Tolkien, I did miss some of the parts that were left out of the story as well as the changes that were made to the overall storyline in order move it from print to the big screen. However, I completely understand the constraints that the director was under and think that he did a marvelous job within them. In fact, I was moved to tears several times during the film and was powerfully stirred at others. I feel that if a director can accomplish that, he has been successful. All I can say is: Great Job, Peter! I hope that Christopher Tolkien relents and allows the filming of "The Hobbit".
8.0~I'm speechless........ NoOneElse101 Sign in Permalink I just saw the Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and I am speechless. Not only is it the best in the series, but it is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life. It will make you laugh, feel full of pride, and reduce you to tears. Amazing story, acting, music it just call came together. At 3 1/2 hours it will give you more than enough to be entertained, in fact the movie is so good it is overwhelming, if this does not win best picture, the Academy Awards are useless, because quite simply its the best motion picture of 2003. Just go see it and tell me ohtherwise. This whole series has been magical, and this will go down in history as the greatest third installment of the trilogy in movie history, because it is better than its two predecessors. I bow down to Peter Jackson, this man devoted years of his life to this project, and it paid up, the Academy Awards owes him that best director oscar and everyone knows it.
10.0~An Epic that comes once a generation irishnyc Sign in Permalink 1977, a Long time ago in a galaxy far far away... there was a genra busting masterpiece Star Wars, then a darker and far superior Empire, then marketing of lunch boxes led to ewoks in Jedi and the Series fell off... I worry from time to time that there is no creativity out there wich is how we end up with the 6th star wars when the series ran out of gas after the second, I like most people read the LOTR in HS and always worried that they would attempt to make it and it would be cheesey (imagine clash of the titans level effects and lack of cinematography for the LOTR series) Peter Jackson has brought vision to bring the books to life to make it real, but I also feel he has also define a new standard on the use of CGI, there in the last few years has been a backlash against CGI the hul looked fake, and star wars attack of the clones while fun looked like a cartoon, it really impairs with the suspension of disbelieve and the gravity of it all... Peter Jackson has found the balance to create the incredible without it being unrealistic or fake.... Amazing triliogy, most trilogies do not maintain throught out, (the matrix movies decline rapidly after a brilliant original and a decent second to a horrid conclusion) and I already mentioned the evil ewoks... Mike
9.0~Great, just Great, but a new editor please! Frogfisher Sign in Permalink It's an epic tale, made into one of the best adventure movies ever, but definatly not the best. Although I knew much of the story was shortened and many characters was lost, I decided to try watching it with as new eyes as possible. This task showed impossible. When you've read the books you know what there is to come and which scenes have been changed and deleted. Besides that fact the movie turned out pretty well, I think. It got some of the feels to as FOTR and the stunning battles of TTT. But it doesn't out rank FOTR, but is slight better than TTT. Here follows Spoilers: The movie starts out pretty well, a scene that explains the story of Smeagol turning into Gollum. A scene that I felt could have been cut for some of greater importance. It's is of course in to show Smeagols first kill and that he is able to kill. It's in for those who have not read the books. Like TTT the film quickly gets into the right pace. It's fast and is, although many scenes missing, almost as good as I feel TTT is untill The Warge Attack. But ROTK is this good all the way trough. Great effects, pretty convincing settings, great acting, incredible music and a touch of love for the story is shown allthrough the movie. BUT, the film is to fast and jumps very much in stories, much more than TTT, and there's too many flashbacks. The flashbacks are the worst of those things. There are no flashbacks like these in the two former, both here we suddenly have ten. The pace is fast and makes the movie too hectic. But it also makes it exciting and, due to the length, easier to watch. Many scenes have been cut and many things have been changed to make this work. I, as a Ringerfan, misses so many things, but I expect them to be in the EE. Still as a fan, PJ should have cut the films diffently, so ROTK why be slower and many scenes could have been in it. Most of the things cut, is after Cirith Ungol for Frodo and Sam, and after The Battle of Pelennor, for Aragorn and co. But all in all, with Minas Tirith, Dunharrow, Pelennor, Minas Morgul, Cirtih Ungol, the army of death, Shelob, The Witchking, Ghan-bur-ghan and luckily the fact Aragorn shouldn't fight Sauron or The Mouth, made me very pleased, compared to what I feared. A 9 I'll give it, just to be on the safe side, should I see it again and love it. Besides EE should be able to draw it up to 9.
10.0~The King of the Trilogy Hannie3 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson did a very good job with the first two movies, although some of the liberties he took were hard to accept. However, with Return of the King, Jackson took the characters and storylines and made them shine! If this movie does not win Oscars, it does not say anything about the film's quality, but rather the quality of the Oscars. An exceptional end to an amazing trilogy!
10.0~Hail to the King! dog-seller Sign in Permalink I think myself as a strict movievewer, in fact, I gave Fellowship 7.0 and Two Towers 8.0, yet, not this... I had no choice but to give 10.0 to the Return of the King. It's flawless compared with previous Rings. if not perfect. First, I saw the film with my eye, then I saw it with my heart, finally, I saw it with my spirit. Wow...... unforgettable experinece to me. Thank you............... No more word is needed to praise this movie. Four thumbs up!!! MMMMMMust see movie, even for those who does not like fantasy.
6.0~Overall disappointing conclusion. i_killed_that_guy Sign in Permalink I loved FOTR, for me it was one of the greatest action fantasy films ever made. It had fantastic characters, beautiful locations, amazing special effects and a brilliant story. Two Towers was a slight disappointment, no longer did we see the beautiful locations of Fellowship, no Elf kingdoms or Dwarf cities, instead we got a small town on a hill. And while Bernard Hills King Theodon was fantastic, it was nothing like anything in FOTR. TT lacked Fellowships beauty, the digital grading seemed to be lacking, resulting in a more raw picture that didnt fit with the first. Also the special effects (in particular the Warg Sequence) seemed slightly rushed, and the music proved be to somewhat intrusive. All these points came to light even more in ROTK, the special effects were very rushed, the music was especially intrusive, the emotion was lacking (i didnt cry once, even though everyone said i would). The ending of the battle scenes suffered from extreme deus ex machina (and utilising the exact same occurance that ended Helms Deep). The fantasy locations were gone again, and a geographical problem (is Minis Tirith and Osgiliath the only cities in the area? Why are there no towns shown, is seems unrealistic) stopped me from enjoying it. I have a feeling that Two Towers and ROTK would have been amazing films, if they had each taken 2 years between films rather than one.
9.0~Trilogy Complete gigan-92 Sign in Permalink The third is simply an undeniably great movie. The enormous length of it is pretty interesting thru out and it certainly qualifies as one of the most epic films ever unleashed onto the mainstream audiences. Its epic battles and dazzling shots will mesmerize and quite a bit happens. The composition of music by Howard Shore is beautiful as ever, but aside all this I want to comment on the theatrical cut. It had no business existing, seeing as there are so many gaping holes in the theatrical cut. The fate of Christopher Lee's Sarumon is pushed feebly to the side and the love story between Faramir (the great David Wenham) and Miranda Otto comes completely out of left field, much to my distaste. The biggest disappointment is with the Witch-King. There is a bad-ass scene where an underling asks the shadowy figure of Gandalf's fate, to which the Witch-King replies "I will break him". It was so awesome, and you get the foreshadowing an epic battle is to take place. And yet in the movie this is completely ignored, what the f*ck?! Basically the only true way to watch "Return of the king" is to purchase the uncut version. The theatrical cut is just an abomination that exist solely to please the mainstream audiences. This angers me when you think of all the awards the film won; all that praise for basically a sell-out version. If you're going to have all this build up in the previous films, please don't allow me to walk into the theater to have my expectations shat on. Especially concerning the duo of Frodo Baggins and his constant counterpart Samwise Gamgee. There's such a strong homosexual innuendo the relationship between them is laughable, and then out of nowhere at the end Peter Jackson thrust into Sam's wedding. When it's all said and done though the movie is one I recommend, but to don't say you've seen the film if all you saw was the theatrical cut. The theatrical cut is a damn lie.
10.0~Better than the first two marchesa Sign in Permalink Superlatives are poular in describing the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, both as literature and now as Peter Jackson's films. I've run out of them to describe The Return of the King movie. Incredible comes to mind. Jackson shows he is a master of pacing and drama and now spectacle. Certainly the most incredicble battle sequences I have seen on film. With some exception, Jackson is in my mind more true to the books in this film than the previous two. Deviations from the original are more acceptable here for some reason. The acting of the lead cast is increasingly improved, makign me wonder how Jackson managed to get this from his cast while filming all mixed up all at once... Truly, this film is a masterpiece on its own; as a crowning cap of a tremendous trilogy of films, it is simply astounding. There is excitment and energy yet so much more emotion and character involvement here. I can't wait to see what Jackson has cut out to see just how in depth the movie began its life...I can picture what is not here.
10.0~Perfect combo of Tolkien's storyline and movie magic! xenababe69 Sign in Permalink I was incredibly happy with the way Peter Jackson did the last installment of Lord of the Rings. He kept all the major plot occurences from the book and transformed them into a visual presentation of the book! The ending was so parallel to the boo kthat it had near the same affect of instilling emotion into me as the book did. Therefore I think that RoTK is one of the best movies this year and in the history of filmmaking.
10.0~WOW DrFrasierCrane Sign in Permalink Went to "Trilogy Tuesday"... ROTK was terrific. Peter Jackson stays true to the book this time around, only leaving out parts rather than changing plot lines (i.e. Faramir in Two Towers). After watching the first two movies in the hours before, I didn't expect to be as awed by the majesty and grandeur of the locations and effects as I was when I saw "Fellowship". Instead, I found myself holding my breath in amazement. The acting again is strong and provides strong drama to compliment the myriad of action sequences in the movie. You'll be cheering or laughing in one moment and then holding back tears in the next. A well done finale to one of the greatest movie series of all time.
10.0~There And Back Again Forever Itoc Sign in Permalink There is no shortage to say that Peter Jackson and his staff of creators and actors have left its mark in the history of visual story telling for as long as time shall go. History will continue to revile this gem of our time, and I feel lucky to be part of its birth and continuation to fill the hearts of love for films. Its visual achievements stand proud even ten years down the evolution of movie crafting, and Howard Shore delivers a score which will define brilliance in motion picture soundtracks. It is truly one of the rare films I watch dearly once a year, and still gives me chills, smiles and touch the deep heartstrings I so seldom touch in real life. It is a reminder of the beauty in life, and that darkness is but a passing no matter how great. It is indeed a movie which is pro-life; no matter what your struggles may be in life. This film is part of my childhood, now in my adult hood and hopefully something dear I can share with my children and their children. Until we all voyage into the west.
10.0~Loved It charliedalton100 Sign in Permalink This film is truly incredible, every time i see it i just want to watch it again. All of the actors do fantastic jobs especially Sam Astin and Elijah Woods (sorry if i spelt the names wrongly). The scenes which involve those two really are my favourite scenes in the movie because you can see true friendship and it makes me feel uplifted to see it. I also thought that Gollumn was done very well he was exactly how i imagined him to be and at times i really felt sorry for him him though i knew that he wasn't to be trusted. Well i don't really know what to say on these comments as it is my first one but if you haven't seen this film i highly recommend it to you because it is such a good film.
10.0~THE RETURN OF THE KING WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! matthew-barber1 Sign in Permalink Once you've seen this film you've seen the best. Great movies will come and go but none will compare to the true brilliance of this film. While no film will ever be perfect this final installment comes close enough. Once you have recovered from bouts of motion sickness and possibly dehydration due to the length of the film its likely you'll be dying to see the film again, and I advice seeing the film at least twice for it may be along time before the film gets another theatrical release (maybe the uncut version in cinemas within a few years). Upon multiple viewings you will truely begin to realize the magnificence of the film, something which you may not fully appreciate during first watching. This was the funiest, SCARIEST, dramatic, emotional and violent of the three, something which also leads me to question the films PG-13/12A rating, but I'm glad a younger audience can enjoy this masterpiece. I'm sure Peter Jackson's directing achievements won't go unnoticed at the awards either - he truly deserves to win this time! This film deserves 10/10 and should be at the top of the IMDB film chart, and once there i'm sure it will be for a very long time.
10.0~Extended Edition review. Throw away your theatrical edition DVD! MisterCellophane Sign in Permalink ** Spoilers throughout! ** It's a shame that a review of the Return of the King extended edition has to mention the shortcomings of the theatrical edition, but unlike the theatrical editions of the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers, The Return of the King felt naggingly incomplete. Story threads both major and minor are set up and either not followed through at all or come to an unsatisfactory shorthand conclusion. I'm thinking particularly of the Witch-king's threat to "break" Gandalf, which never happens, and of course, the conclusion of Saruman's story  as far as I am concerned "he has no power any more" just didn't cut it. Worse still, there are a number of places where the editing shows the 'joins' where you just know something is missing from a scene. So the EE has double the work to do: to fill in the blanks, and to provide the wealth of extra detail that the previous two Extended Editions have led us to expect. Don't let my negativity fool you into thinking that I didn't like the TE, but now Peter Jackson and his crew have delivered us the EE well, let's just say I'll put my copy of the TE on eBay in a few days. The Return of the King now feels complete. I think it's safe to say that most fans were holding their breath for the Voice of Saruman scene, and I'm thrilled to say it was well worth the wait. Truly a mighty actor, Christopher Lee demonstrates the true power of Saruman's (and his own) voice in an exciting, grisly and tragically ignominious end that makes me wonder more than ever why Jackson would cut such a powerful scene from the TE. Lee proves yet again how perfectly cast he was as Saruman simply by intoning the line "You are all going to die." Shivers down my spine! It seems that all characters get some benefit from the extra breathing room allowed by those extra 50 minutes. In the scenes that follow Saruman's death, Pippin's compulsion to look into the palantir is much better explained: it's not just a hobbit's curiosity - we see it preying on his mind. Small changes see Legolas's character finally allowed to breathe, and we can now really believe in the friendship between him and Gimli, who provides useful comic counterpoint to the intense action scenes to come, making sure the action stays rooted in character and doesn't stray too far into groundless spectacle (though there is an enjoyable amount of extra shots of mumakil smashing through the Rohirrim and, speaking as a Witch-king groupie, I don't think I'll ever get to see enough Nazgul shots). Eowyn has a few nice new moments, particularly her intimate scene with Aragorn in the Golden Hall (plus a beautiful tracking shot of that wonderful set) and it's good to see her fighting more on foot in the Pelennor Fields battle. Eomer gains a few more lines of dialogue  nothing significant, but the film is all the better for his presence. Frodo and Sam's exhausting trek across Mordor, and the march to the Black Gate are both now given a more appropriate timescale, and we get some sense of how arduous the journey across Gorgoroth was for poor Frodo and Sam. The scene with the two hobbits forced to march with the orcs is an unexpected bonus and a nice touch. Frodo's relationship with the ring is deepened too  now we see that he collapses due to the physical weight of the ring rather than simply through exhaustion alone. The economy of the TE is still admirable in places  the shorthand treatment of Denethor for example, in which we find out exactly what we need to know about his character to explain his actions. Even here, however, the EE can make tweaks for the better: his motivations are now given added gravity: what we formerly saw simply as madness is now revealed to be more like despair. Not every addition is for the benefit of the film, however - I could have done without Faramir and Eowyn gazing wetly at one another, for example. Overall the story is allowed to flex and breathe, but doesn't become flabby. There is a feeling of luxury, but Jackson still keeps the tension high while allowing the subtle richness of the production to shine. Throw away the TE Peter Jackson and co have finally given us the film we've been waiting for. And I haven't watched the appendices yet!
9.0~Perfect Adventure Jorgosch Sign in Permalink Watching this movie I was absolutely awed by it's impact, the way Star Wars made me feel when I was a teen. And I think this is already one of the movie's biggest achievements: To achieve a level of, well, if not reality, then involvement, to let oneself absolutely fall into it. Stunning special effects, well done writing (absolutely forgivable the deviations from the book for better dramatic effect, like absolute darkness in the spider's lair). In fact, everything is so gorgeous, grand and stunning, that it is even more noticeable when actors don't live up to everything that's going on around them. Even so, there was only one personality that I would have liked to see changed and that is Frodo. Elijah Wood's face for me didn't show enough pain, cruelty or any of the wide range of emotions necessary when not doing the baby smile. Viggo Mortensen certainly looks heroic, although he seemed to move too slow for a ranger in battle and talked too low during the 3 movies be recognized as one with great blood. I would have wished for a more energetic performance to show his finally accepting the role of king, like a more determined walk or whatever. Let me list some things that I saw as goofs, but then again, everything was happening so fast sometimes, I could be wrong :-) The White Wizard always fights with his staff - hm, he is a mage, isn't he? SOME display of battle magic would certainly have been nice... In one scene, a hobbit on a horse slashes the tendons of the hind legs of an oliphant - excuse me, but I just can't believe he would have the armlength... In one shot on Mount Doom, a slope against the sky, we actually see blue sky although everything was supposed to be dark in Mordor... And finally, the two hobbits crouching on a rock in the midst of running lava, well, the rising heat alone would be enough to burn them to cinders and let's not forget about the sulphur smoke :-) If not for these tiny imperfections, the movie could have been a 10, now it will have to make do with a 9 :-) And I feel empty, that now, after 3 years, there is nothing more to look forward to in Middle Earth...
10.0~Epic movie mrb-skywalker-4-60030 Sign in Permalink Probably the best movie in the series The hobbit and LOTR this movie is the best because of three crucial parts.First the Stunning CGI only a genius like Peter Jackson could create along with Weta Workshop.The CGI will make you feel like the orcs are standing right in front of you.Second up on the list is amazing writing.With dialog that makes it seem like real life instead of a movie,with most of the dialog coming from the books too.The finally thing that makes this movie great is the soundtrack.Often Put down as one of the best soundtracks ever,the sad violin theme for rohan, the iconic gondorian theme and even the Mordor theme are good.And you can't deny it you probably cried towards the end of the movie.Yes maybe the ending is a little over the top and gimli really isn't that cool and serves as comic relief but otherwise this movie is flawless.
10.0~Amazing starchild81 Sign in Permalink LOTR: Return of the king is an amazing movie. I saw the trilogy on December 16th, and was very impressed. It was all that I expected and more. Obviously a must see, but I think it was just that much better because I got to see all 3 one after the other. Hats off to Mr. Peter Jackson for a great interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkiens masterpiece.
10.0~The story is changing... Blackfyre27 Sign in Permalink Well, Peter Jackson has done it again - made a movie where I felt a little put out by the omissions and gratuitous additions, and had initial difficulties dealing with some of his choices as a director, especially one or two instances of cheesy effects. I felt it rather obvious where scenes had been shortened or cut out entirely, and I find the rumour that over an hour of footage was removed from the final cut entirely believable. I still hold true to the idea that, as there are six books, six movies would have been ideal and would have allowed enough screen time to avoid cutting out any of the material - HOWEVER - I remember feeling this way about the first two movies, and now that I have viewed them countless times I love them dearly. Furthermore, some things that I had thought erroneous previously are actually contained in the books, as I discovered afterwards upon close scrutiny. Judging by that, I have to stand behind Peter Jackson as having done an immense amount of research, almost to the point where he is more of an authority than I. I have great respect for this man, and I have no doubt that Return of the King will garner several Oscars - perhaps not exclusively for the film itself, but for the series as a whole, which has yet to be officially recognized by the Academy - surely they are waiting to award everything to the concluding film.
10.0~Emotionally Draining JefferyDCombs Sign in Permalink What a wild ride! Not only was it non stop action. It was also intense emotionally. If you already care about the characters, you will see them go through hades and back. It will take me a while to sort it out what I have seen. They did cut out some major parts from the book, but most of my favourite parts are there in cinematic glory. Hats off to Peter Jackson! Great ending (s)
10.0~UNBELIEVABLE alvarmarcha Sign in Permalink The astonishing moments of this film ends the incredible journey of Frodo baggins and the broken fellowship of the ring
10.0~Blows your brain away sgcamil Sign in Permalink Gargantuan piece of art. This last episode surely follows in the footsteps of its predecessors. Its got it omissions or rather its often abrupt shortcuts and it is this which leaves it short of being a masterpiece. One thing is for sure though. If the past is anything to go by, Masterpiece it will be when Mr Jackson gives us the extended cut. Tolkien deserves naught less!
1.0~WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK - BAD DIRECTED AND WAY WAY WAY TO LONG!! A_Nicolajsen Sign in Permalink BAD BAD BAD It is such a shame that this movie is so bad.. It really has the potential to be great but no no no. The first two movies were okay, but this last one really sucked! And yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie. I just can't understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting, bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 Oscars.??? The world has truly gone mad, and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users.. Its sad - just sad.. There are tons of movies that are better. And this really is the movie that would never end.. Very long ending.. 30 minutes of fading and ending, only to not really end.. bearf! I think people are mistaking the movie for the book.. Sad.....
8.0~Technically, the movie is a visual marvel, but there are some holes.... ellahillsmith Sign in Permalink I recently saw the "Return of the King" Christmas Eve (best time to go - no crowds, no waiting), and was visually enthralled, but still came up wanting. There are so many excellent sequences in the movie, such as the battle with Shelob, the lighting of the signal fires when Gondor (aka Gandalf) signals Rohan for assistance, the collapse of Sauron and Mordor, the many scenes with Gollum, and, of course, the battle at Minas Tirith. However, I did have a few problems with the storyline (or lack thereof) and those listed below are my biggest: >>>> SPOILERS <<<< 1. There was absolutely no sign of Saruman or Grima Wormtongue. None. Just a slight, and I do mean slight, mention in the first half hour of the film. Then nothing. Considering Saruman was such an important character in the first 2 films, and Grima Wormtongue in the 2nd, why almost completely ignore them? 2. Treebill and the Ents were also almost completely forgotten. Left to watch Saruman in the first half hour, the film never mentions them again. As in my comment above, why almost completely ignore them since, according the TT, they were such important allies to the cause? 3. We don't see that much of Legolas and Gimli, and never determine what happens to them at the end. From what I remember from the book, they form a deeply close friendship and decide to journey away together. Not much of this (except one brief exchange of words) is brought out. 4. My biggest complaint has to be how the relationship between the characters Faramir and Eowyn is so badly handled. In essence, there is none. After Denethor's demise, we see nothing of Faramir until the end at the coronation. No mention of his injuries, his reaction to his father's death, or his bloosoming romance with Eowyn. As for her, we watch as Aragon "brushes her off", she then sneaks into battle to slay the Witch King, then next is seen smiling up at Faramir at the coronation. My only reaction was "What?????" As I recall, a large portion of the ROTK was the budding romance between these 2 characters in the House of Healing, which, I might add, is not mentioned either. Considering how important and developed these 2 characters were in the TT, I was highly disappointed. >>>>Spoilers end <<<< I realize of course that the film is over 3 hours long, but also felt that some scenes, including the battle at Minas Tirith, were just a little too long. In fact, some had the feeling that they would never end. I realize that special effects and great battle sequences now carry a movie, but character development and storyline continuity should also matter. I did enjoy the movie; however, like the TT, I am hoping that these and other "oversights" are corrected in the DVD Extended Edition. We shall see. My rating: 8/10.
10.0~Why i go to the movies raydvd451 Sign in Permalink Where do i begin ? I am not an articulate writer so please bear with me, i have seen many, many movies in my time, different languages, genres and themes.There are good movies, bad movies and indifferent ones. But there are few master pieces, and even fewer modern ones, and Return of the King is a true master-piece of cinema. It would be a truly cold person that would not be touched by the characters in these 3 films and it doesn't matter that it is set in a fantasy environment as in all films if we cannot relate with the characters then there is no soul in the screen. Everone involved in ROTK is at the top of their game and the Academy where spot on to award all the 'gold guys' that were on offer to them. It does have it flaws maybe ( soem say the ending was a bit drawn out) but hey , why would you want to leave middle earth when you love being in this place. Thank You to Peter Jackson and co for filling my heart with wonder once more i look at the silver screen !
5.0~Incomprehensible Hang_All_Drunkdrivers Sign in Permalink If you're read the books or seen the first two movies in the series you should be OK but if you're new to The Lord of the Rings, you'll be lost in the first 10 minutes. There is no introduction explaining who is who and the movie just starts off with characters that they assume you know. Needless to say, the sets are magnificent and so too the action. Lots of battle scenes with huge elephant-like creatures and dragons. A lot to like in this movie if you're a fan. Incidentally the movie ends a half hour before it ends. After a big battle you think the show is over but no - it goes on for another 30 minutes even though nothing happens! Interesting that Sean Astin, who plays Sam and looks about 13, was 32 when this show was made. Also John Rhys Davies who played the fierce dwarf warrior was 59 and actually stands 6' 1".
10.0~It strayed a bit but was wonderful Justahobbit Sign in Permalink What a wonderful movie. There was a lot of straying from the book that I was disappointed in. But it was still an awesome film. I realize that it would be impossible for everything to be put into the film, I just feel that a bunch of loose ends were never tied up. But it still has become my favorite of the series.
10.0~The greatest adventure story since the bible. p-tinto Sign in Permalink For me, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the greatest story ever told. Peter Jackson has accomplished a phenomenal achievement by bringing Tolkien's fantasy world into real life characters, living in such beautiful vivid scenes. This last installment of the trilogy is the greatest piece of cinema I ever seen. 10 out of 10.
10.0~The Greatest MarkB-11 Sign in Permalink epic film, in any case. This is the equivalent of Doctor Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia. That is, this is true if we only consider LotR:RK by itself. Naturally, that is the usual practice, even in series like Star Wars. However, LotR has simply changed the rules. Now, if you need to make a huge film, don't want to scrimp all that much, and still want to have people not faint in the theatres, you break it up and produce it in bits. Clearly, PJ saved the best bit for last. RK is simply the finest most deeply-felt epic of all time. It beats Intolerance. It's more sweeping that Gone With the Wind (and I mean that in all seriousness: where GWTW narrowed as it continued, RK continues to open up, proceeding from a small, intimate and highly ominous opening to the incredible sight of tens of thousands of fighters trying to hold out (a la Zulu, another film PJ openly admits inspired him and which he tops, almost casually). I guess The Godfather remains the best, sort of. I have come to dislike that film as I have aged. It's message does not deepen, which one would have expected. I think that to really make the full comparison, I'll have to wait that many years on LotR too, just to be fair. Still, that makes LotR #2 all time. If you haven't seen it, please do. Then buy the Extended Edition. Can't fix the Scouring, but we can fix Faramir/Eowyn, yes?
3.0~What Crap! geraldclare Sign in Permalink Spoilers!! Gerald: Well, Marsha, you got me to The Lord of the Rings part 3, my thought throughout it was, "ridiculous nonsense interspersed with ugly nonsense" or "What Crap!". Okay, I grant you it was exciting in a Star Wars meets the middle ages kinda way. But I was bored a lot, how come the elves won't share their shampoo with the humans. Aragon doesn't wash his hair till the final coronation scene. Hope I'm not giving anything away for those of you who thought the hero might actually die in this formulaic Nordic sword opera. And speaking of Nordic, is this movie white or what? Marsha:I was bored. I kept thinking about what I was going to wear to work the next day. Now there's a bad sign. These people take themselves so seriously too. At least in Stars Wars there was humor. Nothing much funny happens in this movie. The battle scenes are very real, special effects incredible, scenery gorgeous but the story just doesn't work for me. I'm just not into this kind of fantasy. If you loved the books go see this. If you don't like fantasy or war movies, don't bother. Gerald: And characters, the only characters with more than one dimension are Frodo and the animated Gollum/Smigel. A friends ten year old loved it. I'd say that was the appropriate audience, though I know this puts me in a tiny minority.Me I wanna see the new Nicholson movie, or Stuck on You, I like my stupid movies to be funny, not ugly.The Lord of the Rings-#3 if you loved 1&2 you'll love #3. They're all #2 to me.
10.0~I love this film!!! agienkz Sign in Permalink I think this trilogy film is awesome aka. best film all the time!!! The film that you remember all the time in your memory. I always remember this characters film since 2001. This story was strong. Every characters act perfectly. Pray, faith, sought. I surprise for surprise by new creature. About magic, about fairy tales. Every time just flow with same goals. We know that we have to struggle for this life. For humanity. For we people who we love. For better world. I always ask for epilogue for this film or maybe the same genre.I'm waiting this same film. And after 10 years... The Hobbit answer that. thanks!!! :D And after the prologue we wait condition after return of the king.
10.0~Very interesting film Rituparna_Thakur Sign in Permalink I saw this film twice, it's a very interesting film....with some learning experience.
10.0~The most magical, powerful, emotional and inspiring of the Lord of the Rings epic films... NoArrow Sign in Permalink ...Two years ago I had not read The Lord of the Rings and only thought the movie looked interesting because of the monsters and that guy who was in X-Men (I was only twelve) but when I seen The Fellowship of the Ring I was amazed by the level of magnitude and emotion that that film achieved. I was immediately smitten with the epic film and started memorizing the actor names, buying the toys and reading the three books (plus The Hobbit). A year later I went to the theater opening night for The Two Towers with a ticket in my hand, ready to be amazed once again. That night, I was disappointed. I had just read the book and did not agree with the changes made. But two months later I seen it again and now that I knew of the faults all I could focus on was the greatness. The passionate performance by Bernard Hill (Theoden), the amazing effects and complexity of Gollum (Andy Serkis). By the end of that day I liked The Two Towers even more than The Fellowship of the Ring. Now, two years later I prepared for what I thought was going to be the biggest disappointment of movie history. As everyone knows, the third is always the worst of the trilogy. "Return of the Jedi" and "Matrix Revolutions" weren't necessarily bad movies, but compared to their predecessors they were unimpressive. "The Godfather: Part III" was hammy, and who could forget the pathetic westernized "Back to the Future III"? All disappointments. I thought "Return of the King" would follow their leads. I was so wrong. The plot of "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" focuses on Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam's (Sean Astin) continuing journey into the dark reaches of the evil land of Mordor do destroy the One Ring, the greatest weapon in the history of Middle Earth. As they trek into the land with the help of their conniving servant Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Theoden (Bernard Hill) plot to come to the aid of Gondor, a city besieged by countless attacks from Mordor. The three go their different ways, with Aragorn looking for aid in a ghostful army, Gandalf trying to convince Gondor steward Denethor (John Noble) to fight back and Theoden mustering his armies to come to the aid of Gondor in its most heated moment. It sounds very confusing, with the legions of characters, but with the way the story unfolds, someone who hadn't seen the first two could probably understand it. Plus there are the subplots with female warrior Eowyn (Miranda Otto), hobbit friends Merry (Dominic Monoghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Faramir's (David Wenham) relationship with his father Denethor. The Golden Globes are moronic. This movie has what's probably the greatest ensemble cast in film history. The acting goes beyond perfect. Every last actor becomes their characters. Most notably are McKellen's Gandalf and Noble's Denethor. McKellen - who actually gets to be in the whole movie this time - gives his best performance of the trilogy as the desperate wizard trying to help and solve the problems of all of the other characters. John Noble gives what could be the best performance of the trilogy as the steward-gone-mad, and he has what is one of the most memorable and complex scenes in a fantasy movie (I wont spoil it). He deserves a Supporting Actor Oscar for sure, along with McKellen and Astin (who gives his best performance of the trilogy). The leads, Elijah Wood and Viggo Mortensen, also do wonderful. Wood presents his inner struggle so well you'd be calling him Frodo if you met him in real life. Mortensen probably did better in The Two Towers, but his role in this is notable as well. Overall, this movie conquers the fantasy genre, the adventure genre and the action genre, I recommend to anyone who wants to be entertained, 9.5/10.
10.0~An outstanding ending to one of the greatest epic stories of our time filmbuff-36 Sign in Permalink Epic is just one way to describe the closing chapter in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Larger then life heroics, codes of honor among friends and grand scale battles have all shared screen time equally throughout the series, and the final vignette brings the story to an end marvelously. "The Return of the King" opens darkly, with the Ring fellowship still split up and facing seemingly insurmountable odds. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) are still being led through the wasteland of Mordor by the treacherous Gollum (voice of Andy Serkis). Gollum seeks to stop the two Hobbits from destroying the Ring in the fires of Mt. Doom, and tries to drive a wedge between the two before betraying Frodo to his doom. Meanwhile, reserved elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom), cocky dwarf brawler Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and future human king Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) have barely had time to recover from the Battle of Helms Deep before learning of another enemy offensive targeting the human city of Minas Tirith in Gondor. The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) seeks to bring a truce between the warring human factions in Gondor and Rohan to unite the armies for a massive counterattack, while the evil demon Sauron plots to overrun his enemies with his army of Orcs and Uruk-hai and regain his Ring of Power from Frodo so that he may rule all of Middle Earth. Okay, those last three paragraphs may seem really confusing if you haven't seen the first two movies, but at this point if you're not familiar with the trilogy then you must have been living under a rock for the last three years. "The Return of the King" finishes the series admirably, bringing a powerful ending to one of the greatest motion pictures series. Where "The Matrix" trilogy started strong but slowly regressed into an overblown mess, "The Lord of the Rings" began on top and only went up from there. Director Peter Jackson's realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy story is wonderful. The movies succeed because of the mix of cutting edge special effects, powerful performances and most of all, a respect for the source material. Jackson has already earned his place in cinematic history with the ultra-gory zombie flick "Dead Alive," but these films will make him one of the immortals. Wood manages to move Frodo further along on his quest with control over his character well beyond his years. Frodo, the ring bearer, literally carries the weight of the world with him as the forces of darkness seek to destroy him and his friends. The emotional power is carried by Wood admirably. McKellen is perhaps filmdom's best wizard, with Gandalf perpetually in conflict with his surroundings and even his acquaintances. It is to the movie's credit that Gandalf is no longer merely a detached figurehead but a full-blown warrior this time around, and McKellen is such a master of his craft here that it's hard to believe that the white wizard is a fictional character. The rest of the cast is awesome as well. Bloom and Rhys-Davies have successfully moved Legolas and Gimli from rivals that barely tolerated each other's presence to friends who facetiously compete in battle over who can kill the most Orcs. Mortensen brings a quiet fury to his role, balancing a star-crossed love with elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler) and his duty to reunite the many human clans under one king. This whole enterprise might have collapsed under its own weight had it been done in a campy or half-hearted way, but "The Return of the King" ends the series brilliantly. The siege of Minas Tirith is one of the most impressive battle sequences ever committed to celluloid, even making the last film's Battle of Helms Deep seem tame by comparison. The action scenes here are underscored with flawless emotional energy, as the heroes fight valiantly against the depraved, overwhelming forces of evil. Whether against the monstrous spider Shelob, the heartless Nazgul king Gothmog, the tragically flawed Gollum, or the armies of the evil Sauron himself, the heroes battle with vigor and determination. Every arrow fired or slash of a sword is felt with force and importance almost unparalleled on the big screen. In a way, I'm sad to see the series end. Moviegoers have gotten to know the heroes and villains well, and it almost seems wrong to end the travels of the fellowship. But the story ends respectfully with all loose ends handled commendably, which is more than any other movie series has done since the original "Star Wars" trilogy. The epilogue last perhaps five minutes longer then it needs to, but that is a personal complaint, and one with which Tolkien fans will have no problem. Cinematic history was created with this series, and "The Return of the King" will rightly go down as one of the greatest endings to one of the greatest stories ever brought to the screen. 10 out of 10 stars. Even a few false endings can not dull this unequaled masterpiece.
10.0~The Epic grand adventure of the Millenia! One of the greatest movies ever made! hanifmuhammad92 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is perhaps the greatest achievement in cinematic history. It's the ending of Trilogy that ends the Journey even more masterfully than it began and it does it just a way that will leave you in tears once it's all over. I've cried while watching this, several times in fact. There are so many great emotional punches that it's staggerly long 3 and a half hour length(Four and a half if your watching the Extended) go by like a picnic. Honestly till this day I've never seen anything like before or since. We've had great movies, movies that mark the end of a series or trilogy. Movies like, The Dark Knight Rises, Avengers Endgame, and MockingJay. All try to end their series in an Epic fashion with a Grand final battle but none of these hit me with the same emotional punch like The Return of the King. Needlessly to say I FREAKING LOVE THIS MOVIE! The film picks up right where the previous film left off. Frodo and Sam are still being led by Gollum on their perilous journey towards Mount Doom while Gandalf, Aragorn, Théoden and the others prepare for the War to end all wars. The Battle of Pelenoir Fields is in my estimation the greatest visual achievement in film history. Gandalf is a Titan when he leads Gondor's armies and Théoden is a Legend! The Sequence when he leads the armies of Rohan as they shout "DEATH" sends chills down by spine and moves me beyond measure. I adore that scene as I do The Oliphant battle. This movie is filled with battle sequences from beginning to end, the most out of the trilogy. In a film with so much action it would be easy to forget about the heart but to compensate this the movie somehow magically contains twice the emotion of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. There are so many sub plots in this adventure but rather than distract they give assistance to the main arch of the film. From Eowyn being the one female willing to fight side by side amongst determined men, To the tragic circumatance that Faramir finds himself in when he finds that his father detests him and rather him die over his diseased brother Boromir, to Théoden's acceptance of his mortality and letting go of his animosity towards Gondor. It's all Great stuff and does more than just about any 3 or 4 hour that I've ever seen to justify it's length. I will always cherish this film for that. The Climax is spell binding and Everything you can possibly hope for. Everything comes to a head at the end and it takes it's time getting there. Not only did I appreciate that but after the Climax the resolution becomes it's own unique section of the film. Frodo returns after destroying the ring and Gollum along with it to find the world has moved on without him. None of the Hobbits truly feel home when they return, though Sam is able to make the most of it after getting married and starting a family. Frodo must leave Middle Earth Forever and go with the Elves to the Valinor, a heaven like place far away from the rest of the world. A tear Jerker ending if there ever was one. All in all The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one of the rare examples of a Perfect Movie. Everything is exactly as it should be. Everything from the first two films is tied up beautifully by the final acts of the film. Every moment feels like time well spent from the brief Look at the origin of Gollum that sets the tone at the opening of the film to the Closing of the door after Sam comes home to his family at the shire at the end. All of it feels like a revelation. This movie a Must Watch and one of the rare cases of a Sequel that surpasses it's predecessors. It's a Marvel to behold.
10.0~A Spectacular end to the most amazing motion picture event ever made Bigfootballfan Sign in Permalink This is hands down the best of all the three films of the trilogy. It is simply a wonder-kind. The movie is awesome. Simply, flat out, spectacular. This one is the one the emotionally resonates most. I was amazed by the final sequences how they bring us happily home and how we feel relieved and amazed that this journey is finally over. What and epic it has been. I love this whole trilogy. The last film is the crowning achievement on all of Mr. Jacksons work. The special effects are seamless and convincing throughout. The epic scope and nature of the project is simply amazing. The whole trilogy deserves its technical awards amongst the others. This the first great cinematic accomplishment of the twenty-first century. This is one of those peaks that stands above all others in the history of film-making. Go get the whole trilogy for your DVD collection now.
10.0~From the beginning... dee.reid Sign in Permalink ...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the "goriest movie ever made" (1992's "Dead Alive"), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of "The Lord of the Rings" saga, which include "The Fellowship of the Ring" (2001), "The Two Towers" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner "The Return of the King" (2003). ***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page. Not since "Star Wars" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing "The Lord of the Rings" films. "The Lord of the Rings" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the "PG-13" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get "into" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and "The Enemy," who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live ("live" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a "fellowship of the ring." There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called "The Lord of the Rings" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right. 10/10
10.0~Final battle between good and evil,fought on several battlefields guje-i-akrepi Sign in Permalink My favorite movie of all times. Excellent,brilliant,exquisite.... Soooooo emotional and so epic at the same time,the best example is the scene when King Theoden encourages his soldiers,and tells them,that they have to fight because there are greater things at stakes than their lives. I cry every time. The battle for Minas Tirith is very dramatic,makes you sit at the edge of your seat all the time. The ending contains very Tolkien-like feeling,happiness mixed with a bit of grief and loss. If there is anyone on this planet who haven't seen it yet,know,you are very wrong,this movie is worth your time,and it will give you so much pleasure.
10.0~The Greatest Trilogy of All Time kylemcd77 Sign in Permalink Having just got back home from seeing the Return of the King I can honestly say I have seen the ending to the greatest trilogy in the history of cinema. The Return of the King does what so many trilogies have failed to do, and that is to have the final installment be the best of the three. Finishing the trilogy on a high note making you feel as if you have come to the end of the greatest journey of your life. One of the greatest films of all time 10/10.
10.0~Ending is Great!!! ahhofelt Sign in Permalink Don't believe the reviews of the slow ending, etc. It was nearly perfect! 'Hollywood' reviewers expect a Hollywood ending, but Peter Jackson is not from Hollywood. Kudos to him and his staff for doing it right. Another note, 3 1/2 hours was not enough. It should have went closer to 4 hours. I hope they have an extended edition dvd!
10.0~If you haven't seen this movie, then you haven't LIVED! frbrthr22 Sign in Permalink 201 minutes...that's 3 hours and 21 minutes! Almost 3 and a half hours of non stop thrilling scenes that literally had me sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time. All the same beloved characters are back and better than ever before! Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, and Sean Astin give astounding performances once again. I have now watched this movie at least 15 times and I'm still picking up little details I had never noticed before. For any one that has seen the first two movies you will love this movie. If you truly want to watch a great movie, a movie that rocked the box offices, a movie that had audiences applauding, a movie that had critics smiling, and a movie that changed the movie industry dramatically watch this movie. If you don't see this movie before you die you never lived. So grab your pop corn and a drink and be drawn into this world of fantasy and imagination the world of The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King!!!!!
10.0~an absolute masterpiece!!!! rkeaney Sign in Permalink We start off with a flash back to the times where Gollum or smeagol was one of the riverfolk not unlike a hobbit.We see how smeagol came into the possession of the ring and how he transformed into smeagol. The battle for middle earth is about to begin as Gondor prepare for war also in hope of aid from ancient ally's Rohan the Troops of Mordor are about to launch an attack upon Minas Tirith so hard that Middle earth as we know it will be lost forever. Frodo and sam struggle to keep up with there guide smeagol who it seems is about to bring them into great danger.The ring of power must be destroyed by being cast into the flames of mount doom where it as made and the only place it can be unmade before sauron unleashes his armies upon the whole of middle earth. This is well deserving of its place in the top 250.After eagerly awaiting this movie since the end credits of two towers i am proud to say that this is my favourite movie of all time.I loved this movie the cgi is absolutely mind blowing and battle at Minas Tirith was literally breathtaking.The final chapter in this epic journey is a must see for all lovers of action/fantasy movies. After just watching the trilogy non-stop over the weekend i couldn't tear my eyes away from it and you get so engrossed in it that you don't notice anything around you but the screen which is captivating you with every scene Peter Jackson is god to me this movie's well deserving of 11 Oscars. 10/10.
10.0~The best of the three, though a little short. pbol Sign in Permalink I was blown away in the theater by the sheer intensity of the movie. I have never had such an emotional reaction to a piece of fiction in my life. I found my self almost crying in some passages. The acting is phenomenal. Especially Frodo(Woods), Sam(Austin) and Aragorn(Mortensen) have through the entire trilogy had a grip on me. And the way Frodo and Sam's friendship evolves is simply fantastic. As I said to one of my friends about the movies, `It is all the small things as the look in the eye and the way the words are said which makes this trilogy the greatest masterwork of all time.' The fighting sense of course are very grand an exciting, but nothing without the glue.
10.0~An epic that will not be forgotten... Youngbuck11 Sign in Permalink This film isn't as gritty as The Two Towers, but in no way is it as magical and cheery as the first film, if you can call it that. This film is a long and emotional story that has it all. Epic battles, emotional scenes, great acting, wonderful visual effects, superb directing, and, of course, a brilliant story. This film was definitely the greatest cinema going experiences I've ever had and will, most likely, ever have. It was so huge and was just so much of everything anyone could ever want in a movie. It was flawless. The only thing I think that this film doesn't have going for it is it's replay value. Fellowship of the Rings is a little bit more light hearted and can be watched on DVD multiple times without ever tiring of seeing it. The Two Towers is probably the worst when it comes to replay value, but this isn't much better. This one has a very complex plot and is extremely long and is really much better on the big screen. All in all, this was the greatest of the three. You'll have to pick your jaw up off the ground after seeing this. -Chris
10.0~Absolutely amazing NinaaniN Sign in Permalink This movie is just as great as the three before it. The camera angles, lighting and effects were amazing. I am so proud of the actors, Viggo, Orlando, Elijah, Ian and everyone else! Without this amazing cast, Lord Of the Rings would not feel the way it does. Andy Serkis, props to you for your amazing portrayal of Gollum and all the effort to get all those jumping shots in. The camera crew showed their worth with the excellent filmography. Ever angle gave meaning and ever sound effect chilled you with pride. With all these factors I feel proud to be alive when beautiful films like this are made for us to enjoy. Intense nostalgia grabs me when I watch this film now and I couldn't be more happier.
9.0~Nice end to the series nsymms Sign in Permalink I haven't read the books, but have seen all the movies. "Return of the King" is much better than the "Two Towers" in my opinion. "King" doesn't wander around with long boring scenes nearly as much. I'm sure if you read the book you're drooling over all of it, but for those of us who haven't, the story is a bit daunting. Overall, I think it works out well. The action sequences are amazing. Huge sweeping scenes of beautiful landscapes, impressive castles, massive war-making action with gigantic creatures battling against tiny humans and our even tinier hobbits. Of course it all works out for the best in the end. The good people live, the bad people die. However, we don't get to see much of my favorites, like Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett. I want to see it again, but I'm not sure if I can sit through the whole thing in the theater again. 3 hours 20 minutes is a long time if you're not in stadium seating.
4.0~LotR smelleanor00 Sign in Permalink All the Lord of the Rings movies are over rated. I think there are much better movies out there, and people care too much about these stupid movies. Nothing all that great happens, the acting is okay, the landscape is pretty to look at, but the story is boring. I just feel that these movies are way to popular for what they are, or should I say what they are not. If you have seen these movies more than 3 times, get a life. If you know most of the lines in the movies, get a life. Movies are for enjoyment, they should not be a lifestyle. And most of the people who really likes these movies, let their obsessions rule their lives. So once a again, get a life. These movies are not that great.
8.0~8 out of 10 10basetom Sign in Permalink This was the worst movie of the trilogy. Don't get me wrong, it was still a good movie, but there were some cornball lines, too predictable plot points (even if you haven't read the books), and I felt that the ending was too dragged out. The action sequences were definitely one of the best offered up by Hollywood though. Still, all that action cannot match the magic in the first movie. 8 out of 10.
10.0~AMAZING vtskiier Sign in Permalink bar none the greatest movie i have ever seen. i have been looking forward to this movie since december of 2002 and i was not disappointed. the only thing that i can complain about is that the trilogy is over and i have nothing to look forward to next december!
10.0~good happytouryogya Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings is My favorite Film, the best film ever in the world
6.0~Action supplants character UndeadKitties Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson said in interview that the movie he really wanted to make (of the 3) was ROTK -because there was no character development to deal with. Well, it shows. While there are a few bright moments, they are far between. Yes, there are spectacles to witness- but vast portions of the film feel pointless -and worse- boring. Jackson demonstrates why you should storyboard AND script a film before starting principle photography- which was not the case here. The only thing saving a weak script are excellent actors and a high production level. I would have rather seen a low budget film with the same actors and a script that equaled them. At best it is eye candy with characters that have earned endearment from the previous episodes; at worst, ROTK debases what came before by repetition without added substance.
10.0~The VERY BEST of the three.... ChristopherLee Sign in Permalink Although this film was QUITE lengthy, I found it to be the most satisfying of the trilogy. It ended this story wonderfully, and there was no question that this was the last. Even though my butt was numb, it was well worth it.. A MUST SEE FILM. These are the ultimate movies of this generation....
10.0~The Greatest Epic of All Time! rileymullins Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King (LOTR, ROTK), is by far the most powerful and astonishing chapter in the LOTR trilogy, and that's saying a lot because the first two are amazing. If you liked the first two this one will rock your life. It takes a real movie fan to appreciate the fine details put into every set, every prop, every costume, every character, and every scene, and anyone who opposes it has to oppose the 11 Oscars it deservingly won as well. Unlike many trilogies, LOTR has a rare quality that makes it superior to all others: Each movie gets better as they continue. The film is perfectly cast and every actor plays his or her role to perfection. The CGI work is outstanding and revolutionary. Gollum is the most detailed and realistic computer-generated creature ever put on screen. The musical score makes this film. Howard Shore is a genius and this is by far his greatest work. The cinematography, EVERYTHING IS FANTASTIC! Please enjoy this monumental film and appreciate the incredible amount of work put into it.
10.0~A Perfect Finish. jymcgr Sign in Permalink I just came from "The Return of the King" and aside from being emotionally drained, I am thrilled with this final installment. Unlike the tepid finish of "The Matrix" trilogy, this series of movies go out with the same force it came in with. Jackson's work, no matter what the rest of his career yields, will be his capstone achievement and one that place him in the movie directors hall of fame. For all of the fussing and complaining about the length of this movie, I was happy with it. I thought the movie was as long as it needed to be and I personally never wanted it to end. Thank you Peter Jackson.
10.0~Peter Jacksons masterpiece Saxxxon Sign in Permalink This movie really is incredible. It is like putting the dot over the I. Incredibly breathtaking and i love it. I love the characters. I am glad that the movie is a success because I was sceptical at first. I am looking forward to seeing the extended version. Amazing, fantastic,... Saxxxon
9.0~The tale ends with flying colours samyaksambuddha Sign in Permalink This part largely deals with the struggles of Frodo and Sam towards Mordon. The Gollum tricks them at all levels winning significantly when he tricks into poisoning Frodo against Sam. Gandalf, Aragorn and others gain march towards Minas Tirith. The preparations are being made for the final war of the Middle Earth. Also this shows the undisclosed stories like the story of Smeagol and how the ring transformed him poorly. Also Aragorn reclaims his role as the rightful heir primarily for dealing with the dead of the mountain. Their role in defeating the invincible army of Orcs and men was crucial. The return of Arwen for the love of Aragorn while sacrificing her immortality added on the romantic side. The triangle with Ewoyn was also interesting. Moreover, Ewoyn contributed greatly by killing the invincible Nazgul whom no man could kill. The tale ends on the beautiful side with Middle Earth gaining the peace and prosperity as earlier days with the destruction of Sauron's eyes. The war sequence is fascinating with the introcduction of interesting elements like the oliphaunts. The Farewell of Frodo with his friends was an emotional scene. Also the elves leave leaving the middle Earth in the hands of men and crowning Aragorn as the King. As one tale ends another begins!! haha..waiting for another such series.
10.0~Absolutely excellent KevinRuiz Sign in Permalink It couldn't be another better ending for this wonderful trilogy. All the work is fantastic but this third part of this story couldn't be better. Congratulations to all the team. I had read the trilogy's book before watching the film and I thought in a epic history, that is how it has been, I was not wrong. So, the only more thing I can say is, if there is someone that has not seen this film yet, don't wait more. Also, I recommend the new trilogy based in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien, called "The Hobbit", It's awesome. Perhaps, one of the most important point to have made this film the best option, it has been the choice of the environment. Simply amazing.
10.0~A Breathtaking Experience lin_liangjun Sign in Permalink I watched this movie on 22nd Dec, and I would give it a 10 for this movie. In this movie, it contains many unexpected scenes and you would probably want for more as the movie moves on. The beautiful scenery and especially the battle scenes were marvellously depicted. The ending though was acceptable and I really like the part where Shelob was trying to sneak Frodo from behind and devour him. The main attraction of this movie would be the battle at Minas Tirith, and the interception of the Nazguls and the Riders of Rohan makes the battle even more thrilling between the battle of the humans and the orc goblins.This movie is a must see and it would not be a disappointment, I'm sure.
10.0~The standard for which all movies should aspire to DistrictSix Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings cast and crew have already set a new standard in movie production. 2003 will forever be known as the year of Tolkien and one of the greatest movies and certainly THE greatest trilogy of all time is complete.
10.0~Defies Gravity cquinn-1 Sign in Permalink Three hours of lifting and holding an audience off its seat. Twenty minutes to set them back down on a gentle landing that is unlikely to be forgotten. Return of the King takes off from the point of its prequels' promises, covers the bet and then goes on to payoff far in excess of expectation. I entered the theater waiting to be disappointed. The Fellowship, in its original theatrical cut, seemed to glance off of Tolkein's material. Loved it thoroughly, but thought the characters to be thinly drawn. Frankly, I'm not sure that I felt deep concern for the hobbits' plight at prequel's end. The Two Towers did a better job of taking the audience into the persons of Aragon, Frodo and Gandalf. But still, I did not think it was enough. Director Peter Jackson played me. He knew he had his audience hooked. But he also knew that he would have a tough time of building to a crescendo with seemingly ultimate battle after ultimate battle. In Return of the King, he takes off from the first moment to tell us about the reality of Smeagol. The nuances of this computer-generated creature are unnerving to say the least. Elrond makes his case with his daughter the best he can and relents. Aragon faces his future with palpable angst. Eowyn, Gandalf, Theoden, Merry, Pippin, Legolas, and, yes, even Gimli have risen above the halftones of character originally portrayed in the earlier releases. And by movie's end, we deeply cared about the fate of Frodo and Sam. RotK was worth the three year and longer wait. Now, how about the Hobbit?
10.0~The most influential and successful film jadmodel Sign in Permalink It's the best movie I have ever seen I've always loved watching it many times I don't get tired of watching this film There is everything in this film is a legend in every sense of the word All the characters more than wonderful This movie made me to i be ambitious in the world of cinema and representation The funny thing is that this film made me watch all its parts more than 30 times It's the only film that I loved it and I will not forget him at all.. I thank everyone on this legendary film.. All movie scenes are wonderful ..we will never see such a wonderful movie never.. I say thanks thaks thanks about this movie I don't have words to describe expressive Just I wish that you will continue in a new industry chains of the film
10.0~Simply Amazing galor5 Sign in Permalink All I can say is this movie is Simply Amazing! It is a masterpiece work of art! As a fan of both the books & the movies I applaud the genius of Peter Jackson! If you've seen The Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers you MUST go see Return of the King to get a resolution to all the stories that were so prevalent throughout the first two. Thank You Peter Jackson, New Line and all the wonderful Cast & Crew for putting so much heart & soul into this trilogy!
10.0~A Masterpiece. But don't tell screenit.com nankipoo Sign in Permalink First, I want to thank IMDB for allowing users to vote on films, rather than having a reviewer on staff. By the time a film receives tens of thousands of votes, it becomes clear that there is more to a movie than a die-hard core group of admirers could conjure up. Take your children to "Return of the King"...then take them again. It's scary and chilling in some places, but those incidents are outweighed by the wonderful examples of leadership, bravery, dedication and undying hope, along with some gentle humor that (believe it or not) doesn't go the typical Hollywood route of being obnoxious or gross. It really is a film for all ages. Really. I can easily ignore the random IMDB user who dismisses the LOTR Trilogy because I know that those who sing its praises aren't all cave-dwellers who have to "escape" to Middle Earth to feel alive. In fact, I'd bet that a lot of the film Trilogy's most devoted fans are people who have never read the books, but are responding to 3 of the most moving, beautiful, and memorable films ever made. LOTR speaks to the best parts of human nature: courage, loyalty, commitment, and true friendship, just to name a few. As a parent, I am indebted to PJ and his colleagues for bringing an uplifting and inspirational story to the screen; one I can bring my family to and not cringe every ten minutes. Yes, these are hobbitts, elves, dwarfs, wizards, humans and one very nasty eye, but the lessons are here and now; good for the home and for the world today. Most all agree. I've found that, almost without exception, the "External Reviews" for LOTR as listed by IMDB, are 90% ecstatic, with the remaining 10% still conceding that the Trilogy is both exceptional and absolutely worth seeing. So, when I popped over to ScreenIt.com (which presents itself as a parents' guide to films), I was both amazed and disgusted that their invisible "reviewer" had virtually nothing good to say about ROTK. The review was totally biased against all aspects of the movie. The site begrudgingly yielded the film a 6/10 rating, complaining all the way. As someone said here earlier: to those who rate LOTR 0/10, please cancel your registration to IMDB, for there simply is no intelligent way that a person can slam these movies across the board. And so I'm hoping to alert parents and moviegoers alike that not all "professional" reviewers feel the need for objectivity or responsibility, even in this case, which seems clear-cut to most of us who have seen the films and who would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone who asked, or anyone who didn't ask as well!! I suppose that in the case of anything that is unabashedly positive, there are always those who (like Saruman) cannot resist the shadows. Time will prove that the Trilogy is a milestone and a masterwork. And then misguided websites with axes to grind will be exposed as lacking the basic credentials to be advising parents, or anyone else for that matter. Again, take your children to ROTK over these holidays and you'll have even one more reason to celebrate.
10.0~The best movie I've ever seen lue_duden Sign in Permalink This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has everything; a good director, a thrilling history that you want to involve in yourself, good directed action scenes, romantic histories that has it's turning points in the main story, a good cast and good assistants. And(!) it's a great video version based on a great book. (and that aren't always so easy to manage, especially not when the book it's based on is so full of action, and details, so thumbs up for Peter Jackson and his crew =)) The actors are a chapter for itself, who keeps the story so living, thrilling and amazing the whole movie. They does an amazing job, and I thinks nobody can deny that. The people that got the job for the costumes also did an incredible job dressing the actors so they looked like elves, men, dwarfs, Orcs, Moria goblins, hobbits and other fantasy creatures + those who computer animated all of the trolls, Ents, servants of the dark master, the dark master himself, the flame Deamon from the old ages and all of that stuff. I'm feeling that Iv'e said my opinion about this subject, (if eleven Oscars has not)
10.0~WOW! joninagy Sign in Permalink That was the best movie i have ever seen. There is EVERYTHING in that movie. Action, Drama, and thriller. The battle seens are amazing and can not be found in any other movie. This movie will not be forgtton soon. I GIVE THIS MOVIE A 12 OUT OF 10! But since i can only give it a 10, well thats what i gave it. PURELY AMAZING!!!!!!!
7.0~Most of it is wonderful- so what is with the bad CGI??? luvthatmouse Sign in Permalink Good points: -The battle scenes are amazing -Frodo and Sam! Like others said, I can not picture anyone else playing them. S.Astin and E.Wood did such a great job in the 3 movies. -The scenery-beautiful. -Shelob looks real! Bad points: -Legolas jumping on the mammoth-looks SO fake. Why stick things like this in when other scenes are so amazing??? -The army of the dead moves way too fast-fake, fake, fake... -Bad makeup on some characters (Bilbo at the end.) -Weird cuts and fades at some points. -P. Jackson must be in love with Liv Tyler, he focuses on her face for LONG amounts of time. Why spend so long on these scenes like this and cut out great scenes from the books? -Characters saying there's in the wrong context. As in "there's armys on their way towards us right now..." There IS armys?? This sounds so stupid and people would never speak this way back then. It just ruins the moment and makes you remember oh yeah, these are modern day people that speak wrong. Caught it several times-if I can, why can't the writers/director fix this?!
5.0~Object Lesson in Tedium matthood Sign in Permalink Overblown, overlong and pompous, the third instalment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy has disappeared well up its own backside - and seemingly taken a whole host of weak-willed and easily-pleased movie-goers with it. Equating length and special effects, falsely, to cinematic excellence, Peter Jackson has created a film so tedious and slow-paced as to make re-reading the snore-inducing novel seem like a brilliant idea. The hobbits are so wet and dreary as to make Gollum (an exact replica of Jar Jar Binks without the ears) look like a hero - every second they take up screen time I just groaned with embarrassment and boredom. Jackson' sole directing technique is the slow pan, fine for establishing scenery, wince-making when it comes to our third trip up Frodo's nostrils. Most of the characters just make you want to go up to them, slap them sharply round the face and tell them to pull themselves together and get a brain/life. Worse of all, the spiders were done better in Eight Legged Freaks, the ghosts were sub-Pirates of the Caribbean and the battle sequences were as confusingly grey-on-grey as the last instalment of the equally dreary Matrix trilogy! Judged on its merits alone this movie would feature as number one only in a list of the biggest wastes of time and money in cinema history, but sadly a gullible public have lost their way. Please, please - do not make The Hobbit, Peter!
9.0~A brilliant conclusion - but now what do I look forward to? MsMovie Sign in Permalink If Peter Jackson doesn't win the best director and best picture Oscars this year, then there is NO JUSTICE at all in the entertainment industry - let's just hope the Golden Globes are a good indication! To start with, this movie is outstanding - there will be no spoilers in this review because you really have to go and see this film for yourself to appreciate the splendor and the spectacle of this epic tale of adventure, romance, nobility and heroism. Frodo is back as good as ever, and Elijah Wood is proving to be a really talented adult actor, following on from his excellent start in childhood. And as Sam, Sean Astin, is another child star who has really come into his own now. Viggo Mortensen is still gorgeous and makes a believable King, and the entrancing Liv Ullman is beautiful as the elf who gives up her immortality for love. New Zealand has now become one of the places I must visit, because it is just breathtaking and that is thanks to Peter Jackson's sensitive direction and the skill of the cinematographer and editor combined! This film deserves to be nominated for about 10-12 Oscars that I can think of - best film, director, original score, original song, a gaggle of special effects type awards, and if there were a best overall cast, it would definitely win that one. I cannot wait for this film to come out in the special edition triple boxed set later in 2004 - it will be a must-buy for Christmas 2004! You should see this film if you have seen the first 2 and if not rent them first, then see the ending, the impact is much better if you know what is going on. And for anyone who thinks 3 hours is a long time to be sat in a cinema, well, don't concern yourself, it will all be over before you even realize it and you'll wonder where the time went!
5.0~i cried :( piratebabe2727 Sign in Permalink I cried because they messed this movie up so much! At the end of the movie, I literally sat there bawling because, after reading the books at least 8 times, I was so disappointed by Peter Jackson's direction of the movie. The Two Towers was amazing, it stuck to the books and had awesome battle sequences. In RotK, the battle scenes look copied from the TT, the Paths of the Dead made me think Bloom had brought the guys in from Pirates of the Caribbean, the movie felt extremely long, and there were 8 endings!!! The worst part of it was they left out the Scouring of the Shire... the scene was completely gone. I used to be a huge Lord of the Rings fan, I saw the other two movies at least 20 times and have read the books every year for years. After seeing this, I've completely lost interest. If you enjoyed the book, don't bother watching the movie.
6.0~A mediocre film that everyone feels obliged to love danila_1 Sign in Permalink For some reason people fell compelled to love ROTK, even despite all its shortcomings. After making the Purist Edit of The Two Towers (check eDonkey2000 network for it) I have no such qualms. Return of the King is mediocre filmmaking at most. Yes, it does have excellent source material and it does have some expensive (but not impressive) CGI. But almost everything else that the film is comprised of is shoddy. Script is a butchering of a book, created by three self-assured writers who think they can do a better job than JRRT (regardless of the target medium). Acting is poor with a few exceptions. Music is either a rehash of TTT themes, or is extremely lame. Directing and editing are absolutely pathetic, overall and in minor details. Even make-up is not on-par with FOTR and TTT, reusing some mutant from Total Recall for an orc chieftain instead of lifelike Moria orcs and Uruk-Hai in FOTR and Mordor and Isengard orcs in TTT. Special effects are everywhere, but the quality is truly pathetic. Disneyesque phantoms, unbelievable miniatures (with blatantly obvious jumps from set filming to miniature and back several times), completely lame collapses of Minas Tirith's buildings hit by catapults (note to PJ: your are not filming an attack on flimsy movie sets, you are filming an attack on a mighty Gondor fortress). The film clumsily borrows from Star Wars, Terminator, Aliens, etc., instead of creating its own visual style like it was done in FOTR. Even more blatant are the rip-offs from TTT - countless scenes, dialogs and whole episodes look like they have been taken straight from TTT with only a little modification (like superimposing the same footage on a different background - compare the HD and MT Rohirrim attacks, Gimli and horn vs. Pippin and beacons, etc., etc.). There are many extremely cheap and overused shots, the beacon sequence is crap (there is no sense of direction, it is unrealistic). There are simply to many faults in this movie to list them here, on average I flinched about once per minute, witnessing yet another wild story change, lame dialog or poor performance. There are some good parts, but they are few and far between. If you are a sheep or have other reasons to believe that PJ is god and his movies are gospel, watch the film suppressing your disgust. Otherwise don't expect much from it, a few laughs at the ridiculousness of the movie at most. If you love the books and don't enjoy pointless and stupid plot (and character) changes, avoid this one. Watch FOTR EE again instead.
10.0~The best and the worst one... fedo_morgan Sign in Permalink I cried the whole movie. As far as my wet eyes could see, they saw an enormous movie, as no one has seen since Spartacus. The cinematographic language achieved by Jackson for this sort of movie, is unbelievable. Everyone should go and see this movie to tell to their future kids, as my father did with me with Star Wars, that they saw a movie that will be known forever. Now the worst. As in the previous movies, there are several mistakes. The taken out scenes for the extended version leave major voids in the continuity that can be noticed easily. And there's this "time" thing, it looks like the whole movie happens in a couple of hours. Nevertheless, I think this is the most thrilling movie of the three, heroic actions are sublime, the music is great, everything is great. And one last good thing, I guarantee that you won't be depressed after the movie. Tolkien fans will never get this close to the professors imaginary again...
10.0~Woow ceccoesco Sign in Permalink Still, Jackson's achievement cannot be denied. "Return of the King" is such a crowning achievement, such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects, such a pure spectacle, that it can be enjoyed even by those who have not seen the first two films. Yes, they will be adrift during the early passages of the film's 200 minutes, but to be adrift occasionally during this nine-hour saga comes with the territory; Tolkien's story is so sweeping and Jackson includes so much of it that only devoted students of the Ring can be sure they understand every character, relationship and plot point.
10.0~Best film of all time.... realgt Sign in Permalink There are more than enough reasons to categorize this film as the best of all time. An incredible story, amazing visual effects, and an emotional call-to-arms combine to provide an extraordinary adventure that is beyond our wildest dreams. The journey of Frodo Baggins from the innocence of the Shire, his adventures in middle earth, the countless other subplots woven into the fabric of one of the greatest stories of our time, are all developed at such an adept level of professional storytelling as to hold the viewers attention for not only the length of the film(s) but into the routine moments of their lives. I dreamed of the Ring, Sauron, the eye, Frodo, the battle...as I came home, the woods seemed to groan and shadows fleeting were signs of journeying Elfs. Director Peter Jackson soars beyond our own imaginations of the book providing beautiful cinematography and amazing visual effects. One could *feel* the beauty of Arwen and her undying love in close-ups of her face. The spider, the Oliphaunts, the destructions, the battle scenes, Gollum, and more were all produced in near-perfect visual effects to a degree of detail that merits an Academy Award. The film's rallying cry for those who will fight for good made fans of cynics and realists. When my friends dragged me to the first viewing of Fellowship of the Ring, I had scarcely an inkling of interest in fantastical stories of monsters and epic battles. Having never read the book, I scorned and laughed at the "-orfs" used to name everything...ooh the woods of moordoooorffff. the toilets of craporffff. It was retarded to me. During the second film, Gollum dragged me into caring, and by ROTK I wanted to draw swords alongside Aragorn and pledge my life to defend Gondor. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King brings to such a satisfying conclusion the journey that all of us took in broadening the scope of our imagination and adventuring in a world of Orcs, Oliphaunts, Elfs, and Dwarfs. It tells of undying love, the conquest of humanity, honor, loyalty, the corruption of power, and the overcoming of fear. It shows our very eyes scenes which we could only imagine and creates fans of those who see it. There is no better example or definition of a movie than this.
10.0~Well envisioned, beautifully executed davidkmcw Sign in Permalink A visually stunning cinematic masterpiece. Having been a big fan of the series, I was pretty skeptical of an attempt to bring them to the silver screen. The first two films were very good, the extra scenes on the DVD make them excellent. The third movie is head & shoulders above the previous two. The scenery is visually stunning and is everything I hoped I would see. Andy Serkis as Gollum is excellent. I would hugely recommend it.
10.0~Better than 1 and 2 combined kungen2050 Sign in Permalink The Fellowship of the Ring was a magic movie magic when I first saw it, despite the lack of massive battle scenes, which I particuly like with the trilogy. The Two Towers did an even greater job immersing oneself into the story with the big battle of Helms Deep. The third and last movie successfully combined them both and possessed both the good story and the kick-ass battle scenes, both in much larger scale. I long to see it again. Although I rather see the extended edition cause it gives you a more complete version of the plot (including the battle of the shire).
10.0~I totaly LOVED this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!! angeldevil1334 Sign in Permalink This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I have seen it 9 times in theater. I love all the Lord of the Ring movies and this one is the best! I rated it a ten because it is just full of excitment and you never know what is going to happen next or if someone is going to die which you might think alot in the movie. You can never tell if someone is evil or good. I love the sights and the places they film at. It makes me want to go to New Zeland. It is so pretty and the battle in it is huge and exciting. The battle is one of the best parts! It is by far the best movie in the entire world! I would see it again in theater in an instent and I am buying it the very first day it comes out!
2.0~Truth misleading charbel-vip Sign in Permalink I think that "Lord of the rings" series mislead the viewers especially the Christian viewers in indirect way, because these series promote magic ("good magic") as a solution for the world & hints strongly that it's good to benefit from dealing with the souls of the dead people, & because these series consider that "good magic" not "God's care & his miracles" or any "high good power" is the only way to deliver mankind from evil. That "good magic" is done by "Gondolf" who is a wizard, a magician & a sorcerer! Who follow an unknown & invisible & enigmatic power; and also by fictional entities called "elves". I believe that there is no good magic, because every real magic is from the devil, the old serpent, the great dragon (Satan). So how evil can fight evil & win on it?
9.0~This film basically... changed my mental attitude... cinema_forever19 Sign in Permalink Back during the year of 2001-2003, I was 10-12 years old. I've known about The Lord of the Rings, I've seen them advertised on television and so on, but I never gave any interest in them. Nor was I at all interested in films to begin with. I was never really a bright person back then either, I actually would pick on The Lord of the Rings for no particular reason - yet, even though I had never seen the films, I was very inconsiderate and immature. Of course, as years passed, I grew up a little. By 2005, after viewing Peter Jackson's epic King Kong, which surpassed anything I have ever seen in my very short movie-going experience. I got a lot more interested in films - King Kong amazed me, not just visually but emotionally... so I wanted to see more films like it. But throughout 2006, I never knew what films were good and what films were bad. All the films I saw throughout that year were all the bad ones. They were never satisfying. I was in desperate need of suggestions. Finally I discovered IMDb's Top 250 list - as voted by IMDb users, which guided me to seeing better films. The Top 250 was the answer to my prayer. So finally, I decided to rid myself of being a child and finally check out Jackson's The Lord of the Rings. Starting with Fellowship and Towers - renting them at a rental store. The Fellowship of the Ring was amazing, I discovered a heart inside of me that I never knew I had. The Two Towers gave me thrills and chills that I've only ever experienced watching Jackson's King Kong. But... when I finally watched The Return of the King, it throw me on my neck! You are talking about a nuclear explosion going off inside me. I was absolutely blown away by The Return of the King! It was perfect in every way possible! It had such a cinematic and brilliant story + conclusion to such a wonderful trilogy! This was "perfection" that I have never seen before! I immediately wanted to get these amazing films in my DVD collection, so I did. Throughout 2007 I would watch these films almost all the time, sometimes even twice to three times a month. Then came Feb 11, 2008 - my 17th birthday. By then I have seen and favor over 100 films on the Top 250. I felt like I've grown up a lot as a person and as a movie-fanatic, watching the films that everyone else watches. From how much I loved The Lord of the Rings, I decided to purchase the Special Extended Trilogy box set using my birthday money. And I felt, well... ashamed. Ashamed of what a fool I was! The extended cuts are seriously a much larger improvement than those theatrical cuts! Particularly in terms of story, depth, and characters! I could not believe all that time when I was watching the theatrical cuts, I actually didn't realize how much back-story they actually lacked! Even to this very day I'll watch the theatrical cuts for comparison, and yet I still find myself preferring the extended cuts, by far! My highest recommendation: watch the extended cuts! Not once, but two or three times! I may not personally agree with the majority of the Top 250, but I must admit to the IMDb users, for they do have a very good taste in films nonetheless! However, of all the films I've seen and favor, including all those household classics (Rear Window, Casablanca, Star Wars, and so many more), The Lord of the Rings Trilogy yet remains in my top favorite of all-time, especially The Return of the King. If you haven't seen these films yet, and I mean see them in the way that I did... you must stop at nothing to at least give them a try, whether it's your first or your tenth! Don't even think anything of it, just watch them! Watch them and follow the story in the way a film and story should be followed. These films continue to impress me and touch my heart every time I watch them. These films are very valuable to watch from time to time. For a plus, watch them with family! The films have deep moral messages about friendship, trust, courage, bravery and the processes of growing up and maturing. I'm so proud that I rid myself of all my immaturity and gave these films a try, only now do I feel like I've truly matured as a person. I'm far from that childish kid that I used to be. Just put it, these films will probably be the best example of "Home Entertainment" you will ever have in your DVD collection. Btw, I never read the books - as I'm not much of a reader, and there really is no need to, unless of course you want to. But it's not required, just watch the films! Thank you, and I hope The Lord of the Rings will find a place in your heart and in your DVD collection, as they did with mine.
10.0~Fantasy-war movie nurchowdhuryhimel-18574 Sign in Permalink Extra ordinary movie. Believe it or not, i watched this movie over 50 times. If you love fantasy, war, history genre, then you must see it. What a story, what a graphics!! i just can't describe. Soundtrack was just awesome.Acting was very good. The best trilogy of all time is "LORD OF THE RINGS" trilogy
10.0~An epic movie Plaxeo Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings: Return of the King Quite simply Best one of the three, the perfect end to THE perfect trilogy. I think that this may be the greatest movie of all time. Everyone had such high expectations, and it didn't let them down. Things most likely to be seen in the Extended Edition.
10.0~The Greatest Movie Ever Made austin-27325 Sign in Permalink This is a shine of hope for the film industry. It shares the same standard with Braveheart in its brilliant craft. It is moving art, something to be worshipped and cherished. This is what filmmakers should always strive to do. Many directors, writers, artists, and composers half ass their efforts of crafting a movie for money. This here shows that movies should be a passion, not a way to make money, a lifestyle and a beautiful one at that. One cannot describe the beautiful creation that is the Lord of the Rings series. This is what a finale should be like. It had something everyone will want to see in a film. Any compliment you give this movie is an understatement. It simply surpasses perfection, and something definitely worth viewing endlessly. Do not try to watch this movie for free. That's an insult to the artists of this film.
10.0~Greatest Epic Ever! JOHNLATONA Sign in Permalink Along with Fellowship and Two Towers, it is the greatest story that has ever been shown on film. Peter Jackson has accomplished what few individuals have been able to do and that is to take a fascinating book and make it a fascinating movie...in this case movies. This trilogy is what all other movies will be measured against for a long time to come!
5.0~This "greatest movie/trilogy" will fade into oblivion in time.. jpozenel Sign in Permalink I think those that have described both this movie and the trilogy as the 'greatest ever' should go back to their video games. In time, all three of these movies will take their rightful place in film history...oblivion. I can't understand how people can equate special effects with great film making. There's really nothing positive that I can say about these movies except that the special effects were at first stunning. Soon their repetitiveness led to utter boredom. I would much rather watch a film about realistic situations that people can actually relate to. But I guess if you spent your entire life playing video games and watching other special effects based movies like these, then these movies would qualify as the greatest ever. Someone made the comment that this movie was better than Citizen Kane. Watch this movie as many times as Citizen Kane and see which holds up better. Believe me, this whole trilogy will be a fading memory in ten or twenty years and Citizen Kane will continue to be praised. This is just another case of the 'dumbing down' of the culture. These same people probably can't wait until the next Superbowl so they can watch the commercials. I generously gave all three movies of this trilogy a 5/10.
6.0~A Great Achievement Vash2001 Sign in Permalink After an almost unbearable wait I was able to finally see this film. I plan to see it again, but for now this will do. Sometimes you hear so much about something that your expectations reach the sky and when you finally see it, it is a bit of a disappointment. i would not call ROTK a disappointment, but it could have been even better. It is astounding that the 3 LOTR movies were delivered every December for 3 years on schedule. The whole trilogy was filmed at once, and the individual parts came out as the three LOTR movies. It is an amazing feat. First, what I loved about the movie. The special effects, art direction, the magnificence of everything are unparalleled. In fact without the technological advances this movie could not have been made. The acting was excellent, even though nobody won an Oscar nomination. The characters were well developed throughout the trilogy, and by the time I saw ROTK, I knew them pretty well. This is an example of fantastic story telling. I particularly liked the part toward the end where Frodo feels the ill effects of carrying the ring and is going to be a victim of greed, but Sam pulls him back from disaster. It stresses what kind of a selfless and devoted person Sam is, and how difficult the task of carrying the ring had been all along. Even Frodo had difficulty with it. The last scenes where everything is burning are out of this world. Now the (somewhat) negatives. I felt, as I did in Two Towers, that the story was sacrificed a bit to accommodate the special effects, the war, etc. The fighting got just a bit too long for me. I would have preferred to see more about the story- e.g. why did Arwyn (Liv Tyler) give up her immortality to marry Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen)? I would have liked to see more dialogues/interaction between good and evil (Gandalf and Saruman). We saw some of this in earlier LOTR movies, but it would have been nice to somehow bring those into the final movie. At the end when Aragorn marries Arwyn, it seems too sudden. Except for a few minor flaws this is a great movie, and a great trilogy. I hope it wins the Best Picture Oscar and possibly the Best Director Oscar too. When you consider the long list of people involved in the making of this film, this is a monumental achievement.
9.0~The Lord of the Rings and Howard Shore's Melodies lbrinton Sign in Permalink In December, 2003, J. R. R. Tolkien's last installment of The Lord of the Rings made its debut, with fans across the world swarming theaters to see Peter Jackson's inspired version of the film. In the film, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Jackson wanted Tolkien's writing to come to life. This was accomplished not only by means of the cinematography, special effects, and computer generated-imagery (CGI), but by means of an epic film score, which, according to Estelle R. Jorgensen, "assists the moviegoer to make connections between times and travel imaginatively through time, thereby bringing alive the past and imagined future in the present moment." (45). The audience is thrown from battle scene to battle scene riding on the back of Howard Shore's melodies; finally able to catch their breath as Shore's concluding score ends the first installment of The Lord of the Rings. Howard Shore created a masterpiece that was able to alternate completely between the pastoral, the romantic, the fight, and the epic.
5.0~Great visuals, not so great storytelling... NickFalk Sign in Permalink Return of the King - Special Extended Edition. While normally a person to find enjoyment in both fantasy and science-fiction, I am one of the few who haven't really enjoyed Jackson's earlier takes on the Tolkien masterpiece I had less than stellar expectations. The film however did kick off on a promising note and for the first hour or so I was having a pretty decent time. After a while though my mind started to wander and after another hour I couldn't really care less about what happened to the characters. What is it that makes me so indifferent to these characters? I believe the whole thing boils down to Jackson's storytelling. At his best when he can wield his mighty camera over vast landscapes, showing off weird and wonderful creatures and humongous armies. He seems a lot less comfortable when dealing with human (hobbit, dwarfish, elfish) interaction on a smaller level. Unfortunately this somewhat spills over too the battle-scenes as well, and any enjoyment is purely on the visual side. Yes, the spectacle is certainly great - but it is still JUST spectacle. Another problem is that the actors are for the most part delivering speeches rather than having conversations. It makes the whole thing stale and the characters less life-like. On a positive note Jackson and his editors have improved the flow between the different story lines since the last film. The effects are mostly top-notch as is the production-design. Unfortunately it is let down by a director who seems to be bellowing, "look what I can do" to at all times. This "more is more"-style served him well in his earlier work but it's just a bit too shallow to do a justice to a story of this scale. All in all not horrible, but certainly not the film to end all films... 5/10
10.0~stunning. phery_dust Sign in Permalink saw it. loved it... ditto to the rest of the comments. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King--is God in movie land. No doubt that this movie will live on forever in the minds of many, and in the hearts of many girls, mine included---star wars, star trek...step aside, the era of the Rings has come and no one can put a stop to it. Space and time is over, ladies and gentlemen... get ready for arrows, swords, battles, love stories galore! This is one of those films that comes only once a blue moon and it is indeed a joy to see it in our lifetime.So sit back, enjoy and come to realize that this film is for the truly dedicated...you can't handle 3 hours? well then, the exit is to your left. sorry you're missing out. Finally..."now come the days of the king! May they be blessed."

10.0~Great movie! nemanja_i23 Sign in Permalink Love them all. Great movie and story! Action, magic and drama. The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent.I am a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them.Frodo Baggins and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum. Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orc.Peter Jackson has done it. He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, I've never seen a series like this. I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience.As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson
10.0~Not only the best trilogy... kyln2050 Sign in Permalink The lord of the rings is without a doubt the greatest film ever made the acting, the effects, the scenery, the music, the directing.. when i was heading for the theatre with my brother i knew what i was expecting, I was right. i went out of the theatre feeling a great deal of emotion. and frankly if was living now in the 50s, i would have agreed with what Tolkien said after the release of the books when he said that no one could make a film out of this. at the time obviously that would be true but then came SIR peter Jackson and created something so incredibly special. so to make a long story short the LOTR is the without a doubt the Best 11 HR AND 21 MIN movie of all time!!! A++++ 10/10
10.0~Didn't think it could get any better? Necara Sign in Permalink Well....Wow. My mind is still spinning, and I know I probably wont sleep tonight. The awsome power of it is unbelieveable. If you havent yet seen it, drop what you are doing now and run as fast as you can to the nearest theatre playing at that moment! I know that I will watch it again countless times, but I wish I could relive that first time again and again!
10.0~Simply Glorious... albator-1 Sign in Permalink That is the best movie I've ever seen I think in my entire life. It take me a full 20 minutes after the end of the movie to recover. I was simply speechless. WOW, What a movie. The emotions in the movie are so thick, it is simply amazing. Special effect are super and the acting is out of this world. Thanks Mr. Jackson, all the actors and the crew. That's a wonderfull gift.
10.0~Visually and auditorily stunning masterpiece rodericko Sign in Permalink The film lays some claim to being the best fantasy film ever created. It is visually and auditorily stunning. This epic adventure is of gargantuan proportions and carefully crafts a crescendo in tensions where good only triumphs over evil at the last and against overwhelming odds in the world of middle earth. The scene of one of the later battles involving the elephantine creatures provides an almost overwhelming sensory input when watched in a well set up theatre environment. The multi-dimensionality of the characters, landscape and the forces on both side creates a beautiful complexity which captures the imagination and adds to the emotional impact of the film. Masterpiece.
10.0~An unbelievable work of magic by Peter Jackson! diva_chic2188 Sign in Permalink Of all the movies, I must say that this had the best visual effects. This was my most beloved book and to see it come to life on screen was absolutely amazing. Peter Jackson, once again, worked his magic. The characters are still as amazing as ever. Legolas has incredible stunts that make you want to stand up and cheer. Eowyn becomes a hero. Merry and Pippin aren't up to there usual mischief. Gandalf is as awesome as ever. Aragorn is a very important role in the film. Gimli still brings some comic relief into the film. And Arwen is still as fair as ever. This film is a must see by all lovers of Tolkien, although you must expect to see a few scenes missing (the Houses of Healing, the Scouring of the Shire, and a couple others). It goes without saying that Peter Jackson brought home the gold with this one...literally. He won best director at the Golden Globes and the film won Best Dramatic Film at the Golden Globes. Now, they need to bring home the little bald guy (Oscars) on February 29, 2004. Film rating: 10/10
9.0~Too much left out irinjal Sign in Permalink I have been an avid fan of Jackson's LOTR trilogy. This is despite the fact that I was only partially impressed by Tolkien's book which I read years ago. However I must say that there are a few serious problems with ROTK. And the sad thing is, it could have been avoided so easily. The problem is simple - too many important scenes have been edited out and a few trivial scenes have found their way into the film. Now, I am not complaining about the ending (it was appropriate for a trilogy this grand), Pelennor battle or the Sam/Frodo scenes. The trivial parts were the Osigiliath battle when Faramir's party is routed, Galadriel appearing infront of Frodo (after tunnel scene), Frodo hanging onto the cliff in the climax, Arwen's mortality etc.. I can easily cite a few more examples. These scenes contributed nothing to the film except for a few thrills in the first viewing. Repeat viewing will show viewers the utter banality of these parts in the movie. The movie badly missed Saruman, resolution of the love triangle between Aragorn/Arwen/Eowyn and Eowyn's determination to follow Aragorn through the paths of the dead. But the powerplay between Gollum and Sam was brilliant and totally unexpected. As good as the change (in the first movie) where Arwen saved Frodo. Going by the previous EE DVDs, there is every chance that these mistakes become less prominent. However, that will be an entirely new movie. As it is, I must say that the theatrical release of ROTK is not upto the standard set by 'Fellowship' & (to a lesser extent) 'Towers' in being consistent and whole. I give it an 8 out of 10.
10.0~Simply incredible. lucasrundle07 Sign in Permalink This is the perfect way to conclude, in my opinion, the best trilogy of all time. If your looking for a gripping, emotional and action packed fantasy adventure then this is your perfect film. Everything in this film is outstanding. such as the acting, which is dominated by performances by Sean Astin and Viggo Mortensen. Sean Astin puts in deep emotion and conveys the character of Sam expertly. Viggo Mortensen has become the star of the film, more so than Elija Wood as Frodo and even Ian Mckellen as Gandalf. In addition to this the story line of this film is so easy to fall in to due to the excitement. Many people complain that the film is too long and it is true that the film is very long at nearly three and a half hours,that is if you're watching the special extended edition. However I must say that this film didn't feel too long at all as soon enough after watching you will become lost in the sheer awesomeness that is The Return Of The King. Once again, as he has done in many films before this, Howard Shore creates an exceptional score which provides anything from chills goosebumps and tears to those watching the film. If I was to describe the film with one word the word would be Outstanding. Ifyou have not seen this film already I would highly recommend it as it has been, for a long time, considered the best film of all time by myself and thousands of others.
9.0~Um bom filme jeffyter Sign in Permalink Efeitos Especiais para o período são absurdamente bons, além de um bom roteiro.
10.0~The Fellowship Complete jon.h.ochiai Sign in Permalink At the very end of Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", when the extraordinary Annie Lennox sings the beautiful song, "Into the West", it occurred to me that this is not just an end to the epic trilogy, rather it marks it's completion. The distinction being that this ambitious undertaking of J.R.R. Tolkien's story of Middle Earth is now whole and complete. We have witnessed the transformation of the story's characters, be it Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), or Gandalf (Ian McKellen). They are not the same characters that we saw in "The Fellowship of the Ring". Jackson has powerfully told a tale of the cost of doing what is right in one's heart, of courage, of loyalty, and of love. And I say this not having read the Tolkien books. Though I appreciate and respect that Tolkien is the Shakespeare of a specific generation. In Minas Tirith preparing for the final battle, an aging and worn Wizard Gandalf tells his charge Pippin, who fears death in the coming war, "End? No, the journey doesn't end here. There is another path; one that we all must take..." Ultimately, "Return of the King" is about having faith, and that things work out just the way they do. Director Peter Jackson along with screen writers Frances Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, and Jackson himself are the master storytellers of the tech era. Unlike some other trilogies (or ones yet to be completed), Jackson and crew weave a tapestry of spectacular visual effects and cutting edge CGI, with a transparent narrative style, and stunning acting throughout. Jackson's art is one of balance in the realm of apparent chaos. "Return of the King" starts where "Two Towers" ended. We have an insight into Gollum (Andy Serkis) who is guiding Frodo and Sam to Mount Doom to destroy The Ring; thus, ending Sauron's reign over Middle Earth. Aragorn and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) must find the mysterious army in the Cursed Mountians to battle Sauron's legions. They are all willing to sacrifice their lives to distract the Eye of Sauron, so that Frodo can destroy the Ring. We also discover that Arwen (Liv Tyler) has forsaken her Elf immortality to be with her love, Aragorn. Credit Jackson and his actors for providing a believable evolution of the story's characters. In "Return of the King" Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn truly becomes regal, and the charismatic leader of men. Mortensen has powerful screen presence, and has a calmness about him that is noble and just. Elijah Wood's Frodo constantly fights the seductive power of The Ring. Wood has a great innocence and drive that works in the role. Sean Astin as Sam really emerges as the movie's hero. Astin's performance is strong and provides the movie's heart. He brings an authenticity to Sam's selflessness and humanity. Astin's performance deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The one actor under used in this all is Liv Tyler-- she had little to do here and in the last movie. This is shame being that she is a talented actress. Peter Jackson is truly to be acknowledged for completing an epic tale with "Return of the King", and for the entire "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. This is a historic feat, and his work will be enjoyed for generation to come. I will miss seeing the annual "Lord of the Rings" movie at Christmases. I will also look forward to Jackson's next screen project.
10.0~A film ahead of its time, Lord of The Rings The Return Of the King is the best thing I have ever seen... mithilbhoras-103-581296 Sign in Permalink Even after the second installment's grand success, I was still afraid that it will fail. The trailer was brilliant and promised a thousands things to come. And then in the next 3 and a half hours, I was proved wrong! This was the best conclusion to a great trilogy. I never imagined that they could make it bigger and better than the last two. The previous movies were just picnic. Not only the action sequences but also the emotions run high. The battle scenes were really great. But I was more concerned about the people we knew from the last two films who were in it. You really get that feeling of "The Return". Unlike the first two, this movie is stylish. The elements are more elegant, the story more bold, the score more experienced and bold and the dangers more troublesome. As Frodo and Sam march towards Mount Doom, the movie gets more darker and hope really seems to fade away. One thing I learned in this movie is: Never give up. No matter what happens you have to finish the task because your cause is important. For me and all the LOTR fans, this is not a movie. What we thought of as an action movie-of-the-week turned out to be an important lesson on hope, friendship, conquering your fears and love. It's a cinematic achievement that will never be defeated. This really is the king of all movies and the 11 golden statues prove it. Go for it (Only if you have seen the first two movies) 10/10
10.0~My honest opinion on this movie... Queen Claire Sign in Permalink How could anyone put into words a description of this movie? It may sound sad but it touched me so much I was in tears for an hour after I saw it. It was the most touching, heartfelt, spectacular, story I have ever seen in the Cinema that I don't think even the words I used just now do it justice... All I have to say is it is DEFINITELY the best for last, the special effects and stunt work was beyond this world and just the way everything flowed and how true the characters were was just magical to watch! If I had to recommend this, I would say GO AND SEE IT MORE THAN 5 TIMES!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!
6.0~Effective But Bloated, The King Could Stand to Shed a Few Pounds drqshadow-reviews Sign in Permalink For as little as this film has to work with, plot wise, there's really no excuse for how long it clings to the screen. Really, in the grand scheme of things, what does it accomplish? A big battle scene to preserve the sacred city of Gondor, a recruitment drive in the land of the dead to facilitate the former, Frodo and Sam's arrival at Mordor and the big finale at the lava pit. Some exposition can be expected, naturally, and in a few scattered cases it does serve to enrich the extended universe, but for those four primary points to devour over four hours of screen time seems ridiculously excessive. The wealth of character moments on display in Return of the King are generally well done, but rarely do they feel as essential as they did in previous chapters. With very little exception, the primary cast has already worked through their individual arcs before the title card, so there isn't much meat in that respect. As with The Two Towers, the fight scenes (scattered liberally throughout) are appropriately epic and pulse-pounding, though these too push the limits in terms of what the viewing audience is willing to let slide. We're already suspending our disbelief a fair distance in regards to the fellowship's universal fighting prowess, but one particular scene with Legolas and an elephant seems more than a bit excessive. In fact, Legolas is granted an especially silly amount of battlefield respect throughout the series. I could dwell on the negatives all day long - I haven't even touched on the stupid amount of slow motion in the farewell scenes - but at the end of the day, this really isn't a bad film just a madly bloated one. It's thoroughly rewarding to finally conclude our journey with the residents of Middle Earth, and when the plot finally gets around to waving goodbye it's a powerful experience. I just can't help but wonder how much better a slim two-hour cut, trimming off half the body fat of the original, would play to the same material. Oh, and its status as a Best Picture winner? Clearly that was a lifetime achievement award for the trilogy at large, because The King is far and away LOTR's weakest installment.
10.0~the best of the best!!! paloma_ad335 Sign in Permalink Is the best movie in the world, it's wonderfull, beautifull, perfect... everything it's amazing. There is not mistake to me. You have to see this movie. Everithing it's perfect. There's no words to can discribe what are you belive in that moment because you can't belive it. The best in the movie it's Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen and there's also Elijah Wood, but don't forget then that it's for the ladies... and for the gentleman... Lyv Tyler and Cate Blanchett. And remember if you are not see this movie ... you have to see it!!!
5.0~Middle of the road. surfchick2 Sign in Permalink This film was compelling - it kept you watching. The spectacular backgrounds and both strange and interesting characters are all attractions. But the storyline is basically rubbish. I haven't read the books myself, but can only imagine them to be terrible as the story by itself is poor, and only works with the images to support it. This story is fantasy that isn't quite convincing. I didn't feel that you got to know the characters at all which made you feel distant from what was happening. I'm not a particular fan of this genre, but it can be effective if it convinces you that you are there and that it is real. I would watch this film, purely as something to fill a couple of hours. Long movies are always hard to keep at a good standard the whole way through and often drop down in your ratings, within the last half hour. This is why I give it a 5, because it really is in the middle. Nothing very bad, just nothing to shout about.
9.0~My word... stuart_hza Sign in Permalink One can't do a film like this justice by reviewing it. Every attempt to capture the experience in words falls flat. This is the best film I have ever seen in my life. Awesome. Simply Awesome.
10.0~Phenomenal and unparalleled BradleyHarris Sign in Permalink Let me assure you, anyone who says Return of the King was anything less than extraordinary is merely disagreeing to be different. This was by far the best film I have ever seen, the best story, the best acting, the best CGI, it made me laugh, cry, sob, shake with fear, it is and always will be a cinematic phenomenon, it will remain unparalleled until Hollywood crumbles and falls. there will never be a film as great as this. There is emotion in every camera shot and every syllable of dialogue. The music is extraordinary and could tell the story unaided. It is better than one and two combined.
10.0~Fantastic r-hale Sign in Permalink Technically brilliant...an amazing movie from start to finish. The extra scenes added in the extended version round this movie out and create a well-rounded and exceptional movie that should be enjoyable for all fans of the book and all moviegoers. The visual and computer-added effects are breathtaking and the seamless integration between live-action and blue-screen development is astounding. Weta has out-done itself in this, the third of the trilogy. Use of miniatures and 'big-atures' reach a new level of sophistication in the use of sets and creatures. The depictations of Minas Tirith & Orthanc are so realistic as to suspend disbelief in the audiences awareness of reality and encourages the belief in the 'history' of Middle Earth as to the 'fantasy'. The use of skilfully placed camera angles is flawless and heightens tension of the feature's atmosphere.
10.0~Absolutely Fantastic Godman66 Sign in Permalink One of the best of all-time, if not THE best. Absolutely amazing. Better than the first two movies, by FAR. Should be Best Picture winner at Oscars and at Golden Globes. I'd sit through it again and again and again.
10.0~This film completes a whole story magpie930 Sign in Permalink Being a great fan of the book, I always struggle to reconcile my vision with Peter Jackson's version. It never happened completely in The Two Towers. And I left my first viewing of Return of the King dazed, stunned, overwhelmed, but unsure whether I liked it or not. After seeing it a second time, I was no longer unsure. I started to understand that these movies do not stand alone, and Return of the King completes Jackson's version of the myth of Tolkien's Middle-earth. There was a depth of story and soundtrack that made it separate from the books in such a way that I could enjoy it. And enjoy it I did. The cinematography was breathtaking at times; the character development tender (how did they get Gandalf's hand on Pippin's face to be so believable?); and the scenes we expected surprising none the less. 10!
10.0~Staggering andyhise Sign in Permalink I couldn't do this justice, so I'm not going to try ;-) I have to write four lines, otherwise the site won't accept the review. So here they are ... Believe What Everyone Says
8.0~The Lord of the Rings marisolarubio Sign in Permalink Watching this movie for the first time I thought it was a great adaptation of the series. I was drawn in by the dynamic visuals and story line. I love the Lord of the Rings serious and was not disappointed after watching this continuation of the series. I also love the action sequences in the film and the special effects creations like Gollum, who appears real on the screen. The final battle scene is also a magnificent piece in the movie which allows the viewer an up close and personal encounter to action taking place. As they emerge on the city with a battering ram, I was drawn into the scene as it was unfolding and was in total amazement as the imagination of the writer was captured on the screen.
10.0~Saw it Wednesday and Thursday night. walstib1977 Sign in Permalink Funny thing about seeing it twice in two nights was the fact that I became emotional at different parts of the movie. Yup, tears down the face emotional. And how about Legolas and the Oliphant. Gandalfs priceless facial expressions. Prediction: Best Movie, Best Supporting Actor (McKellan). We all need a Samwise Gamgee in our lives.
9.0~Easily the strongest of the trilogy Nigel St. Buggering Sign in Permalink Let's start with my general perspective. I do not believe that The Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest works of literature ever created. I do not believe that either of the two previous films are among the greatest cinematic achievements of all time. If you haven't stormed off yet, then you're prepared for the rest of the review. "Return of the King" is brilliant in almost every particular. It is not only the best of the three films, but almost certainly the greatest sword-and-sorcery film ever made (admittedly, that's faint praise when you consider its company). Now personally, I felt that "Fellowship" was a great fantasy film, though not quite deserving of the fan worship heaped upon it. I found "The Two Towers" rather ponderous and tedious (and like the book upon which it's based, plotless and motionless), and nowhere near deserving of the fan worship heaped upon it. But here, finally, we have a film that deserves very nearly every bit of fan worship which will no doubt be heaped upon it. As with Tolkien's book, what makes "Return of the King" so much more effective than its predecessors is sheer momentum. With the end finally in sight, events pick up speed and urgency. Where "Towers" seemed simply to be a placeholder in the saga, here events are constantly evolving and developing, and the characters develop with them. The feel of the totality of the journey is particularly telling in the scenes with Frodo and Sam. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin do superb work in communicating their weariness and despair, as every step they take in the final act is agonizing to watch. Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill repeat the excellent work that almost single-handedly redeemed "The Two Towers". And what more can one say about Gollum? Jackson allows the story to scale back its sympathy for the character here, revealing his sordid origins, and skillfully turning the audience against him. While Andy Serkis and the effects team receive great praise for their work, and deservedly, attention must once again be turned to Wood and Astin; if not for their genuine performances in reacting to the character, he simply would not work. The action sequences here are breathtaking; some of the best since "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Though some go gleefully over the top, these moments are hard-earned, and they work. The massive effects work is not entirely seamless, but the sheer ambition and scale of it all makes it forgivable. Of course, it's rare that everything in a film works. Howard Shore's score again fails to do anything very new. His excellent work on "Fellowship" has simply been repeated and continued through "Towers" and "King", adding nothing very much to the mix. And then there are the endings...yes, one after another after another, as if the film-makers cannot bear to let go. While I'm sure that many ringies feel the same way, couldn't some of this have waited for the extended edition DVD? It almost starts being funny after a while. Still, these problems detract only slightly from what is, after all, a truly monumental achievement. Jackson and company are to be commended for their perseverance in crafting one of the great film epics, both in this film as an individual, and series in general. Hopefully, this will jump-start filmed fantasy in the way that "Star Wars" jumped science fiction in the 70's and 80's. God knows fantasy can use the help.
10.0~Terrific third movie for a glorious trilogy flashheart Sign in Permalink In every trilogy the third was not the strongest, mostly the first, sometimes the second. But in the LOTR it's the third film that is the best, the strongest and the greatest one. A terrific climax and a beautiful ending. But it was sad, because there will be no LOTR next year:-(. Everything that has a beginning has an end. In my comment for Matrix Revolutions, I said that the Matrix failed where LOTR will succeed. I've never been SO right in my whole life. The movie is one whole thrill. 3 hours and of suspense, darkness, and despair and the resting 20 minutes were just beautiful and gave the movie a perfect ending. But there is always hope, a light at the end of the tunnel. The special effects were the best ever. The battle in Minas Tirith, the battle at the Black Gate and the fight between Frodo, Sam and Shelob. Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions were also breathtaking, but they overwhelmed the characters, the characters in LOTR stay strong and stronger than ever, especially Aragorn, Sam, Gollum and Frodo. I watched the movie twice and there were two scenes that made my flesh creep, the Rohirrim attacking the Orcs, and a silent Shelob behind Frodo (really spooky). The battle and the nature of good and evil have never been so deep, amazing and beautiful as before. But I was totally satisfied at the end, where Sam says his last line. The last line in the film was the same last line as in the book. Then I went back to my home, never been so happy. 10/10
10.0~The Film of the Century alejo2k Sign in Permalink When I refer to this as the film of the century I'm talking about the whole trilogy, because that's what it really is, just as it was a single big book before its big screen treatment. I think anyone can write volumes about how great the film is in every aspect: acting, script, photography, costumes, special FX, etc. I think it's a waste of words because the film speaks for itself in all its spectacular grandeur. Nothing that can be said would describe it accurately. Just go see it if you haven't. It is sure to be a real classic that will be talked about for many decades to come, and the reason is very simple: it has no time, no space. It is all about one message, one of good overcoming evil, and friendship, and unity between all the peoples in the world, therefore there will always be need for these stories and they will never fade from our minds -to quote the film- "as long as there's good in this world that's worth fighting for".
8.0~The Best Experience I Had In A Theater paulfischer207 Sign in Permalink It went til 3:30 AM but that didn't matter. It was quite exciting (and terrifying, where's the R rating I wonder?) and carried a lot of emotional weight. Elijah Wood shows his true capabilities as an actor in the latter half of this film, expecially at Mount Doom. The 3 hour+ running time may numb your bum but not your attention.
10.0~If only there was a score of 11! MinorityReporter Sign in Permalink So The Lord of the Rings comes to its inevitable conclusion and shatters the so-called rule of three where a third film dramatically reduces in quality (e.g. Terminator 3 or The Godfather Part III), for The Return of the King is simply breathtaking in any- and every way imaginable. Peter Jackson's genius is with this film underlined in a way no-one could have imagined. Both the majority of the critics and general audience agrees that this is the best of the Lord of the Rings series and I would have to agree. In terms of general film making the Return of the King is by far the best of the series. The narrative structure is flawless, the acting is undoubtedly the best of the series and the effects are brilliant and are even today, three years later, better than anything we see in the new films. In short, this is the film to watch and it is a mistake if you haven't already. As I said the acting is the best of the series which, when you think about it, makes complete sense as the characters have become more and more interesting throughout the first two movies obviously because of the amount of things they experience. Elijah Wood does an incredible job with his character and during some scenes the character I remembered from the book really came to life. Especially his eyes are extremely expressive and has a somewhat haunted look to them which is very appropriate to the character. Viggo Mortensen does an equally impressive job with his character and you really see the changes in the character as he gradually accepts who he is. Ian McKellen who had been absent throughout the most of the previous movie makes a welcome return as one of the chief characters and while I prefer his performance as Gandalf the Grey his performance in this film is staggering as well. The supporting cast is only a few steps short of brilliant once again. Sean Astin, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan all do exceptional jobs with their characters who have all turned towards the more serious and they handle these changes very well. Bernard Hill does a great job as well and David Wenham makes the character of Faramir closer to the one we remember from the book (his character was the subject of much critique in the second film). Andy Serkis has to be mentioned as well because the job he did with Gollum was brilliant. In short brilliant acting. The effects are of course better than ever and with this movie Peter Jackson usurps the title of King of the Effects from George Lucas' grasp. Not only are the effects brilliant they also seem to blend seamlessly with actors and the environment which means that some effects are overlooked as effects because they almost seem to real to be effects. This is achieved by a very healthy balance between actual real life effects and computer effects. The Gollum character is an excellent example as they first Serkis' movements and interactions as a reference point and then add the Gollum character afterwards and this is done in such a seamless way that you sometimes take for granted the enormous amount of work going into making the character work. The action effects are still completely brilliant and jaw-dropping, and considering how high the bar was from the battle for Helm's Deep in the previous movie that is quite an accomplishment. In connection to this we get some previously unseen stunts that make all involved in the battle scenes seem even more skilled. The film is as most people know almost 3½ hours long and some people have claimed that the film dragged. Particularly towards the ending. With the chance of sounding arrogant that is an ignorant conclusion. The series is comprised of three movies each over three hours in length. With that amount of material there will obviously be a lot of loose ends that must be tied up in a satisfactory manner and some 10 minute ending would undoubtedly seem hurried and far fetched. Peter Jackson sticks to his ending and so do I. The fact that the film is so long is in my opinion countered by an impeccable pacing so you don't really think that your watching a 3½ hour movie. In terms of film-making this is the ultimate film which mixes good acting with brilliant effects and a eternally interesting story. In fact in terms of form and style this is probably the best film ever made and it certainly deserved every award it was given. 10/10 - my all time favorite movie.
10.0~Give the man what he deserves joe_neuenfeldt32 Sign in Permalink After viewing 'The Return of the King' it is clear that one character has been the heart of each movie, and that is Samwise (played by Sean Astin). Now that wouldn't be that big an accomplishment if this were an ordinary movie or movie's. But these are 3 of the biggest movies of all time, and the only thing keeping them from being solely wonders in visual effects is the emotion felt in each movie. Sam is the hero in ROTK and carries the film. So the Academy should give Sean Astin what he deserves and nominate him for the Oscar for supporting actor. Anyone who has seen the film know the reasons why he has earned it. It must be difficult to play an emotional character like Sam, but imagine doing so when nearly all of your scenes are against computer generated images. Whereas Frodo would not have succeeded without Sam, Elijah Wood would have been nothing without Sean Astin. So let's do the right thing this time Academy and not the the crappy Golden Globes dictate what you do. It's time to honor Lord of the Rings with the Best Picture Oscar, Best Director Oscar and Best Suppporting Actor Oscar for Sean Astin. Lord of the Rings should have won in 2001 and 2002. Peter Jackson should have won both years also. But instead the less than mediocre 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'Chicago' won just like the Golden Globes. The Academy also had a chance to do something original at last years awards. They could have been the first awards show to nominate a cgi character (Gollum played marvelously by Andy Serkis). But instead they opted to follow the Golden Globes and nominate 4 out of the 5 that were nominated for the globes. So what will the Academy do this year? Are they simply going to give the award to 'Cold Mountain' since it got the most globe nominations? Or maybe Peter Jackson will be snubbed again by the Academy since one nomination 2 years ago was enough. Is Sean Astin a big enough name for the Academy to honor (Seriously, William H. Macy in Seabiscuit. I liked the movie but it's not nearly his best work)? It's time for the Academy to step up and show why their award show is taken seriously and the Golden Globes are simply a joke (Anything that nominates Billy Bob Thornton for 'Bad Santa' or Goldie Hawn for 'The Banger Sisters'(2002) should not be considered anything but a joke). Honor the cast and crew of the greatest trilogy ever made with a victory. Nominations aren't enough anymore. It's time for a 'fantasy' type movie to win. If far below average dramas (A Beautiful Mind) and very mediocre musicals (Chicago) can win, then there is no reason why a nearly flawless in every way fantasy movie can't win. I guess it's time to see if the Academy Awards should be taken seriously.
10.0~The best of the trilogy ,watch the extended DVDs or you miss out. BigWhiskers Sign in Permalink The best , better than the three films ranked above it in the IMDb. Sorry godfather fans but I hated the godfather and do not think it belongs in the top 10 let alone the farce of being number one.Anyways,I got my hands on the extended edition DVDs of ROTK and there is so much extra stuff.The main thing left out of the theatrical release that I wanted to see was the final fate of Saruman.It is included in the extended edition but it doesn't follow the books version. In the book after the ring was destroyed,Saruman had fled out of Isengard and came to the Shire with Grima Wormtongue ,there they tried to take over the Shire with the help of some ruffians and orcs , they were defeated by hobbits led by Merry and Pippin in what was called The Battle Of Bywater.Frodo confronted the defeated Saruman who was brought to BagEnd and banished him from the Shire .However as Saruman was leaving he berated Grima one last time which sent Grima over the edge with hatred, he came up behind Saruman and slit his throat and before Frodo could stop them ,some other hobbits shot Grima dead with arrows. In the extended edition of the movie, Gandalf,Aragorn,Gimli,Legolas and King Theoden arrive at Isengard where they are greeted by Merry and Pippin ,there is some small talk and then a conversation between Gandalf and Treebeard.Saruman then appears from the top of his tower with Grima behind him. He sends fire down at Gandalf who repels it and breaks Sarumans staff, King Theoden then tells Grima that he can come back to Rohan and all is forgiven ,to start a new life. Saruman then berates Grima as useless fodder and shoves him to the ground. Grima then gets angry and stabs Saruman in the back,he falls off the tower and gets impaled on a waterwheel that drags him under the water. Legolas shoots Grima with an arrow killing him. I liked the books ending better ,Peter Jackson evidently thought a major battle at the end of the movie would have been too much excess so he left out the Battle of Bywater much to the chagrin of fans and changed Sarumans death scene,Christoper Lee was majorly po'ed when it was cut out of the theatrical release-I would have been too as he was also cut from the ending credits in the theatrical release,he does however get credit in t he extended edition credits. That scene being cut out was one thing I didn't understand,the scene was no more than ten minutes long but Peter Jackson said that the scene was cut out due to time constraints and pacing, I don't buy that B/S - Saruman was a major player in the books and that scene should have been included in the theatrical release. I think some Hollywood politics were going on and someone just didn't like Mr Lee being in the third movie- there were rumors that Peter Jackson did not get along with Mr Lee and so he decided to cut Mr Lee out of ROTKs theatrical release,Brad Dourif also got the snub from the theatrical release. Oh well, the film is just pure wonder,top notch acting and incredible special effects,the battle scenes alone are worth watching the 4 plus hrs of extras. If you haven't already, go buy the extended edition ,its filled with goodies and extras including the Wellington parade and world premiere event , with clips and video of the stars walking down the street signing autographs.Enjoy LOTR fans
10.0~A Great End to A Great Film kaiminc Sign in Permalink I thought the ending perfectly captures the spirit of Tolkien's greatest work - it brought tears to many in the theater where I was sitting. What a way to end probably the most enduring of modern film classics and epics. The battle scenes were incredible to say the least - what else can I say that have not been said by others! For good measure, I brought a buddy who had not watch any movie for years and by the end, he said he's got to watch parts 1 & 2 and 3 (again) - that's how good ROTK was. A movie to end all movies.
8.0~The end of the Journey agmoldham Sign in Permalink The journey comes to an end. For me the final installment ensures that the Lord of the Rings replaces Star Wars as my favourite fantasy movie franchise. In time the film will look dated, but the story and characterisation far surpass that of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back is the only one of the Star Wars films that is in the same league as LOR. As with Two Towers, the Return of the King doesn't recap the story so far, so don't even think of seeing this film if you're unfamiliar with the story. It starts with a flashback to Smeagol and means Andy Serkis gets to appear on the finished print. Frodo, Sam and Smeagol then continue on their quest, whilst the remaining members of the fellowship are briefly reunited at Isengard before taking different paths to Minas Tirith. The action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time is over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets, models and cgi brings middle earth to life. I suspect quite a few of the performers will be in with a chance of Oscar recognition. Miranda Otto is the stand out performer and is outstanding as Eowyn and surely deserves the Best Supporting Actress honour. I'm sure that Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Orlando Bloom will all have their supporters for acting honours and rightly so, as they all put in fine performances. I'm not sure whether Andy Serkis is elligable, but I suspect the success of Smeagol/Gollum owes as much to him as the animators. Bernhard Hill should also be in with a shout for recognition for his performance as King Theoden. My guess is that it'll miss out on the acting awards with the exception of Miranda Otto. It's absolutely certain to take Best Director, Best Picture and a string of technical awards though. My guess is that it will be nominated for about 12 categories and take 8 gongs. Return of the King isn't flawless however. Saruman was cut entirely from the theatrical release of the film. We therefore missed out on the final face off between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard. This was certainly filmed and will no doubt be on the extended edition. When the Hobbits return to the Shire it looks remarkably like when they left. No sign that Saruman has arrived back before them and taken over. In the book Merry, Pippin, Sam and Frodo help rally the rest of the Hobbits to retake the Shire, but at some cost to both the hobbits and the environment. Merry, Pippin and Sam become heros to the rest of the hobbits who are largely unaware of Frodo's adventure and exploits. I'm not sure if any of this was shot, but it would be a welcome addition to the extended addition. Personally I would have followed Tolkien and got rid of 7 minutes of Arwen footage and kept Saruman in. Bearing in mind Christopher Lee's passion for the trilogy it is also sad to see him removed from the final episode. I'm quite sure Peter Jackson must have had a few sleepless nights over that decision. If Saruman's exclusion was the biggest blunder of the film, Gimli's consignment to comic interlude was also a bit disappointing. I'm not against a bit of light hearted relief every so often, especially in such a long film, but it seemed that every time Gimli appeared on screen it was for light entertainment. The "That still only counts as one" line to Legolas was very funny though. Despite these gripes Peter Jackson can certainly be very proud of the Lord of the Rings. Very few people thought it possible to do justice to the book. He has crafted a film that many people will enjoy for many years.
1.0~bad, bad, movie. Ughh. bettyville Sign in Permalink This movie sucks. Really hard. How it beat lost in translation I will never know. 11 Oscars, really, even best song. Huh? Is that right. Acting, Good? Nah. Sean Austin deserved the best supporting? Really, Can't be. No. Oh good. People are blinded by it's bland CG effect (OK, Gollum looked great, but the battle scenes, weak). Take off the blindfold and realize that it is not good. I am sad that this movie is second highest grossing of all time. Yeah, I know what your thinking, I saw it. And I saw the other two. The fellowship of the ring was good, but the this and the two towers stunk. Really bad. Naughty Peter Jackson, Naughty. Go sit in the corner.
10.0~A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Best Picture of the Year!!!!!(spoilers ahead) thereturnoftheking Sign in Permalink Simply one word describes The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King...pure and simple MASTERPIECE!!!!! This movie was a revelation in film. From the second that I saw the New Line Cinema logo and heard the undeniable Lord of the Rings music I was transfixed. The film starts off with a backstory of the sneaky, twisted, evil, and (in this film) unlikeable Gollum/Smeagol. It tells of how Deagol(Smeagol's brother) and Smeagol are fishing and when Deagol catches a fish it pulls him in and he is pulled through the water. Deagol finds the one ring and plans to keep it until Smeagol kills him for it. Then it shows how he became Gollum. Followed by a scene with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. Then it starts off the first scene with Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli with the words "The Return of the King" and then riding through Fangorn forest to Isengard. When they arrive they find Merry and Pippin and the place over-run by water and ruled by Treebeard. After Pippin finds the Palantir which Gandalf takes and hides, but back at Edoras Pippin steals it and looks into it being completely overwhelmed and nearly dead after seeing the great eye. Gandalf rides Pippin to Minas Tirith, city of kings, stronghold of Gondor. Soon after we go to Frodo believes that Sam wants to take the ring from him and so leaves him behind crying right after the Witch King leaves Minas Morgul and then Frodo and Gollum arrive in Shelob's tunnel where my attention was not dropped for the entire movie. The Battle of the Pellenor fields was so amazing and loud that I was vibrating in my chair at the theater. Mount Doom was a big and amazing scene. Terrifying, loud, beautiful, and heartbreaking. Frodo's one and despairing line which got me was, "The ring is mine." From then on I felt betrayed even though I had read the book. The movie had a bigger sense of danger, heartbreak, death, despair, and finality. I found myself crying from their entrance in the shire to the end. Probably the most amazing looking scene and the scene I was waiting for was right as soon as the ring was destroyed and Sauron went wild with anger, fear, and frustration. His eye moving wildly and the tower of Barad-Dur falling followed by the end with Sauron's shockwave goodbye. The wedding of Aragorn and Arwen as well the crowning was amazing. The grey havens was a beautiful place and a beautiful scene and I found myself crying my eyeballs to death in that scene as soon as Bilbo walked onto the ship I started crying because I knew what was coming and it was the end. The ending in the Shire with Sam was pivotal and key. If he hadn't said that one line the movie would have been ruined for me. "Well...I'm Back" This movie is unlikely to ever find an equal in all the rest of the world and I say that with the utmost confidence as The Return of the King came to a close I found myself to sadened for words or tears. It was the end of this epic journey of a life-time and I amazingly made it through it. Oh, no, I'm crying now. Must go, but with one last word. Of all the films to come out in the next five millenia The Return of the King will stay as number one for all eternity. Undoubtedly the only film in which you cannot say a single bad thing went wrong. MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....from Sean Astin's on target acting, to Ian McKellen's, to Viggo Mortensen's, to the heartbreak of failure the is Elijah Wood's Frodo King is a full blown MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10 stars **********
10.0~My opinion kjawesome6 Sign in Permalink This movie is the third of a trilogy which starts off with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and then The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and ended with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King which is what I am writing about now and I believe it was the best out of the three. It was intriguing and mysterious, which is what I enjoy when watching a movie. It goes for a fair amount of time just like the rest of the movies in the trilogy but it is worth it and you don't get bored unlike what you do in other movies that just go on forever about non-interesting things with no action. If you enjoyed this trilogy of The Lord of the Rings then I highly recommend you watch the trilogy of the Hobbits.
4.0~Such a disappointing journey TheOtherFool Sign in Permalink Considering the hype, box office numbers, Oscars and everything else, the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been for a lot of people the highlight of film making these last couple of years. And even without very much liking it, as a person who did not read the books and though I feel that everybody was just overdoing it, I must congratulate Peter Jackson and his team of cast and crew by accomplishing just that. Maybe, when things cool down a bit and other projects take their place in the spotlights, I can honestly get over the fact that all those people who think this is how movies should be, clearly outnumber the people like myself who see it as a good, but ultimately failed attempt on producing a wonderful trilogy from a no doubt inspiring book. Peter Jackson did not have an easy job by filming the trilogy, and I will give you an example on how to work with a silly part of the trilogy (I at least assume that the next passage is in the book somewhere as well). It's when Frodo is attacked by the huge spider, and taken to a castle of the orks (or similar nasty creatures). In the next scene, we see how 2 orks get into a fight over I think a piece of clothing. Everybody (that is, the other orks) have their say in it and a huge brawl starts. So when Sam comes to the castle to save his master Frodo, he finds thousands of Orks dead on the ground, only having to kill about 4 of them before getting to the top of the tower, where Frodo is held. Now, in any other movie that takes itself remotely serious, these events would be laughable, ridiculous, the movie would be slammed for it. But here comes the nice part: because it is 'in the book', Jackson gets away with these silly little facts. As he got away with the fact that the whole and entire army of Sauron go on and take on the army, not one noticing the two little hobbits and the creature called Gollem. And there are other examples, like the death and rise (apparently) from Gandalf in part 2, the oh-so easy defeat of Saruman when some silly looking trees come to action... the plot holes are endless. I will be clear: because of above reasons (amongst others), I do not think highly of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It started out with the rather boring Fellowship, went on with the loud but ultimately silly Two Towers, and ended with the incredibly disappointing and not satisfying Return of the King, the least of the three. It's too long, with lulls everywhere and a complete lack of decent acting because of the overuse of CGI. It's boring, silly and not to be taken seriously. It's, in one word, a drag, in particular for people who did not read the books, or didn't take much fun into them. So, in the end, there's a trilogy here that has ruled the box office and that special night somewhere in february nowadays, but I am not convinced one bit. And somehow I don't think I will be any time in the future... As for Return of the King: 4/10.
10.0~A Fabulous Film Magellan Grey Sign in Permalink Although I read the books many years ago, I have always had a fondness for the third book: Return of the King. Peter Jackson's treatment of the trilogy and the end story especially is something for future history. It is an extremely sensitive and insightful translation of the story from book to silver screen. I enjoyed every moment of it. The ending is a golden moment and the care and sweetness of the film ending does the book justice. This is film history. Congradulations Peter Jackson.
10.0~The Return Of The Movie We All Loved! Laerke-DK Sign in Permalink WAUW! First, to everyone, who hasn't seen it yet; WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GO AND BUY IT RIGHT NOW! I think that this movie probably is the best of the three "Lord Of The Rings"-movies! And it's just sad, that this were the last one.... But then we have an great excuse, to use 9 hours to watch movies! I love all three of the movies, and I don't think it's one of those movies that you get tired of, no, it's all about watching it again, ad again, and again! Love Lærke, DK
10.0~Wow juliebug04 Sign in Permalink This movie was amazing! Peter Jackson has a true vision and this entire trilogy was wonderful. Tolkien would be extremely proud. The only thing that bums me out now is the fact that there aren't any more to look forward to next year... How about making The Hobbit?
6.0~The solid ending to a good trilogy Horst_In_Translation Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", which sounds like a Robin Hood reference, is the final chapter to Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings"-series. It starts most of the cast from the two previous films and also the crew does not look that much different. What does look different is the awards output. While the first was really successful with the Academy and the second moderately, this one won 11 Oscars, all categories where it was nominated, but missed out on once category to be the alone record holder. This was maybe the cinematography category, where it wasn't even nominated surprisingly. Still, the Best Picture win and Director for Jackson should make up for it. The film features lots of Gollum again too. Actually, it starts with Smeagol, back when he was a human. Not much later we see the killing of Saruman, something we may have expected to be one of the final moments, but this happens, so that we see Sauron as the true antagonist of this film and the whole franchise. I found it a bit surprising as Saruman was definitely the main villain in the first two films, the first more than the second. Another thing I liked was the water reflection scene with Gollum/Smeagol. Nicely done here how his good side talks to his evil side. The film's central point is Minas Tirith, but I wasn't too thrilled by that. Scenes like Pippin's possible death with that fireball that he could not put away were more interesting and spectacular than the fight sequences. The part about Boromir's father and the fight for paternal love maybe helped the movie with its award ambitions as the topic is still relevant today, even if in a different manner. Other than that, the arguing between Sam and Gollum continues from the second movie. I just wonder why Sam would lay down so close to the abyss with Gollum around. Anyway, the scene where Frodo sends Sam away is one of the emotional highlights from the trilogy. Pretty sad. In addition to that, Frodo (before he meets the spider) screams Smeagol a couple times, then whispers Sam and realizes who his real friend is. The spider scene is really one of the most intense from all three movies. What a disgusting creature and a perfect moment to pick as it proves Gollum has been evil all the time and even a main antagonist to the two courageous Hobbits at the end. Later on, Sam appears to free Frodo from the Orc headquarter and I wondered a bit why Sam showed the ring to Frodo first. I'd have thought just get out of there guys and not stay there a second longer than you have to. In addition, a couple fathers are dying, good ones and bad ones, and the storyline with Miranda Otto's character is continued. I never found that particularly interesting though and the final chapter doesn't change that. I actually could have done without it in its entirety. Then also the film would not have dragged on some occasions. Finally we get a firework of lava as closure and a sequence which seemed more like a dream (where I thought something bad was about to happen), but it was real, including a final beautiful moment between Sam and Frodo. Astin was the MVP from the final film for me, maybe even the trilogy. If McKellen got an Oscar nomination for the Fellowship, Astin at least would have deserved one too here. Sadly he did not get any, but it was refreshing to see how he stole the films from all these established Hollywood actors being almost a no-name when the trilogy started. It would also have been a nice ending if the film had ended when they all bowed down to the four Hobbits, but it went on a bit afterward. We find out that the journey started 13 months ago and what happened to Bilbo in the meantime, pretty sad actually. The ending looked almost as if there would be a Sam sequel, but actually we got a Bilbo prequel in these last three years. Annie Lennox' song with the closing credits also won an Oscar for the Eurythmics singer (Enya was nominated two movies earlier) and while I thought it was okay, I believe she has done some better work in her career. All in all, I recommend watching this film/trilogy. I would not call it epic as many do, but it can provide for some nice entertainment and over eleven fantastic hours of film if you are into fantasy movies.
9.0~The battles are too long and the farewells too sentimental Dr_Coulardeau Sign in Permalink It is not the best episode though it is the crowning piece. Not the best because there are by far too many and too long battles which are quite repetitive in effects. But it is an essential episode to understand or extract some meaning in this fantasy. The vanity of the human king is turning criminal since he tries to burn his surviving son, who he does not like, alive. The hobbit Frodo who has been entrusted with the mission of carrying the ring back into the pit of hell is also shown as being vain somewhere in his mission. Vain because he believes he has been entrusted with this mission because he is special, though in fact it is the mission that is going to make him in the future somewhat special. Vain too because he does not understand he cannot succeed alone. And there the help of Sam is dramatically shown as essential to fulfill his mission, not to betray it, not to let some kind of disgusting being and a giant spider of the deep caves of earth distract him and rob him of the ring, which it actually does, and not to fall into the pit himself along with the underground traitor and the ring. But the lesson is more for us than for the hobbit himself since he does not seem to learn his simple lesson very easily. The main lesson is that a battle can only be won when everyone, including the dead come up and fight. This inclusion of the dead into the fight makes it slightly spectacular and is an allusion to Jesus and other Saviors who had to go down into the limbos or hell to do some salvaging with Adam and Eve or Euridyce. But the meaning  of the film  comes from some strong imagery used with a fair level of insistence. The world is cut in two. The dark forces of evil on one side to whom the ring has to be returned in order to be destroyed, and all the others representing light. Contrast between light and darkness, between underground traps, caves and tunnels and open air and countryside, between blue sky and very dark grey if not black sky, between the more or less civilized use of fire on the good side and its evil use on the bad side. The final battle is in front of the black gate that looks like a wall that finally crumbles and sinks into the ground at the end like some other wall fell in 1989. That can only be a modern vision since when the books were written the wall in question did not even stand. Since then this image has been turned around since two walls are being built but no longer by the forces of the east or the north, but by the forces of the west, one in Palestine and the other along Mexico's northern border (in that case the north is not supposed to be the bad side, and yet). History is twisty at times. The books were written during the Cold War and they represent this vision of the time of a world cut in two, black and white, etc. This today has changed too and this simple splitting of reality in two does not correspond to reality though it is still very active in the minds of people who still think a lot on an either/or line. So today, what used to be the reflection of cold war fear becomes rather simplistic and we experience everyday how this approach of the world and life leads to catastrophes and other swampy situations. The end of this third episode with the return of peace and quiet turns slightly emotional not to say sentimental or even sentimentalese. Too much crying indeed and too much sadness compensated by the joy of peace, love and a couple of weddings. Altogether it brings the tale to an end but it does not reach the height of the second episode, though we can see some of the inspiration of another recent series in the field of fantasy, Harry Potter who links the modern world with this underground fantasy world like Stephen King in the Dark Tower Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
10.0~Beyond awesome fir3r0s3 Sign in Permalink If you go past the inaccuracies of the book-to-film transition, RotK was one of, if not the best films I've ever seen, and that's without the incredibly hot Viggo and Karl. So if you haven't seen it, go see it, or you'll miss out on one of the best films ever.
5.0~Great Direction but still a bad underlying Kassdhal Sign in Permalink AS the first two movies, Peter Jackson did a great job directing, filming and editing the movie. However, the strong defaults of the original books show up, being too much of a too simplistic (anglo-saxon) battle of good against evil with characters lacking subtlety and finesse and, overall, lacking richness. As for the actors, Mortensen and Bean are very good but Orlando Bloom exhibits once again his usual remarkable lack of presence. Overall, great image and edition and just above average cast, put together to support an initial story offering a good entertainment value but lacking subtlety, deepness and richness.
1.0~Hey, it's terrible. ickash Sign in Permalink Talk about a bad mainstream movie, bad acting and terrible choices of scenes to have in the movie by Peter Jackson. It's a shame it's on the 2th place when great movies like Lost in translation is much further down. Sure, the movie contains some really great effects and some okay acting, but I mean the end.. oh my god. Was it really necessary to have 4 ending scenes? If you still like these kind of movies why don't you guys go and see star wars? At least their acting and characters is a lot more fun and those movies are also contains nice scenes, relating to the time they were made. This shouldn't be seen as an offense to either Peter Jackson nor Tolkien because they are both great. But still the movie didn't really work out. /ickash
10.0~Simply Stunning Perfection zniffyjunk Sign in Permalink I was very impressed by how faithfully the movie retold Tolkien's epic story. During my first viewing of the movie, there were scenes that felt very familiar, because they were so perfectly matched to my imagination from reading the book. If you've seen the first two movies, you know that every actor does a stellar job. But more so than the first two movies, "Return of the King" had many emotionally gripping moments. Many scenes were directed so well that they triggered exactly the same emotions as the book had intended. The movie's special effects were wonderful. The Battle of Pelennor Fields was the best movie battle scene I had ever seen. The soundtrack beautifully augmented the movie's tension and excitement. I have nothing but glowing recommendations for this movie - go see it!!
1.0~its a stupid series with no meaning i_am_notsure Sign in Permalink i saw this this movie and thought it was terrible. this movie is stupid and there is no point to it. destroy a bloody ring is it that hard. i don't see why this movie is rated well its stupid boring and pointless i was waiting for the movie to end the whole time i was in the cinemas and when it did end i asked myself what the hell was the point of that. i had wasted good money which i could've spent on something half descent but i spent it on this movie what a waste complete waste of money and time
10.0~favorite moments from book to screen (nothing plot revealing) Opus Esq Sign in Permalink (minor spoilers, but only if you haven't read the book.) some of the more awe inspiring moments for me were The Rohirim riding into battle at Gondor, Faramir leading his troops into Osgillioth against impossible odds, the moment Pippin becomes a man (so to speak), and the whole of Minas Tirith bowing down to four halflings, who might earlier have been dismissed as insignificant... it's moments like these that allow you to forgive the hollywood showboating of Orlando Bloom on the battlefield, and other such excesses.
10.0~Excellent. Who needs the book? aschachte Sign in Permalink Minor spoilers. I'll try not to be too specific. If you're one of the remaining 27 people who haven't seen any of the LotR movies, go ahead and rent them now so you can see this. If you have a friend (like me) who has the extended DVD box sets, borrow them. The extra footage is well worth it. It'll take you about 3 days to watch both movies. (Edit: I wrote this when it was still at the theatres. And the extended DVD is longer!) RotK was as good as everyone says. I didn't see the other two in the theatre, but borrowed the extended DVD's before watching this. I read the first book in high school, and the first movie was better than the book. The second movie was better than that, and well, this third movie was just plain great. OK, if you've read the books, that's nice. Seen the cartoons from the 1970's? Yeah, me too. Forget all that. This is better by far. Acting - top notch. Costumes - perfect. Special effects - brilliant. Locations - breathtaking. Excitement - edge of your seat (my son was literally sitting a foot and a half forward on his chair, which made it easy for me to give him a 'gotcha' during the spider scene - yeah, cruel, I know). There was wonderful tension between all the characters. Should Sam and Frodo kill Gollum, or keep him as a guide? How would Eowyn overcome Aragorn's love for Arwen? How could Faramir convince his father he's as brave as Boromir was? Who would rack up a higher death toll, Legolas or Gimli? And none of this got in the way of the action. It added to the action. It fueled it, just like it should in a great movie. I can't wait for the extended DVD to see what all was cut. Fighting the Oliphaunts reminded me of The Empire Strikes Back, where they had to fight Imperial Walkers. That whole battle was amazing, and took up a huge chunk of the movie. And did the troop platforms on top of the Oliphaunts remind you a little of Jabba's dune barge in Return of the Jedi? Hmm. The immense scope and size of the story approaches the ridiculous as the movie unfolds. The white castle is larger every time you see it, because they keep panning back from a higher altitude. And if you look closely when Frodo and Sam have climbed about a mile above the great keep of Mordor, you will see the armies still marching out on that road. That probably took them all day to get up that high. Just how many orcs are there, anyway? Especially toward the end, they ran you through just about every emotion - elation, despair, victory, defeat, love, pride, hope, etc. It was hard keeping a dry eye. None of the characters wanted to be the weak link. Everyone displayed uncommon bravery and heroism, just like you would expect at the end of the world. Maybe Gollum or Boromir's father come close, but there's really no character there to hate or consider useless. There's no Jar Jar Binks here, folks. My only small peeve is that the movie ended several times. When Sam and Frodo were on that rock at Mount Doom, they made it look like the end of the movie. The screen even went black. OK, so let's all get up and. wait! There's more. OK, so now they do this last bit and that's it. No, I was just kidding. Alright, this is really the end. Psyche! Basically, just sit there patiently. If it doesn't actually say 'The End', it's not. In case you're wondering, it's when you see a round door with a central door knob. When it finally did end, I got up to leave. My son asked me if we should wait through the credits for 'end stuff'. I said you have to be kidding. It already ended 12 times. And then we finally left the theatre. Everyone in there made a bee-line straight for the cinema bathrooms. It's 3 and a half hour long. So sit near the exit.
10.0~start rolling the nomination reel maverick122977 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson did a marvelous job. This could be the year of the King come Oscar night. I would not be surprised if it gets more than 10 nominations. Although he left out some parts (like the war in the Shire by the Hobbits and the Ruffians), it didn't deviate from the main focus of the story. Best parts of the movie was the Paths of the Dead scene and the siege of Gondor. Aragorn was imposing to the ghosts. As for the siege of Gondor, what more can I say. The fight scene was made to perfection. I liked the way Peter Jackson, at the start of the movie, introduced how Gollum came to be. It was, in my opinion, the one of the most critical elements of the entire series. If that would not had been shown, the story would be incomplete. Even though the movie started in the middle of the Two Towers book, it didn't affect much. The acting was superb. The stunts (especially that of Legolas killing an oliphant) were amazing. I think Jackson made the best decision when he cast Elijah Wood to be Frodo Baggins and Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf. I would not be surprised if Wood gets a nod for a nomination for Best Actor and McKellen a 2nd crack for Best Supporting Actor. In general, "King" deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. And if it wins the Best Picture, let's all start chanting "Hail to the King!"
10.0~A milestone in movie making TheRobidog Sign in Permalink Let me start by telling this, I think this movie is the best movie ever made. There are different reasons for that conclusion and part of it certainly is due to the buildup this movie had, with the first 2 other movies. I think this movie is much better than both of them though. It pretty much everything a movie needs to have IMO. It has good storytelling, great characters, outstanding visuals and good pacing (which is something I found the other 2 movies to be missing). What can be said about the story obviously is, that it is giant. There are stories that take place on a smaller scale, where only small things are at risk and I am not saying, these stories are worse (in fact, if they're done right, they can be better), but I also like stories that tackle a giant, worldwide danger. This is what all of the LOTR movies do, they deal with something that threatens pretty much the entire world. The good storytelling in it is that we find different people in this situation and they all come together through some circumstances (which, of course, happens in the first movie, not this one). What we get in this movie, is those characters working together, to solve this one problem. They all do serve a purpose in solving the problem and the story does a good job to show, why they do. That is good storytelling, that is how you tell a giant story right. And also, the way it ended is great. Then we have the characters. We have a lot of different characters in LOTR. We have people like Aragorn, who are in self doubt (although this isn't really present in the books. I think it's a great addition to the story), which they manage to lose in the end and which makes them get to the peak of their power. This is what we get to see in Return of the King. We finally see Aragorn, actively deciding that he will take his rightful throne and he does what he needs to do, to deserve it. On the other hand, we have characters that are like Legolas, the knight in shining armor kind. We do also have crazy people (Denethor), we have people like Sam, who are just very loyal. What I am getting to is that those characters all seem believable to me, which is what makes a good character. The best example would be Frodo, who also is in a constant struggle, because of the ring. His story is a great story about a guy that is not big enough for the task he's up against, which is a sad story. The good thing on that part is that everyone else got their happy end, but Frodo didn't, because Frodo basically failed. This characters are interesting. So, let's talk about the visuals. My favorite scene of the trilogy (from the cinematic standpoint) is in this movie. It is, when the riders of Rohan attack the Ork army in front of Minas Tirith. It is just a very beautiful scene. From an artistic standpoint, it is brilliantly made. What gives this scene a lot of power, is the horn that announces it. When you hear that horn, you have a slight idea of what you're going to get. You get the fact that Rohan is arriving, but to see it play out on the screen, to see them ride down those hills, being bombarded by arrows and crushing through the pikes of the Orks, was the most beautiful thing, I have ever seen on a screen. If I have ever been close to an orgasm while watching a movie, it was during this scene, because this scene, is epic. Now to the pacing. This movie does pacing in a better way than the other 2. What makes the difference is that noting in Return of the King seems irrelevant to the story. Yes, it is long. But the length this movie has is filled up with relevant stuff and everything seems very important, which is why it doesn't stretch as much as the other 2 movies do. It feels shorter, although it is massively longer. This is quite an impressive thing. Now, those are my reason for liking this movie. I truly think that it probably isn't the best in any of the categories I mentioned, but I think it combines them in the best way. The complete package of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is bigger and better than that of any other movie, which makes it the best movie I have ever watched. If there was any way to give it more than 10/10, I would definitely do that, but I will have to stick to a 10/10.
10.0~The story is now complete angelaw1975 Sign in Permalink Keeping in mind that the two previous movies are really all meant as a complete picture, I can truely say that this is a masterpiece. Like the books that the movies are based on, the movies are not always perfect in a traditional movie sense, nor do they confine themselves to traditional filmaking. I have read the books three times now and yet PJ and his team has manaaged to keep me on the edge of my seat and feel anxious when the characters or in peril... I do know certain aspects were left out, including Sauraman and the love blossoming between Faramir and Eowyn. With that said though, PJ made sure he did the theatrical version true to the books in the sense that we are never torn from the main characters of this story. I do have to say, however, that the real test will come when we have all three extended cuts of these movies and watch them in a marathon of 12 hours and watch them flow into one another. I can't wait! 10/10
3.0~Please!!! macandbg Sign in Permalink Come on People, How can you rate this movie as no 3 all time??? I do agree it is a very good movie based on an excellent novel or series of novels (the one I read had all three in on book). Yes it swept the academy awards (just the third one though) but where is Al Pacino, or Marlon Brando, or Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman? And to make things worse, the other 2 Movies are in the top 15!!! Don't get me wrong I did enjoy all three movies and if I sat down and made a list of my top 25 movies ROTK would probably be around 20th but definitely not top 10 or # 3 of all the movies ever made, or at least voted on in this list. I just don't think a movie should be voted one of the best of all time with no Great Actors in leading roles. Just my opinion, sorry my little Hobbit friends.
2.0~An unbiased view of this movie flessvictory Sign in Permalink I can't believe that I canceled an entire outing to watch the full 3.5 hrs of this movie which turned out to be extremely disappointing and downright boring at times. I followed the hype, the rating and thought that this movie must really be one of the best in the world and it certainly is not. It is actually one of the poorer movie efforts I've seen. The story is very weak and the happy ending is expected. The pile of CGI ie the Golem was rendered completely pointless by his portrayal in this film and the series could have actually gone on without it. There is even less of a villain in this movie than there was in the first and second movies. The movie is divided into two parts, namely Frodo's boring and mostly event-less journey and a banal war which the good guys obviously win. Avoid this movie despite all the hype. It has nothing new.
10.0~Amazing ilibarpasfer Sign in Permalink Amazing film! Based on a great book story. Despite being populated with wizards, elves, dwarfs, and trolls, Lord of the Rings has more in common with epic films like Ben Hur or The Ten Commandments than it does with the comparatively small-scale mild adventurism that is the likes of Harry Potter. This is a film of contrast and familiarity. Contrast it its landscapes, from the comfortable, sweetly beautiful landscapes of Hobbiton, to the dark and disturbing dangers of deeply delved Moria, to the majestic, breathtaking tree homes of Lothlorien and the elves. Familiarity in it's characters, brought together by the fickle scales of fate, desperately balancing their lives against evil for the greater good. It's also a movie about struggle and determination, as the smallest and meekest of creatures enters a world far beyond their experience. Best trilogy ever!
10.0~One of the best movies I've ever seen, it just could've ended 30 minutes earlier... commie007 Sign in Permalink Every aspect of the film was at the highest level. My one major gripe is that it truly dragged on at the end. In fact, I found myself saying, c'mon let's get this over with. Regardless, a brilliant conclusion to Jackson's film trilogy.
7.0~I liked this film all the way through, apart from the ending AdrenalinDragon Sign in Permalink I liked all of the Lord Of The Rings films, but this one has to have the best battle scenes in it though and the most stunning special effects in it. The acting was pretty good in the film, and Peter Jackson is a good director. As you may might have known the story carries on from The Two Towers. Frodo, Sam and Gollum are trying to get into Mordor and taking the ring into Mount Doom to destroy evil once and for all. While the others fight off the orcs and the other creatures to defend them. The only part of this film I didn't like, was the ending. It just dragged and dragged for ages. I know that's probably how it ends in the book but come on!. Did the ending have to be 25 minutes long?. It could have easily been shortened down to 10 minutes. Overall, I do think that this film is a very good action/adventure film but it could have got a better score if the ending was a lot shorter. I would give this film a rating of 8/10.
8.0~Second comment on it Hellsinger Sign in Permalink Already commented on it, but i needed to added something i forgot really... I am really disappointed by the ending, the last 45 minutes or so are SO useless, and not useful for the story. I would have done the scenes after the eagles taking Frodo and Sam, maybe in 5 minutes or so, The marriage of Sam was straight out of poor American dramas, and Frodo's leave was also not relevant to the story itself. It's a shame that Peter Jackson totally messed up the ending, because before that it was like many people said, flawless.
10.0~Splendid and brave rivendal Sign in Permalink Just to mention that I`m not just a big fun of Tolkien`s, I simply coming in and out of his books, as I`m waking up at morning and diving in dreams by night. It lasts almost 30 years. So, as a commentator I could be very strict, but... Peter Jackson, the actors and the movie crew have done something specific in a film production. Knowing well, there are a millions of Tolkien funs worldwide, who are such a specific kind (devote to the stories, perfectionists remembering all of details, even the words of the original text and lines), they dare to touch and reveal "the sanctuary", making their own vision to lay it direct in front of the enormous varieties of visions of the opposite side - the funs and their particular imaginations of Tolkien`s world. This is the most brave act in a history of film production. Congratulations! Just because of that very hazardous, in one hand dangerous idea (considering career) and it`s realization after seven years of hard work, I am appreciate, delightful and marvelling. Of course, the irregularities existed, but in this case I`ll let them pass. I`m afraid I`m a pessimist about "The Return of the King" winning the Oscar (for the best film in 2003.), not only because the movies such a genre usually are not enough "appropriate" for that prise (I had noticed that in many cases), but of possibility a bit of jealousy or envy in the world of the "seventh art". Made such a brilliant movie (movies), with enormous effort, to connect in a mutual ambient the initiated funs and ones who had never read any of Tolkien`s books, it is an act which have to be respected and loved. Just like the Tolkien`s trilogy "The Lord of the Rings" (also "The Silmarillion") is actually a serious writing, no matter the fabula does not described the real world, P. Jackson`s movie is in the same manner. It is a big responsibility not to make it profane, but in the same time make it so fascinating, to attract the ones who does not know the story. This is an art and the gift. As I said, I`m a pessimist, but underhand I hope "The Return of the King" will win the Oscar for the movie of the year.
10.0~Gave me goosebumps at times! SleeperVB Sign in Permalink Finally after a year of waiting Return of the King came out and blew me away. I was expecting, once again, brilliant fighting scenes to go along with the story. I received this along with emotional scenes which gave me the goosebumps and nearly brought tears to my eyes. This movie was a fantastic finale to the trilogy and should go down as the years best film.
10.0~A Breathtaking Conclusion To Cinema`s Greatest Fantasy Epic Theo Robertson Sign in Permalink It takes a miracle for me to go the cinema since smoking is banned in cinema chains but Peter Jackson is a miracle worker . How else would he be able to make me forget my filthy and disgusting nicotine addiction ? He made me forget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew that with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for a record breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay winter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled !!!!! SPOILERS !!!!! I do conclude there are some people in the world who can`t see what the fuss is about with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy . My parents seem slightly puzzled that their cynical critical son loves LOTR . It`s simply explained , these epic movies aren`t a childish fantasy , they`re like David Lean filming a Shakespeare play , but I do take onboard the criticism that the story structure of the movies can be irritating . FELLOWSHIP is very stop-start while the action intercutting in TTT can be annoying but ROTK has probably the best pace and structure of the three . ROTK starts with a sequence showing Smeagol murdering his friend in order to get the ring . This gives some needed backstory to Gollum . It also sets up its stall that it`s not a family film never mind a " childish fantasy " . In fact I predict that many of the children in Rothesay cinema will be having nightmares tonight due to the scenes with that horrible big spider , it made my skin crawl and the woman sitting next to me was gasping out loud as it prepared to cocoon poor Frodo , you should have seen the Q for the toilet after that scene which tells you how convincing the FX are in this movie , nothing appears CGI : Gollum isn`t computer generated he`s a living being and Peter Jackson doesn`t use camera trickery for fight scenes he uses million upon millions of extras . He is David Lean reincarnated . No he is David Lean AND Will Shakespeare reincarnated , look at the way the cast act their parts , it`s like they`re appearing in the greatest play of the bard . Their performances are superlative There are some flaws . I did mention the script gives background to Smeagol but the script - Like the other films in the trilogy - is somewhat uneven . John Noble`s character Denethor seems somewhat underwritten and I wasn`t sure what his motivation was . Also as everyone else has mentioned the false endings are very irritating . When Aragorn is crowned king and the screen faded to black the audience reached for their Jackets and bags then we`re shown another scene lasting several minutes which faded to a blaze of music. Everyone reached for their bags and jackets , then another scene which... It would have been better to have seen Aragorn crowned King and then seen Frodo sailing into the distance but I guess after the screenwriters have irritated us with the abrupt endings of the first two movies it`s somewhat traditional to irritate with the end of the trilogy . These faults I can forgive but there is an unforgivable cop out of having an army of the undead charging to save the race of men from the Orc army at the end . It didn`t ruin the movie for me but it just seems so lazy and contrived which stopped me from thinking it was the best movie in the trilogy , it`s not , FELLOWSHIP is . But still this is a masterpiece of cinema which like cigarettes left me breathless and satisfied and hopefully we`ll see it sweep the Oscar ceremony at last As for the Oscars themselves I`m puzzled about a couple of things . Howard Shore`s score is beautiful and haunting but it`s far from original with much of the music in ROTK re-used from FELLOWSHIP ( The Gondor theme ) and TTT ( The Celtic music ) while the omissions are even more surprising . No nominations for any of the actors ! I know that all the great performances would cancel each other out but it`s shameful Andy Serkis wasn`t nominated as best supporting actor . Can anyone name a more unlikable baddie than Gollum in recent cinema ? Me neither and no nomination for cinematography ! I`ve no idea how John Lesnie`s camera was able to keep up with the action and he deserved at least a nomination so maybe we`ll see the third instalment robbed on Oscar night like FELLOWSHIP was . Even if it is that doesn`t stop me and millions of other film fans from recognising the genuis of Peter Jackson . I bow to you Sir
9.0~Need to watch. phucalias Sign in Permalink A great movie, epic, mesmerizing content. Set amid the studio but have great appeal for viewers. Not only brought indescribable emotions but also contain the element of surprise, dramatic. First is the story of a mischievous dwarf with the game, and the obsession of getting ugly little things with the ring. Released on 17 December 2003, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King received rave reviews[5] and became one of the greatest critical and box-office successes of all time, being only the second film to gross $1 billion worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film from New Line Cinema, as well as the biggest financial success for Time Warner in general, until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 surpassed The Return of the King's final gross in 2011. The film was the highest- grossing film of 2003. Notably, it won all eleven Academy Awards for which it was nominated, including the awards for Best Picture, the first and only time a fantasy film has done so; it was also the second sequel to win a Best Picture Oscar (following The Godfather Part II) and Best Director. The film is tied for largest number of awards won with Ben-Hur (1959) and Titanic (1997).
10.0~Best of te Best yilmazboy Sign in Permalink This was the best i'v saw till today !!! sorry for my bad england
10.0~In my opinion, the supreme adventure film of our generation. j_ohanley92 Sign in Permalink I will probably never see a movie like The Return of the King again. The first two chapters set up all of the characters and all of the little story arcs, and Return of the King, as the movie that gets to wrap things up, has a natural advantage over it's predecessors. Most adventure movies use the first 80 minutes to set things up, and the final 40 to pay things off. That's exactly what exactly what this is whenever you look at The Lord of the Rings as a single movie: the four hour climax of one twelve hour adventure film. And as an individual entry into the series, from an emotional, scope, and action standpoint, it's in my opinion far and away the best of the trilogy. We all know the story, but this time everybody is in the final round. Frodo and Sam still must enter Mordor to destroy the Ring, guided by the scheming creature Gollum, but this time there's no turning back. Gandalf still must do what he can to hold back the Dark Lord Sauron's forces, but his armies have grown to an overwhelming size. Aragorn still must return to the City of Minas Tirith to reclaim the King's thrown, but now time is pressing against him. So yes, it's more of the same from the first two films, but now on a grander and more climatic scale. Elijah Wood does a fine job as a now exhausted and tormented Frodo. Sean Astin is allowed to emerge as the trilogy's true hero, repeatedly risking his own life to save Frodo's. Andy Serkis's performance as the CGI Gollum, is as impressive as anyone's in the trilogy. Interestingly, in The Two Towers much time and energy was spent winning us over to Gollum's side. Then, in the wonderful and creepy opening scene of this movie, all sympathy we had for the character is gone completely, and the rest of the film portrays him as a genuinely detestable villain. Ian McKellan, who spent most of The Two Towers off screen as Gandalf, is back in full force. And Viggo Mortenson, who dominated the previous film, has probably his smallest role in the movie in which he is the title character. Still, his performance is intense and focused. Mention must be made of some supporting characters. Merry (Dominic Mongahan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) become fully developed characters at last. Bernard Hill as Theoden hits all the right notes. Miranda Otto's Eowyn is a very easy protagonist to root for. The rest of the cast holds perform admirably. Terrific ensemble performances. On a "Great scene per movie" basis, Return of the King is outstanding. Smeagol pre-CGI corruption. A chain of signal beacons setting vast mountaintops ablaze. A father coldly sending his son on a suicide mission. Dueling catapults between a city a third of a mile tall and an army of hundreds of thousands. The unbearable suspense as a large spider relentlessly stalks one of our heroes. The arrival of 6000 soldiers on horseback just as all seems lost. The climatic scene right at the very Crack of Doom with the fate of the world dangling over a fiery chasm. And a single ship sailing away into the setting sun. These are just the highlights of the highlights. It's unfair to expect every scene in a movie to be riveting, but this one is quite close. Although the special effects serve the story, they are so strong and numerous that it is impossible not to mention them. The film's third quarter, a one hour siege of Minas Tirith by 300,000 of Sauron's minions, is masterful film-making. This due to the fact that although there plenty of eye candy here, the characters have been so strongly developed that we find ourselves worrying more about their lives than anything else. That's really all you can ask for. Of course, The Return of the King has it's weakpoints. In a deviation from the book, Frodo loses faith in Sam and sends him away at one point. While a nice bit of drama, it creates a lot of big plot holes later on. A subplot featuring the mad stewart of Gondor, Denethor (John Noble) ultimately trying to burn himself and his son Faramir (David Wenham) alive doesn't quite work with the rest of the movie. And an invincible, undead army that appears without warning at a key point is what the phrase Deux Es Machina was invented for. In fact, it's probably the most flawed of the three movies, but what does work, works so well that it overshadows all the little problems. Speaking of which, I've heard all the arguments against the long ending, and I don't agree at all. We're ending an entire trilogy here, not a single movie. When you examine the ending, you'll find it wraps up more loose ends from Fellowship than from King. Director Peter Jackson deserved to cater exclusively to those who cherished the characters, just once. Finally, Theatrical or Extended Edition? Already for me, the 250 minute extended version has become the only Return of the King. Although it only contains a few new scenes that, by themselves, stand out as truly great, there are huge numbers of moments that set up and strengthen bits that come later. Casual fans who want to experience the fastest 200 minutes you'll ever spend watching a movie should get the TE. In conclusion, it would be plain arrogant of me to declare this the best movie ever made. I don't think it is. But while I was watching it, I was completely enraptured. I was absorbed in the story, the sights, the sounds. I rooted for the characters, winced every time Sauron scored any kind of victory, and cheered during every single triumphant moment. The Return of the King resounded and appealed to me on a more personal level than any movie I've ever seen. And I really can't argue with that.
9.0~It is a great fantasy movie! xnxxlame Sign in Permalink The trilogy of lord of the rings is a master piece,i would suggest to any one who is fan of fantasy movies to watch it and better start from the begin . This movie is a master piece it includes everything you need to see first all it gives us a installment of mystery then to keep us alive and not to get bored it puts us in a action stance,i am thrilled of this trilogy and i wanna suggest it to the ones who haven't seen yet . Although for those who will start with this movie they better start with the fist movie of lord of the rings so they can understand the movie because it has some unexplained things.That's all for me folks sorry for my grammar hope haven't you bored enough :) Keep it straight
10.0~Already a classic masterpiece of film-making eelfinn Sign in Permalink Although you would have to have seen parts one and two to wholly appreciate part three, Return of the King is in and of itself an exemplary piece of film-making. Acting performances are outstanding across the board, the scenery will take your breath, and the exceptionally well-adapted story will have you on the edge of your seat the whole 210 minutes. I should say Tolkien would be proud of this movie. I wouldn't have imagined most people who read the book to say that they were quite satisfied with the movie's handling of the story. The years shooting this movie were time well spent! (As will be the hours you it'll take you to watch it all. :)
10.0~This type of excellence will never be repeated ablack90 Sign in Permalink So there's two trilogies I watch over and over again, year over year and sometimes even more than once/year. The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Swedish Millennium Trilogy (Girl with Dragon Tattoo). Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is my favorite of the three because it's on an epic scale of film-making that we'll likely never see again. From beginning to end, the story-telling, location, dialogue, character development, direction, acting, costuming, set design, cinematography, you name it, all of it is stellar in this film. I was in love with the books and this trilogy, similar to Oplev and Alfredson's Millennium films, adapted to the books in a spectacular way, as to be rendered in a class of their own.
10.0~An Epic Cinematic Masterpice... ryansmoody Sign in Permalink Quite simply, I think that this may be the greatest movie of all time. Everyone had such high expectations, and it didn't let them down. It delivered hardcore. Give Sean Austin the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor NOW!
10.0~The best picture of the year departed07 Sign in Permalink I saw the last epic in the lord of the ring series and it was wonderful. The story finishes with Sam and Frodo going to the fire of Modor to destroy the ring, the humans continue to fight for middle earth as they find Pippen and Merry safe. The special effects are awesome, the film remains one of the best pictures of 2003 with a top notch cast, cool storytelling, badass fight sequences and something for you to smile. The Return of the King is twice as sad than the first two from the series so carry a tissue with you. Since third times a charm, maybe it will finally win best picture for the 2004 Oscars. Beware of Gollum, he's more creppy than he was in two towers 10/10
10.0~Legendary movie Yazan_Bakeer Sign in Permalink Perfect story , graphics , fantasy .. maybe the acting of characters is not good enough but the movie still the best adventure and fantasy of all time
10.0~Epic with emotional and dramatic payoff seltzer Sign in Permalink Magnificent and beautiful, the final film of The Lord Of The Rings is an astounding achievement in filmmaking. The hours spent with each character, including the two previous films, is used to bring you so much closer to people in horrible mortal danger. Peter Jackson and his amazing company of players and technicians have brought this huge storytelling to a nice and perfect ending, wrapping up loose ends and combining all the elements in a cinematic shot to the head. Probably not for anyone who hasn't seen the first two, and it's a good idea to refresh your memory by watching those films again. This is by no means a standalone movie, but as the final third of really huge movie, it has never been equalled. The direction is great, with many close up shots of the people and creatures we have gotten to know, offset by landscape sized shots that almost show entire nations in one shot. The effects are, of course, extremely cool, and the fights are fantastic. A must see.
10.0~The King has returned! EdouardBMesert Sign in Permalink This is a masterpiece, Gondor will prosper for a thousand years. The old world is passing away, the age of man is beginning. Peter Jackson is a genius! Sean Astin deserves an Oscar. Ian McKellan deserves an Oscar. Viggo Mortenson deserves an Oscar. The Return of the King is the Best Drama of the Year! It has been a very long wait, everyone said that LOTR was not filmable. Well Peter Jackson has done the impossible.
9.0~What are you all complaining for? canubelieveitsnotbutter Sign in Permalink Maybe it's just me, but I've been browsing through all of the RotK reviews, and practically everyone says the film is 'the worst one in the trilogy' or 'utter rubbish'. WHAT? I admit there are some things in the film that could be improved. The ending did seem to drag a bit, but have you read the book? Jackson has cut a lot out, and yet the storyline still makes sense, and it's still just as effective. To all of the people currently saying that he needed to add more about the Shire, think again, I'm sure I'm not the only one who'd have found a five hour movie too much. RotK is by far the biggest of the LotR trilogy. The huge battles and the amazing Shelob scene make this film by far the most exciting. The music is, yet again, flawless. There are very few scores that you can remember months after seeing the film (Stars Wars and Indiana Jones being some of those scores) and I think that LotR has some truly amazing music, that will be remembered for decades. My personal favourite scene has to be the lighting of the beacons, as the camera flies over the mountains you really get a sense of the scale of Tolkien's world. And of course I sat in the cinema with all of my friends and cheered when Eowyn killed the Witch King. Finally, a woman killing something! YES! Sean Astin really stole the show though, his portrayal of Sam was immensely powerful. "Don't go where I can't follow" was such a powerful line that I could see at least one of my friends in tears. But if there's one thing that you remember after seeing this film, remember Gollum. Sometimes I forget that he's not a real person. Overall, don't listen to the idiots saying that this film 'isn't worth seeing', because they're wrong. This film deserves every Oscar it won, and you deserve to watch it. Pure brilliance.
10.0~A great way to end a Trilogy. Not just the best, but the best. StarWars93 Sign in Permalink This movie was an amazing way to end the story of the Fellowship all the way back in 2001. Now, comes the end of their journeys and their destinies await. The battle for Middle-Earth begins. As Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli prepare for the final stand against Sauron, Frodo and Sam, the movie's most important characters, are being led to Mount Doom to destroy the accursed One Ring. Gollum, now evil after Faramir captured him at the Forbidden Pool in The Two Towers, wants the Rings back and tries to kill Frodo and Sam along the way. The story is great and so is the acting. There's not much more I can say but this movie was spectacular.
9.0~One of the Best Films of all time cameroncox53 Sign in Permalink This movie, hands down was one of the best films of all time. A shear example of Good vs Evil. I cannot even put onto words how good this movie was. The story followed the first two films without a flaw, the acting was superb with the exception of Frodo whose role as a weak and pathetic character got a little annoying by the middle of the first film. But nonetheless this film is a real tearjerker, it is a perfect example of chivalry, hope, and courage in the face of impossible odds. I loved how well the actors got into character, it made you really believe that such a place as middle earth really existed. Most of all I loved Aragorn's transition from a lowly ranger to his rightful place on the throne of Gondor. The movies battle scenes were nothing short of fantastic especially the siege of Minas Tirith. Granted the movie was slow at points in order for the story to fully develop, but who can complain, there were no points in the film where the viewers did not know what was happening or why something was happening, like with the relationship Farimir had with his father. This movie will send shivers down your spine, especially when the Riders Of Rohan make their long awaited presence on the fields of Pelennor in order to relieve the defenders of Gondor of certain defeat. This movie has such redeeming value it is too hard to explain in words, it is something that you will just have to see for yourself. My only problem with this film is the ending, simply put their were far too many of them making the movie drag out longer than expected, but it was necessary in order to complete the story and for it to make sense.
8.0~Adaptation derekjh-94833 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson outdoes himself in this stunning adaptation of the finale of J.R.R. Tolkein's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I have never seen a better film adaptation of a book.
1.0~I'm sorry, since when was this the third best film of all time? Seikan Sign in Permalink It's an okay film, epic and all, of course, the fact that it's an epic like Gladiator or Troy doesn't mean it's good, Troy proved that fact, and Alexander continued to prove it with one star antics. To be quite frank, Peter Jackson is an overrated director, much like the Lord of the Rings movies are overrated movies. If you notice, all three are located in the top fifteen films, this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as Seven Samurai; Schindler's List; and even Casablanca! This is not the case... With camera angles that make you sick, utilising the, admittedly beautiful landscape of New Zealand, to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of Middle Earth. But wait! Where are the interesting characters? Every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up, you seem to hope that they'd be dead by the second one, but no, they come along to the third one to kick some Sauron ass. Here's my view of Lord of the Rings: A whole load of walking. Lord of the Rings- Fellowship of the Ring: *points* There! *walks* Lord of the Rings- The Two Towers: *points* There! *walks, trips up, walks on* Lord of the Rings- Return of the King: *points* There! *walks, throws ring into mountain, walks away* Take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie (depending on which one you watch, and I myself wouldn't touch the Extended versions...), you really get the idea that the Academy Awards truly are flawed. Why look! Forrest Gump won best film of 1994 instead of The Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction! Titanic won best film of 1997 instead of L.A. Confidential! And, why, lookey here! LOTR- ROTK won best ****ing film of 2003 instead of Mystic River... Perhaps next year we'll have The Constant Gardener as the best film of 2005, that may actually redeem the Oscars' failing reputation, a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half-arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as "Best Film".
10.0~The Best of the Three mOVIemAN56 Sign in Permalink (Possible Spoilers) In the land of Mordor Frodo is finally closing in on Mount Doom. Aragorn and his company are seeking dead soldiers and Gandalf is smacking people with his staff. Most of this would not make any sense to those who did not see the first two. The Return of the King is the final installment of the now Legendary Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Though the first two (The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers) were done very well and seemed to follow the book I felt this one did the best job of them all. Even though Shelob was added to Return of the King instead of its predecessor I felt it made the movie better. The actual construction Minas Tirith and just seeing the entire Orc army surrounding it was breathtaking. Elijah Wood gives what I think is his best of the three movies and is supported by a superb job by Sean Astin and Ian MacKellan. The movie, I think was deserving of all eleven Oscar's and all the hype it got. the acting was strong, the visual effects were great, and the story was one only J.R.R. Tolkien could create. 5 Out of 5 Stars.
8.0~good, but definitely not deserving of #4 of all time Iniquitous Sign in Permalink A movie shouldn't be elevated beyond it's true value simply because of special effects. All three movies had exceptional special effects. They were amazing. The realism is unbelievable. However, superfluous additions to, and needless omissions from, the original story, along with quite a bit of over-the-top acting are certainly enough to move it quite a ways down the list. This movie is not better than Schindler's List. It's not better than The Usual Suspects. It's not better than many of the movies it's currently beating in the top 250. This film is currently rated higher than The Seven Samurai -and- Citizen Kane. Let's vote the real value of a film and not destroy the value of our system. I rate this film 8/10 in it's genre for exceptional special effects and a great soundtrack.
1.0~ROTK = Godawful JohnnnyUtah Sign in Permalink Man, fellowship was much better than this piece of junk. A lot of the shots were horrible, the cgi except for gollum sucked, the dialogue was beyond cheesy, the battles were anti-climatic, the way the war ended w/ the dead people was dumb, the ending dragged on, and on, and on. I checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie. The battle scenes blah. And if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered, why freakin' joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt. That's just so freakin' lame. The attempts at 'comedy' in this movie were laughable. If you want to watch a movie w/ real battle scenes, do yourself a favor and go see Last Samurai. I've seen that movie 2 times, and I'm going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is ROTK.
2.0~Emotionally vacuous; brutally boring federeragassi Sign in Permalink Several points that I agree with: 1. Characters and story are dull, hence... 2. I lose interest and lose track of who's fighting whom and why 3. People take this way too seriously 4. On a technical level, the film is very well done and impressive to look at, but ultimately, it never involves you emotionally unless you are taking it too seriously, hence... 5. This is one of the most overrated movies of all-time to be up at #4 on this list.
10.0~Amazing Movie kevin-v-r893 Sign in Permalink This was my first movie ever.I mean it when i say that i have never been interested in jack squat before watching LOTR(yes,the caps is important). I saw it in Bahrain first in Budaiya,for those of you who don't know where Bahrain is,FYI beautiful place,must go. Anyways,I couldn't believe the story line and the details of the characters and where they come from as well as their homelands,it's a completely different feeling whenever i watch it but I will always have that feeling in my mind that i'm watching something worthwhile( which is better than what's out there now,with one question. What would've happened if i never saw this movie? I told my best friend at the time and no surprise he got hooked too. I think anyone in the world will agree with me when I say that LOTR is the greatest and most respected Movie series accompanied by of course The Godfather. Just ask Aguero.(And i'm an Arsenal fan)
10.0~Dear Lord, I couldn't stop crying. PhedreSpitfire Sign in Permalink Okay, I read the books, and I knew what was going to happen, but I still couldn't stop crying. I guess just seeing people act it out makes all the more wonderful. I loved this movie, and I think Peter Jackson did the books justice. For once I've seen a movie based on a book that I can be extremely happy about. Kudos to you Peter Jackson.
10.0~History became real!! Shinumaru Sign in Permalink This is not only my Favourite LOTR film, it is also the best film I ever seen at all-time. Story, places, characters, quotes, musics, effects, make-ups,sound effects, weapons, costumes... everything is perfect.A fantasy can not be real more than this.. Each character has his or her own charisma, but I especially inspired some of them. Aragorn, Lord Eomer, Witch King of Angmar and Legolas... Edoras and Minas Tirith have been perfectly realized.The Battle in the Pelennor Fields , Riding of Rohirrim in the Helm's Deep, Cry of Nazgul at the Minas Morgul, Coming of Eagles at the Black Gates of Mordor, The Saruman's speech at the Isengard are my favorite scenes... There is always hope!!
10.0~A rich experience in sound, color and story. Ellie-23 Sign in Permalink I had read all the Tolkien books long before this beautifully done set of films were made. I did not see the first two films in the theater as I am not much of a movie goer. I did see them on DVD and liked them very much. The sound quality in the first two was my only complaint, I found it difficult to hear what the actors were saying at times, but in this final film that seemed much improved. Of course this final part of the tale is less dialog and more action so that may explain the improved effect, it may also be because I saw this in the theater and the sound is better quality than my little TV gives. I was enchanted with the whole finale of the tale. I was glad that the ending was not changed to much, though I liked the struggle to save the shire at the end of the book, the movie was getting long and the tale stood without that piece. I hope we can look forward to "The Hobbit" some day by this same group of people, it will make my DVD collection complete. I hope many people will read these books now because creativity and imagination need to be developed on well written works like this. I am sure Mr. Tolkien would have been pleased.
10.0~Fantastic... can-saracoglu Sign in Permalink It's a great movie and story. There is not one thing about this movie that I would change. Maybe one or two of the extra scenes could have been cut out, but they only are there to lead into the sequel. All in all, this is a fantastic movie.
10.0~WOW!!! Condolf Sign in Permalink Three thumbs up. This is the best of the three films and certainly worth getting an Oscar for as best picture. There aren't words to describe this movie, but I can say one thing... move over George and Steven, there's a new kid in town that really knows how to put together a great film. The torch has now been past. But this is just my opinion.
10.0~WOW Cassandra_Jade Sign in Permalink Well what can i say except WOW! Peter Jackson surely made us wait for the best, last. I dont know exactly what to write because i am speechless about this movie so far i've seen it 3 times at the cinema and feel i should now wait for the DVD release to see it again. I cried so much at the end from when Saroun is defeated till the end of the film! Sean Astin is outstanding in this film he really put his all into Sam aswell as Elijah as Frodo who really makes us feel for his tortured soul. And the rest of the cast were all great too, best cast line up i've seen in a film, well ever as far as i'm concerned. I also love the little hobbits Merry (Dom) and Pip (Billy) you made me laugh and cry so many times with your hobbit antics.The perfect fantasy world is middle-earth! And the magic lives on thanks to Jackson and Tolkein! and the elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards and man.
10.0~Best film ever! PeteRoy Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King is the best film ever. You must watch this movie if you want to know what a good movie is, and if you want to enjoy a movie the most. I enjoyed it the most in my life. It has everything, love, war, peace, and most important: a good ending! Excellent!
3.0~Almost follows the star wars trilogy: two winners and a dog to finish mattrochman Sign in Permalink All I can say is this: I have watched Fellowship about 100 times, Two towers about 40 times and Return of the King 3 times. And I'd say that the number of times I've watched them is directly proportional to how I regard each film. Before I discuss the film itself, let me start by saying that I'm not one of those who dis's this (and all the other LOTR movies) simply because they don't follow verbatim those the horribly written, over-baked novels. To those who think this way, I have this to say: I noticed that JRR seems to have lost patience with writing this trilogy towards the end. You'll notice that fellowship is neat and punchy and two towers is engaging, but drops off in parts. By the time JRR was writing RotK, he must have been absolutely fed up with the whole LOTR because the syntax and language is rough, awkward, rushed in parts; and the author's own interest in winding up the story in style is visibly lacking. My criticism of the film itself is more reserved for the fact that the film-makers clearly attempted to hoodwink the population into thinking that this was a grand epic. Post production was over way the top and many elements were far too sentimental and over-dramatic (epic cinematic devices). If they wanted to create a truly great epic, they should have looked at films like Dances with Wolves where the powerful score, grand-standing and sentimentality work seamlessly with the story. For some reason, I felt that this film had all the elements of an epic.... but it just wasn't one. Perhaps the underlying novel didn't give them enough to work with. In any case, it really doesn't rank highly in my humble opinion. Fellowship was, without a doubt, the best of this series. How RotK ended up with all the awards and praise, both here and from the critics, has me absolutely stumped! Sometimes, I get the feeling that everyone was waiting for the final chapter before showering with awards and praise ... and when they finally saw it and realised that it wasn't as great as they had hoped, they were either sucked in by the epic devices (as opposed to an epic MOVIE) or they felt obliged to simply reward it notwithstanding because they had held off their showering of praise on the first two and felt obliged to give one of them all the accolades simply out of respect for their dedication in executing a task this size. Yet... the final product is unsatisfactory.
1.0~worst of the 3, and the stink of the first 2 rose pretty high jshells Sign in Permalink Obviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel, but what's worse, a terrible movie. Lacking flow, sense, linearity and dramatic impact, this played out like a highlights reel, not a coherent story. The actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given, with some exceptions. Peter Jackson's only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots, both of which are heartily abused. And the special effects, for the most part, would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability. There were high points, but this was and is the first and only movie I have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the Eowyn-Nazgul scene. A hollywood blockbuster? No Doubt. A good movie? Hell no. Possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on? The fact is, if this were based on real events, I don't think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names. Maybe that wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have to hear about Jackson's love of the books, or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material. There is hardly a scene or underlying theme in the movie that has anything to do with the books. This movie could probably have been worse, but I would be hard pressed to know how...
1.0~For idiots axortagosss Sign in Permalink Without effects this movie will be nothing People you wants a cinema full of effects? in this effects you find some feelings? The only reason for this movie is money for the money. The movie is awful, the director sucks, Jackson is a puppet, sorry mister Jackson maybe you are good person (i don't think so , because you want to full your pockets and buy some pools ) Hollywood must close, is industry that puts poison in people minds and hearts. All that things is not for the art but for the money. Shame on Hollywood.Lord 1, lord 2 and lord 3 is for person with 3 years old minds, i prefer to read the books. The votes on IMDb is fake, wake up !! The world must wake up is the only solution for this awful cinema, but how?
7.0~Overrated scanlon178 Sign in Permalink I cannot see how a movie that goes for at least half an hour longer than it should have, has variations between wooden acting and over-acting (ouch, what's with the crying all the time?), with almost zero character development, become one of the 'greatest movies of all time'? Am I taking crazy pills here? The effects are great, and the settings are quite breath-taking. Yeah, same for Lawrence of Arabia. But in that movie the script was awesome, instead of over-blown, and trying SO hard to be epic and dramatic, and the whole thing doesn't seem to go on for a whole day, even though it is long. Maybe it's just that there's a new wave of movie watchers pouring onto this site, who haven't really seen many movies, and don't know the difference: "Gee, I've seen Scary Movie, American Pie and LOTR III... I must conclude LOTR III is the best movie ever made in the world! By a mile"! I mean the movie's quite good. Just not that good. The Dwarf made it more bearable. "That still only counts as one!" 7/10
10.0~Excellent Film...Few Errors helloscoobie Sign in Permalink I made time to view The Return of the King opening night. I must say I was intrigued from the opening to the ending of the movie. I wanted to know who lived, died, etc. I must say that, though I had few complaints, I call this the best movie of the year. My complaints are few. Firstly, I find Gollum's background concerning the ring unecessary. I would have preferred if it was in another film, perhaps upon his first meeting Frodo and Sam. Another complaint is a common one...the lack of Christopher Lee. He was the only missing element in the movie. He basically dissappeared. As far as battle scenes go, my favorite in all three movies is still Helms Deep. It is foreboding and ominous and unsure. The beginning of total war. The battles in the Return of the King are wonderful indeed, but they are more direct. They feel swift and some ideas were used. Also, the appearance of the ghost/spirit things made it feel unreal. I didn't enjoy how they came across with their eerie glow. Now that the complaints are through, the movie was overall marvy! I especially loved the many conflicts [particularly Gollum vs. Sam] and character developements [Merry and Pippin]. I loved the major role Merry and Pippin played. They really came across as true heroes who were willing to pay for any ills done. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Eowyn. She really came through as a woman of honor in the end, not one dragged down by men, as Arwen seemed to be. One more thing...Frodo was evil. I lost all empathy for him. Sam was being nice! Darn that Gollum and his mind games. Overall, I would give this movie a 9 out of 10. One of the best of our time.
10.0~Arguably the Greatest Film of All Time grantbullert Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is a film like no other. The massive scale is unparalled, yet it stays down to earth and doesn't forget about what the story is all about: our humble Fellowship who desire to bring an end to the evil of Sauron and his puppets. -Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: All paths cross in this epic conclusion of one of the greatest stories ever told. The mastery of the storytelling completely sets this film apart from almost all other franchises. There is so much depth and heart to each character that it doesn't matter who is on screen at the time. We are totally drawn in to the story. The pacing and tension building is phenomenal and is what makes this film a classic among the fantasy genre, and perhaps even a classic across all of cinema. Peter Jackson's astounding work is clearly visible once again in this epic tale. He has complete command over every aspect of his brilliant adaptation of Tolkien's master work. *Cinematography/Editing: Once again, the work of Andrew Lesnie continues to impress and awe. He brings such beauty and realism to Jackson's vision. Few cinematographers would be able to do what he has done for these films. Every shot is a beautiful work of art, but also an excellent piece of storytelling. The editing is incredible in this final installment. Tension and urgency rise as the film progresses. The blending of the images and soundscape, as well as music makes us feel as if we are in Middle-earth. *Dialogue/Acting: The urgency is also heightened due to the incredible dialogue. Speeches are more grand than they have ever been, conversations between main characters have so much weight to them. The delivery from the actors is what really sells it. There is so much passion coming from every actor in this film. Viggo Mortensen continues to impress. Sir Ian McKellen is as powerful as ever. Sean Astin delivers his best performance of his life. Every member of the cast is incredible and believable. There is not a single weak link in the cast. The heart that everyone put into these films is clearly visible, and it pays off in this epic conclusion. *Music/Sound: The soundtrack is second to none. Howard Shore proves he is a genius as he continues to build on the musical world he created through the past two films. The music is so essential in this cinematic world; it adds depth to every moment. The sound mixing, sound editing, and sound design are all marvelous. They suck the audience into the world and help grab and hold our attention all throughout the film. The atmosphere feels so undeniably real due to the soundscape. The work the sound designers and foley crew did is incredibly tedious and it shows. They created a masterpiece of sound. *Production Design/Special Effects: The set pieces and weapons, armor, make-up, and more are even more impressive in this film than the previous two. The work that Weta Workshop did is unprecedented and has not been matched since. Every prop and set has so much detail that it feels as real as anything we would see in the real world. The attention to detail in this film is second to none. The special effects, both practical and digital, are groundbreaking. The blending of CGI and real effects is seamless and is many years ahead of its time. This film should be the rule book for how to effectively create a massive film with multiple elements. *Conclusion: "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is a film that has paved the way for fantasy films and all films with a massive scale. It is a masterful work through every single aspect of film. No film before it has been so groundbreaking on so many levels or matched the level of mastery in every aspect of filmmaking. No film after it has quite lived up to the level of perfection this film has achieved. It is for these reasons that it deserves to be part of the discussion for the greatest film ever brought to screen.
10.0~Just more praise brakoholic Sign in Permalink By far the best film of the trilogy. Any doubts I had about Jackson making the Two Towers pretty much solely about the Battle of Helm's Deep were quelled upon seeing the Return of the King. The exclusion of Shelob in the third installment would have upset the pace of the film. Having been a fan of Tolkien's for a long time, sure there are scenes I would have liked to follow the book more closely, but one can always complain about such issues. This film is truly outstanding and everyone and their mother should go see it.
10.0~A worthy final to a great movie-conversion of an epic story ladulaser Sign in Permalink I got to see this third and final movie of the triology about the Ring at the premiere day, thanks to my job connections as a computer technician (what company would show this movie to its customers if the customers weren't geeks?). After sitting through 2 hours of presentation of Netware 6.5 (it was quite fun actually, the speaker made fun of everything), the movie was rolled up, without those annoying commercials that you get if you go to a regular session (that you have to PAY for, on top of that!). Behind me sat this corpulent middle-aged man who was complaining about EVERYthing and thought he knew better than Peter Jackson how a book should be converted into a movie. That mans idea was that all the details from the books should be displayed in the movie and everything should happen exactly the way that the books describe it, so that the book becomes the script in a way. Isn't that stupid? Some things just can't be brought from paper to silver screen. Take thoughts, for example. There are some TV series and B-movies out there where thoughts are whispered by the actor who thinks them, as the screen shows the actor walking back and forth, thus brining you the impression that he is really pondering something that's on his mind. I find that Peter Jackson has done a great job in converting the last book of the triology to movie, although it becomes a bit too much at 3 hours and 20 minutes. He cut 5 chapters from the end of the second movie (compared to the books), and those 5 chapters are now being told in movie number three. I warn you: Do NOT get a Coke or anything that contains caffeine, because half-way through, you will start wanting to go to the restrooms, and there's still a full movies worth of film left to watch! I won't give away the story details for all you people who haven't read the books, but I will say that I'm glad that the movie shows a LOT of celebration & epilogue at the end (I sincerely hope you could guess the ending would be happy in this mother-of-all-fairytales!), just like in the books.
10.0~Looking forward to the extended version on dvd! KatharineP Sign in Permalink Mild spoilers ahead. Like many people, I had very high expectations when I walked into the theater today, but unlike some people who's reviews I've read here, I wasn't disappointed. I loved this film. Sure, there are things that are bothering, like they way certain characters are changed (as in the case of Faramir and Denethor - and Theoden as well, in my opinion) or completely left out (as in the case of Saruman and Gríma). But there is so much beauty in this film which makes up for it. The musical score is amazing. Someone here loathed Howard Shore for writing pompous and sentimental music - I don't understand it. This is the most wonderful soundtrack I have ever heard, except for maybe the one in Fellowship Of The Ring. If this is not rewarded with an Oscar in February, something is very, very wrong. During the first two movies, I was always bothered by the fact that Merry and Pippin were turned into comic figures, simply there to lighten up serious moments. In this movie, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan finally get to work a little more on their characters - characters which I love. And they do it so well. I have to admit, that my absolute favourite moment in the movie was Pippin singing before Denethor while the battle goes on outside. It was a beautiful and very strong scene. Does anyone think that the Academy will remember Billy Boyd when it's time for the Oscars? But there were things that were left out that should not have been, mainly in the ending. There were no explanations to how Faramir, Eowyn or Merry were suddenly healed, there was nothing with Pippin being in Minas Tirith before the battle, and as I said, Saruman and Gríma were left out. Not good. One can only hope there will be more of this in the extended version of the dvd. I'm very much looking forward to it!
10.0~my favorite emmbipi Sign in Permalink To be honest, I'm a total Tolkien fan. Since forever. When I read Hobbit, I was in love. And it continued with more books. I adored the LOTR cartoon and was always sad it did not have the entire trilogy. But now it's here. The entire trilogy. The ending. And I'm thrilled. I loved first two parts, but the last film binds everything together. The basic difference from the other trilogies and what is usually the main problem is the fact that there is a literary original on which the story is based. Here the original is fabulous work of art so it helps a lot. Truth to be told, I always preferred Stryder to Aragorn, but The Return of the King is not only a great story, but a great movie as well.
1.0~Boring JC Danton Sign in Permalink Very boring film, good effects but not 100% by book. A long and boring film with special effect, nothing more. Other parts have the same issue. Its like spider-man or transformers, good idea but a sh*** film. So if u have enough time, I think about 12 hours for whole trilogy and crap Hobbit and u can waste your time for this then go ahead.
10.0~"They seemed above my likes or dislikes, Mr. Frodo." half_light Sign in Permalink An unprecedented cinematic victory. Brilliant, stunning, lovely, endearing. "Like lightning from a clear sky." What else can be said? I feel somewhat disappointed, though, that I have seen the best movie I will ever see at only eighteen years old. There's always DVD, and the Extended Edition. Thank you Mr. Jackson, thank you cast and crew, and thank you John most of all. Who, fifty years from now will know what the movie 'Chicago' was? Fifty years from now, people will read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings to their children and show them the movies. I know I will, if I am so blessed. To those who were determined to hate these movies, I do not hate you. I pity you for missing such an experience. Your world is a good deal darker for not knowing what joy these books and these films can bring you. Maybe one day, when you're older and less cynical, you will discover it for yourself. No-one can discover it for you.
10.0~Nailed it goldbugruffid Sign in Permalink As a huge fan of the books (I must have read the Lord Of the Rings 15 times as a kid), i was sceptical about how this series of movies would go. I was so pleasantly surprised when I saw the movies, and Peter Jackson absolutely nailed this one.The characters were perfectly cast, the screenplay was amazing, and the scenery was outstanding. I could not recommend this enough
10.0~The epic trilogy comes to an end nick-mulder-974-394826 Sign in Permalink The Lord Of The Rings, in my opinion the best trilogy ever made. It has this awesome vibe that gives you chills and you just want to stay focused during the whole movie. The symphonies made during all the scenes only make this more epic. I really recommend to watch how the orchestra made all the symphonies. You can easily find these on Youtube . Return of the king is in my opinion the one with the best effects and action in it. The actors also did an great job with playing their roles at their best so far. This last installment really gives you so much relieve that it's finally over, but also sadness because the movie is so good that you just want it to continue, the battle scenes, the soundtracks, the romance, just everything.
10.0~A story that changed my life fabiopaivareis Sign in Permalink I read the books before the films were made, I was part of a reading group that discussed only the work of Tolkien and all that. The movies, for me, at the time and until today, are amazing. Of course The Return of the King, as a sum of all the finales you have in all those histories told by Tolkien at the same time, is just flawless. I cried in all the ending, as I had cried when I was reading. Those characters are part of my life. This history is part of my life. Some of my best friends are still part of our old reading group, and even my fiancé is the amazing girl that, though we really bet somewhere else, I got to really know in this same group. I think that there aren't some many histories like this one that can connect people like me and my friends so profoundly.
10.0~One of the best films EVER/// liamgoose Sign in Permalink First things first, I am a huge LOTR fan, and a love all of them (even The Hobbit films). I have read all the books and they are one of my favorites (as the Hobbit is my favorite book of all time). LOTR in general are my favorite movie franchise of all time. They all are so well written and directed, but the best of them all (in the Lord of the Rings films as I liked The Desolation of Smaug more by a hair) is Return of the King. Return of the King had the best battle scenes and the best cinematography and acting in it, although they were all well acted. Return of the King, to me, had the best visual effects and the best "bad ass" parts. When Eowyn and Merry take down the Witch King of Angmar, that was one of the best scenes in a movie ever. All in all I can't fathom the love and compassion that I have for this film, if I could give it a 12 I would, but alas I cant. RETURN OF THE KING IS AMAZING. YOU HAVE TO WATCH ALL OF THEM, ESPECIALLY RETURN OF THE KING.
10.0~Awesome!!!! Superb!!!! WOW!!! LaEsquivar Sign in Permalink Of course there are no words to really describe how excellent this movie is. I felt like jumping up and down and screaming in the theater while watching it. After seeing it, I wanted to jump back in line and sit through it again. I saw it prior to winning all of those "little men." I have seen it three times and it was worth every cent! I will probably see it again. I believe anyone who hasn't seen this is cheating themselves horribly. I sat through most of the movie with my mouth gaped open and even shed a tear or two at the end. Not just because it was a great ending but because the whole journey was over. I hated to see it end. Of course Mr. Tolkien wanted it that way. I think peter Jackson is one of the few directors that have made a movie the way the author would have envisioned it to be. Return Of The King was an awesome movie and will go down in history in many positive ways. It is my favorite movie and will be hard to replace.
10.0~My childhood eric-samuelsson Sign in Permalink Troll sat alone on his seat of stone, And munched and mumbled a bare old bone; For many a year he had gnawed it near, For meat was hard to come by. Done by! Gum by! In a cave in the hills he dwelt alone, And meat was hard to come by. Up came Tom with his big boots on. Said he to Troll: 'Pray, what is yon? For it looks like the shin o' my nuncle Tim. As should be a-lyin' in the graveyard. Caveyard! Paveyard! This many a year has Tim been gone, And I thought he were lyin' in the graveyard. My lad,' said Troll, 'this bone I stole. But what be bones that lie in a hole? Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o' lead, Afore I found his shinbone. Tinbone! Skinbone! He can spare a share for a poor old troll, For he don't need his shinbone. Lord Of The Rings is endless and always.
10.0~Best movie ever made (possible spoilers) mwhitmore03 Sign in Permalink There's really not much to say about this movie, other than it is the best movie ever made. Well, it may be tied with The Godfather. Anyway, beyond the amazing cast, magnificent special effects, fantastic score, and stellar sets, this movie actually has a great plot. Thanks, J.R.R. But really, I've read the each book more than once, and this is one of the only movies that I can really say that the movie is even on par with the book from which it is made. Granted, they have taken some liberties with the script, but there is so much in the books that it is to be expected. For those of you who think it is too long, I recommend reading the book and finding out how much longer it technically should have been. The third movie is the best one just because it wraps everything up so seamlessly. I'm a sucker for happy endings, and this is like the ultimate. Thank God Peter Jackson went to New Line and did three movies instead of staying with Miramax who wanted him to make only two. This movie is, in all senses of the word, epic.
9.0~Incredible film from top to bottom valmorphisis Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is the final volume of the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films. This film continues the journey of the odd group of companions consisting of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Austin), Pippen (Billy Boyd), and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). The story picks up where "The Two Towers" left us with Sam and Frodo continuing their journey to destroy the ring of power and the rest of the companions fulfilling each of their individual destinies elsewhere in Middle Earth. The film climaxes during the battle at Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor and the implied final stand for the world of Men. This film embodies the "good vs. evil" theme in one of the most effective applications seen to date. Much like "The Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Two Towers" this film offers incredible writing, cinematography, and editing. The use of setting and sound in this film really deliver the feeling and emotions that the productions staff intended. The setting of the film is Middle Earth, a fictional realm and is really the mountainous regions of New Zealand. The scenery offered is awe inspiring and definitely makes one feel as if it were not from this world. The sound in the film is full of emotion and purpose. You know exactly who is bad, who is good, and what their purpose in the story is just by hearing the sounds offered. Some of the battle scenes have you tricked into thinking you may actually be there. This film sets the standard for the modern day epic battle between good and evil. The characters are well thought out, developed and allow the viewer to develop and almost personal relationship with them. The film is incredible almost any way you analyze it, from the basic components to the acting and beyond. It is a film that any moviegoer should want to see, whether the like fantasy or not.
10.0~As good as everyone says it to be, and with a GREAT ending Dark Eye Sign in Permalink Finally! After waiting for years the big payoff is here and it couldn't be better. Return of the King is a definitive culmination of a journey and have essentially wrapped the trilogy into one big film. Again I walked out the theatre with a big grin and a feeling of light-footedness, much like after watching the first two. It has great character moments akin of The Fellowship of the Ring, and spectacular battle scenes bigger than The Two Towers. But while TT focused more on the world of Men, this time the Hobbits have taken the centre stage, especially that of Frodo and Sam. Memorable visuals are plentiful like the beacon of Minas Tirith, the sight of Orc armies marching out from Minas Morgul, Trolls beating the drums of war, rampaging Mumakils and more. What else can I say about this movie except to gush more about it? I love the book and the movies, and very grateful to both J.R.R Tolkien and Peter Jackson for their respective talents. Those useless movie reviewers who complained that the ending "dragged on" for too long are not worth their salt. Its not even long at all! These guys just reek in their over-glorified short-attention span and they have a "Made in Hollywood" stamped over their foreheads. Since the first two did not have endings, the third film demand proper closure. This film has the dignity to say goodbye to the characters in a proper fashion. After all, when you reach the end of a gigantic NINE hours trilogy, wouldn't YOU want an ending that takes it time to reward its audiences instead of rushing straight into the credits?
10.0~Perfection. Katarina_03 Sign in Permalink Elijah Wood and Sean Astin made history with the following scene. After reading the book i always wanted to see that scene on screen. And when i finally saw it,my heart stopped because it was more than i could ever ask for. The song was perfect. The acting was perfect. Can someone tell me, where the hell is Sean Astin's Oscar?!he deserved it. Sam: (about the ring on the slopes of Mount Doom) Then let us be rid of it... once and for all... Come on Mr. Frodo... I can't carry for you... but I can carry you! Come on! (Picks Frodo up and starts to carry him up the mountain). Best Movie ever.Best Scene ever. Best Line Ever. This movie (and the books) made me believe in human kind again. If some people can create something so beautiful, there is still hope.
10.0~The best movie asaad_mhn Sign in Permalink You can see this movie 50 times and still enjoy it
10.0~A wonderful masterpiece that will surely give the Lord of the Rings series an Academy Award. SmirkingHermitt Sign in Permalink The acting is amazing, the emotion unnerving, and the climax of an entire two years is here. I believe the nominations for Best Picture have been hints that the final episode of the Lord of the Rings will receive it at last. This film is a masterpiece, filled with every emotion, from fear to comedy, and everything in between. Some have said it dwindles. I disagree, if you think of the resolution being too long, just remember that it's the resolution for the end of three 3+ hour movies. It's pretty much expected to have a long resolve. But I do agree that all of these films are a wonderful representation of the books, and the Academy should seriously consider this as all of them combined in one film, and just give it an award. Anyone who's casually interested in movies, books, or just fantasy in general will enjoy, if not love, this movie. Highly recommended, notably honored.
8.0~Entertaining phillips2003-1 Sign in Permalink All of the Lord of the Ring movies were good. I enjoyed watching them in theatres with my brother on New Years Eve. However, like Star Wars and other movies and books, the theme of the movie is shallow. It's the usual Good verses Evil theme. "Destroy the ring to save Middle Earth"! I liked the Return of the King the best, but it really fell apart at the end. It was annoying how Frodo destroyed the ring and the next half-hour of the movie was just stuff. But I got a good laugh about the orgie scene with the hobits, the old man, the blonde long haired dude, the brunette and the redhead. That was probably the gayest scene (not that there is anything wrong with that, it's fine if that's who you are). So I give this movie a B and give it entertaining.
8.0~Bit of a disappointment after the first two slothropgr Sign in Permalink The only one of the trilogy I have serious problems with. Not that I haven't watched the Extended DVD many times, but I only saw it once in the theater, unlike the previous (thrice each). Generally great considering that PJ is cramming half the entire trilogy into one flick, but to me he blew the deaths and departures pretty completely. All of 'em. Beginning with Saruman, who dies like a cheap thug (Charles Bronson in "4 For Texas" died the same way). C'mon, Pete, we're talking about one of the 3 most powerful beings in Middle Earth here! Stab-plummet-splash?? That's IT??? He should've fallen like a comet and Worm should've at least burst into flames when he stabbed him. And since he dies at Orthanc (a good choice), the tower should've been thrown down at the same time, providing a good bookend for the (first) finale. Second is Theoden, who dies according to the book and very well--then is totally completely utterly FORGOTTEN! Not borne from the field in high honor (30 seconds more) or even mentioned. Poor old guy. Then we have Sauron, who bursts like a bubble. Wow. A few seconds for the master villain of a 10 hour flick. Where was the towering lightning-crowned figure of shadow looming over Mordor and stretching out a vast impotent hand to the West? Or at least loping over the hills hauling a steamer trunk of odd socks? At least he took most of Mordor with him. And the Nazgul--what DID happen to them? First thing I did when the DVD came out was slo-mo through that sequence and it STILL isn't clear. Snap-crackle-oops, no pop. At least the Witch King went out in style because they followed the book. More on him in a moment. Finally Frodo's departure--WHAAATT? I had to explain to a friend of mine who hadn't read the trilogy why he had to leave, because the movie sure doesn't make it clear. He mentions that the wound from Weathertop "has never healed" but it looks about as serious as a mild case of indigestion. He shoulda been a lot sicker than that, and in the book he was. Finally we come to the bit that angers me more than any of this: when the Witch King breaks Gandalf's staff. What kind of idiocy is that?? I refer to my previous statement about the most powerful beings in Middle Earth--Saruman, Sauron and Gandalf (they're all Maia, f'Pete's sake)! The Witch King would've had less chance against G than a hobbit against a mumakil, yet according the beginning when Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff the movie is telling us that the WK is more powerful than G. Nonsense. The Don knew this, that's why he cut the confrontation short. Fortunately the DVD is banded so I can skip that part. Despite all this it's a fitting finale to the trilogy which I am enjoying more now. Maybe I'm finally getting used to Sam's whining.
4.0~huh? slerby Sign in Permalink I liked this trilogy. I did. But if you have NOT read these books, they make NO sense. I don't know anyone else in the movies but the main characters, and the only storyline I was ever able to follow was the one with Sam and Frodo as they were doing the only significant thing in all 3 of them. To me, the basic idea here was to take the one ring and put it in the fire of mount doom. So how are many of the other things relevant? What are their purpose? I'm not going to waste time writing about all the thing that didn't make sense nor am I going to post in all 3 trilogies about it. for example... who is this other guy (also a king) who is trying to burn his other son on the wood and oil, and where is the relevance to the rest of the movie? and the other guy (also a king) not allowing his daughter to fight, she sneeks away to do so and ends up killing the guy with no face and cool mask? I had to ask my girlfriend what the relevance was of Aragorn becoming King. There were other kings. She said he was the king of all men... ????? who cares? this way he could bring back the dead guys to help in another insignificant fight that they were all outnumbered in again???? The girl fighting was more significant than that because as the man with no face and cool mask said "no MAN can kill me" hmmm... If they had all just focused their energy on helping Sam and Frodo make it to Mount Doom, the rest of the stuff would have become insignificant like I thought it was anyways. the 3rd and final chapter here... what's the deal with dragging it on for an additional 1/2 or more after the ring was tossed in the fire? Totally pointless. Could you imagine what some great directors (and PJ is not one... he took a great story - so i've heard - and put it on film) could do with 3.5 hours + in films? Just think what Lucas and his directors would be able to give in being able to allow much more dialogue and emphasis on storyline and back history if he could have 3.5 hours + to put it on film.
10.0~The best of the 3; of the year; of all fantasy jboy2309 Sign in Permalink Three days later my mind is still full of the rich visuals and epic scenes of ROTK. The picture was awesome in its enormous scale. The script was great, the acting (particularly McKellen, John Noble's Denethor, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis) was superb and the pacing the best of the three movies. If i have a single gripe it is that given the size of the subject matter the whole picture flew by too quickly! The fantastic Battle of Pelennor Fields swept by in an hour that seemed minutes with every scene something to behold, filled with stunning, original, jaw-dropping visuals. As a result from the build-up of the siege of Minas Tirith to the breaking of the gates by Grond seemed a tad rushed. Hopefully the EE will flesh this out. The absence of (spoiler) the Mouth of Sauron was also missed, but again he should appear in the EE. PJ must not give up on The Hobbit. He MUST make it, and only he can.
10.0~Lord of The Rings luccille Sign in Permalink I love everything in the movie! The fun parts are so sweet...i love to see the four hobbits together...The love stories are so beautiful. There is friendship, adventure, heroes, villains, death, fear... I can't decide which one is my favorite moment in the movie or in the books, but i can say that when (in the movie) Sam carries Frodo on his back...the music (Howard Shore is amazing!),the lines,it's completely unbelievable...I cry my heart out every time i watch it! lol... This trilogy (and also every book related with this world) changed my life. And that's it.Nothing that i can say or do will ever be enough to explain the impact that they had (movies and books) on my life. I think LOTR is a masterpiece. It made me cry,laugh... It's the best movie ever made,and it doesn't matter how old i am, and when the books were written,and when the movies were made,because i know that they will always have a special place in my heart =)
10.0~Amazing, magnificent, stupendous afnaste Sign in Permalink I saw this last night at at special reserved showing full of gamer geeks. ROTK was so incredible that FOTR and TTT pale by comparison. I didn't think any villain could've been scarier than the Balrog of Morgoth, but Shelob the First Spider sent chills up my spine and unholy slimy things crawling down it! The burden of carrying the One Ring really takes its toll on Frodo, Sam and even Gollum, if you thought that Gollum could not appear even more f*cked up the head, just wait til you see him. The epic battle scenes in ROTK are quite possibly the best I have ever seen, with Aragorn's forces and Sauron's armies beating seventeen shades of hell out of each other, with each side gaining and losing the upper hand several times, and hordes after hordes of reinforcements for both sides appearing again and again. The battering ram Gron was unbelieveably creepy-looking and totally cool at the same time, it looked alive and like it had been coughed up straight from hell. I give this 10 out of 10 because that is the highest score available when it actually ranks around a 12. The only gripe I have about ROTK is POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS cutting Saruman out of the theatrical release completely. But he will be in the extended DVD come November 2004.
10.0~There are no words to sum this up... stop_look_listen Sign in Permalink What a film this was. There are so many good things in this that it is impossible to list them all in this review but let me start by saying that I don't understand how anyone could have walked out the cinema and not have felt more than a little conflicted emotionally. I cried at numerous points in the movie and at the end I just sat in the cinema and realised 'this is it - that's it over now'. I've grown to love the characters even more than I did when I read the books now and it was hard saying goodbye especially in a film of the calibre. It had everything, battles, romance, drama, angst - it was a true film in every sense of the word. The revelations in this movie though were Sean Astin and Billy Boyd - I will be disappointed if one of them doesn't get an oscar nod (although I doubt they will due to the oscars tending to shy away from movies like this). Both of these actors brought that little bit extra that just shone in a film full of marvelous performances. I defy anyone to watch the scene where Sam finds Frodo in Shelbob's lair and not feel a bit choked up, or to watch the scene where Pippin has to say goodbye to Merry and not have to remind themselves that they can't cry yet because there;s still three hours of movie left. The scene with Faramir, Denethor & Pippin also deserves a mention for being one of the most eery scenes I've witnessed when Denethor tells Faramir he wished he had died and then the song as the battle wages on in the background. Breathtaking but upsetting. This is an amazing movie - I didn't even notice the length and would have happily say for longer if necessary. Go watch it and you will not be disappointed as this is a masterpiece.
10.0~And that, kids, is how to make a movie... darlee-1 Sign in Permalink Exquisite, breathtaking film making, loved every frame of it. Peter Jackson has now officially earned a place in history as the mastermind behind The Greatest Trilogy Ever Made(tm), and considered as a whole, the first true cinematic masterpiece of the 21st Century. Ranks alongside the very best cinema of the last 100 years, and will be talked about and revisited for that many years to come. Of course it will probably be robbed at the Oscars, but that's OK - history will be the judge and history will be kinder. Perfection.
1.0~What in the heck is so good about this movie elecander Sign in Permalink This movie is not great its barley border-line good. The only two reason I cant think this was rated so high was the extremely high budget on 3D-animation and the fact that people are so easily enticed by the name and actors. Now I am not insulting the books as I have never read them. But other than what I stated what makes this movie so "great"? Is it the acting? I don't really think Orlando Bloom can preform any other role (take a look at both The Lord Of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean) Is it Climax? I think even the people who didn't even read the book knew that from the first half of the first movie knew that the ring would be destroyed Is it the Characters? It had all the basic characters for all movie storyline the only entertaining and not bland character was Golem What is it that makes you think its in the league with Schindler's List and Casablanca I don't claim to know what the best movie ever is but i know this movie dose not rank high in greatness it only high in its budget.
10.0~The best possibly end pabloroldanlopez Sign in Permalink A finishing touch for an almost perfect trilogy. focused mainly in the completion of the journey of Frodo and Sam also closes phenomenally the way of the King of Gondor, Aragorn. While there's some substantial differences with the book of Tolkien this IS an exciting movie and maintaining the quality of its predecessors. The Return of the King delivers all share action-adventure drama that both die-hard Tolkien fans and followers of the version of Peter Jackson expected. Perhaps one might criticize certain extent some problems concerning the quality of certain scenes containing CGI but clearly this does not diminish the quality of the whole, the film is undoubtedly the best finish possible. Anyone who wants a little more history must necessarily see the extended version presented on DVD and Blu ray where you will find a series of extra information that will help greatly to complete this journey through Middle Earth.
10.0~The best jasonmg99 Sign in Permalink Okay now this final version of the trilogy could not be any better. The previous two towers may have been a small battle. But what we have here is a world war involving hundreds and thousands of beings. I loved every moment of the film and could watch it every day. What I did miss about the trilogy are the extended versions of the films. I desperately want to own the whole extended set upon the release of the Return of the King and take the whole thing with me when i die and go to heaven. Those who have seen the trilogy I'm sure are obsessed with it and won't let it go. Especially those who like action, as this involves the most characters on screen during the siege of gondor and the ultimate battle on the fields. I'm sure the trilogy will win the most awards. It better Way over 10/10
10.0~Absolutely incredible elanorsam Sign in Permalink I thought this is just an incredible movie. It's so amazing, and splendid, and emotional, and moving and just glorious. The reviewers who said it was operatic are correct. There is a visual grandeur and epic majesty to this movie that is stunning. The movie is perfectly balanced between these huge spectacular moments and the small intimate moments. The acting is amazing in this movie. First of all, I was completely blown away by Elijah Wood. I thought he was very good in the first two movies, but any good actor could have done what he did. But he crossed over to greatness in this movie IMO. I'm still stunned by how perfect he was. Sean Astin was wonderful. Just fantastic. (And boy howdy does he know how to cry!) As good as they are separately, all the Frodo/Sam scenes together are so intense and so wonderful. Billy Boyd is amazing in this movie. He has lots of great scenes. Viggo is just as good as in the first two movies, as is Ian McKellen. Bernard Hill really comes into his own as an inspirational leader of men. Miranda Otto is just great. Dominic Monaghan doesn't have a lot of scenes, but makes the most of them. David Wenham had a scene that made me cry. Some of my favorite moments from the book are gone, and I hope they're in the EE, but nonetheless I still was completely enthralled by the movie. I had tears running down my face at the end of it. (I actually had tears in my eyes four or five times in the movie.) I felt emotionally drained when it was over, and can't wait to see it again. (And there are NOT too many endings. For Pete's sake, this is the wrap up of a 10 hour epic with multiple characters and plots.)
9.0~heartbreakingly close to perfection TheMightyN Sign in Permalink In the old days when Ben-Hur and Cleopatra came out, they were over three hours and you got an intermission in the middle to relax and regroup. That's what LOTR3 needed! The human mind can only watch drama for so long, no matter how cool it may look. There is a limit. I loved this film. I said "wow" out loud many times during it, but the end, my god the end!!! Arrggghhhh!!!! It just goes far beyond what humans are capable of tolerating! It took too long for them to get up mount Doom, there were too many Orcs and the dramatic conflicts just repeated themselves. LOTR 1 - 10/10 LOTR 2 - 6/10 LOTR 3 - 7/10
9.0~Third Times the Charm! ForReal84 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best film of the year. In fact it is the best film that I've seen in a long time. It has some of the most amazing special effects that have even been captured on screen. In the third and final installment Frodo and company conclude their epic adventure. I don't think there is anything bad that I can say about this film it is basically amazing. So many times big budgeted films get lost in the story and focus more one the special effects and the action sequences, but in this case the story line is just as important. All of the performances that are turned in by the talented actors deserve some type of recognition; I believe that they did something that a lot of actors often try to do, they try not to get lost in the story and give their characters a chance, here that's just what the actors did. Throughout this trilogy we cheered for their characters, we wished them only the best. The third installment in this series is an excellent ending to one of the most cinematic masterpieces of our time. I'm so happy to see that this film is finally winning some of the highest praises in Hollywood. I wish that Sean Astin had received a more attention for his performance; it is one of the best performances of the year. As usual Elijah Wood turned in another perfect performance. The battle scenes in this film are astonishing; I literally sat with my jaw on the floor. Never before and never again, will a beloved story capture the hearts of so many people. Peter Jackson has done it again; his vision has confined what so many have dreamed. The Lord of the Rings is a once in a lifetime achievement, it is a masterpiece it has raised the bar for this type of film. In this case it is apparent that sometime the third time really is the charm.
10.0~I loved it!!! fiddleswim Sign in Permalink So many scenes were just how I had imagined them. It was great to see them come to life on the screen. I'm really happy that Peter Jackson and team made all three movies. They're so great. I can't wait for the extended DVD! Go see it!
10.0~How can 200 minutes pass by so fast? skimbleshanks Sign in Permalink Return of the King is everything I wanted this Trilogy to be. It stays truer to the story than the previous two films did, the only noticeable omission being the character of Saruman, other than that, what was cut wasn't really all that missable. Mind you, I'll be the first in line to get the extended DVD when it's finally available. This is truly an ensemble cast where no one person is more important than the other, only certain characters hold more weight. Gandalf was more prominent than ever here, and it was good to see him. Viggo Mortensen seems to be fitting the role of Aragorn better all the time, so it'll be a shame to realize that there are no further instalments coming out to enjoy him in. Gimli and Legolas play off each other so well here, while we don't get to see their friendship develops and carries on after the war, you get the feel for that part of the storyline. All of the hobbits were outstanding, particularly Pippin who really comes into his own. The movie is a little slow to start, but once the action gets going, fasten your seatbelt and hang on for the ride. Usually by the two hour point in any movie I'm looking at my watch. Not this time. Peter Jackson truly deserves Best Director kudos, as well as Best Picture.
10.0~Lord Of The Rings ssconservative Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson is absolutely amazing! No matter what Peter Jackson is working on, you can be sure to see excellent craftsmanship. Lord Of The Rings seems to be a placed where everyone would like to visit. From the Elvish language, that everyone wanted to learn to speak. Due to the eloquence when the actors spoke. Right down to the amazing sets. He is able to take you into a world beyond your expectations. The actors did a wonderful job in bringing their characters to life. Each actor was dedicated to portraying their characters. The costumes were wonderfully designed, making one want to be apart of this magical world and who wouldn't want to live in the Shire. I recommend seeing Lord Of The Rings. You will not be disappointed. It was beyond the minds expectations.
10.0~Simply the best Vrieskist Sign in Permalink This is by far the most beautiful, entertaining and touching movie I've ever seen. There is only one disadvantage, there will be not be another Lord of the Rings movie next year :'( Score 10/10
10.0~Phenomenal ending to the trilogy ! recognize187 Sign in Permalink Just like the two previous this one explores a action packed adventure/fantasy world with a extremely well crafted story line thanks to JRR Tolkien books. Not every adaptation from book to movie lives up to the hype but let's just say this one is relatively close. If Tolkien was alive today i think he would certainly be pleased about the outcome of this brilliant trilogy. This movie has all the right elements andis a boys dream and the entertainment value makes this move next to perfect for it's genre. I don't need to brag the movie speaks for it self. Eleven Oscars is all time record high and only two other movies has reached that benchmark. This is a true adventure classic and i truly envy those who have not yet seen this remarkable movie they have a amazing movie experience awaiting them. Enjoy 9.3/10
10.0~Tolkien in our hearts!!! galadriel8 Sign in Permalink And it sure is beautiful this movie. I sat on the premiere trying to keep the tears from coming because if one tear came all of them would be unleashed. The most important thing in the movie was that so much from the book came into this production. Great work Peter.... Thank you on the behaf of the true Tolkien fans, the movies are really important but Tolkien will always move our hearts in a special way...
3.0~Just too LONG!!!! ivan_leung888 Sign in Permalink If I can only describe the whole movie with one word only, that word will surely be "LONG". It is 4 hours and 11 minutes long with a predictable ending. It is such a pain to wait for the climax. The climax is no longer exciting no matter how perfect it is, as the audience has already suffered for 3 hours already. While I watched this movie, the whole cinema was happy about the ending. Not because of it had a good ending but because it finally ended. It is such a waste to film this movie in New Zealand, as the scenes are all computer-composed. It is also very difficult to memorize all the character, places names. The script is basically composed by a group of proper nouns which are unreal. The only thing I like about the movie is the costume that Gandalf wore. It is purely white which I think is cool. It might be great if it is shown on TV in episodes, but surely not worth to spend 4 hours in a cinema for this movie.
9.0~The greatest achievement in the history of cinema. krullie Sign in Permalink I'm writing this the day after I went to the Lord of the Rings marathon. Preparing for this I was afraid that I might not make it through the nine hours of film. However, the brilliance of this epic kept me more than awake. It doesn't happen often that I find myself staring at the screen with my mouth wide open, unable and unwilling to blink, trying to cover every square inch of the image, this way hoping not to miss any genius filmmaking. Because that is what this is. Sheer genius. When I say this I don't mean The Return of the King in particular, but all three parts, which are in fact one movie. When you think of the book by Tolkien, it's almost impossible to imagine that anyone would ever be able to turn this into a movie. But one studio had the guts to trust in Peter Jackson and this was rewarded with what will go down in history as the greatest achievement in cinema of all time. I know this is a bold statement, but it simply is. Everything is soaked with quality, from the screenplay to the acting, from the absolutely fantastic art direction to the stunning special effects which blend in seamless with the ''live'' action. The great battles are completely overwhelming, especially the jaw-dropping olifaunt attack. All this makes The Return of the King a fantastically fitting crown, to the previous two parts. Everything in this film works. The drama, the tension, the suspense and ofcourse the action. All this is a due to the craftsmanship of Peter Jackson as a director. The build up to every scene, if it's drama, packed with emotion, or action, packed with spectacle, is so subtle and effective, that almost every emotion is being addressed, which relates the audience to the characters in the film. This makes The Return of the King a fanatstically fitting crown, to the previous two parts. And that is what makes the Lord of the Rings so powerful, and now I mean the book. Middle-earth is symbolic for our earth. I know I'm not bringing new things to light saying this, but it is where the affection with the story of so many people originates. The enduring battle between different people, good against evil, values like love, hate, vengeance, pride and trust all come to pass, leading to a self-reflective work of art. Peter Jackson found a way of translating the epic novel to pictures. Beautifully shot pictures, which deserve to swoop the oscars and which will be remembered until the end of our era.
7.0~The majestic return of the king! magnus-bergstrom Sign in Permalink This film is like nothing you have ever seen before, especially not cinematicaly speaking! First of all, my guess is that the special effects of the movie will last at least 10 to 15 years without being considered old, or at least "worn". 10 to 15 years is a long time in the art of cinema, but this movie really has potential. The only effect that was a bit crappy was the animation of the undead army. I think they could have done it better by considering using a white color instead of green when animating their "auras"... It's also no hard guess that the whole trilogy is going to become for the children of today what "Star Wars" was to us in our childhood. The movie is simply breathtaking. Although I like the more slow and laid back parts of the trilogy rather than the action packed parts, the action sequences where really enjoyable! I'm sorry to say that I thought of the battle at Pelennor as to short, but that might just have been because of the thrilling speed the whole movie was going at. Also, I think that the same battle will be one of the parts that has been edited in the "Extended Edition". There may be some disappointments for fans of the book to be found in the movie. Some parts not appropriate to their hopes and expectations from the book, and also some parts changed or deleted completely. The greatest hope for those fans is to be found in the mentioned "Extended Edition", but the persons will also have to accept that these are the movies and not the literary story. I am one of those pretty big fans who has read the trilogy and additional books about Middle-Earth a couple of times, but I knew right after having seen "The Fellowship of the Ring" that I have to accept the movies as they are... And as movies, they truly are great!
10.0~I'm in denial Noi Sign in Permalink I can't believe that around December this year we won't be having any LOTR movie. I'm in denial and am convinced that Peter Jackson will make a new movie to tie up all the loose ends. They should have made this into an epic miniseries. Too many things left unsaid and undone in the Return of the King. Not that it's not a good movie -- it's the best I've seen so far.. and as the finale of the LOTR trilogy it does go with a BANG rather than a whimper that Matrix Revolutions did. LOTR die hard fans want more.... that's why we are waiting for the extended version of the video. We need some closure...
10.0~the best film of all time. I have never see anything like this one. lakshya2004 Sign in Permalink i have red the book 2 time and watch the movie over 50 time. i really love this film. First i didn't like any of the three but i don't know how it happened and i began to like this movie. Return of the king had been fill the trilogy as the best trilogy of all time. Return of the king have put Lord of the Rings on top of my top 10 movies of all time. Return of the king has excellent direction it put the Peter Jackson on top of his other films. Excellent visual effect better than Titance, Star Wars, and The Matrix. The writing is a masterpiece , it's hardly to adotpe the writing like this and the editing is mind-blowing.A brilliant aperformance; Liv Tyler and Miranda Otto give the one of the Best Supporting Actress performance of all time. Andy Serkies and Sean Astin give the best performance of year. Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom give the best breakthrough performance. But i am disappoint about the one thing that they entirely cut the Saruman, the movie second villain behind the Gollum.
10.0~One word - Superb cross_jon Sign in Permalink Nearly everything that has been said about this film was correct. The visuals were amazing, the story was mostly consistant with the original plot and when small things were changed; I feel it made for a more visceral story. The only thing that's been said that wasn't right was that those who have been commenting for weeks that it was going to be "over-rated" or "garbage" were 100% WRONG. Incredible effort to make the whole thing go off like it did - thanks to PJ, the entire cast and the visuals crew at WETA. Look forward to seeing your work in Kong as well as in the Narnia series.
10.0~Greatest conclusion ever!! ariel_kathryn2000 Sign in Permalink No trilogy in history has ever had as great a conclusion as this movie is. I can't say a lot about it, since I just saw it today, on the opening day. I don't want to spoil it. However, the special effects, the cinematography, the acting, and everything was just absolutely breath-taking. Gondor was awesome. Mordor was just like the pits of hell. And it all fit perfectly. Tolkien would have been proud!
1.0~Return of the King sucks as a movie but is good as a watch ammadwaheed87 Sign in Permalink This movie is overrated and frankly sucks as a film. It has very few elements of a good film and was toooooo long. Anyone can make a good movie in about four hours. The trick is to stay under three hours and still have a forceful impact. The movie had too many 'fronts'. There were frodo-sam-gollum, aragorn-dead people, mary-rohirran, and gandalf-pippin. The movie is good entertainment-if you're willing to sit long enough. LOTR freaks have kept giving this movie a 10, making a mockery of the voting. No thought is actually being given during voting, and personally I think people should just give it a one just to counteract the false voting.
10.0~Appropriate Conclusion BigEdLB Sign in Permalink ROTK was the appropriate finale for the Rings Trilogy. Peter Jackson seemed to understand how to deal with all things coming together properly. These movies will be watched and enjoyed for years. At last! Poor Frodo and Bilbo are at peace, Sam got his Rosie, and Aragorn his Arwen.
10.0~Epic, Brilliant, Thrilling! gthistle Sign in Permalink This hair-raising and action packed film may have some fans choosing the quietly dramatic second installment as their favorite but, everyone must agree that this is one of the finest movies ever made. In every way it meets the audiences expectations and surpasses them. The battle sequences set a new standard for both action scenes and visual effects. All will also agree the old-world theatrical choice of multiple formal endings to the story lags a bit but, the smile stayed on this viewer's face to the bitter end. Only the very cynical will not be left breathless by this fantastic and stunning work.
4.0~It's a highly overrated film. DeepJedi Sign in Permalink My comment here is merely an effort to lead the ignorant, fawning masses to the water, but I have no faith whatsoever that any of them will drink of it. The biggest bone of contention I have is with the tiresomely oft-repeated nonsense that books cannot be adapted accurately to the screen. To attempt to defend Peter Jackson and these films with this claptrap is particularly misguided. Does not a picture speak a thousand words? Has not Peter Jackson used ten hours of pictures? By that measure, he could have covered Tolkien's trilogy 300 times over! To have been given ten hours and such a huge budget, was an unprecedented opportunity but what did Jackson do with it? He made his own interpretation. He got to make these three films because *Tolkien's* The Lord of the Rings demanded it. It wasn't right to use the opportunity to spend the time and money making his own hacked-up version; to *change* the story, alter characters, omit characters, change the locations of events, *make up* various events. That he did all this was sheer hubris – but since he's made profits, he's gotten away with it and only Tolkien's faithful are saddened and sickened. Bear in mind the money and success that Jackson has reaped by climbing on Tolkien's shoulders, having assured fans that he would remain faithful to the book. To those who really think books (let alone long books) cannot be accurately adapted to the screen, I say take a long hard look at Richard Boleslawski's Les Miserables (1935). Adapted by W.P Lipscomb, Victor Hugo's huge novel (longer than The Lord of the Rings) is faithfully covered in just 108 minutes. Peter Jackson had over five times that, so there is absolutely no excuse for altering the story in any way. I'm absolutely certain that any director in the business could have achieved movies at least as good as Jackson's given the same opportunity; and any director that had the brains to stick to the proper story would have produced *better* ones. The Lord of the Rings is apparently the second most popular book after the Holy Bible, which, I would say, suggests that Tolkien writes a story a tad better than a certain Peter who?
10.0~Simply One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made kennyt11685 Sign in Permalink To keep it short and simple, only 2 movies all time where better than The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King: Godfather, and Casablanca. The graphical effects where amazing as was the screenplay, I could have asked for no better way to end that series than with a movie like that.
8.0~Good, solid movie but let's not kid ourselves. garrettconnors Sign in Permalink Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King; the third chapter and final chapter of the epic trilogy. It was a good movie. Not a great one. At times it was a bit melodramatic and trite. I encourage people to see it, but Top 20 of all time worthy? -lets not kid ourselves. Didn't I see this sceene in LoTR 2?
8.0~A Classic that Will Always be Cherished! uoqytcmbv Sign in Permalink Masterpiece doesn't even begin to describe this LOTR movie. Gorgeous costumes, lighting, actors. Such a high quality movie that it could stand on it's own even without the soundtrack (a good rating test in my book)! Without writing a spoiler, the story builds up in such a way that the characters line up perfectly with Tolkien's legend. Can stand on it's own as a single movie or as part of the trilogy. One of the best classics.
10.0~Nice movie m-v-tkalich-630-920509 Sign in Permalink One of the greatest movies of all the times! The extended version named "Director's cut" is definitely must-see, although it is not a director's cut at all.
10.0~Best of three. Citizen_Cam Sign in Permalink It's been two years since The Fellowship of the Ring first hit cinema screens, and one year since The Two Towers continued the journey of Frodo Baggins as he delivers the Ring of Power to its destruction at Mount Doom. And now, finally, after years of waiting and waiting, we finally have a conclusion. And what a conclusion! Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his stalwart companion Sam (Sean Astin) are still on the path to Mordor, accompanied by the slimy creature Gollum, who now plots to get the ring (his 'precious'back from Frodo. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), must claim the throne of Gondor from its steward, Denethor (John Noble) in order to defeat Sauron's forces. The movie looks amazing. And I do mean amazing. The Battle of Helm's Deep in last year's instalment was one of the best battle sequences ever filmed; the siege of Minas Tirith in this film blows it out of the water. With thousands upon thousands of orcs pouring into the White City, defended only by a comparative handful of warriors, I gasped in wonder at the spectacle. Aragorn's undead army is also handled very well, and the scene in which they sweep through the battlefield is spectacular, not to mention just plain cool. The creepiest bit of the film is also special-effects based; Frodo's encounter with Shelob, a giant spider. I hate spiders, and Shelob is so well done, and the sequence so well-directed, that the bit where she stalks Frodo, silently, freaked me out beyond belief. One of the best character bits is the disintegration of Denethor. Having lost one son, Boromir, in the first part of the story, he almost loses his other, less favoured son, Faramir (David Wenham) here. When he believes Faramir is dead and places him on a funeral pyre while his city burns around him, is great storytelling and terrific acting on the part of John Noble, who does a great job of making us believe Denethor goes around with his knickers on his head most of the time. The Lord of the Rings is one movie, cut into three. But of the three, The Return of the King is the best. There is just so little to dislike about the movie I am almost tempted to give it a perfect score. However, there are, as always a few minor quibbles. The absence of Saruman is one, as the role he plays in the book is not insignificant. As is the loss of Wormtongue, his servant, who in the book kills the old wizard. In the movies, it seems, Wormtongue (Brad Dourif in the 2nd film) is confined to simply sitting there and cowering. Also, the ending of the film is too long, with several spots where the credits could be inserted before they finally are. But both these transgressions are acceptable &#8211; the first because, good as the Scouring of the Shire is, it didn't really serve a narrative purpose in Tolkein's original. And the second is allowable because, quite simply, Tolkien didn't know when to stop, and the movie honours that. Peter Jackson has made an epic that will stand the test of time. It will never be remade and is unlikely ever to be topped. A century from now, people will still be watching it, still marvelling at it and the world Jackson and Tolkein, two men set apart by time, created together. Good-o-meter rating: 9.5/10 Special Note: The extended DVD edition, while it still doesn't have the Scouring of the Shire, does have Saruman's death at the hands of Wormtongue. For the inclusion of this, plus more kick-arse scenes, is worthy enough for me to do what I never do. The extended version earns 10/10 on the good-o-meter. Don't tell anyone.
10.0~Great Action, Great Story, Great Movie! jharvey-4 Sign in Permalink "LOTR: Return of the King" marks the final and perhaps the best film in Peter Jackson's stunningly successful adaptation of Tolkien's much-revered trilogy. Keep in mind that this was a story that many scholars, fans, and film industry hawks assumed would never be done to the satisfaction of multiple generations of Tolkien aficionados and fanatics (especially since these films never received the official endorsement of Tolkien's estate as managed by his son, Christopher Tolkien). And sure, there are gaffes (the worst being the unsatisfactory way this film deals with the evil wizard Saruman), but none are so egregious that the legions of fans felt they had to boycott Jackson's trilogy. In fact, all three films have managed to remain close enough to the books to keep the hardcore fans' respect while using the strengths of the cast, special effects, and a well-written screenplay to keep the story accessible to the millions who have never read the books but loved the movies nonetheless. "Return of the King" not only maintains the high standard set in the previous films, but easily surpasses it. While no one has gone out of their way to praise the acting in the previous two films, the performances of Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Sam in "Return of the King" certainly deserve a mention. For those of you who love the battle scenes (and I happen to be a bit of a battle scene junkie) you will not be disappointed here. The assault on Gondor is breathtaking and creative. Unlike the tediously long fight scenes in the final two "Matrix" movies, "Return of the King" smartly threads drama in and amongst the clashing swords, flying debris, and charging steeds. All that said, viewers should be aware that the impressive feat of wrapping up the trilogy requires three and a half hours of viewing time. Sure, the vast majority of the film flies by, but it's something to keep in mind as you're planning the rest of your Saturday afternoon. I say 'vast majority' because the final scenes drag out a bit and the movie seems to end several times before the credits actually roll. When I went to see the movie, many people in the audience stood up not once, but twice, because what felt like the end of the film faked them out. Last but not least, kudos to New Line for having the financial and creative courage to film all three big-budget films back to back in New Zealand. It was gutsy risk that could have hurt the company a great deal had the first movie flopped.
10.0~Amazing Qonas Sign in Permalink This movie was and is, quite simply, a life-changing experience. Nothing tops this movie, at all. It may be 3hours+ long, but I was on the edge of my seat shaking with adrenaline the entire time. All hail the Return of the King!
7.0~A Solid Film, but very overrated groundalm Sign in Permalink This is probably the best sequel made in recent years, but in my mind does not measure up to another American blockbuster, star wars. It does not rival the quality of Return of the Jedi. And this movie rated third all time? Absolute blaspheme. The novels were designed to tell the story about corruption and power, yet the movie deserts to extravagant special effects and goes completely against the message of the movie. It extends approximately an hour longer than it has to, without proper cuts being made. The end half-hour seems to whimsical, using the same technique of cutting to a whimsical look over and over, making it boring and pointless. I got tired at the end, I didn't care anymore. Don't get me wrong, this movie is by no means bad, it should be held in high esteem, but top 100 all time, that a push, top 10, absolute bull. I cannot believe enough ignorant people gave this movie a ten.
10.0~Excellent time at the movies! akiva96 Sign in Permalink This was an outstanding rendering of the final installment of LOTR. Though some liberties (minor for the most part) were taken with the story this film held together well and made 3 hours and 20 minutes seem like an hour and a half. Many have commented on the "multiple endings" and the slow pace of the last 20 minutes, but I think these scenes tied the movie together and left a sense of closure for the story (as it did with the books). I give it a ten and may go see it again this week...
5.0~Good Movie..but bad editing at the end Jedi-51 Sign in Permalink The ending of this movie just went on and on....very boring, plus the begining was very slow as well. Many Star Wars rips...Elepants = AT Walkers in Empire.....kings death vaders death in ROTJ ("you have already saved me!").... good movie, but not great!!
10.0~Greatest movie of all time! faiknadir Sign in Permalink What can I say? All the people must watch this at least once a year. I watch The Return of the King when I was sick, happy, bored or sad. I will always be thankful with my father because of showed me Peter Jackson's masterpiece.
10.0~Two things TribalWarriorPrincess Sign in Permalink First of all, did anyone notice that there was a reference to Star Wars: Return of the Jedi in this movie? Eowyn: No, I'm going to save you. Theoden: You already did. In Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, there was a scene with dialogue very similar to that. Luke Skywalker: No, I have to save you. Anakin Skywalker\Darth Vader: You already have. Second, I have an alternate scene for when Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are in the cave and Gollum is trying to get the ring: Frodo holds the ring above the lava. Frodo Baggins: You want this? Gollum growls. Frodo Baggins: Come get it then! Drops the ring. Gollum: NO! NO! MY PRECIOUS! Jumps in after the ring.
10.0~BEST TRILOGY MOVIE sbobetasia Sign in Permalink This is the best Action Fantasy Movie Trilogy so far.. I am a big fan of The Lord Of The Rings since kid. I can't count how many times i watch this movie.. I never get bored watch LOTR again and again.. The Story is great, Character is so awesome and the moral of the story super cool too.. Thanks for this great movie !!
10.0~simply amazing queenerylee Sign in Permalink I was overwhelmed by this film. I felt like an evil little wormtongue when I saw the amazing battles and the amazing EVERY thing. I cried like a little baby throughout the entire film. The energy IS splendid for this film. This movie does it for me. I have to say that the Lord of the Rings trilogy to me is what the Star Wars trilogy is to my parents. I am proud to say, look at this amazing epic in my generation. This is a giant step in the right direction for epic movie making. On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 15. Mad crazy and awesome. Great job crew and cast of LORD OF THE RINGS.
10.0~The film that shall never be forgotten haris_manda Sign in Permalink *CONTAINS VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF Spoiler, GOOD TO GO* I've read most of the "hated" "reviews" for this film, and it all comes to one : Movie ain't created by the book. For God sake, do you depend so much on the book that you can't even enjoy movie that's been updated a bit ? No, movie does not follow the books and I'm glad it is that way. For all movies that are created according to the books I watch very beginning and very ending. If those are the same, movie will burst into my heart like a bullet from the gun. I understand how someone felt after watching the movie and not seeing every single scene from the book in movie, or even those who were a bit edited, but you must understand that this is movie of epicness and that those little details who were missed out of book will never crush him down. Peter Jackos, along with all film crew, created something worth watching even ten years after that. I've seen all three movies like tons of times, and I watch them each time with full passion and will to see what will happen next. No matter if I know that Aragorn will become what he is meant to become, I still watch the movie with hope that Aragorn will become what he's meant to become. Not knowledge, but hope. I haven't read all Tokiens books, so I cannot judge fully, but there isn't film whos inspiration was book that's fully made by same. If that's the way then it's better to just read the book. It's all same, and book costs about 50$ and movie creation 200000xxxxx+. You all need to look further than just shell of the movie. Movie represents book as much as it needs. Taking all details from the book would be just stupid, because it's not that ALL DETAILS have some important role in what will happen next. The Return of the King is a broughter of the epicness to the movie plot, and even after almost ten years of it's creation, I could not find a single movie that can compare to it (expect, of course, FOTR & TT). No, Avatar does not own the spirit that this movie has. In Avatar it's all about fantasy, fighting with nature against machines, while in ROTK story goes from character to character describing their paths and their desires. Story is much more than destroying ring. It's about willingness to sacrifice, friendship, love, passion, devotion, selfishness ... Actually, if we look that way, Avatar takes many "ideas" from the ROTK and indirectly making this movie a big influencer. However, this is not review about Avatar, so I will stop here. ROTK is final and the greatest movie in trilogy. It combines great acting, directing, script, visual effects, breathtaking battle scenes and final victory of good. For me, probably, this will stay favorite movie forever, till the very day ground warp off my body and everything that's left is a single bone. "The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began, Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow if I can, Pursuing it with eager feet, Until it joins some larger way Where many path and errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say."
10.0~Best Film I Have Seen This Year nrusso88 Sign in Permalink I go to the movies quite often, and have seen and own the previous two Lord of the Rings films. But after having seen The Return of the King twice already I not only have to say that it is the best movie I have seen this year (better than Kill Bill, Pirates of the Caribbean, Mystic River, and Finding Nemo), but I think it was the best film of the Lord of Rings triology and one of the best films I have ever seen. The visual effects, landscape, scope, plot line, and story telling are amazing and truly capture everything that a movie of that epic size should. And as a person that has read the books, I did not find Peter Jackson's artistic trip down lover's lane with Aragorn and Arwen (which was not a major part of the book) too sappy or contrived. It, like all other parts of the movie, seemed genuine and real. I would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone who has not yet seen it. Do yourself the favor and go see it. You will be glad you did.
10.0~Wonderful! sej41257 Sign in Permalink I am so glad that Peter Jackson made these movies. I have read the books countless times, but to finally see them has been a dream come true. Thank you Peter Jackson! The actors were fantastic!! They were all so believable in their parts. I would not change any of them. Even though there were differences from the book, it did not matter one bit. I loved the extended versions of the movies. I would have liked to have seen them in the theater rather than having to wait a year for them to come out on DVD. Wow! I was on the edge of my seat most of the time. I laughed, I cried. I did not want the whole experience to end. I am so glad that special effects have come so far that Mr. Jackson was able to produce this epic. I hope he will make "The Hobbit". I would love to see what he would do with Smaug and the three trolls the giant spiders.
9.0~Very beautiful, overwhelming movie! The best film of the excellent trilogy! Really blew me away! One of the best movies ever made!! NoName1989 Sign in Permalink This movie is magical! I liked the first and the second part a lot, but this was éven bétter! It's one of the best movies ever made! Everything about this movie is excellent: The special effects, the acting, the music, the cinematography,... Peter Jackson is an excellent director! This movie is a fantasy film that relies heavily on special effects, but you don't notice anything fake. The special effects have been executed perfectly! But this movie has more to offer than only special effects. The music is very good an contributes a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. A beautiful scene is when Pippin sings a song! Also the acting is very good! This movie is sometimes very moving. The battle scenes are very well done and the movie is very exciting a some moments. The direction by Peter Jackson is amazing, he combines amazing special effects with very good acting, emotions, suspense and beautiful cinematography (the scene at Mount Doom is, in my opinion, one of the best scenes in movie history). I don't think I have to say more about this movie. This movie is exquisite! If you haven't seen it, see it as soon as possible! You will be amazed!
8.0~Great but too long camsean Sign in Permalink I thought this was a very good movie. Very well filmed and acted with amazing sets and scenery. My only complaint was that it went on too long. It should have finished at Mount Doom the rest of the scenes were not necessary.
10.0~The greatest film of all time seidj19 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is no doubt the greatest film of all time!!! The film is a masterpiece....i don't see any other film that can surpass the emotion, the drama, the action that this film had. Those who doubted Peter Jackson will eat their words when they see this film. What Peter Jackson did with this film will touch every person who sees it. It will forever change the way we see films. This film definitely deserves an Oscar. So does Sean Astin, Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen. The cast namely: Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, Miranda Otto, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Bernard Hill and the 3 mentioned above, etc. definitely deserves an award for their performance as an ensemble. And most of all Peter Jackson definitely deserves an Oscar.
10.0~GREATEST FILM EVER! Well that is just my opinion. jjlord Sign in Permalink Star Wars was super sci-fi,Godfather magnificent mafia but the third installment in this fantastic trilogy rises above em all'. Before seeing the first Lord of the Rings I expected a low rate adventure on a small scale. Boy was I wrong. I had never read the books, in fact I never really liked fantasy's, so I was largely impressed how Peter Jackson had sort of explained it at the start with short narration of Cate Blanchett. After that I found it had everything action, adventure, romance, emotions, loyalty plus kicking orc butt. It was one of the best films I'd ever seen but the second was great too. People always say how rubbish it was but just because it is new don't mean it isn't classic! Like I said in my Two Towers Review it is as close to a modern classic you can get. Everything in it was awesome. Special effects, Acting (Yes Acting. Mckellen for one thing was superb), Music, Songs, score, I cried so many times in it even when its not real which shows you how good it is, great battle scenes, Cinematography, Costume Design, IT ALL RULED. I love this film and even though I like so many old classics I still love this one most. It has a great message and even though I don't really like fantasy's I loved this one. I also loved how they ended the film with how they made Mount Doom look and how Gollum fell etc. The miniatures were awesome too. Minas Tirith was stunning. I don't wanna sound like a jerk with my head up PJ's A$$ but it was that good. It also has a good message and morals in it. Look for the book on Ebay or or something, "A Closer look at Lord of the Rings" and it will show you some of the messages and Christian themes in it. FANTASTIC, AWESOME, BRILLIANT Oh and don't say it had too many endings because it would be unfair on some of the characters to end it at Minas Tirith plus there would be many things unresolved. I mean it's an Epic so don't moan about it being long! Yes it long. So you should go in expecting that! Very Highly recommended 10/10
10.0~My Story of The Lord of the Rings... sam_frank95 Sign in Permalink Despite all the hype I never liked The Lord of the Rings, in fact, I thought they were stupid. However, one day I decided to give it a try, and I watched Fellowship of the Ring-one of the greatest movie's I've ever seen. The next day I watched Two Towers and loved it more than Fellowship. Now I just finished watching Return of the King, AKA: A masterpiece. Return of the King has everything (including 11 Oscars, it is tied for the most, with Titanic and Ben-Hur also receiving 11), great acting, great script (and a good story that is exciting almost every minute), great heroes, great villains (Ahem, Gollum), and a great script. Now you may be expecting me to say, "So, this movie is great!", but it's not it's fantastic, and by the end you just want to give anyone involved in the making a BIG hug and a "Congratulations! This movie is one of my favorites!" Watch this movie after you've seen the slightly worse prequels, you'll be doing yourself a favor.
10.0~The Best Ending for a Trilogy! marv287 Sign in Permalink I think the Return of the King was the best ending. The acting was great and the special effects were spectacular. It was smart of Peter Jackson to do the trilogy during an era when motion picture technology involved computers. Without computers, it would have been difficult to make this trilogy. I enjoyed the superb acting of Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Ian McKellen for Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen for Aragorn. The four hobbits were performed by great actors. The battle in the Pelennor Fields and Minas Tirith was the best fight sequence I have ever seen in a motion picture. It defeats Star Wars and the Matrix combined. The battle seen is the victor of the movies since its beginning. Arwen had little importance, but focusing on one hobbit named Frodo is not good for attention grabbing. The alternation of scenes was the best way to keep the audience up. Arwen was important to the last installment because it shows her love for Aragorn. The ending could have been shorter, but overall the film has little errors and more achievements.
9.0~It was perfect. Literally breathtaking. iamno1 Sign in Permalink I saw a screening last night (Dec 15). I was absolutely blown away by the third film, and it brought together everything from the first two films and gave closure to the trilogy. Action scenes were stunning, brilliant and beautiful. From start to finish, Peter Jackson delivers an absolute gem. Throughout the entire trilogy, he stays truer to the author than anyone in Hollywood ever has. The only reason I'm even writing this is to in some way give thanks to him for making the entire trilogy. It was long. Some will say too long. But those who do should do so in private. This movie was so groundbreakingly brilliant that the critics should sheath their swords out of respect for it. It was perfect. Literally breathtaking. No LOTR fan will be disappointed. I can't fathom how much the box office will be on opening weekend, but I intend to pitch in at least once more this week. I have never experienced a movie like it before and I am afraid to think I may never again... well, not until the extended DVD comes out of course.
10.0~"This trilogy will not soon,if ever,find its equal!"-Kenneth Turan winter_irish_girl Sign in Permalink I voted a grade 10 for LotR because I personally consider it as the greatest book ever and the most magnificent movie of all time!Hail to Tolkien and to Peter Jackson ,Gods in literature and film making!Hail ,also to the wonderful cast which made the story even greater(if that's possible)!And of course we must not forget the crew,which went far beyond the expectations to make Tolkien's book come to live!Bless you all!These 3 years watching the trilogy were the most magical time of my life!Thank you so much for being a part of our lives,we, your fans, will never forget you!!! ~Miss Baggins~
8.0~Cool anrinakano Sign in Permalink It was a very cool and inspiring movie, it was kind of long for my taste, maybe that's why I only gave it an 8 but I really felt close to the story from beginning to end, even though it was kind of long i still actually wanted more. I know that sounds a little contradictory but the movie just pulled me in and brought me to a place where I was actually sucked into the whole world of the lord of the rings and I felt what everyone was feeling and although it was long time seemed to move by fast and 3 hrs felt almost like 1 or 1 and a half which for my taste is kinda long or just pushing it, maybe that's why it was a little confusing for me time wise but overall I thought it was a solid movie. As far as the acting I thought it was good. No one really stood out on that front but maybe that's what they were going for so nobody really out shined another actor, it was a team effort at I admired that.
10.0~The Journey Ends! lee.burstow Sign in Permalink Having waited 12-months for the final instalment of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic adventure The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King, I entered the cinema full of excitement and anticipation. Having read that the film would last for a whopping 3-hours, 20 minutes I decided to get myself a very large box of popcorn and a large coke to see me through this final journey. The film begins with a look back at how Smeagol/Gollum came to being, (Incidentally, the final character to have his background revealed.) and how he came to posses the `One Ring' Director Peter Jackson very cleverly diverts any sympathy or affection for Gollum by transferring them to Frodo and Sam by revealing Gollums' darker side. The film moves along with pace and passion and that can only be down to the superb direction of Jackson. (Who surely must receive an Oscar for this film) The scenes during the battle of Minas Tirith and the Pelennor Fields are spectacular. For those of you who have read the trilogy, you will find yourself looking out for certain events and scenes contained within the books. Sadly though, a lot of the storyline has had to be cut out due to time constraints. However, for the NEW fans of Tolkien's trilogy, you'll enjoy the books even more after you see these films. This is a must see cinema experience. You do feel emotion during this film and for me there are two scenes that stand out more than the others. The first is the scene just after the Beacons of Gondor have been lit and Aragorn rushes in to King Theoden to ask for help. (In the film Pippin lights the beacons, but in the book they are already lit by the time Gandalf and Pippin enter Minas Tirith) The second is at the end when Aragorn informs the hobbits that they don't have to bow to the newly crowned King and instead he leads the crowd in bowing to them. Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is quite simply breathtaking and if you only see one film over Christmas this is the one you have to see. Leaving the cinema I felt a sudden sense of loss. The journey has ended but what a journey it has been! ************************** SPOILERS COMING UP ********************** Scenes that I was looking forward to seeing that were not portrayed in the film are as follows: - 1. The confrontation between Gandalf, Saruman and Wormtongue at Isengard. 2. The healing of Faramir and Merry at Minas Tirith. 3. The Love affair between Faramir and Eowyn on the battlements. 4. Sam using the ring to evade capture by the Orcs of Mordor. 5. Sam entering the Dark Tower and seeing the `Watchers' 6. Saurons messenger trying to convince Gandalf that Frodo was dead 7. The Funeral of King Theoden of Rohan. 8. The return of the hobbits to Hobbiton, only to discover that it had been taken over. 9. The battle of Hobbiton 10. The death of Saruman
9.0~Excellent Work of Art dpoll390 Sign in Permalink This movie is simply one of the best. Winner of 11 Academy Awards and well deserving. This epic conclusion to the story should just make everyone happy that Peter Jackson and Company even decided to make this trilogy. Story: 10 Graphics: 10 Action: 10 Acting: 10 The only thing about this movie is that the ending is too drawn out. When you think the movies over there's still about a half hour left. But that doesn't really contribute to you not liking the movie. The ending, though it is drawn out, is happy. After three movies you are glad to see that everything turns out for the better in Middle Earth. An amazing display of film making. Amazing, 10/10
10.0~Brilliant nilslottrup Sign in Permalink Well, I gave this movie 10 (excellent) but I actually don't mean that it is excellent. I mean, it is simply the best movie that's ever made. It is brilliant, fabilous, supreme and simply just good. I don't think I ever will see a movie that is better than these 3 movies.
10.0~Probably The Best Movie you will see this year! nelliguy Sign in Permalink Brilliant!There are no words to discribe this movie. It is a perfect combination of pure Action ,Drama, Adventure and Fantasy. I recommend you all to see the all 3 movies one after another to max' your enjoyment from the outstanding performance. A truly MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!!
10.0~what a book adaptation trilogy can be .. greenpower Sign in Permalink Let me introduce myself in a proper way: i am a LOTR fanatic ;) why? because the literature in it is absolutely fantastic. Lines like: "now for glory, now for wrath, fell deeds, awake!!" (Return of the King) - "What can a man do against such wreakless hate? (TwoTowers)" [ by Theoden (King of Rohan) ] The values within the book, and the story itself are what we can consider the most noble, and why note say, the most Human ones. Protect your World, your forest, Love your Family and Friends, be noble, honored and respectable. One day, the human civilization will be enlightened and those values will prevail. greenpower
3.0~Boring!!!!! vanhowe Sign in Permalink While it has more action than the first two movies, it dragged and dragged and dragged on. This portion of the story could have been told in 90 minutes: the other two hours are there merely to give your subwoofer a work out. The movie does accurately portray the book, which was also exceedingly boring. The story is not memorable. I couldn't remember enough about the first two movies to know what the situation was for the third movie. The highlight of the movie is the boost it gave to the New Zealand economy. It is also a great travel video for the South Island, enough that I may take a vacation there to see it. Don't waste your money on this, unless you need a good nap.
6.0~Compared to the Books....Complete Rubbish awtracy33 Sign in Permalink I have been a fan of Tolkien as long as I can remember. I read the Hobbit in its entirety at the tender age of 9. Since then, I have read the complete trilogy of the Fellowship of the Ring more times than I can remember, I have forgotten more than most people know about the books...and yes, I still manage to have an active social life. Now, I could go into microscopic detail about the inconsistencies that plague this particular movie and the entire trilogy as a whole when compared to Tolkien's novels, but that has been done ad nauseum to say the least. Peter Jackson certainly had an eye for detail, the scene locations were absolutely realistic, and often breathtaking, but overall...his reliance on computer animated graphics and completely straying from the story line just ruined it for me. I can prove this in one example. Towards the end of Return of the King, Aaragorn has to persuade the Ghost King to help him in battle, and he will release them from their mountain prison. The same thing happens in the book, but the Ghost King and his army have only a marginal impact on the battle for Osgiliath and have absolutely nothing to do with the battle at the city of Gondor. However, Peter Jackson decides to take the Ghost King and his army to new levels of valor. In the movie...the Ghost King's army basically takes out the entire army of East Tribesman who are fighting for Sauron (Oliphants and all), along with half of Sauron's army, which are assembled around the gates of Gondor. This happens on screen in a matter of seconds, as a ridiculous fluorescent green wave "cleanses" the city of Gondor. Complete garbage! Maybe if I was 10 years old and didn't read the book, that part may have seemed cool, but to a devoted Tolkien fan and reader years before these movies came out, I can only hope that Tolkien himself is rolling around in his grave as we speak. For the record, I don't have a problem with all of the subtle changes that Jackson felt he had to make (even the addition of Liv Tyler as "Arwen," Aaragorn's love interest who never existed), but to completely change the face and facts of the battle scenes is just too much to swallow. I couldn't wait to get out of the theater and away from all the "average" moviegoers, who it seems have not picked up a book their entire lives, and seem even more eager to be lead around like a donkey going after the carrot on the stick. Bottom line...PG-13 killed this movie, pandering to the tastes of kids (graphics and more graphics) killed this movie, and a director who seemed to be too full of himself (literally and figuratively) killed this movie. Read the books, dump the DVD collection in this case. How this movie ranks among IMDb's best of the best completely baffles me. Better than Citizen Kane? Godfather II? Are you people f@#$ing kidding me?
10.0~the best doyouwannabeinmy Sign in Permalink I saw this movie yesterday evening and it has been in my mind ever since. It's the best of all three of them and I was a bit sad when it was over. No more waiting around for another Lotr movie. It's the end. For all of you fans that haven't seen it yet: Go and be amazed my rate: 10
2.0~The hype will die down Inakaguy Sign in Permalink The conclusion to what has been a seriously overhyped trilogy. As of the time of writing, this movie was rated #4 in IMDB's top 250. However, I suspect that much of that rating is due to overexcited fanboys (I hate that word but couldn't think of a substitute), and the film will slip a considerable number of places in subsequent years. Return of the King is probably the second best of the three films, surpassing the lackluster "Two Towers" but nowhere near as good as "The Fellowship". I enjoyed the first half of the film considerably and was prepared to accept it as a good final installment. Unfortunately, like "The Two Towers", the film moves from the sublime to the ridiculous with the introduction of the battle scene. I'm afraid I am not a fan of CG animation in live films. While the character of Gollum was well produced, the CG in the battles in lackluster and obvious. It is like being slapped in the face whenever it appears. Even leaving out the CG however, the biggest insult I find is that the main characters have to do everything. This was a particular problem in "The Two Towers", where the three heroes held off a whole army of orcs, but it is also prevalent in the battle in this movie. Sure, I've heard of suspension of disbelief, but it can only go so far. Unlike most people, I didn't mind the long ending with Sam and Frodo but the film had already been ruined for me before that.
9.0~Best Movie Ever jhessicaclarke Sign in Permalink I love this movie so much, I watch it all the time. I want to have the others also because i hope they will also be good just like this one. All the Lord of the Rings series is awesome and a good story line.I want to watch it every night 7 days a week because I can cannot get enough of this movie.This movie is the best movie I have ever watched in my life just like the others because they have a fascinating story to them and they always keep me interested in them. I want to get my friends to watch them since they are the best movies ever. I'm going to watch it when I get home from school and the store since I love Lord of the Rings.
10.0~Just perfect abdgursoy Sign in Permalink I watch all movies (about 12 hours) in one shot every year. I have movies and all books. I read all of them. I never bored because this world is amazing and magnificent.

10.0~Magical: Magnificent, Masterpiece lvan-2 Sign in Permalink Never having read the books but aware of how they have been revered I began the Journey tentatively with The Fellowship not fully understanding how it would impact me emotionally. I was awestruck with its strength and power to mesmerize and pull you into another world, another time. I am no stranger to "great movies". I have seen my share over the years. "Godfather" " Star Wars", "To Kill A Mockingbird" to name a few. Many different genres. Lord of The Rings stands on its own. They were superb. Having seen each of them about 20 times I can honestly state I don't have a favorite. However, the Return of the King leaves you at the end bereft and saddened. Emotionally exhausted.There will be no more. You will miss the characters who became your friends. You feel like you took the journey with them. Last February we had a LOTR day with my daughter and daughter-in-law. We watched them back to back. Extended versions. Yes, women very much enjoy the story, the characters, the music,the battle scenes, the cinematography. Each of us represents a different generation. Each enthralled by the the fantastic journey enriched by Peter Jackson's expert direction and vision. People will be watching these films forever. They are timeless. Once you visit Middle Earth you won't want to leave. You don't have to. Peter Jackson made it possible for you to visit.
6.0~Good, but not great (spoilers) malberts1 Sign in Permalink Everyone is gushing about this film, and mostly for good reasons. It's the crowning film of one of the best trilogies ever filmed. It appeals to tons of people because it's based on a timeless story, it's well acted, it's filmed beautifully, and the effects don't overwhelm it like they would a Lucas effort. That said, it's far from a perfect film, and to me, not even the best of the three (I find The Two Towers to be the most consistent of the three). It is not just the oft-repeated idea that the ending is far too long (it kind of is, but probably wouldn't seem to drag on so long if not for the tons of material cut out of the start and the middle of the film), but rather for the really uneven pacing of the film. It seems 2/3 of the time is spent with Frodo and Samwise crawling up to Shelob and then only five minutes going across Mordor towards Mount Doom. This is very odd to me, as if getting passed Cirith Ungol was the real feat, not the trek across the waterless, foodless plain. The Army of the Dead was one of the most amazing aspects of the film, but they appear abruptly and disappear almost as quickly, making them a passing rather than a salient point of the battle. And, of course, there are the elements the purists complain about, which I found would have really aided in the storytelling: Denethor's corruption by Sauron and the breaking of Saruman's hold after the battle with the ents would have smoothed it out a ton, and they could have kept the length failry the same by editing out some other parts. Arwen, for example, was basically unnecessary as the story unfolded--leave her out; if the scouring of the Shire is unnecessary, why do we even need to go back at all, when they could just head to the ships and end it there, or even better, just end it at the ceremony on top of Minas Tirith? I know there was an effort to keep it as true to the book, but I think Jackson made some basic errors in storytelling that keeps it far from the ranks of a ten, much like the problems with The Hulk earlier in the year. Good, but not great. 6/10
10.0~Perhaps the best of the trilogy PatrynXX Sign in Permalink now all Peter Jackson has to do is re edit the movie so we can put all the credits at the end. ;) Now while I really love the cinematography of the first film. It lacked emotion. So did Two Towers. The extended versions of both films improved upon the story massively. I won't even bother watching the theatrical versions. However it looks like Peter was rather good on the third film. It's also not often that you see 200 minutes of movie one a single side of a dvd. Though the longest I have is The Last Emperor at 219 minutes. (not getting into DVD-18 movies which are all but extinct) If you don't tear up at the end of watching ROTK. Then something might be wrong with your tear ducts. It's rather good. I can't say it's perfect. Some movies are, but this comes pretty close. Can't wait till the extended comes out. Definately devote an entire day to this trilogy. I just did... and my what a movie. LOTR is one movie. As it should be one book. ;) 10/10 Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 7/10 (alone) 10/10 via the other two movies
10.0~Great ending to a classic trilogy Greeners04 Sign in Permalink With the first two films being of such a high standard an ending to the quest had to be master piece in order to not disappoint. And that is exactly what it was from start to finish. A great film which definitely rates as one of the best of all time.
10.0~Can't believe it's over sayemutain Sign in Permalink It's amazing that although this was released 16 years ago, it stands out to be one of the best movies ever created. The acting feels like those characters can be true people that you can relate to. The CGI looks realistic but fantastical. It feels like a classic yet looks better than movies now. A true fascinating ending to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
10.0~Return of the King, Baby. Etrigan Sign in Permalink Definitely the best film in the Trilogy. Like many Tolkien fans though I was disappointed by the details left out only to find that we'll have to wait for the DVD gouge to get them (hopefully), but it still an absolutely breathtaking film. A friend of mine commented, however, "Someone shoot that damn violinist", and its so true. Every time the Violin starts its a tear jerking moment ;)
10.0~Lord of the Rings a great trilogy mbentham Sign in Permalink When i saw one and two i could not believe my eyes. I remember thinking how are they going to top this, but with its visual effect and fantastic work from the cast and crew it make fantastic movie which binds everything of what acting does for us, it bind us and keeps us guessing to the very last second. when it did come out i knew from the first five minuets that it had top the first two, to make a outstanding film. It deserving all of it's awards that it got. i was upset to see that none of the actors were recognised for their work, i do believe that Ian Mckellen gave an outstanding display of acting, i think for his fantastic roll in Richard iii he could of only be the only choice for Gandalf.
10.0~Awesomely beautiful eVissa Sign in Permalink This is movie making at its superlative best .... imaginative, innovative, sensitive and visually superb. Tolkien said that LOTR was not based on anything, and was not allegorical. That may be true but you can't help but think that his time in the trenches in WW1 had an enormous impact on him which he exorcised in the writing of the LOTR trilogy. The brutality of hand to hand combat, the desecration of the land and the power of an evil mastermind ultimately leading to death on a scale never seen before. I doubt that anyone could have made a better movie version of the trilogy than Peter Jackson. What can we look forward to next from this creative genius?
10.0~One of a kind qaz-12345 Sign in Permalink If your looking for one of the best movies (if not the best) that will take you to another world, with the biggest adventure I ever had this is the best choice. I loved this movie since I was little till now. and I doubt there will ever be made a Fantasy/Adventure movie (of this kind) so great as this. The three things that made this movie a 10/10 for me are the huge/fantastic Story, the breathtaking Filming & the never forgettable Characters.
9.0~Third one is the best one! tuhin94 Sign in Permalink When movies based on novels are done right, they allow readers to see on screen what they could only imagine in their minds. One of the biggest problems I had with Tolkien's third novel was not being able to visualize Frodo and Sam's adventure concurrently with the stories of Rohan and Gondor. This, of course, is a limitation due to the characteristics of a book and not a criticism of Tolkien. The movie has elongated scenes which focus on one side of the story, but there are critical moments when the stories are totally intertwined (i.e., Aragorn and the rest drawing out the orcs from Mordor to free up Frodo and Sam's passage). And of course, since a movie can tell a story in a shorter time, one does not forget events that occurred at an earlier time. Even though the release dates of the first and third movies were only two years apart, the advancements in technology are clear. The improvements in CGI over the previous films are tremendous. The fantasy creatures like trolls and oliphaunts looked like a natural part of the battlefield. The Army of the Dead looked like they could come and kill some bad guys for us in the 21st century too (although, their duty was completed, so we should leave them alone... even though they were total bad-asses). And all those battle scenes were executed perfectly! I can't imagine the amount of man- hours that must have been put in to accomplish them. Just as the third novel was my favorite of the series, the third film was the best and my favorite of the three. As always, changes were necessary for making this Lord of the Rings film. Happily, however, there were less extreme and damaging changes to the plot as in The Two Towers. The worst offense was Frodo ditching Sam in the film. It showed weakness and lack of trust in their friendship, something that was never a quality in their relationship in the novels. And the Witch King breaking Gandalf's staff served to portray Gandalf the White as mortal. The novels showed he could feel challenged and was not capable of saving Middle Earth by himself, but his staff, one of the major endowments representative of his otherworldliness, was never broken. They did a good job with killing Saruman and Grima earlier on in the story, since the whole ruffian affair in the Shire at the end was (rightfully) omitted. A job well-done adapting the novel for the screen. Watched (Extended Edition) 09/05/14, written 09/06/14.
10.0~nearly flawless MDMeridius Sign in Permalink minor spoilers I'm a ring nut, let's just make that clear. This film, even more so than the other two, from a critical standpoint is a true masterpiece; an uncanny achievement in film-making. The music, the costumes, the art direction and sets, the acting, the passion... all come together in a brilliant package that does the great novel justice. Of course it's not totally perfect... some might complain about the spirit army being "ghoulish" or what have you. My only two critical quips would be the absence of Saruman (and having seen the added scene in the extended cut, truly a shame it was cut) and how exactly Denethor died... he should have stayed in the pyre if you ask me, not jump off a half mile cliff. Minor. The acting: superb. True camaraderie shines through each of the performing artists which makes their performances all the more believable. The effects make a movie of this scale so believable you're not sure when you're looking at a effects shot or not. It's practically seamless. From and entertainment as well as artistic standpoint, this movie is NOT to be missed. Just watch the first two parts, first.
10.0~Jackson is the undisputed king of all mythical worlds improbablesage Sign in Permalink It goes without saying that with the final chapter in the now-legendary "Rings" cycle, director Peter Jackson has concluded the most breathtakingly ambitious, staggeringly detailed, monstrously epic film trilogy in the history of the art form. But the scope, intricacy, and eternal relevancy of these three films -- really, a single work, delicately divided into three equally stunning parts -- is almost too obvious, too oft-recognized to even comment on, especially when there are so many other things to praise, so diverse a palette of achievement to choose commendations from. Consider: In "Rings", Jackson has not only managed to successfully adapt a literary work most learned scholars of film deemed unadaptable; he has arguably created the best filmed adaptation of a source novel in motion picture history; Jackson put together a cast comprised not of above-the-title "stars", but veteran and journeymen character actors, who both individually and as an ensemble so perfectly inhabited their characters and the artificial world those characters were a part of, that they will forever -- for good or ill -- be indistinguishable from their Middle-Earth counterparts; Jackson put together a film trilogy that has, like "Star Wars" a generation before, redefined the standard by which superlative special effects will enhance and magnify the film experience... ...There is almost too much to say, too much to admire. This is Jackson's Sistene Chapel, his Iliad, his "walk on the moon". Like "2001: A Space Odyssey" for science fiction, "Citizen Kane" for drama and "The Godfather" for crime epics, The "Lord of the Rings" filmed trilogy will forever stand as both watershed and high-water mark, inspiration and albatross, invitation and warning, to both future filmmakers and filmgoers. It will both redefine the standard by which other films, aspiring to a certain degree of meticulous execution and artistic perfection, are measured, and intimidate all who bravely attempt to conquer the thematic, visual and dramatic landscapes that Jackson, like an earthly Sauron, has so thoroughly and inarguably conquered. James Cameron once, having scaled the peaks of cinematic achievement, declared himself "king of the world", but with these films, Jackson must be coronated king of *ALL* worlds. To quote Gandalf the White: "Now come the days of the King. May they be blessed."
10.0~The phrase "Save the best for last" has never been so evident. vip_ebriega Sign in Permalink My Take: The best of the best. An unforgettable grand-scale epic. "This is it", director Peter Jackson might have said. "This is the film where the name Peter Jackson will be remembered for." Indeed, it is. The phrase "Save the best for last" has never been so evident. And not since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK have we had a sequel that outdoes an original that is too powerful to defeat. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING is a sequel the third movie in the series of adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's bestselling novels including THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS, two very strong box-office hits that aren't easily topped from the highest spot. But, surprisingly, it was (by this film, no less). But still, all three films act like one big epic of a movie that's just plain beautiful, exciting and enjoyable to watch. The film continues the events where THE TWO TOWERS left off, having not much separate characters to focus on. This time, it only have the escapades of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood, companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum/Smeagol (voiced by Andy Serkis) on their quest for the gates of Mordor and continue their mission to destroy the One Ring. On the other end, we have Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and the people of Rohan fighting for glory against the forces of Mordor who has besieged the capital city of Gondor, ruled by a treacherous ruler (John Noble), a typical stereotype of a cowardly ruler. Director (Jackson) doesn't disappoint the fans he has earned with the series he created. Of course he shows new special-effects advancements in the brilliant battle sequences, lots of creative creatures and outlandish settings, but he also keeps a strong direction, brilliant performances from the cast and other stylish works behind the camera. Films like this come ones in a full moon, but Jackson does such a great job, he succeeds to make such a rare and min-blowing achievement. Here I am, brainstorming one of the best films of the last few years and I'll make sure that the LOTR series is there, with THE RETURN OF THE KING on the top spot of the entire series. Rating: ***** out of 5.
8.0~An epic conclusion to a classic literary work, and now, movie trilogy clumzy Sign in Permalink Sitting through a three and a half hour anything is a feat in and of itself, but I was faced with the unique challenge of further physical trials. There sitting beside me, as I sat through the previews, was a mid-20's lady who I'll call Butt-Monkey, sipping on a 2L bucket of Coke. As I turned to talk to my friend I saw in the corner of my eye that Butt-Monkey decides she wants to extricate her vat of soft-drink from the armrest vat-holder BY THE LID to give it a good sucking on. Of course the lid flies off, sending the tub of liquid slamming onto the floor beside my foot splashing my left leg, shoe and sock with the monstrous acidic sticky goop. My foot was soaked and our seating area was like a carbonated swamp. Even after the nice man (14yr old kid) mopped up the pool of Butt-Monkey's beverage, my shoes were fused to the ground for the entirety of the film. I literally spent the next 3 hours with napkins shoved down my sock and sitting on an angle seething with my dagger eyes at this incompetent boob. This still did not, in any way, lessen my enjoyment of this film and after the 3 hour epic I walked out of the theater with a huge smile on my face, only partially because I knew I would be writing this up and making up a stupid name for her. So Butt-Monkey, these butts are for you! Finally the highly anticipated fantasy finale of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is here completing the epic tale of Frodo and the destruction of the One Ring. We see the rejoining of old company as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandolf, Merry and Pippin reunite at the fall of Isengard, continuing their story together. Sam, Frodo and Gollum press on along the road to Mordor and to the destruction of the Ring. This is an enthralling conclusion to a masterful cinematic saga that not only does justice to the original literary works but stands on it's own as THE epic trilogy of the 2000's (Read: the Star Wars Trilogy sucks). I so thoroughly enjoyed this film that there are few if any negatives to address, but I did manage to find a few niggles. Unfortunately, we see little of certain characters that were very interesting from the past two films. For instance Saruman doesn't make an appearance at all, Treebeard and the Ents only grace the screen for 10 seconds if even, and Arwin is only a quaint side story of little consequence. I also found the spectacular main battle sequence concluded with a bit of a cop-out with a blanket victory by the good guys. In the very minor niggles category you could see that there were a few scenes that looked very "blue screened" that slightly pulled me out of the movie magic. Finally, I felt that the last few concluding scenes of the movie are arguably unnecessary. Still in the finest Hollywood fashion we see the Lord of the Rings shine and work on so many levels, appealing to young and old, man, woman and child ... as films should. The cinematic journey that has been the Lord of the Rings has escalated over the 2 years of their release, each movie getting better and better, weaving together a tapestry of film making history. The spectacular vistas, spellbinding action, believable characters, friendship, conflict, defeat and victory all intertwine in a such a compelling story that it's redefined the attention span of your average movie-goer. Who can justify spending $13.50 at SilverCity to watch a movie like "Elf" when Return of the King can be had at the same price? This I will never know, but what I can tell you is that RofK is worth every penny. So go and go now to your local cinema and experience the most memorable film event that will impact this generation as the original Star Wars did in the 80s. A well deserved 5 Butt-Monkey salute for Return of the King.
7.0~This should win best picture at the Oscars dtyrannus429 Sign in Permalink ROTK was the most visually spectacular and more importantly, emotionally engaging chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The battle scenes in ROTK blow away the battle scenes in the first two movies combined. The acting was excellent, especially Sean Astin. I nearly had a Hallmark moment every time he uttered a line. The LOTR trilogy is one of the greatest achievement in film history. The academy should reward it as such by bestowing the best picture oscar to Return of the King.
10.0~The end of the Middle Earth Journey alindsay-al Sign in Permalink Well this film in my opinion is possibly the best ever. This is the end of the Lord of the rings trilogy so it is a sad experience at the end, but this film is absolutely epically epic. This film leads where the Two Towers left off with the Evil powers gaining strength for the final conclusion against all men while Frodo,Sam and Gollum head to Mordor. Everything is ten times bigger in thee stakes and importance as this film really plays up the fact that this trilogy is based throughout a year of these characters life and failure is not an option. Every character is better then they were in the last film even the lesser characters of people from Rohan and Gondor are acted magnificently and really live up to the expectations of this film. There isn't much more to say about this film but SEE IT as it is the most epic master class of film ever with great cinematography, action, drama and action. A film for the ages.
10.0~Great achievement!!! dlope1 Sign in Permalink Without a doubt, this movie has to be the best film achievement of the year. All elements of filmmaking deserve recognition; production, acting, directing, visual effects, sound, music, special effects, cinematography, everything. It had it all. I cannot wait until the extended edition dvd is available for my collection. What a treat not only for all middle-earth followers but for lovers of good cinema worldwide.
10.0~One and only one thing bothered me about ROTK luap_99 Sign in Permalink Overall I thought the movie was a masterpiece and still a day later I am in awe of it. I honestly don't know what's wrong with some critics. I mean look at the immense task that Peter Jackson is undertaking. Tolkien was a long winded guy and went into immense detail in everything he described. Jackson actually includes the small details that most film makers would ignore and the overall effect leaves you wondering what was real and what was special effects. The fact that most of the time you can't tell the difference says it all. And as far as the story itself goes I challenge the critics to put together a better way of telling the story. Then we'll analyze your story and see if its better. Not likely. My one and only criticism is the absence of what I considered to be a very important part of the book. I think it was important to show that when the hobbits got back to the Shire they had another battle of their own to fight to bring order to the area. I suppose it doesn't really fit in especially given the time restraints. However it is misleading to someone who has never read the books and I just hope it is included in the extended version of return of the king. I think there is something wrong if this movie doesn't clean up at the academy awards. Critics have to learn that drama's aren't the only movies deserving of praise. I guess dramas are alot easier to give praise and still seem intelligent. Since critics are really out only to feed their own egos. The same critic that puts down Lord of the Rings will praise a movie like Chicago. I mean honestly isn't there something a little wrong there. The Return of the King eats movies like Chicago for breakfast.
7.0~Great Film, Worth the Wait, Minor Annoyances but still great Looking_For_BMW325i Sign in Permalink Tolkien's tale is brought to life well in its 3rd and final chapter, and is easily one of the if not the greatest film of 2003. The battle sequences dazzle yet again, and even in their great abundance they dont cease to entertain. The acting is good as well, although i have to say i was a little annoyed during some scenes that seemed too overplayed (when pippin recalls what he saw in the sphere he stole from Gandalf). Things do tend to drag a bit near the end, especially during what will probably be the most parodied scene of the next decade when Frodo awakens near the very end and everyone runs into the room laughing (the scene itself looks like its supposed to be a parody, and gave everyone in the theatre a good laugh). All in all, The Lord of the Rings: ROTK was an amazing movie, well worth its length, with a setting so fleshed out you'll feel like your fighting for middle earth with the rest of the cast.
10.0~The end of one of the greatest films of our time hans_p_elling Sign in Permalink So, we have come to it at last. The end. And what an ending. I could hardly breath during some of the greatest battle scenes. Battle scenes I up until now, only imagined. Peter Jackson and his crew has in my opinion, created one of the greatest films and film trilogies of our time. The richness in the visual presentation as well as in the details and development of the characters, makes this an overwhelming experience. The only flaw in my opinion was that it was too short, with it's 3 hours and 20 minutes! I look forward to the extended version next year.
10.0~Amazing issaaljubouri Sign in Permalink The first movie of this franchise was released in 2001 and until this day i did not find any movie like the awesomeness of this movie, the effect's are much better than the effect's of the modern movies and the epic battles that motivate your body and soul and each character in it is interesting and above all this the adventure lovely adventure of the hero's of this franchise .
10.0~Just Awesome Hail2daredskinz Sign in Permalink The first two movies, which are excellent in their own right, truly set the stage for the third installment of what I think is automatically one of the best trilogies of all time. What is so great is that a lot of material from previous movies that were only touched on are given more attention in thise movie, such as Smeagol's story. The battle scenes are awesome and speak for themselves. The one thing I thought that was a little lacking is that the supporting characters don't have such a big role in this one. Even the main trio of Legolas, Gimli, and the King himself (Aragorn) find themselves playing second fiddle to Frodo, Sam, Gollum, Gandalf, Merry and Pippin. Maybe it is because I'm partial to those three, but to me it seemed they weren't in it as much. A positive thing is that we finally see Arwen for more than 2 minutes in this one. Having read the book more than once, I think Peter Jackson did a great job with it, and not only didn't mess it up, but captured the essence of it and enhanced it. Anyone who says the movie pays no respect to the book and makes a big deal about minor details, plot changes and characters being changed and/or discarded has problems, IMHO. So go see it ASAP.. and one more thing... FORTH EORLINGAS!
10.0~Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire slimshady_8mile_eminem_a Sign in Permalink Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) made his amazing performance in the Goblet of Fire. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire proves to be the darkest and most ambitious Harry Potter.This Is the best harry potter followed by the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) last year You Will See more death and more darkness as Lord Voldemort make his comeback.Another Year, another trouble and harry potter saves the day again... This movie is good but not great and the Goblet of Fire made up on my top list, one of the year movie. This time there's more magic as this movie take you into the magical world of harry potter.All the years passed by and harry potter and his friends turns to into teenager.Many things changes including there hairstyle, clothes and even there behavior. There will be more courage as harry potter face "you know who" ( Voldemort ).There are also some funny moments. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has more action then anyother harry potter.The special effect was good too.PG-13 was ratted for the movie as the age grow wilder and more violence you will see including Intense and graphic action, characters injured, character killed and there will be Some very mild teen romance. The Plot: Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) reaches adolescence facing greater challenges than ever before. Lord Voldemort, who has lurked offscreen until now appears, in malevolent fury, played by Ralph Fiennes -- hairless, with the complexion of a slug, his nostrils snaky slits in his face. Harry is also entered in the Tri-Wizard Competition, even though technically he's too young, and has to battle dragons and enter an endless maze. An even more endless maze is teenage romance, as he faces the problem of a date for the Yule Prom. Most of the series regulars are back, including Harry's inseparable friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). New this time is Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody (Brendan Gleeson), professor of Defense Against the Black Arts. Their character development is getting batter every time. Daniel Radcliffe was great but they (ALL) fail to give great emotional to my heart.The editing was poorly done made the whole movie not in a proper position.I mean that some scene are so fast that dose not make the movie cearly understand to all.Some scene are not even complete.The editing is poor dose not make the whole movie look bad.The Directing was good and the movie was packed with great atcion and magical moments but the director fails to give great emotional and the story line is a bit mix up .Among all of the scence, I love the scene where all the three Competition take place and also the place where harry potter vs voldemort.All this is my best scene in harry potter. The Effect was well done and the climax was fun to watch.Harry potter gives another magical and powerful that would give you memorable moments.The journey continue with another Harry Potter I Would Give -A 8.2 out of 10....
10.0~Many variations from the book, but still masterful. garryglaubtennis Sign in Permalink Don't worry...this won't contain any spoilers. I just returned from attending a showing of the movie in Palm Springs, including a witty talk by Sir Ian McKellan. I am "one of those" fans of Tolkien, who has read the books numerous times. I was truly disappointed with what Peter Jackson did to Faramir in "The Two Towers," but also realize there is a difference between film and novel in time to develop characters. Additionally, Jackson felt a need to make the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen stronger, to attract more viewers. In "The Return of the King," he stays pretty true to the book. Though I personally disagree with creating a new storyline when time is of the essence (don't add, instead subtract, or combine characters and traits), regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed the third in the series. I might follow this up in a few weeks, with more to the point comments, but as the release date isn't for almost two weeks, it would be unfair to comment more than I have. For those who have never read the books, you will love it. For those who read the books long ago and don't remember details, you also will love it. For those who are huge fans of the books and remember every detail, parts will annoy you. Yet, my guess is most of you will still remember that Jackson has done a fine job in depicting the works of Tolkien, with great special effects and characterization of a majority of the ensemble cast. Some of you won't get past those changes, but most of you will love it even with the somewhat flawed changes.
10.0~As good as it gets! sweetp91180 Sign in Permalink For all people who were fans of the book, and afraid of what these movies could do to the world that is Middle Earth, fear no more. The final installment lives up to everything we expected after the first two. I have never seen a movie hold more true to the books than this series. Any changes, which were minimal, it seems were done only to save screen time, or more easily develop parts of the book that are hard to do in a movie. Peter Jackson has made an epic trilogy that in my humble opinion is right up there with the first three Star Wars and the Indiana Jones films. With so much material to deal with he has done an incredible job. Fans of either the books, or the movies will have no complaints. Thank you Mr. Jackson for bringing Middle Earth out of Tolkien's imagination and into reality.
10.0~a fitting end to the trilogy - SPOILERS cxw1065 Sign in Permalink I can't believe it's finally over-- the three year rollercoaster that we, the viewing audience have been honoured to ride. Well, it was a fitting ending, and almost completely satisfying. Aragorn deservedly reclaimed his crown, and Viggo Mortenson claimed a place in the pantheon of actors who are made for the role they play. The Hobbits, who I detested in both the first and second movie, won me over so completely that I shall be defending them to any and all naysayers. A special mention goes to Sean Astin, who moved this cynical moviegoer to tears. Gandalf, and Ian McKellan lived up to their reputations. The battle scenes were incredible. There were certain areas where booklovers (such as myself) may have felt cheated, but I am hopeful that we will see the return of some left out scenes in the extended edition DVD which has become such an integral part of the LOTR world. After all, there were a lot of stories and loose ends that had to be tied up in only 3.5hours of screen time-- realistically they did the best they could to fit in as many of the highpoints as possible. It would have been impossible to fit in everything and everybody. As to the movie as a whole, it was good-- not without flaws, not perfect, but good. The CGI let them down occasionally, some of the dialogue was trite, some of the editing felt rushed, and almost none of the characters, except the hobbits and gandalf got the closure they deserved. Certain characters were treated abysmally-- with what we got eventually, did we even need to see the character of Eomer, or see the unrequited love of Eowyn-- after all, no pay-off was given. Characterisation was also given less emphasis than perhaps was needed, but then we had met all of the characters before, and they were well established, therefore you could argue that less time was needed for this. However, very few films are perfect, and as stand-alone films go, this was certainly enough to keep me happy. As the final third of a 9hr+ movie this was indeed a fitting ending. I shall be watching it again at the cinema, and I will be rushing to buy the extended edition DVD, despite it's flaws. Go see it, but be warned, you might not get everything you wished for. Go see it with no expectations, or if you've never read the books, and you will be in for one of the treats of the movie year. 8/10
2.0~"Q: Where Would You Rather Be? A: Anywhere But Here..." Jasper76 Sign in Permalink Follow in "The Lord of the Rings" creator's (J.R.R. Tolkien's) footsteps. Project a malevolent universe. Invent a world and animate it with creatures in conflict. Make the conflict a battle between good and evil, but don't identify clearly the moral value or purpose of either side. In fact, remove morality's essence altogether by eliminating the power of choice for your characters. Emphasize the corruptibility of men. Glamorize the supernatural. Dwell interminably on the preparations for and the wreaking of violence and destruction, on the fragility of hope and happiness. Name the scene of action: Middle-earth. Sound like an environment you'd care to envision? Would you "live" there? If so, fate alone will decide its survival and your own. You can visit this predetermined "paradise" by watching/enduring/suffering Peter Jackson's elaborately filmed adaptation of Tolkien's epic trilogy, which concludes with "The Return of the King." I hold it is true that what is not worth contemplating in life is not worth contemplating in art. For its dismaying lack of meaningful moral definition, its pervasive pictorial ugliness, the quantity of its scenes of mind-numbing graphic violence, and its minimizing of the value of happiness, "The Lord of the Rings" films--including this one--ought to be shunned and damned.
10.0~There will never be a film like this in a long time. FilmFanInTheHouse Sign in Permalink The problem when writing reviews for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, is that they are so perfect in every way known, that there reviews will be so familiar. Each film gets better than the last, and Return of the King pulls out all the stops to bring you an unforgettable masterpiece of epic proportions. The story is well written, with the relationships between the characters really appearing. The special effects were wonderful again, along with the locations and creatures. It becomes near impossible to spot the point when the CGI doubles become the real actors. The music again, really set the tone for the film, and expanded on the adventure. The acting was superb again, especially Andy Serkis' performance as both the non-cgi and cgi versions of Smeagol/Gollum. There isn't much to say about this film apart from BRILLIANT. If you haven't seen these yet, you don't know what your missing. Once the end credits start rolling, you start to feel a feeling of sadness deep inside you. An unforgettable journey has come to an end. He's one fan who hope Peter Jackson will finally choose to make The Hobbit books into a cinematic masterpiece. The film deserved the 11 academy awards it got. You should go out now and pick this up. I also would recommend the extended editions for each films. You gather lots more action and back story, along with Sarumans missing death scene.
10.0~Visual Poetry TrappedSoul Sign in Permalink The third installment in Peter Jackson's trilogy is astonishing. The pure brilliance of the trilogy harbors great attention, but none of the first two could possibly stand a chance against the epic storytelling of the third chapter. 'Return of the King' swan-dives into the stratosphere of incredible cinema. Jackson's style is unmatched, as is Andrew Lesnie's cinematography, and Howard Shore's music sets the mood and stage for a triumphant adventure. The acting is majestic, the battles are probably the best that has ever been put on screen, and the emotional heaviness of the characters is virtuous. The overall film is by far the best this year, and in my opinion, in film history. The atmosphere surrounding the 'King' is much darker in the sense that "the end has come," it is also much deeper as we come to understand the true meaning of the films...even the smallest person can make a difference. This is proved at the film's climax, which will remain untold. If this doesn't win Best Picture, I don't know what will. Go see it...more than once.
10.0~Captivating cleaveroscar Sign in Permalink A fantastic tribute to a superb set of books. Tolkien would be proud of Jackson's work, bringing thousands and thousands of reader's imaginations to the big screen. There are too many spectacular aspects of this trilogy to name, but one part stands out to me: the music. Absolutely incredible. Makes you feel attached to the characters and the storyline, to an extent that no other screenplay has ever done. One of the only films that I have been able to watch over and over again, has to be up there as the greatest fantasy series of all time. Thank you Peter Jackson for bringing a fantastic book to life.
10.0~And what about the credits! barberouge Sign in Permalink Don't make the mistake to leave your seat too early (even though 200 minutes hardly qualify as too early...). The credits are simply the best I've ever seen. Seeing the characters one last time by drawing them on a bookpage-like background is a great and humble way to fade from the movies back to the books they came from. Full of sketches of no particular significance regarding the story itself, but glimpses of an universe we fell in love with. And then the One ring as the last drawing And then, the light on the movie screen goes out... I tell you, hold your pee for a few minutes and give credits to those credits...
8.0~Disappointing to those who read the book, but for those who didn't... jusbean Sign in Permalink Upon finishing 'Return of the King' last night at 3 in the morning, I felt that I had seen one of the best movies ever completed. I have not read the books (except for the Hobbit, which technically doesn't count) but on so many levels I enjoyed 'Return of the King'. I'm sure much was left out of the movies, but that is to be expected; one can put down a book and return to reading when they want to, but people pay to sit through a 3 hour movie in one sitting, so everything must be condensed, obviously. The sheer beauty of this movie is unchallenged by any movie I can think of, besides 'Baraka'. The acting, while being quite dramatized (my only minor complaint) is necessary given the nature of the movie (fantasy, dragons, romanticism, etc.). The action is phenomenal and the battle sequences are filmed superbly. Interaction between the actors and the fantastic creatures is very believable and the sound, musical, and visual aspects of each battle draw the viewer in and raise their heart rate, that being what I found, at least. I am prepared to say that the trilogy is the most important and well made group of movies in the history of film making, and I doubt any will compare. The scope of Peter Jackson's artistic vision is unsurpassed by any director I know. For 'Return of the Kings', all the stops were pulled. The moods conveyed in each scene contribute to 'Return of the King' being more than a simple movie; it helps to draw the audience into the fantastic world of J.R.R. Tolkien. I acknowledge that many people who have read his books will disagree with that I'm saying, but from a point of view judging the movie on movie standards (which is how it should be judged...RotK as Peter Jackson created it is NOT a book, it's a movie), Return of the King proves to be one fantastic movie.
10.0~The best movie of the year jemi2k Sign in Permalink This is the best of the trilogy. Started with calm story of Smeagol, followed by long huge battle and ended with the serenity of the Shire. The plot just awesome! The best part is when Merry/Pippin singing to the Manager of the throne at Minas Tirith. certainly i will watch it again soon.
9.0~Oh it was good very very good.... no stupid fat hobbit it wasnt they ruined precious.... (lol) Laura_is_god Sign in Permalink Right having queued up outside my local cinema in the freezing cold last night, jumping about like a hyperactive 3-year old I was not expecting to be disappointed, however I am torn between my instinct as a lover of films in general and a passionate lover of the LOTR books. I thoroughly enjoyed the opening scene (Smeagol/Deagol) I've been looking forward to a scene like that since the first time I hear Andy Serkis' Gollum voice (and I salute him for it!) Although at times the dialogue was a little wooden (something I noticed throughout) overall it told the downfall of Smeagol well, especially for those who haven't read the books and didn't really 'get' Gollum. I felt that the finding of the Palantir was too insignificant, especially considering the enormous power the Palantir has and its significance to the story, it definitely ought to have been chucked out of a window (lol). Pippin's 'battle' with the Palantir was unconvincing and a little too over the top for my taste but it was still quite good. Merry and Pippin finally taking on their more serious roles was excellent and something I'm very glad happened. However new comedy Gimli was dually noted and discarded as ill timed and unnecessary. I also felt Aragorn's transition from ranger to King cam too quickly too late, making him seem a bit wooden, but I cannot fault Viggo Mortensen as an actor as he has been stunning through all three movies. Something that really annoyed me as a book fan through-out all three movies is that PJ tended to swap nice Tolkien bits (such as Frodo asking Legolas why he wasn't wearing the winter boots of the other characters in FotR) for bad comedy banter or insignificant Arwen moments, the Arwen bits a nice touch but again unnecessary. The scene of Arwen seeing her son was wonderful, but should have been followed up in some was by either adding the appendices ending of the fellowship (i.e. Legolas and Gimli sailing off and Aragorn dying) or even being taken out all together, hopefully on the EE DVD there will be more to this! *Crosses fingers* After finally getting my long awaited good view of Gondor, I felt that visually it was visually missing something but from a film point of view it was a fabulous piece of design. Once again costume, makeup and set were faultless and I salute the dudes who do it! One touch I really did love was the chain of the Ring making deeper and deeper cuts into Frodo's neck. Another problem I has as a book-fan was the lack of Faramir and Eowyn love story, though I can see that from a none book audiences point of view this could seem tacked on and also take the mood away from Aragorn and Arwen. Also a total lack of Houses of Healing, that was a scene missed where Aragorn could have really shown his power as King, but fingers crossed for the DVD (again!) lol. The final scenes of the coronation and also the returning to the shire seemed hacked together and choppy, something I hope will change on the (dare I say it again) DVD. Finally my instinct as a book lover tells me to hate it, or at least dislike it but as a lover of films in general I ought to adore it and go to see it and embarrassing and financially draining number of times. I took my till around half way through the film to turn of to that fact it was adapted from my favourite book and enjoy it as a movie in its own right, but once I did I really loved it and was dying to applaud when Aragorn and Arwen kissed in Gondor (I'm such a sucker for mush!). I think I will simply saw I liked it more than Two Towers and about the same as I did Fellowship, and I might just be tempted to go see it again... &#61514;
10.0~the series lord of the rings is amazing Dragos95 Sign in Permalink so... i will don't write a lot because all know to blame. the movies lord of the rings was the most exciting series in world, i see all 6 movies (including the hobbit) 2-3 time on year because is my favorite series , and will remain my favorite, since the beginning the story was amazing, i mean, a world when the technology doesn't exist, but the magic, dragons, or enchanted items are, this is amazing, that type of story is my favorite, i hope will be more movie based on this story, because is one of greatest series. second think is the landscapes, i mean there's a lot of landscapes everywhere but in this movie are just amazing, i think was very very hard to make a great movie like this, but this is just... perfect.
10.0~RotK is by far, the best film of the three! review by 20 y/o geek. woo. disarmingbeautyx Sign in Permalink Like many a Tolkien geek, before the premiere of this movie, I literally had nightmares that Return of the King would be an utter disappointment and grievance for me and all Tolkien fandom. At long last, after years of waiting, endlessly thinking about, insanely obsessing over, and anticipating it, that day finally arrived. As I went to the theater, feeling the day to be quite surreal as I struggled to fully grasp I was about to witness, I was fully equipped with my One Ring on finger, and as always, my Tolkien tattoo on my back, I sat down in my carefully selected seat. After some time the lights dimmed, but my nervousness increased dramatically. The trailers began. Minutes passed and so did they. Then, The New Line logo played upon the screen. A moment of imminent silence. Finally, my journal was taken up from where last it had halted. Nearly three and a half hours after I had initially stepped into that large, crimson colored room, filled with quasi-reclining cushioned seats, my journey, like Frodo's was over. And though my eyes could not have possibly cried more during the duration of that film, I had a feeling of complete gratitude for Jackson for the making of this final chapter. Truly, it was by far the most riveting, and intensely powerful installment of the trilogy. For what The Fellowship of the Ring had spent on the characters, it lacked in action. (though personally, I'm not complaining in the least, for I'd take Tolkien's characters any day over a battle). And while The Two Towers makes up for the small amounts of physicality in it's former, it lacked in what the Fellowship was most strong. However, Return of the King magnificently and flawlessly integrates both the characters and the battles into one perfectly bound and balanced masterpiece. The scene changes flow beautifully and naturally from character to character and the scenes themselves hardly ever feel rushed. And though in the first hour I began to become seriously concerned about the relatively brief Frodo/Sam/Gollum sequences, by the end, (excluding Eomer and perhaps Faramir) everyone had about the equal amount of screen time. I was throughly pleased and relieved, for the shortcomings and lack of those Ring Bearer scenes were the ones I most feared. And though Jackson has changed and/or added a few new things (as he has done in the others), one in particular over which I was quite upset where I saw no need for exclusion, for most of the parts, I can understand his reasoning, and actually in some cases I think it even improved the scene. But besides that, he has stayed very close to the books events. Hoorah! If you've enjoyed the previous two films, you will absolutely adore this final film, marking the closure to one of the greatest epic stories ever told. I was and still am moved by it more than words can describe. RotK begs for me to view it again sometime VERY soon.
10.0~Terrific Movie hardyboyfan Sign in Permalink Beautiful series the remarkable work Peter Jackson has done in the Lord of the rings and the hobbit series is breath taking. The thrill and suspense throughout the film makes it worth it to see. Wish they could have included more of the history behind the elves and the history between Legolas's family and Gimili's family. The fact though that they brought forth the characters from the hobbit into the lord of the rings series brings it full circle. It would have been nice had they reference Thorin in the end with Bilbo remembering things as they head for the ship after all the adventure he went on began it all. All in all though amazing movie.
10.0~Best movie series of all time clashwithmody Sign in Permalink If you haven't seen the LOTR trilogy yet i don't know what you're waiting for
10.0~Whew! pied Sign in Permalink I've now seen "Return of the King" two times. It delivers! Peter Jackson deserves the well-earned kudos he is getting for the difficult achievement of translating Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth to the wide screen. "Fellowship of the Ring" was good; "The Two Tower" was the best film ever made. And this final installment is very good, but not as good as "The Two Towers." The final installment of Tolkien's trilogy is definitely the most difficult to translate to the screen. One point which I would like to make that I've not read anywhere else except in Michael Medved's review of this film is the poor job done by Viggo Mortenson. He was absolutely splendid in "The Two Towers," but in "Return of the King" he seems to have lost some of his confidence. He never takes hold of the role of Aragorn as he does in the two previous installments. In spite of the long running time, 3 hours 20 minutes, and the many diverging story lines, this is a splendid film. I cried at the devotion showed by Sam to Frodo. And Sean Astin who plays Samwise Gangee should get an Oscar. The relationship of Sam and Frodo was the best thing in this last installment. Of course, the special effects are mind boggling. Ian McClellan is superb as Gandalf. He resembles St. Michael the archangel in his phsycial interpretation of the role. You sense his great love for these courageous little hobbits and of Middle Earth. There are those who say J.R.R. Tolkien would have objected to Peter Jackson's interpretation of "The Lord of The Rings." I think Tolkien would have liked it far better than most people think. There never has been a more Christian vision of good versus evil translated to the screen.
9.0~Epic, Powerful, Satisfying andrewkeithharrison Sign in Permalink The end has come. After spending the best part of 9 hours inside Middle-Earth, the end has come. The Return of King wraps up an engrossing and powerful story. Peter Jackson isn't one for a short story, and this three hour epic is no different. However, the three hours is lost within the captivating story and characters, the epic climax, the powerful battle sequences, and breathtaking New Zealand scenery. A mention must go out to Weta Workshop for the incredible design of characters, sets and props. In particular, the work taken to bring Gollum to life is an incredible feat of cinema. The effects are extraordinary and the performance of Andy Serkis deserved, at the very least, an Oscar nomination. It is sad to say goodbye to this world, but take heart that we got to see this world in such a magnificent way. The only thing stopping this from being a 10/10, was the extended and drawn-out ending. Perhaps unavoidable, due to the complex nature of the story and large number of character archs, but still, long.
10.0~This movie has become the best of all times! The_Factor Sign in Permalink Possible spoilers... ROTK was far exceeded any expectations I had. Appealing to both the visceral and the cerebral appetites - it is far and above the best movie of all time. The Smeagol/Gollum realization was superb, and the emergence of the supporting characters from TTT was very satisfying. Last, Peter Jackson has proven that sequels can be (should be) released closer together and maintain audience interest...in fact it heightens it. Remarkable.
9.0~Still in awe peter-nem Sign in Permalink In a way I am sad having seen this film. Sad, that it is unlikely for a long time we will be treated to such a great set of films as Lord of the Rings. Return of the King was everything that Matrix:Revolutions wasn't - the perfect end to an excellent trillogy. I guess that I always knew it would be though. I'm not going to post any spoilers here as I guess most people still won't have seen the film (although I'm guessing most will have read the books!). Go and see it now, you've no excuse to sit here reading this! 10 out of 10.
10.0~Class, a perfect ending maccaz Sign in Permalink I'm not used to writing comments about anything, but I had to writesomething about this movie tonight. I haven't read the books, so I don't know if the film has done them justice, but I don't really care, because this film is a classic. I'm sure anyone who is going to watch this film has already seen the other two, if not, go to the local video store and rent them out, because you'll need to have seen them before you see this film. It took a while for this movie to get started, but when it does it really worth the wait. The fight scenes were brilliant (there was a lot of them), but as we have seen from the previous 2 installments it's not all fighting. I'll not spoil it for people who haven't seen it yet, but they are in for a treat. I'm sorry this is the last of the films, but maybe they'll do a prequel and do a film on The Hobbit. Can't wait until this film comes out on DVD so I can watch it in the comfort of my living room and not the awful seats in my local cinema!
10.0~brilliant! pri_e Sign in Permalink This was the one movie I had been waiting for all year so I wasn't disappointed when I saw it yesterday. I knew that there were some important scenes cut from the movie but it didn't matter to me because I know they will be there in the extended version dvd set. It was fantastic to see Aragorn become who he was born to be, it was his courage and belief in Frodo that inspired many of the others to continue on. I think anyone would want someone like Sam to be their friend, his friendship had more power than the ring itself. I honestly can't decide which of the three are my favourites because I love them all, but this definitely is a trilogy that I'll never forget.
6.0~No Best Picture of the Year tygershark69 Sign in Permalink After finishing watching the whole series of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I am at a loss as to why this film won the Best Picture Academy Award. Make no mistake it is a good movie. The effects are spectacular and the story is great. But it got to the point to where I was saying, "Get on with it!" I was just plain tired looking at Frodo's morose little face. All the other characters are truly heroic; Frodo just brings it down. Sam, Frodo's companion, is far more driven and determined. Frodo's characterization really has much to be desired. I found myself feeling like the Elaine character on Seinfeld as she watches The English Patient and screams, "Die already!" The intended dramatic tension as Frodo approaches Mount Doom fails and could have been cut down a bit. There was enough build up from the first two movies and from the first three-quarters of the third. All that said, I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who enjoy Fantasy films and stories. I will likely buy this series, but I do not consider it on the same level as the Academy does.
8.0~Best movie bilalwmohamed Sign in Permalink the story is amazing but too long without mention the first story and the guy who is the lord of the rings (evil guy). the nice from the writer to mention all kinds of people without mention the human kind as he try to say the humans are not the only kinds on the earth. the "hopet" story is nice to continue as separate film to try to explain who they are ? where are they came from? there movie will be better if there writer focus on evil part of story. who create the rings and where are other rings ( the movie mention only one but its name " Lord of rings". which increase the power of rings " dispear only is not Enough.
7.0~Maddeningly Inconsistent Quality roedyg Sign in Permalink If you have read the books, don't go see the movie. It is frustrating to have your own magical visions turned into comic strip characters. However, the hobbits are delightfully done, endearing as bunnies. The makeup is realistic. The only catch is the hobbits seem to change size from human to half human size and back from scene to scene. The king of the elves is blond and magical looking, though again he seems to change size from scene to scene. The Dwarf is bang on, if a tad stereotyped. Golem kept me guessing. Was he an actor, a puppet, computer animation? a mixture? In my imagination he would be a black otter-like slimy creature. This Golem was quite different, and riveting. In nearly all the scenes, except the one just before his death, he seemed quite real. I don't think I have ever seen a more lifelike "monster" in the movies before. The backgrounds throughout the movie are spectacular and true to the spirit of the books. A huge hunk of the movie is given over to mindless breastbeating prior to battle. Every pro-war cliché from every book and every movie and every politician is thrown in. The corny battle plot is stolen from Rocky. The battle scene goes on for what feels like forever. It as boring as watching someone else play a video game. Corny cartoonish wart hogs, flying dragons and elephants swoop about doing dominance displays like some Kong movie. It even has Pac-Man ghosts and giant eagles. It just plain silly with one touch of extreme grossness -- catapulting decapitated heads into the castle. In the books, the terror comes from fear of the unknown, from the dark. There is none of that in the movie. The danger is as explicit as a cowboy comic book. The part 3 by itself does not properly explain why the ring corrupts, why it is so addictive, which is the key to the trilogy. The ring just seems to cause stomach upset, and a childish petulance leading to wanting to hold the ring. The ending is revoltingly saccharine and clichéd. They laid the sweetness on so thick I felt like throwing up. The hobbits are lovable in themselves. They don't need the "laughing" ending like an episode of the Real McCoys, or a couple wandering hand in hand off into the sunset.
9.0~unrealistic of course, but uplifting nonetheless quantumpuppy Sign in Permalink First things first. The movie is completely unrealistic. There is no way the power of good, alone, can do what it did in this movie. The dwarf and elf alone killed over hundred's of the most evil, strong and heavily armoured warriors without breaking a sweat. This implies that fighting evil is easy work, which it most certainly is not. Jackson shows us the creation of these warriors of evil and how strong they are, and they are felled one by one by a drawf's ax?! Ok, that being said, the movie is nonetheless uplifting. Good can defeat evil. What is required is resolve to do what is right, no matter what the cost, even your own life. The special effects need no comment aside from saying they were the best special effects I have ever seen and the battles were the most incredible I have ever seen. This movie will win several oscars, including best director and best picture. It will not win best actor for there were far too many good actors in this movie, and they all supported the others. Without giving away the ending, which we can already guess at anyways, I was very dissapointed in one scene near the end where our hero Frodo turns to the dark side, for a moment. While it brings home the point that evil can tempt us all, no matter how good we are, I think it says that no man can resist it. There are great men and women who can resist evil at every challenge and Frodo would certainly qualify as that type of man/hobbit. The giant killer spider was just stupid. The dwarf was just so funny. And why in the world did the audience when I saw the movie cheer when the insane king fell to his death is beyond me. We hate evil. we cheer when evil is defeated. But we shouldn't be cheering when an insane king meets with his death. After all, insanity is not the fault of the insane. good job Peter Jackson. Good job to the entire cast. this movie will be on top of IMDB for a long long time. I guess godfather and shawshank redemption will have to be happy with # 2 and #3.
10.0~The Greatest of All Time Alcyryal Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has done it. He has created a masterpiece, a landmark, one that will be treasured as a classic. The 70s had The Godfather, the 80s had Star Wars and Indiana Jones, the 90s many various films, such as Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Titanic, etc. but this Trilogy is our classic of the New Millenium. Part of the Fellowship has been reunited for a time, but now war is beginning in Gondor. They split up, Gandalf and Pippin to warn Gondor, and the others to gather strength for the upcoming battle. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue to Mordor and Mount Doom, with their deceitful guide, Gollum. The stakes in this film are raised off the charts. It is all or nothing now. Failure is not an option. Jackson takes his audience on a whirlwind of emotions. He gives us suspense, excitment, horror, humor, sadness, triumph, loss, everything. Just like the Godfather Trilogy, this series has everything a movie-lover wants. The emotion is made even stronger thanks to the Special Edition DVDs that Peter Jackson has given us the opportunity to see. When I see the movies succeed, I always root for the cast, who gave it their all to make the movies a perfect as possible. I have to say that Peter Jackson has raised the bar for all movies in the future. It is my personal opinion that The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best movie ever made. Everytime I see a movie, this is the standard by which I will judge it. Kudos to Peter Jackson and the entire cast of The Lord of the Rings. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King: ****
10.0~Quite a fabulous ending...with only one flaw patrokov Sign in Permalink Lay your fears to rest. Peter Jackson and friends have not stumbled on the third and final Lord of the Rings movie. The Return of the Kings holds to the same standards as the first two movies and extremely satisfying. There's a big difference between making a trilogy where the entire story has already been written, and one where sequel's are made to capitalize on a successful film. (See Matrix, Batman, and Star Wars for examples.) In fact, the only real flaws are one's of omission. Weighing in at three hours and thirty minutes, it's still not long enough to complete Tolkien's story. So, it glosses over quite a few things in the interest of finishing. While die hard fans, including myself, will have to hope that Peter Jackson puts in these omissions in the extended DVD version, everyone can relish what did make it to the screen. The Return of the King is the easiest of the three movies to understand for Tolkien neophytes, with all of the exposition and explanations clear and well paced. The battle scenes are fabulous and not so onerous as Helm's Deep in The Two Towers. Shelob, Frodo's burden, Minas Tirith, the Mumakil, Eowyn's confrontation with the Witch King are phenomenally well done. Legolas fans won't be disappointed, and Gimli gets to utter the movie's funniest line. The ending suffers a bit with multiple denouements but without the book's second climax. But despite this, the audience cheered, cried, and applauded at the end. When I first read the Lord of the Rings, more than twenty years ago, I thought how great it would be to see this in a movie, but then I thought what a phenomenally bad movie it would be, because the story line was too complex; no movie company would let it be the proper length; and how do you portray the evil whose greatest threat is his oppressive presence? And on top of that, the special effects would never do it justice. Well, I have to take my hat of to Peter Jackson and New Line, as well as everyone else who worked on the project. They truly have accomplished the impossible, adapting The Lord of the Rings to three phenomenal movies which are true to the novels and never cheesy in that Sword and Sorceror kind of way. Thank you.
9.0~Best of the three tom-760 Sign in Permalink I think this one is the best of the three movies. Not coincidentally it is also the one that stuck the closest to the book. I really felt that there were some glaring weaknesses in the first two movies (though still excellent films) that were for the most part avoided in this one. I thought the story flowed well, and the action sequences, particularly the battle for Minas Tirith were spectacular. My only complaint about this one is the ending. While you would typically expect some denouement after the climactic battle, this movie seemed to meander about to it's conclusion for about 30 minutes. It might not have been so bad except for all the times the movie faded to black or white, making you think it was over, only to keep going with another meandering scene. That complaint aside, this was an excellent movie, well worth the price of the admission. A stunning conclusion to a very good trilogy of movies. In this case the best was indeed saved for last.
9.0~And so begins the trilogy of the long walk . . . MichaelineJohnson Sign in Permalink I heard it said that the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, when boiled down, is about two things, the beauty of New Zealand and the art of the walk. The first film of the three, "The Fellowship of the Ring", is more about the exposition of the story than the other movies in this series. It is a glorious introduction to the characters and the storyline; the art of the effects, costumes, and make-up are mind blowing, and the scenery of the locations is breath taking. We as the viewer get to know Frodo, his friends, and his nemeses well during this time, and you get a taste of what the journey will be in the days to come. I enjoyed the film without reading the books and have decided to keep it this way. I am not a reader who enjoys long exposition and landscape description. Saying that, The premise of the film and story is phenomenal and am glad that Jackson and his team adapted this book into an easy on the eye movie that can be enjoyed by all.
10.0~Nice movie chaimcitronenbaum Sign in Permalink This movie is so nice and adventure. I like it so much because all the actors play their role in a great way.
10.0~Unbelievable, Awesome and I've run out of Adjectives flinchn Sign in Permalink Rating: 10/10 I saw the first show this morning. I took the day off work and took my mother, as we have done each of the past two years. She introduced me to the books at a young age and for that, this ritual is the least I could do. I am sad this was the last time. First of all, I'd like to say that although I had some very small issues with a few things,Spoiler:(absence of Saruman, no confrontation between the witch king and Gandalf at the breaking of the gate - especially with Mr. Jackson's fondness of the grandiose) if this isn't the best movie I've ever seen, it sure was the greatest movie-going experience of my life. After the first few minutes settling back into the story - I was taken back to Middle-Earth one last time, to see how this great adventure finally ends. I actually remember saying to myself at one point, "If only our world was as wondrous, as beautifully haunting and as soul-stirring as Peter Jackson's vision." Actually this movie is more like a gift than a vision. If Peter Jackson had personally delivered the prints to my door it would not have been a more intimate transaction. I laughed, I winced, I cried, my jaw dropped in absolute shock and wonder. I felt my body go lifeless at times and my muscles clench as if I was in battle. I lived this movie, more than I watched it. I am very familiar with the subject matter as written, and this movie is probably as true to this standard as humanly possible - My God, do you remember the doubt we all had just over two years ago? Spoiler: For those who question the prolonged ending(s), I see your point, I really do, but now after seeing it once - how could I, who cherishes the end of the book as much as I do, ever ask for the last scenes to be edited out? I see from other reviewers that although universally regarded as a good film, (at least) it did not illicit as viceral a reaction from some as in my experience. A shame, and I feel only empathy. I would love to go through more specifics, but for now I feel exhausted and emotionally drained. I'd say I'm in need of some sleep, but friends, I'm afraid no dream tonight can compare to the one I saw today.

10.0~One of the best films in movie history!!! LizzieFinch Sign in Permalink I don't think it is fare to say that one of the three films is better than the rest because in my opinion there isn't. They are all just as good as each other. They are just different stories. This is the last film in the epic trilogy and it's incredible. It reaches the climax in this film with Frodo and Sam reaching the end of their journey. They are been on the ride of a life time and it is now all over. The one Ring has been chucked into Mount What ever with a bit of a struggle as Smeagle didn't want to let it go. But with a fight it plummeted to the Volcanic Lava And Gollom along with it. Mean while Aragon, Legolas, Gimli and the gang have been fighting their own wars. Now we have reached the end Frodo and Sam only just alive they get back to the beautiful city of Rivindel where Frodo leaves and goes of into the Sunset with Bilbo, Gandalf, and others. Sam gets his family like he wanted, and Merry and Pipin are still getting up to mischief. And there we are the end of the Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and indeed the entire trilogy. It has been a pleasure on commenting on this film and it is a film and movie has got to watch. Yours Whatever Rose Greenwood!!!
10.0~you have to see the movie two times to respect the ending. q-bane Sign in Permalink lord of the ring is one of the best movies ever made, the only thing that disturbed me the first time I saw it was the ending. Every time a scene ended I got the idea that the movie was over but then a new scene would appear. It didn't flow well. A lot of others who have watched the movie agreed, most of them say the ending was also too long and too boring, that it contained to much unimportant information. I got a lot more respect for the movie when I saw it for the second time. I noticed that it wasn't a long ending at all. You have to realize that it's an ending of three movies, not one. And it does contain all the information it has to contain. It concludes every thing, every single story the movie contains. After I saw it for the second time I had to admit that it is a very good ending, one of the same quality as the rest of the movie. The only thing that still bothers is that the time between scenes in the end, when the screen is black, is too long. I recommend it to everyone to see the movie a second time, only then you'll see that it truly is one of the best movies ever made.
10.0~LOTR is mis-ranked xxrotini Sign in Permalink LOTR should be number 2 all time instead of number 164, or whatever it says. You have it listed as having an overall ranking of 8.0, when the voters voted it to have an 8.9. I am very dissapointed that a website as reliable as imdb.com would make such a mistake.
10.0~Why does it have to end? Ashnohgrimbatul Sign in Permalink Never have I been so sad when a movie ends, not because the movie was sad but because I will never get to experience anymore of the characters I have grown to love over the past 3 years. I won't say that this movie is flawless, but I will say that the first 3 hours were the best 3 hours of film contained in one movie that I have ever seen. People who dislike the first 2 movies because they deviated from Tokien's original storyline will not like this movie either, but that wasn't a concern for me despite having read the series 7 times. I love the books in a different way, but Jackson's interpretation is almost as I'd envisioned Middle Earth. It is a shame the story had to end.
10.0~Definitely the best of the 3 movies!! lotrgirl21 Sign in Permalink I don't understand why some people thought this movie wasn't the best. I do agree that the beginning was slow but i thought it picked up enough pace because of all the things that were happening at once. I thought that all the performances were so much better than they were in the other 2. I could really connect with these characters and their pain. My favorite character has to be Aragorn. Viggo Mortenson did such a spectacular job portraying the lost king. I really found him believable at the end of the movie. He seemed like such the perfect king. And those 4 hobbits, there aren't enough words. Each one was so spectacular in their part. To end this review, the movie followed the book very well and i think that this movie deserves at least a best picture oscar or a best director oscar for peter jackson. He struck gold with this movie.
10.0~Amazing movie giselemedeiroseng Sign in Permalink This movie is the best ending that The Lord of the Rings could ever have. I watched it today and i am just impressed about it. Masterpiece!!
5.0~What a lack of subtlety in the massive ending 2MW Sign in Permalink I was a huge fan of the LotR books, and also of the LotR films 1 and 2. But in part 3 Peter Jacksons old hobbies shine through the fabric of the film much to clearly. After the action is ended, the audience is washed away in at least half an hour of ever increasing emotional (tear jerking) scenes, that - because they are pilled up this way irritate instead of emotionate. A total lack of subtlety, or respect for the audience for that matter. Quite a disappointment after the a beautiful beginning in part 1 and 2.
10.0~Great wfranco171280 Sign in Permalink This is an epic and great movie of all time great acting and the stoyry is just fascinating...
1.0~Major problems with character development (spoilers) linnet100 Sign in Permalink I went to see ROTK for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws, want to concentrate on major issues surrounding Jackson's character development. ARAGORN is the first big problem. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills, not as Sauron wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead. And when he goes under the Dimholt he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them. Now Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. As a result we're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? There's simply been no character development of Aragorn. He's been denuded of a sense of who he is. SAURON is the next big problem. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why on earth didn't Jackson then develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!) Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur. Now this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron is a personification of evil. He's not actually the worst - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. The whole point, and if this isn't obvious in the world today then Jackson is even less astute than I imagined, is that evil in many guises takes human form. OTHERS The same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Notable exceptions are GANDALF and SARUMAN (both well acted). Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). ARWEN is drippy throughout. EOWYN is changed in the film. Miranda Otto was excellent. But Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'. As for the HOBBITS . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as SAM is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. BILBO was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh - this is kindergarten film production. I expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good. Peter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R. Tolkien, down.
10.0~purity of emotion okin_okin7 Sign in Permalink How do you condense the ultimate crusade against evil into a ten hour film? How do you capture the depth of the written word with lighting and CGI? How do you encompass the power in Lord of the Rings in a swordstroke or an embrace? The brilliance of Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" is its ability to perfectly capture a single emotion, be it love, camaraderie, betrayal, or despair, and embrace it through visual effect. Every scene in this movie contains within it one idea, masterfully expressed by Tolkien, and uniquely captured by Jackson; every camera angle, every dash of makeup, every facial gesture and reaction in each scene attempts to recreate the "single effect" Tolkien intended. And every attempt is successful. Consider the precipice on the thousand steps where Frodo is deceived, misguided into mistrust. Consider the tavern scene near the end of the movie: no words are spoken, yet none are needed; this is the power of the movie. Before leaving my seat at the movie theater, I was overcome with a sense of indescribable emotion and infinite depth. After much time and consideration, I realized that I had been struck repeatedly by scenes of true emotive power, unclouded by excess and uninhibited by thought.

10.0~Missing pieces but inspiring leakretschmar Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings is the best trilogy made in the movies and books. The books goes in different order and more detailed than the theatrical movies and the Extended version. In the extended version, they show Saurman in the beginning of the Return of the King. In the movie theater, I was mad about Jackson not having Saurman since he was a big chunk of the book. If you read the book, you will know what happens to him if you haven't seen the extended. The extended movies of the Lord of the Rings is a little more detailed, funnier, and more action than the theatrical. There are extra scenes with Aragorn and Sauron, which is very awesome. The Return of the King theatrical movie was a little chopping with the camera. The extended filled all those gaps that did not make sense. Every since the Lord of Rings Trilogy came out, I was so inspired to read their books including the Hobbit, which is very cute. I haven't seen the cartoon version of the Hobbit, but the book is cute and funny. Although I must reread the trilogy again because I think I miss some parts to it since it is so long but interesting. The books goes in such precise detailed, I think it made it easier for Jackson to provide such great actors/actress. The movies have great music and singing that it is so amazing to listen to. With all the movies that came from books, Lord of the Rings beat them all with its themes, colors, quotes, characters, humor, and so on.
10.0~Amazing.... RAxs Sign in Permalink I can only really describe this movie using one word.... AMAZING!!!!!! I'm sure a lot of you were disappointed by the conclusion to the Matrix movies, yes... We all were... However this movie brings every emotion of every last person who sees it to the very edge. Throughout this movie there were people clapping, people crying, laughing, gasping, and crossing their fingers. Everything you could ever hope for in a movie, has certainly been delivered brilliantly by Jackson. Everything you could hope for in a conclusion to a trilogy of one of the greatest set of films ever...... Has been flawlessly brought forth. I for one will be seeing this movie several times in theaters.... I know you will too!
5.0~Impressive, intense, visually stunning epic extravaganza, but vastly overrated galileo3 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (2003) Note: This review both applies to the original 201 minutes cinematic version and the 251 minute Extended Cut. Well... It is an exhaustive experience, it isn't easy sitting without disruption through four hours of monsters, CGI beasts, prolonged battle sequences and a storyline that surpasses the length of all the stories of the Holy Bible. Don't get me wrong this is a beautifully made film, faithfully adapted from Tolkien's thick, detailed novels revolving around that precious ring. I watched both 201 minutes and 251 minute versions. If you are a fan of the film, I also recommend the longer version. 50 extra minutes of footage that you will be able to cherish and appreciate. It doesn't flaw the film it just boosts it. Still all the fantasy distilled from every corner of the mind and put into this blockbuster does not, somehow, doesn't justify a Best Picture Oscar for me; Mystic River was a finer film. Did I Like the Film? Does it matter? A box office gross in excess of $1.1 billion, what does it matter? A film with 11 Oscars and a heap of critics praising it... Well I don't think this film should be in the top 100, 50, 20 or 10 films. It just doesn't have that drive. Jackson's technical and directorial achievements deserve every single praise, the film's style, art direction, effects, cinematography deserve all the accolades, but this isn't a best picture. It isn't a 10/10 masterpiece. No it is just a big, visually spectacular extravaganza. Watch it, love it enjoy it. I don't in any way disregard the praiseworthy elements of the film, but I don't consider it a masterpiece. No not a masterpiece. Just a solid, filling epic fantasy film. The best of the trilogy? Yes. The Best Film of 2003? No. "The BEN-HUR of fantasy films"
4.0~Most overrated film.... ever jackr19 Sign in Permalink I would venture to say that the Godfather underrated compared to how overrated Peter Jackson's drag-fest is. Despite an intriguing concept and decent writing, ROTK manages to put casual viewers and appreciators of good movies to a deep sleep, but it tantalizes all the senses of a good Lord of the Rings geek because it never wants itself to end. Jackson goes over the edge with his third installment, mimicking the mud and molasses pace of the Fellowship. There is something about the ending for the Return of the King that everyone should know before they see it, THERE IS NONE! The final half hour felt like the editors lost the scissors and couldn't make use of the term "cutting-room-floor." My score and recommendation would have definitely increased if not for the sluggish tempo. As a fan of the Two Towers, I was thoroughly disappointed when i learned that i wanted the movie to be over a mere 45 minutes into it. The Two Towers is a great story where everything comes together and everything has a point. The Return of the King is loaded with useless side stories and mediocre acting. If you're a hardcore fantasy world nut who likes to pretend that you are 2 feet tall and living in a hut somewhere or you have a long white hair with a long white robe or if you're just a fan of Orlando Bloom, then check out The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. If you don't have a year to spend and you want creative writing, great acting, and incredible personality, then pick up Se7en, Donnie Darko, Requiem for a Dream, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pulp Fiction, ANYTHING. FOR GOD'S SAKES, THE NINJA TURTLE MOVIE IS MORE ENTERTAINING!
10.0~The end of cinema... HarryWarden Sign in Permalink I'll keep this simple: 'The Return of the King' perfectly completes what is the single greatest cinematic achievement in the history of film. Never again will audiences be this captivated and emotionally invested in a journey so rich and beautiful. Sure, cinema will never lose it's power and will continue to enthrall us until the end of time. But it will never burn as bright as this.
10.0~The Lord of the Movies imperatorturner Sign in Permalink I first saw "Lord of the Rings" as a sixth grader. My dad and brother forced me to watch it, so I suffered through "Fellowship" with a pout on my face. Needless to say, that lasted perhaps five minutes, before I was mesmerized by the world. Everything was beautiful to me: the music, the costumes, the sets, Galadriel's voice. Indeed, "Lord of the Rings" was my chief motivator in life for a good time after. It should come as no surprise then, that "Return of the King" had the greatest impact on me. My young brain was constantly filled with stories (as a self-proclaimed "LEGO Expert," I figured my storytelling was top-notch), and Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's world left me stunned. Everything about it, from the "Continuation of Awesome," which the "Two Towers" began, to the crushing finale(s), left me in, well, awe. "Return" is kind of the first for me, in multiple aspects of film viewing: first time crying about an ending, first "chill/goosebumps" moments, first time appreciating a film's soundtrack, etc. Thus, I feel a review is necessary of this fantastical film. Plot-wise, the movie is very, and I mean VERY, formulaic. It adds on to the other two films in the trilogy, which in total, form the "Hero's Journey." Everything works out in the end, because that is the type of story this is. Sure, there may be some failure, some defeat, but this is not "Game of Thrones." Visually, "Return of the King" is stunning. I simply do not know how else to describe it. The costumes are majestic (or, in the case of Sauron's forces, hideous). The sets are wonderful: Minas Tirith, Isengard, Mordor, Shelob's Lair, etc. All of them, upon reading the books, fit perfectly into the Tolkien's world. The movements of characters/armies is incredible. The CGI is great; not overpowering/detracting from the experience of the film. Sound plays a major role in the movie. Of course, all the medieval sounds one would expect to hear in a movie such as this are present. What I care most about is the music! How well it fits with everything! Howard Shore crafted a masterpiece with "Return of the King," which is crazy, considering how good the first two soundtracks were! Similarly to "Star Wars," "Lord of the Rings" could not exist without music. Imagine watching some fires light atop mountains without the music, or Rohan's charge upon the Pelennor Fields. "Return of the King," if this has not been made obvious already, is one of my three favorite movies, so obviously I am incredibly biased in favor of it. I give no real criticism to it, and really just describe my favorite parts. As a review, this may not be worth much, due to that fact. However, I hope some will read this, and possibly be prompted to give the trilogy a watch, if they have not already seen it.
10.0~Epic for all Time wxwise Sign in Permalink Historical, you do not need to be a fan of the subject. Just look beyond all that to see the writers message to all humankind. This film speaks to us, gives us hope for our lives and for all the world. This film is an Epic for all Time.

9.0~the words to describe it haven't been invented yet(spoilers) Ainar Sign in Permalink i don't normally cry,infact even though i'm quite an emotional person i usualy manage to swallow my tears.but in this movie that wasn't the case.I cried when pippin lit the first torch,i cried when theoden said and rohan shall answer,when pippin and merry broke apart,when sam and frodo left each other ,i cried when sam thought......in short i cried throughout the whole movie ,maybe not just because it was touching but also in acknowledgement that this was really the end.No more Frodo leaning on sam,no more gimili and legolas snapping at each other,no more of the wonderful team that brought a wonderful book to life.It is the most breathtaking piece of art i've ever seen.not to be seen once but at least 5 times and to have a copy on your rack for when ever you need an inspiring movie don't hesitate to see it,because it is truly a masterpiece
10.0~Jackson maintains the quality right to the very end. WaMoZ Sign in Permalink The Return of the King was possibly the most-anticipated film ever, the previous two installments of The Lord of the Rings having instantly ingrained themselves on the movie going public's consciousness. Personally, I held little fear that the film would fall victim to the dreaded cinematic condition of sequelitis and fail to live up to expectation. But only the actual release of the movie an agonising year after The Two Towers would remove this uncertainty, and fulfill my desire to see on the big screen the end of one of the great stories. As with The Fellowship of the Ring, I need not have concerned myself. As a spectacle, The Return of the King is by far the most impressive of Peter Jackson's landmark trilogy. Unfortunately, like TTT, it has flaws, but fortunately these are not fatal. Jackson's great triumph is that even with all its CGI wonders, his film does not neglect its characters, in particular the relationships between Gandalf and Pippin, Eowyn and Theoden, and of course Frodo and Sam. Each resonates in the memory. Even in the midst of battle Jackson focuses on the people into which he has invested so much time and care. It's a shame Hollywood in general is blind to the possibility of overwhelming spectacle co-existing with the human element of cinema. The intercutting between the battle in front of the Black Gate and the desperate struggles at the Crack of Doom is just stunning, with the expressions on the faces of the each of the Fellowship members underlining what a tour-de-force of storytelling this movie is. The relationship of Frodo and Sam becomes the centrepiece of the movie more and more as it goes on. This is the way it should be, because their parting at the Grey Havens is the last act of the story. Jackson shows that his sensitivity to Tolkien is still there, in spite of the harsh verdicts of many who disapprove of the changes from book to film. Ironically, the clamour of "too many endings" by those who hadn't read the book demonstrates why the earlier changes had to be made. A lot of story had to go into this movie, but this is necessary for the following reasons. In TTT there is a convenient pause in the story between Helm's Deep and the Isengard reunion. After Pippin looks into the Palantir the momentum is unbroken in the FotR movie until the end of the great battle inside and outside Minas Tirith. Thus, a great deal of TTT book narrative was still to be shown because the movie of TTT left out many of the last chapters. There was no place for the Voice of Saruman chapter at the end of TTT, because in cinematic terms it would have been too anticlimactic, but more about that later. Also, Jackson really has no option but to put Frodo's and Sam's fights with Shelob and the battles for Gondor at the same stage of the movie. This makes so much more sense than separating them and having to handle a buildup in tension, then the Shelob fight, then another tension buildup before the great battle for Gondor. The structure of the movie would have been too cumbersome. Anyway, when Tolkien's chronology in the appendices is read, you realise both events happen at nearly the same time. The worst consequence of the packing of so much narrative into this movie is the underwritten character of Denethor. He is totally unsympathetic, which is a mistake, because in the book he is much more interesting. Jackson should have found a way to include Denethor's struggle with Sauron through the Palantir, because this is the real reason for Denethor's madness. In this film the cause is his grief over Boromir's death, which also partly explains his treatment of Faramir, but this sells the character of Denethor short. Not only that, but also the death of Denethor is perhaps Jackson's worst error of judgement. The fiery 100 yard dash and plunge over the edge is just ridiculous. There is nothing "wrong" with the arrival of the Army of the Dead to win the battle, but its just not as stirring as the end of Helm's Deep battle. The high point of RotK's battles is the charge of the Rohirrim and their fight against the Mumakil (ie giant elephants), which tends to make the actual of end of the battle a let down. Wisely, Jackson does not focus on the green tide washing over Sauron's hordes, instead he cuts back to Miranda Otto's wonderfully passionate portrayal of Eowyn killing the Witch-King, then throws in the now-famous single-handed bringing down of a mumakil by who else? Legolas, of course. No discussion of this movie should neglect the Extended Edition DVD. Possibly the greatest flaw in the theatrical version of RotK is the omission of the Voice of Saruman scene, and insertion of a silly, misleading line of Gandalf that Saruman had lost his power. But unfortunately, as with the omission of the sons of Denethor scene at Osgiliath in TTT, the scene breaks the flow of the movie too much, and given the three hour plus running time, this decision was understandable. As with TTT, Jackson is given a get out of jail card by the EE, on which Saruman's demise can be seen for the first time. I am sorry to say that I was not as generally impressed by the RotK EE as I was by the EEs of FotR and TTT. Jackson is too self-indulgent with Gimli's character. In the theatrical version of RotK I didn't mind these gags, but in the Paths of the Dead scene in particular I found that Gimli's antics spoiled the mood of horror and dread that should have been maintained. All of that being said, the EE still deserves the highest recommendation. It adds many important details, such as Eowyn and Faramir falling in love. The LotR movie experience is incomplete without it.
10.0~Peter Jackson respects his audience and characters. dgaffen-1 Sign in Permalink And I can't think of a higher complement than that. One thing I noticed near the end of this, and that's nobody in this movie, including Merry and Pippen, kills people "accidentally." There's no Jar-Jar Binks moments where a character accidentally slips on a rock, which tumbles down and kills 50 Orcs or some such nonsense. At no point is Jackson insulting us, or insulting his characters (ok, Gimli has a couple of these moments in Two Towers, but he still ended up killing people anyway.) Overall, this trilogy stands as the greatest of all time. And the significance of each battle in the individual movies becomes greater every time - the skirmish by the river in Fellowship gives way to the greater battle in Helm's Deep to the monstrous, colossal battle of Miris Tirith. It truly relates how the world of men is slowly enveloped in this task from an initial small group of people trying to change the world to the massive acknowledgement that the world will end if people do not unite. There's so many great individual moments, too - just about every character gets one, as well: (SPOILERS) --Pippen's song, while the mad steward sends his son on a suicide mission, which seems lifted from King Lear more than anything else. --Gandalf's ride to Minas Tirith --Gollum speaking to the water --"I'm glad I'm here with you at the end of all things, Sam." --Aragorn's one line, "For Frodo." --King Theoden's repeat of "I know your face" to Eowyn. And the extended coda really does it justice; this is nothing to complain about, especially when modern action movies usually end the film right after the adversary's head has been cut off and finishes rolling down a hill. Considering that this is a 9 1/2 hour epic (and more like 11 hours when considering longer versions), then there's nothing wrong with twenty minutes of endings. It's fantastic.
10.0~Without Peer cziegler2002 Sign in Permalink Return of the King is hands down the best movie of 2003. Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece from the adaptation of the book by the same name. This movie will forever raise the bar for trilogy films. From the lighting of the beacons to the charge of Rohan this movie intoxicates and charms its viewers. Bravo to Newline for having the courage and Jackson for having the vision. Return of the King will talked about 20 years from now.
10.0~Astounding on so many Levels Hotspur-8 Sign in Permalink I saw the midnight screening, worrying if I would fall asleep and miss some of the film, however even though the film was 3+ hours long I was enthralled from the first scene to the finale. What an amazing work. My experience was altogether different from seeing the first two films. I have read the Fellowship and the Two Towers but had never finished reading Return of the King, thus (even though I knew the general outcome), I was able to allow the movie to unfold to me without saying as I watched, "That's not in the book...That's not there either. Thus I will say that this movie is amazing. It is a triumph of filmmaking, cinematography, special effects, and compelling drama. The opening flashback to Sméagol's "finding" of the ring enhances the One Ring's already understood psychological power. The film then starts to build energy and emotion and then delivers a powerful climax. What makes this film more believable even though it deals with fantastical images is that the emotions of these characters are real. We see in various characters the gamut of feelings and motivations. These heroes are not all supremely brave and daring souls. There is fear, apprehension, anger, reluctance and despair. Everyone said that the battle of the Pellenor Field will be greater in scope than Helm's Deep. I was not sure that was possible. How I was wrong. The Oliphants and winged Nazgul are not only formidable but deadly. Many of the battle scenes are as harrowing as they are amazing to watch. It is truly stunning. Jackson effectively builds further on the relationships that were built in the first two films. My only complaint is that other important yet peripheral characters are not developed more fully. However this would add time to an already mammoth film. As great as this film is, one must look at it as part three of an epic work. I don't think that this film can rightly be judged individually (although it does stand alone as a great film). Some say that the emotions are somewhat lost. I could not disagree more. The emotion builds over the three films and the climax does not disappoint. Peter Jackson uses all of the pieces of his "orchestra" to complete this masterpiece. This trilogy will be the measuring stick for all trilogies done before or after. 10/10.
10.0~A super cap to a great story. weishomer Sign in Permalink Wow! The special effects were awesome. The story line was 99% true to the book. I was exhausted when I left the theater not from the length of the film but from the magnitude of its content. A lot of information to digest!
1.0~Excellent visual effects but too damn long LuciferSam Sign in Permalink OK so I saw this movie on DVD last weekend and after those long 200 minutes I still can't understand all the hype and hoopla associated with it and being called the greatest trilogy of films of all time(??). I'll be the first guy to agree that the visual effects are amazing and they blew me away and directing a fantasy tale like this is a colossal task. But I can't comprehend this movie getting 11 Oscars - probably because there weren't too many strong candidates this year. It deserved every award in the visual effects category but Best Editing???? , c'mon now I'm sure they could have done a lot better than 200 minutes!!! After watching it for awhile, the plots (if i may call them) seem to repeat themselves - its just another new breed of evil guys/creatures with new out-of-this-world names and our heroes get past them. IMHO Mystic River was a better movie and deserved the Best Motion Picture for the Year. I don't think the academy should give best picture award to a movie just for its visual effects. Don't get me wrong... I'm really not trying to bash this movie but I really cant see why this is rated the #3 movie of all time on IMDb with the other two parts in the top 10. The only reason I can think why this movie is rated so high and other exceptional movies are falling in the "ratings" is due to more people voting (especially for the latest movies) nowadays. Besides every other person has a computer these days and I wouldn't be too surprised if the younger audience preferred this visual grandeur to an intellectual movie which may be harder to grasp. I personally like movies which make me use my brain for thinking and not just for watching - like Matrix, Mulholland Drive, Sixth Sense, Memento etc. At the end of the day this is nothing but a huge fantasy tale movie which has a few human characters in the midst of grand visual effects. I haven't read the book but I'm sure the whole trilogy could have been concised to 4-5 hours instead of 9-10 hours. I kinda feel that the film trilogy is over-rated, but that's just me. I've noticed some people can't seem to accept that others don't like a particular film. But after all likes and dislikes are just a matter of opinion. Watch the movie if you have a lot of time in hand and don't want to think too hard.
10.0~The Masterpiece of our time. drlogan77 Sign in Permalink Thank you Peter Jackson. Finally here it is, and yes it's beyond my wildest dreams, first I was afraid they cannot achieve the great expectations that first generate. You have to feel this movie, I advise you not try to compare it to the book, don't fell into critics mind games, at last we film viewers have the final word, it's all there the greatest cinematography I ever saw, the little details, great performances, beautiful music, a grand finale for the greatest Trilogy ever filmed. I wish that you can enjoy this movie as I did. At the end, after the great battle,the victory the loses, there is only left what they first had their friendship and love for each other. Peace.
4.0~Good movie, travesty to readers Self_Proclaimed Sign in Permalink The entire Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is a complete travesty. I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune. The only reason that the movie deserves a 4 is because of the quality of it.
10.0~A Fine Example of Good-Old "Kiwi Ingenuity" giving Hollywood the Bums Rush! nz4eva Sign in Permalink Purests, say what you will. A movie can NEVER be exactly true to a book; they are different mediums, with differing weaknesses, strengths and constraints. Each having it's inherent possibility for magic and greatness. This, along with the other two films in the trilogy, were as much a labour of love, passion, artistry and expression of life's work to that point for Peter Jackson as for Tolkien. I say "Bravo!" to him, and "Bravo!" to the Community that grew in creating something so fine. If only we could all find such fellowship. Shame on those who find such sport in documenting every error they find in these movies. Why remove every ounce of magic and joy involved in watching the film? P.S. If you would like to see more of the beautiful New Zealand countryside, watch 'Whalerider,' 'The Last Samurai,' or 'Sylvia.' These are just a few, released last year also.
10.0~The time has come... for the dominion of Men. thesouthfamily2-552-707097 Sign in Permalink At last the full arc is visible, and the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy comes into final focus. "The Return of the King" dispatches its characters to their destinies with a grand and eloquent confidence. This is the best of the three, and certifies the "Ring" trilogy as a work of bold ambition at a time of cinematic timidity. The final battle is kind of magnificent. The desire to depict fantastic events of unimaginable size and power, and with their own cheerful reliance on visual trickery. We see men and even an army of the dead join battle against Orcs, flying dragons, and vast lumbering elephantine creatures that serve as moving platforms for machines of war. As a flaming battering-ram challenges the gates of the city, we feel the size and weight and convincing shudder of impacts that exist only in the imagination. Enormous bestial Trolls pull back the springs for catapults to hurl boulders against the walls and towers of Minas Tirith, which fall in cascades of rubble (only to seem miraculously restored in time for a final celebration). The third film gathers all of the plot strands and guides them toward the great battle at Minas Tirith; it is "before these walls, that the doom of our time will be decided." The city is a spectacular achievement by the special- effects artisans, who show it as part fortress, part Emerald City, topping a mountain, with a buttress reaching out over the plain below where the battle will be joined. In a scene where Gandalf rides his horse across the drawbridge and up the ramped streets of the city, it's remarkable how seamlessly Jackson is able to integrate computer- generated shots with actual full-scale shots, so they all seem of a piece. Jackson's achievement cannot be denied. "The Return of the King" is such a crowning achievement, such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects, such a pure spectacle, that it can be enjoyed; Tolkien's story is so sweeping and Jackson includes so much of it that only devoted students of the Ring can be sure they understand every character, relationship and plot point.
8.0~Great Experience.. jorgebutler Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is good movie but too long..
7.0~I liked it... but Minikin1 Sign in Permalink By the end did anyone else want to end Sam's life? I mean it was a great movie and all, but sometimes a movie has such a long ending that it seems to drag on forever, this is one of those movies. The action and story lines were top notch... Pippin and Merry made this movie in my eyes, but that's me... I don't really know what else to comment on... if you haven't seen it, go and see it for yourself.
7.0~Au revoir Lord of the Rings! richard-pullen-1 Sign in Permalink Three years of fuss concluded with Peter Jackson and his army of smiling puppets walking away with the American Academy Awards. I really didn't care that much because Mystic River took the acting awards (quite right too) and frankly 'Master & Commander' & Co weren't strong enough. I'm more than sure a Forrest Gump-esque film would have shattered Jackson's dreams if one was release at the same time as LOTR third installment. Saying all that credit where it is due for saving the best till last! But Hitchock & Scorsese have missed out doing better jobs than this! But I did enjoy the Return of the King, just not THAT much. Problem with doing three films at once is if the acting is bad on one film it's going to be bad on all three!!! It was.... Terrible! But the imagery and sheer scale helps this film gain my approval (not that it matters) as one of the most important films in history. Why didn't I like the trilogy? I don't know! Maybe it's because everyone loved them so damn much and I just cannot see it! Sorry to offend!
10.0~best trilogy ever edward-van-der-lugt Sign in Permalink After seeing Return Of The King at the press screening here in A'dam I was again totally amazed by the magnitude of this trilogy. Return Of The King has a better pacing, a deeper emotional context and brings us the greatest battles ever put on celluloid. These movies have to be the movies of the new millennium. It's everything you can wish for in a movie. Return features some of the best special effects you'll ever see and it moght have been impossible, but Gollum looks even better (for as far as 'looking good' can be applied on Gollum) ! This film will make you laugh, Gimli and Legolas just have to outdo each other, it will make you cry because characters we have grown into will get deaper into trouble and the film will make you jump out of your seat when those battles rol over the screen. The LOrd Of The Rings: The Return Of The King is the best movie of 2003!
4.0~Another bland LOTR movie felperin Sign in Permalink Where it is not the worst of the three (TTT was), it is still a very boring movie, the script has not an ounce of intelligence or grace or excitement. Art design and cinematography are excellent, as were in the previous two installments. The director is missing -probably giving interviews-, there is no sense of plot or purpose. The acting is so bad all across the cast that, to my total surprise, Liv Tyler does not seem the worse of the lot. An unworthy movie.
10.0~fantastically good mzysz Sign in Permalink Return of the King is one of those "great" movie spectaculars that big fans have been impatiently waiting their full lives to see, while even those who didn't gander at the books know and then have been waiting at minimum a couple of years. Oh, and maybe, just maybe those depressed lonesome souls who walked out of Fellowship of the Ring a few years ago, depicting that the movie didn't have an ending, will pull their fingers from out of their ears to go see the solution to all their unhappiness. Return of the King is the ending of all endings. These are the great films of our age but Return is more than great and more than spectacular. Let there be no doubt. (*****SPOILER ALERT*****) it all starts with a memory of gollums day as smeagol where the first battle of many, took place for the Ring, Return Of The King, as did The Two Towers jumps right into the thick of things and i mean down right hardcore and action packed. If you didn't see the first two movies, so sorry that was your mistake 'you filthy hobbits-es' and if you did see them and rated poorly, then leave now and never come back. Now that "those people" are of the IMDb page, let's talk serious about the one and truly only, Return of the King. Just like hobbitonits a marvel. it puzzles me to know that anyone can single out a certain scene which defines it, nor pick any one moment that stands out. Not because it has no umph or heart, but because every shot is pieced together like an artist painting a masterpiece. a in hind sight i mean to describe it in my final words as satisfying to the least but heroic/ triumphant at its best.
7.0~a good film ... though it does have problems magicmonkey Sign in Permalink This was a good film, fully worth the ticket price ... but this is not the 'greatest film ever made' as some folks would claim. Visually this film is stunning with some classic scenes that will be permanently burned into your consciousness. The performances for the most part are solid and the when there's action it doesn't disappoint. But there are problems.... The scenes between Frodo and Sam are painfully sentimental and effeminate with an obvious homosexual undercurrent. Any momentum built up in the preceding scenes comes crashing to a halt when these two are on screen leaving the viewer more than a little creeped out. The movie is way too long. They could have trimmed an almost an hour out of this. There's lots of scenes that really didn't contribute to the plot or character development. There a good number of slow motion scenes that resembled shampoo commercials ... lots of strutting about with breezy, flowing locks. The whole Faromir and his crazy dad business really didn't amount to much ... didn't we see this 'insane king' scenario in the 2nd movie? There's way too many 3rd rate motivational battle speeches and the singing scenes were just weird and out of place. The big battle scene looked great but wasn't completely satisfying. What was the point of all of the heroics and sacrifice of the armies of men if the invincible ghost army was just going to show up and clean house? The ghost idea was cool but they should have portrayed them to be less invincible so that the preceding battle wouldn't be rendered so insignificant. But despite these flaws this is still a very good film. Finally the D&D genre adventure film has been treated with the respect it deserves. LOTR has done for swords and sorcery what the original Star Wars trilogy did for space adventure films. I hope there'll more great films in this genre ... perhaps 'The Crystal Shard'? 7/10
10.0~A REMINDER OF THE POWER OF CINEMA!!! flicklover Sign in Permalink Movies today are mostly entertaining, but most are forgettable. The Lord of the Rings trilogy has proven that classic movie making and storytelling can still prevail in this time of weekend box office gross competitions. The Return of the King marks the end of what I believe is the greatest movie trilogy in history.Period. Not even George Lucas can compete with the masteriece that Peter Jackson has created.From the first frame the time and love that has been put into this story is evident on the screen.
4.0~awful movie trajan-1 Sign in Permalink The acting is sub-par in this movie just to start off. They tell a great story without the character building, hard to believe from a 3 hour movie, and yes I through away my money on the other 2 horrible movies. Can they actually hire people to right a decent script in Hollywood now? It didn't look like it from this movie, the acting suggested I was watching episode 2 of the StarWars series, who in their right mind would ever cast Orlando Bloom, has he ever made a good movie, or acted well? Disapoointing series reminds me of planet of the apes, and episode 2, very bad production of the orcs looks like planet of the apes series, and the acting was horrible
3.0~Seen it All Before.. jason-1415 Sign in Permalink The problem with this movie is that there's nothing new going on, its more of the same from the previous 2 movies. This is by far the weakest of the series, the ending was just so corny and predictable. Same old battles, same old Frodo, same old clichés, same old everything, this movie had nothing. This whole series could've been 1 movie, instead they just milked it for all that it was worth, and by the time this one came around i'd had more than enough. I don't understand how this movie ranks at number 4 on the top 250 list of all time, it shouldn't be in the top 1000 let alone the top 250. The only words to describe this movie are bloated and self-indulgent.
10.0~God save the king ¡ gasprino Sign in Permalink I will never forget this trilogy¡ Jackson's directing achievement can't be measure¡ special effects, cinematography, make up, costume design, sound, score, editing, screenplay, actor's performances ... everything in it's right place. I'm sure lots of people all over the world feels the same about the movie. Ian McKellen is Gandalf, he is not just an actor... He really became the white wizard¡ Mortensen, Wood, Weaving, Bloom, Astin, Blanchette, Tyler ... what a crew¡ I read the book four years ago, and i just could't believe that images from movie matched perfectly with my imagination. I wish this movie make directors and producer of Hollywood assume new challenges¡ God save the King¡
10.0~The Return of the Ring user-705-156426 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the third film in the film trilogy The Lord of the Rings. It was released in December 2003, one year after the second film in this trilogy, the two towers. Aspects like light and colour, camera work and editing will be discussed and to sum everything up the conclusion will give a final verdict. In the third and final part of the Lord of the Ring, Sam, Frodo and Gollum continue their trip to Mordor to destroy the One Ring. At the same time, Aragorn, Gandalf and the remaining fellowship find out that Sauron is about to attack the city Minas Tirith. They try to gather a human army to battle. Then Gandalf finds out that Denethor, the Steward of Gondor is mad with grief because of his son Boromir, who died in the first film. Gandalf therefore leads the human army to give them a chance of winning the final battle. Aragorn finds personal motivation to win the battle, as when Sauron is getting stronger, his love Arwen is dying. To save her, he must reclaim the throne and lead the human army against Sauron. But even with his new army to aid Frodo he still has to have the strength to destroy the ring that has enchanted him. But does he have the strength to do this? The usage of light and color in this film is used particularly to accentuate the moods of various characters in the film and to immerse the viewer with the feelings felt by all characters. For instance, the colors are dark when Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas visit the city of the dead, and even the brightly dressed characters seem rather bleak when inside the mountain. This changes the moment Aragorn whips out Andurill, as the saturation seems to increase slightly at the moment. Especially when the eye of Sauron gazes at Aragorn's army the harsh light and the colors bleak, it may at first seem threatening, but gives a feeling of hope and serenity as Aragorn says: "For Frodo!" The overall lighting is quite dark and the colors particularly unsaturated, with the exceptions of the happy moments of the characters. The way the cameras are used in this film is absolutely brilliant. As the director, Peter Jackson, refused to use CGI to make actors playing hobbits seem smaller compared to other actors, he used optical illusions, placing the hobbits further away while giving the audience the impression the actors mare standing next to each other. When it was not necessary to show the faces of both or multiple characters at the same time, Peter would use scale doubles for the characters whose faces weren't necessary. An example of this is Eowyn riding to war with Merry. As they are waiting to charge on the battlefield, the shots only show Eowyn's face with the top of Merry's helmet at the bottom of the screen or Merry's face with Eowyn's torso behind him. The cameras are angled so perfectly that you wouldn't notice this the first time, but would still remain non-intrusive to the entire experience even if you were to notice it. In this film special effects play a huge role and a total 2730 of special effects were used in the Lord of the Rings series were used of which 1477 in Return of the King. Special effects are the main reasons this film has been released such a long time after the animated series, as the technology was not present or too expensive to create visual effects as flying dragons or even many scenes which were filmed in front of a green screen and the décor was later added in the studio. The biggest example of an incredibly necessary and important special effect is, the by all loved, Sméagol. The special effects help accentuate the mystical feeling you get by all the happenings that are impossible in real life. Once again great care has been taken to carefully adjust the film in such a way that the film is perfect and balanced correctly. During conversations reverse-shots were occasionally used to get as much involved in the conversation as possible as you experience it as if you are actually amongst the characters and joining the conversation. Whenever the action commences the average shot length decreases. This means that before the action the shots are fairly long, but as the action starts to build up the shots get shorter and shorter to create the feeling of chaos and excitement. The shots are transitioned in such a way that the audience gets more curious to what will happen and what really happened since the shot are so abruptly ended/ In conclusion we have all enjoyed this great film, as the plot was great and the cast perfectly chosen. The acting was of high quality and it was also the best adaptation of a book we had seen so far, which can't be said about a lot of recent films. The camera-work and editing was done perfectly and the light and color was just right at every moment, and the special effects were staggering. We also loved the original soundtrack, as it dragged us deeper into the film, making it an unforgettable journey through Middle Earth for us. Together we came to the conclusion that this film was worth a ten out of ten, and fully deserved all awards it had received.
10.0~"Return of the King" surpasses earlier installments Margeloc Sign in Permalink Fantastic achievement in film-making! Surpasses 1 and 2, excellent as they both were (PARTICULARLY in the extended DVD versions, which I now own). I only wish there could be a FOURTH installment to REALLY wrap up all "loose" ends! (But perhaps release of the extended DVD version in the Fall will help in this regard -- one can hope!) I feel that BOTH Ian McKellan (Gandalf) and Sean Astin (Samwise) deserve "Oscar" attention this year - and OF COURSE Peter Jackson for "Best Director!" Have heard persistent rumors that Jackson MAY consider tackling "The Hobbit" in another couple of years. Would be wonderful if true!
10.0~You'll be surprised at how good it is the SECOND time around G'aal Sign in Permalink I admit it: I'm a bit of a late-blooming Middle Earth geek. I never played D&D role-playing games as a kid, but in recent years have actually played them with a group of guys who grew up on that stuff. Regardless, I was NOT a Lord of the Rings fan whatsoever when the first movie came out. In fact, I knew very little about it, and indifferently agreed to go to see it two years ago. I was completely blown away. Since then, I've become a full-fledged LOTR fan, having devoured the books now twice. Last year, a group of us (yes, the same thirtysomething dorks that I play role-playing games with) went to see "The Two Towers" at 12:01 a.m. the day it opened. We did the same thing again this year with "Return of the King". This is an utterly fantastic movie, and the phraseology understates just how tremendous it really is. This is the epitome of an epic film and is, in my opinion, the "biggest" movie (scope, grandeur, depth, overall size of presentation) ever made. It is a HUGE movie, without question the "biggest" of the series. You don't have hundreds of orcs at a time like in "Fellowship" or even ten thousand in battle like in "Two Towers" -- you have a HUNDRED THOUSAND. You don't just have a cave troll, you have twenty hammer-wielding trolls. You don't have three Oliphaunts like in "Two Towers", you have a dozen. Throw in swarms of fell beasts, Nazgul, the army of the dead and the kitchen sink while you're at it. This is an unbelievably impressive movie. I saw it a second time with my 11-year old daughter (also a LOTR nut) and the emotions shifted. I was of course still impressed, but much of my feelings shifted to pride. I was proud of Aragorn for finally assuming the leadership mantel, proud of Gandalf for being the born leader he is, proud of Eowyn for standing up to the Witch King, proud of Merry for going to battle against all odds and *especially* proud of Sam's courage through adversity. His stand against the feral, horrific Shelob is a sight to behold (and the special effects, especially when she has him cornered and is coming at him from above and to the side, are jaw-dropping). I'll be honest: I loved the original movie, as I felt it spun a tale of classic good versus evil, which clearly etched the undermanned, underdog human/elf/dwarf/hobbit fellowship against the legions of evil. It had "heart". The second movie was good, but lost some of the original's wondrousness along the way. The final chapter regains the franchise's "heart" with a classic tale, told in a soaring, rousing fashion. I'm not sure if I like "Fellowship" or "Return of the King" better, but I'm happy to say that it's a damn close call either way. See the movie once more, at least. See if your amazement turns to another emotion or two along the way. I know mine did.
1.0~Second Worst Ending Ever! pace123 Sign in Permalink A great film, sorely let down by the ending. I know Jackson is only trying to stick to Tolkien's version but the ending was unsuited for a film. It just dragged on and on and on. It really soured my experience of what otherwise was a great trilogy. The interminable ending should have been resigned to a Director's Cut DVD version to satisfy Tolkien fans. The worst ending ever? A.I. of course :)
10.0~Masterpiece nicolae_alina_roxana Sign in Permalink This trilogy is the BEST ever. I love it ! Every time i watch those movies i realize that i'll never be bored to watch them again. Every thing is awesome from the story - till the screenplay,picture,makeup,fashion design and the EXCEPTIONAL actors that make those movies a cinematic MASTERPIECE! And now after 10 years remains just as good! From my point of view, i think Viggo Mortensen would have deserved an Oscar ( best actor ) for his role as Aragorn ( it fit's him like a glove ). Congratulations to Peter Jackson and his entire team, for his achievement and i look forward to see the movie " The Hobitt "
9.0~Superb movie, but... blm140743 Sign in Permalink Like the two movies before this one I immersed myself in the story. I am one of those who do not care that the film does not exactly matches the book. This film, like the book, creates a magic of it's own and I laughed and cried with it. But, here drops the other boot, that ghastly scene at the end of the movie where the Hobbits endlessly hug and stare each other in the eyes... It created the same feeling of nausea that I experience when when, accidentally, watching a piece of a soap on T.V. As we say in Holland, "it made my toes curl". Therefore and therefore alone I rated this a 9 not a 10 like the previous 2 movies.
10.0~They saved the best for last Derek237 Sign in Permalink Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments. At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come. This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable. These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them. Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing. My rating: 10/10
9.0~A New Bar has been set for Chronicles of Narnia, Star Wars Episode III, the next Harry Potter skhan_web Sign in Permalink No film can be perfect for everyone, but this comes close! Peter Jackson found a way to convert a complex and layered story into a movie masterpiece. It could have been done a thousand different ways and still not everyone would be satisfied. This was the best shot and will be hard pressed to be surpassed. Chronicles of Narnia, Star Wars Episode III, the next Harry Potter movie have a new bar.
10.0~A most stupendous spectacle of cinematic triumph CurtMan@LVCM.com Sign in Permalink Going into this film, I was entirely oblivious as to what to expect. I found the first two "Lord of the Rings" films to be dazzling in action, if often stagnant in dialogue, and so my expectations for this film were high if not stratospherically high. Boy, was I surprised at how this wonderful, spectacular film surpassed any kind of expectation and kept me on the edge of my seat in almost its entire nearly three and a half hour run. Spellbinding, breathtaking, and with epic battle scenes more terrifying and engaging than any film of "horror" I have ever seen, this film succeeds on practically every level, as a certifiable masterpiece in film-making. The direction of Peter Jackson is sweeping and incredible in his infinite scope and articulation, among the most laudible and well-deserved Oscars I have ever admired. "King"'s screenplay avoids the hollowness and gushiness of its predecessors, with the characters primarily speaking what is on their mind, particularly about the war against good and evil which is to be waged between man and orc. The music is every bit as astounding as the original "Rings", portentous to the various moods of action and drama throughout the film, supplying plenty suspense, exhilaration, and overall life to the film, a most essential component of the tone of the film. Visual effects: what can I say? Awesome and mind-blowing, the best of the trilogy and possibly the best of the history of cinema. Gollum as insidious and enjoyable as ever! Breathtaking scenery, magnificent art-set direction, and the complements could extend forever... A truly beautiful, stupendous masterpiece of a film, a leviathan of nearly every aspect of cinema, and the best film of 2003 by far. Generally, a movie trilogy is prone to tremendous declination as it proceeds, yet "Rings" merely inclines to the end, stratospherically. It is everything you would want in a movie, and a sensationally excellent film! **** out of ****
6.0~I laughed...I cried (a lot) mutcutts Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was in my 23 years, the most eagerly anticipated film EVER. Not only did it deliver, but they succeeded in doing something so rarely accomplished in film. It's so emotional and powerful that it brings tears to your eyes. Don't even bother fighting them. I saw this movie with my father and I looked over at him and saw them in his eyes as well. It was an amazing moment. Thank you Peter Jackson, New Line, Weta Digital and all the amazing cast, crew, hobbits, elfs and orcsies for creating the greatest film achievement of my generation and for raising the bar for all fantasy film adventures to come.
10.0~I am beyond any doubt that there will never be a film nearly so brilliant as this one. (spoilers) Crakly-Dragon Sign in Permalink No words can portray the sheer brilliance of these 3 films, and the 3rd in particular. It really annoys me that so many people bitch about it so much. Is it not possible for people to think before they write? I read many of the other comments that people have written and i advise them to read the books again before saying that parts of the movie are wrong(like, yes it was Eowyn who destroyed the witch king in the book, not Merry, this scene was done the same as it was in the book.) And to think about the movie and what each scene means before writing about it. Also, there are many that say that the film is too long, and the end should be shorter, but if you think about it, it would suck if done differently. Just think, if it ended with the crowning of the king, then we don't get to see the hobbits go home, we'd be left with "what happened to the hobbits?" And then what would be the purpose of references to Rosie Cotton if we never see her? And if they stopped the film after that, it would just be stupid.You'd be like "did Elrond and Galadriel go on a ship too? where's Gandalf?" Peter Jackson ended the film perfectly. And he made the rest perfectly as well. Anyway, i am writing this about the greatness of the movie, not the stupidity of some veiwers. I cold talk forever about the excellent CGI and so on, so i will focus on he cast. Every character is portrayed to a T, and i don't think any were miscast. Elijah Wood takes every moment of Frodo's screen time and lets us know just how tortured he is as he he makes his way to Mordor. Sean Astin is maybe the greatest of them all, and the Sam we see is every bit the pure goodness of Frodo's best friend who struggles to keep his master on the right track despite the schemeing Gollum's attempts do drive the 2 apart. Though they don't normally get much attention, The roles of Merry and Pippin are done stunningly,and the emotion is felt by everyone as the best friends are forced to into their worst fears and torn away from each other. Pippin(Billy Boyd) is totally believable as he is taken with Gandalf to Minas Tirith and becomes a gaurd of the citadel, forced to fight in the greatest battle of Middleearth. And Merry is left behind in Edoras, with Eowyn(Miranda Otto), and despite orders, the 2 ride to battle together. Legolas(Orlando Bloom), Gimli(John Rhys Davies) and Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen) take the paths of the dead into the cursed mountains in search of a dead army, the only hope for victory in the upcoming battle on the Pelennor fields. Gandalf the white (Ian McKellen) tries to convince the crazed steward of Gondor(John Noble) to raise the alarm and ask Rohan for help in the battle, but he is greiving the death of the favoured of his 2 sons, Boromir(Sean Bean). And to finish it off, we have Faramir, the stewards last son, and who, after leaving the overrun Osgiliath, returns to Minas Tirith only to be sent back in an attempt to win his fathers love, despite the fact that it is an obvious suicide. David Whenham's Faramir is such a sad character, and is portrayed with alot of emotion, he is fully believable. This movie, all in all, has what every one wants, action, romance, humor, drama, and the odd bit of humor and horror, and is most certainly a tear jerker. I myself am known as one who doesnt cry, but found myself bawling my eyes out 6 times throughout the film. The definition of heartless is those who didn't cry in the end of the movie. Truly the greatest film of all time, any one who says they were not drawn in and sitting watching in awe throughout is a liar. Truly brilliant. 10 out of 10.
1.0~Wow, bummer. rightous2400 Sign in Permalink So many high expectations which are all brought plummeting downward in the final episode of the saga. First of all, Orlando Bloom is gay. He is one of the most pathetic actors I have ever watched. Secondly, this movie is incredibly long and drawn out, with nothing any more interesting then what is in THE TWO TOWERS. Finally, it is very disappointing watching the poor acting coming from ELIJAH WOOD and SEAN ASTIN. They have done better in movie such as NORTH and ENCINO MAN. Fortunately, for the avid moviegoers, there are some quality fantasy/Scifi movies that you can go see. Such as MANOS: HANDS OF FATE and MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHALATION. The only good thing about this movie is...wait, there are no good parts about this movie. Take this review serious because I am serious. If you want to call me and talk to me about it, call 1-805-423-6182. Ask for Chris or Alex.
5.0~In the running for the cheesiest movie ever deproduction Sign in Permalink This was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is in the running for the cheesiest film ever made. A film is cheesey when the characters get all sappy and the audience isn't sucked-in due to poor character development or unbelievable circumstances. Its my opinion that the filmmakers here depended on the audience having read the book to learn to connect with the characters, because as someone who didn't read the book, I didn't care about any of the characters, many of whom were introduced and disappeared again without really advancing the story. This film ended at least 30 minutes before the credits ran, it just seemed like Peter Jackson wanted to construct this grandiose conclusion to the epic that would please all the die-hard tolkien fans. Save it for the two-dozen-DVD collector's edition set! This movie is crap. I want the 7 hours I gave to this trilogy back!
4.0~The end of all things galensaysyes Sign in Permalink I had expected to enjoy this film as much as the first two, or even more; but I felt glad when it was over, and my disappointment makes me feel ungenerous toward it. Technically it's the best of the three, less slapped-together-looking, and some parts of it succeed, finally, in capturing the authentic Tolkien atmosphere. But some parts--and sometimes the same parts--are just boring, others are just noisy, the director has begun to repeat himself, and in this culminating installment his inability to come to grips with the crux of the story becomes evident. The previous films, despite their faults, held me all the way through; this one had me wanting to leave after a few minutes. The previous films filled me with a sense of wonder, over and over; this one has it only seldom (as in the lighting of the beacons), and in some places where it might show, it's swamped by the director's overfondness for grue and beasties. I never liked his Orcs (extras in Halloween masks), and here he turns the army of the dead into the Pirates of the Caribbean. The previous films kept me in the world they created; this one kept throwing me out of it, particularly in the scenes of Minas Tirith--where, as an example, the faces, unlike those of the Shire and Rohan, included several that were joltingly contemporary (possibly belonging to friends of the director). The previous films, though of course they cut much from the books, included the essentials of the story; this one eliminates much, including everything to do with Saruman (the parley at Orthanc, the pollution of the Shire, the fates of Saruman and Wormtongue). We see Eowyn and Merry's wounding, but not their healing; we see a Palantir, but not Denethor's; we see Sam with the Ring, but not his use of it. Instead the film squanders most of its time on fighting: not only the battle scenes, which are terrific for a while but go on and on, recycling the same effects again and again, but also wrestling bouts between Sam and Gollum, Frodo and Gollum, Sam and Frodo, Sam and Shelob, etc. Then there are the scenes showing again and again--what was established upon Gollum's first appearance--that he's a treacherous villain and Sam doesn't trust him. But the main fault of the film--and of the others, though it becomes crucial here--is its relative shallowness. It fails to convey the feeling, or the moral meaning, of Frodo's struggle with the Ring. The director resorts to externals--dialogues with Gollum the fallen one, Frodo's alter ego--without ever getting inside Frodo himself. Nor do we ever understand what the Ring is and what it means. The same is true of the event from which this film takes its title. Aragorn gets his sword back, gets a crown and a good cheer, and that's it. His union with Arwen comes down in the end to a juicy kiss. And, incomprehensibly, the film omits the most important line of all, Frodo's, when he says what it's all been in aid of: "It must often be so when things are in danger: that some people have to give them up so that others may keep them." To be fair to the filmmakers, they may simply have butted up against the central problem which confronted them at the outset: Tolkien's books and characters aren't dramatic. Individual scenes in the films are dramatic, the actors are compelling enough personalities to put them across, and the combination makes for good theatre. But, as has been well said by the Eldar, it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing.
9.0~Worth the Wait? M-oO-dles Sign in Permalink For every one who was looking forward to Return of the King for a year, the last and final part of The Lord of the Rings was definitely worth it to wait. Readers and fans of the book already knew what was coming, and were only questioning themselves how Peter Jackson was putting the more than difficult plot on the screen. Well, the result was totally stunning. And if you've never even heard of the book or read it you will be even more amazed than I am. Revolutionary special effects, great acting performances, an eye for detail and a fantastic story make this movie to an unforgettable experience, and not just for the fans from the book or the movies. This is a must-see for every one! Return of the King is the ultimate war-movie, but also a tale of considerate friendship, love, loyalty, alliances, sorrow and of course the eternal battle between good and evil. Try putting that in a movie of about three hours! The only thing that pities me is the fact that I don't have another Lord of the Rings movie to look forward to next year, and only have the extended DVD left to set my mind on. And it is indeed sad, because it is my expectation we will not see another jewel like Return of the King for at least a decade! So my advice, sit down and be amazed by the wonders this movie has to offer you.
10.0~one of the best movie ever tigerpfoten Sign in Permalink The books were already unique. I can't tell you how often I read them. I also watched the movies more than once. It is a wonderful composition of film, music, good actors and an idea that has been excellently implemented. This film offers everything: heartache, a smile, jokes, tears and shows what true friendship is all about. I don't think Tolkien would ever have wanted another movie.
10.0~Breathtaking and enthralling grievous Sign in Permalink The film is absolutely breathtaking and enthralling from start to finish. You would never believe that you have been sat in a cinema for over three hours when it ends, the time just disappears. If this film does not carry all before it at the Oscars then there really is no justice on this earth.
10.0~Still recovering akira49370 Sign in Permalink Words cannot express the emotion in this film. At first I was kind of concerned because it didn't feel like the other two films. I don't know why I just can't explain it, but when the action started it all came back. Totally astounding special effects. The battle scenes alone were on a scale that will not be forgotten. I hear a lot of people knocking it for not having Saruman in it. Which in all honestly I was disappointed with. I wish they could have done the cleansing of the shire. But other than some minor complaints still a movie I will not soon forget. I will say this if this movie does not win Best Picture at the Academy Awards I will be gravely disappointed. Last year I saw all the nominations and there was in no way shape or form that Chicago was better than The Two Towers. I thought Gangs of New York better than Chicago. Previously it was also snubbed by A Beautiful Mind. While it was good Fellowship was a much better film. Again if this movie doesn't win Best Picture not only will I never watch the Oscars I will not even acknowledge Oscar again. I'm still trying to figure out how The Last Emperor won in 1987. Well anyway there is my scoop. I hope that this movie gets all the awards it deserves. Peter Jackson I've been a fan since I saw Bad Taste. I hope you'll do The Hobbit or maybe The Wheel of Time series. You are a true fantasy artist. You have made my dream world into a reality. Thank you!!!!
10.0~The adrenaline-rushing conclusion of the Epic ja_kitty_71 Sign in Permalink Tolkien's works were adapted into TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi had animated the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level in a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart, a bit of humour, heart-thumpin' action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you, that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars - Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler. In this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure, the War of the Ring has begun, and Frodo & Sam (who led by Gollum) continue their dangerous quest to destroy the One Ring. But they are unaware of the trap that set for them by Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf united with Merry & Pippin at the now destroyed Isengard, thanks to them, Treebeard and the other Ents. Now the friends celebrated their victory; but Aragorn was worried of Frodo. And in the dead of the night, Pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at Saruman's palantir, that was found and confiscated. But something happened, the palantir showed him The Eye of Sauron, and that he is planning to attack Minas Tirith; So Gandalf took Pippin, and rode to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, on the road to the ships that will take elves away from Middle Earth, Arwen was thinking over her choice of path. Until a vision of her son convinces her to go home. So she rode home and plead her father to reforged the ancient blade of Narsil, and give it to her beloved Aragorn, so he can become the king he was born to be. So overall ALL three films are excellent. And you know, I do feel sorry for Faramir for being the unappreciated son, I mean it was his big brother Boromir who was their dad's favorite. I love the developing friendship between Merry & Eowyn. And I love the end-title song performed by Annie Lennox.
10.0~The best of the three brixen-1 Sign in Permalink I've been struggling with myself to determinate whether it is the fellowship of the ring or the return of the king which is the best of the three. The fellowship is a great movie, and it really draw you into the universe of Tolkien, but I feel that it miss some epic scene which we see in both the second and the third film. Therefore, the return of the king is the best of these three great movies.
10.0~AWESOME! (No Spoilers contained) sandersonm Sign in Permalink After the bitter disappointment of the Matrix trilogy, I entered the cinema with doubt, hoping that this ending to the trilogy wouldn't disappoint. It doesn't. It's an epic! Peter Jackson gives us a concluding chapter that is perfectly shot, with excellent dialogue keeping the audience captivated for the duration of this long movie. The battle sequences are incredible, surprising and just as good as what you could hope for. Yes there are a couple of "cheesy" moments but these can be forgiven as the rest of the movie leaves you spellbound. I read the books about 18 years ago and had forgotten most of the details of the story, so I'm not sure what the purists think, but hey as a film, well it rocks! Expect it to be in the Top 10 for some time to come, simply legendary!
10.0~Stunning conclusion to one of the best series ever made vithiet Sign in Permalink An absolutely epic conclusion to this fantastic trilogy. An perfect adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece, which set all the standards for Fantasy movies just like Tolkien did for Fantasy literature.
10.0~Best Movie I have seen miroth20 Sign in Permalink I have to say that the movie was the best I have seen. Now as for comments from those earlier. Anyone who says the first ten minutes should be cut don't understand the importance of Smeagol. Anyone says that the last twenty should be cut don't understand Tolkien's true vision, the book never just ended after the battle, and neither should the movie, because there is always more story, which was shown beautifully in the ending sequences. Now as a huge fan of the Tolkien lore I personnally have always been biggest fans of Gandalf and Gimli, I like dwarves. But I have to say that Sean Ashtin as Samwise Gamgee was the most moving perfomance I have ever seen. He exemplifies Sam's spirit and courage and was for me the most enjoyable character of the movie. He should definitely win an Academy Award. Also memorable notions were Merry and Pippin, who grow into their parts and make the hobbits the main focus of the movie. Beautiful. Now I admit there are differences then the book, but that is going to happen with any movie made from a book, but I have to say Peter Jackson has brought the spirit of Tolkien's books alive and it is one of the most spectacular sights you will ever see. The acting is perfect, whoever said they look like cardboard cutouts doesn't know how to do proper characterization or to blind to see, and I will see it over and over again. Manwe, Ulma, Varda, and all the gods of Valinor would be proud.
10.0~The best film ever fiona_256 Sign in Permalink when the second lord of the rings movie came out i didn't think that any thing could ever top this film. I was amazingly surprised when the third film came out and i was once again amazed at the talent and hard work of all of the actors and people who didn't work in front of the camera. the plots of the books are very complex and i believe that the genius that is peter Jackson and the other script writers put the films together to make sure that it was not only interesting but it was easy to understand without being patronising. I have gone on from watching the films to reading the books, the hobbit, the silmirilian and all three of the books. i found them all fabulous and especially the silmirillion, which is like the bible of middle earth and a must-read for any obsessive!! the special effects on the films were breath taking and the beauty of New Zealand has made it my dream destination in life. thanks guys!!!!
9.0~With a saga so all encompassing Peter Jackson scores ozthegreatat42330 Sign in Permalink I have been a "Lord of The Rings" fan since 1970 when I first read the trilogy. Peter Jackson has done a masterful job, with the help of Fran Walsh of bringing it to the movie screen. For those who would complain about what is left out from the book, admittedly I would like to have seen more but until someone decides to do a thirty hour mini-series this will remain the definitive "LOTR." I have just finished watching the extended version of "Return of the King" and I am not surprised that it has broken or tied almost every record in Hollywood. they could have handed out twenty-four more Oscars for the principal actors and they would have been well justified. It will be very hard for the motion picture industry to create any film that will ever beat out this feature for the sheer magnificence of the scale of the film. This one will top the record books for decades to come.
10.0~The best part of the trilogy felsir Sign in Permalink I was privileged to see the movie in a preview for the press. I must say, this is the best part in the trilogy. Mr. Jackson did a great job weaving the ventures of Sam and Frodo (and Gollum/Smeagol) into the film, since in the book they hardly appear RotK. The decision to put the Shelob chapter in this movie proved to be a wise one. The epic battle, the emotions of the characters, it's all there. The movie is fast paced during the quest. Even King Theoden get a chance to be more heroic than in the Two Towers (IMHO he was shown too much as an indecisive character in the Two Towers even though he was released of the influence from Grima). Once the quest ends the pace drops to get a glimpse of what the characters make of their lives after this experience. Too bad the journey has ended. It was a great experience and I can't wait for the special edition DVD set!
10.0~The best movie that I've seen this year... radiopal Sign in Permalink This is probably going to be one of thousands, or maybe 10's of thousands of reviews that are going to be written about THE RETURN OF THE KING. I wasn't sure what I was going to expect, but I was almost certain to be entertained. And I was. I was also amazed at how deeply the movie touched me. It made me think about what real honor is, what courage looks like, and what true love is. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I won't tell you about the elements of the movie, but understand that it's a movie that I will be seeing again... and again. If you haven't seen THE RETURN OF THE KING... please be sure to check it out. I saw it at 11 p.m. 12/19/03.... and was totally enthralled. --Hal K
10.0~The Return of Movie Magic steve macmurray Sign in Permalink Having eagerly anticipated this final instalment since Christmas 2003, my hopes and expectations for ROTK were particularly huge. With every article, trail, web page and poster adding to the suspense, I could not help believing that surely there would be some level of disappointment on my first viewing. My fears could not have been further from the truth. Peter Jackson has delivered a magnificent finale, crowning what must be a unique movie-making achievement - a movie trilogy that surpasses each previous instalment. Superlatives simply cannot do it justice. ROTK is nothing less than pure movie magic. It generated the same spine-tingling, heart in the mouth moments that only the silver screen can elicit when functioning at its best. As a cynical adult, with a fractured attention span, I could hardly have guessed at how I would be absolutely riveted for over three hours, my jaw dropping in amazement at the spectacular tale unfolding before me. Having lived and loved Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Terminator 2 even Jurassic Park, it becomes ever harder to conceive of a movie that could possibly create the gasp and wonderment that only utter cinema magic can conjure. Peter Jackson, along with his cast and crew have proven their credentials as master wizards. Let's hope that the industry can recognise this incredible ach
10.0~This I suppose, is the greatest fantasy film made till date. braddugg Sign in Permalink This I suppose, is the greatest fantasy film made till date. There are many reasons why this is the greatest. The visual effects were spectacular and they have increased the scope of any film. This film took the film-making to new heights which were previously not thought of. Peter Jackson for this very reason became one of the greatest filmmakers ever. The beginning is very simple, and it takes us to the backstory of the ring. The battle scenes are nothing short of epic. The culmination is happy and this has a feel good ending. everything is so perfectly commercial on the face of it. But, to tell it the way it has been told is stupendous. The acts by all, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Austin as Sam, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn are the most memorable for me. These are characters I shall not forget ever in my lifetime. The writing by JRR Tolkein is a masterpiece in itself but to translate such visual strength to the celluloid would have been the greatest challenge for any filmmaker. Just happy that Peter Jackson did his bit in bringing one of the greatest fantasy novels to the public reach, He actually did a great service by doing so. He served the book readers and the film viewers hugely. Thanks to all, who have made this film and the trilogy a possibility and I am going with 5/5. Nothing less for one of the greatest films.
10.0~A stunning achievement by Peter Jackson and friends ssparling Sign in Permalink Return of the King is a sweeping, moving, and breathtaking achievement. As with the first two films in this remarkable trilogy, director Peter Jackson has done a masterful job of translating Tolkien's prodigious book into a streamlined and cunning movie. In the process, Jackson may very well have created the greatest movie trilogy of all-time. Moreover, King stands on its own as a great film for its depth of story, character development, imagination, and visual brilliance. The film follows two story lines. First, there is the tale of the hobbits' journey to Mount Doom to destroy the ring of power. Here, Jackson does a masterful job of developing the deep friendship between Frodo and Sam even further, creating an even stronger bond between the two friends who come closer and closer to peril with each step they take towards Mordor. Building on the foundation of the first two films, Jackson's work in King enables the viewer to feel true emotions for Frodo and Sam. Sitting in the theater, you pity and admire these two characters. Indeed, while the name of the film is "Return of the King," at the heart of the movie is this friendship between Frodo and Sam and their joint battle against the great evil of the ring. Bolstering this rich story of friendship is Jackson's artful depiction and development of the complex character Gollum, as well has his edge-of-your-seat work with Shelob. The second storyline of the film is, of course, Aragorn's return to Gondor to reclaim the throne of men. Here, the film is packed with stunning and powerful battle sequences that seamlessly blend digital special effects with terrific live action. As war sequences go, King stands amongst the very best in film history. Amidst the action, Jackson is able to deliver stories of heroism and human frailty that empower and move the viewer. Particularly well done is Eowyn's confrontation of the Nazgul Witch King. Each time I saw the film, the audience cheered. These two stories are artfully cut together in a way that keeps this 3 hour and change film moving. Almost gone from this film are the slow-talking Ents introduced in the Two Towers, which threatened to put some audience members asleep. Of course, Jackson was forced to cut certain stories from Tolkien's third book in the interest of not keeping the audience overnight. Gone are the downfall of Saruman, the romance between Eowyn and Faramir, the the hobbits recapture of the shire. While the elimination of some of these scenes from the film may disappoint some of Tolkien loyalists, Jackson's choices work and enable Tolkien's main themes to come to life on the screen. The most difficult challenge facing King is our tendency to compare it to Jackson's other two films. Naturally, one's inclination is to immediately decide which of the three films was the greatest. This analysis has the risk of diminishing the audience's appreciation for the splendor and depth of King as its own film. At the end of the day, Jackson's achievement in King is two fold. He has not only made a great movie, but has now made three great films in a row. King is a powerhouse movie. See it.
4.0~Orcs Galore! spider-82 Sign in Permalink If this is the 2nd best movie of all time, then I must have been taking crazy pills when I saw it. It was perfectly serviceable as a kid's story and the visuals were superb. But the last 35 minutes were a complete waste of everyone's time and all of the acting was mediocre at best. Viggo Mortenson probably deserves some credit for giving the only performance that doesn't stray off into melodrama or rote, wooden "mailing it in". I saw the first film in the theaters and nearly fell asleep. I saw the second leg in a drinking theater and was mildly entertained. (The beer helped, a lot.) I saw the 3rd one in the comfort of my own home and had to pause for naps twice. Maybe the sheer grandeur of the CGI-fest would have grabbed me more in a theater setting, but nothing could make up for this plodding, predictable plot.
10.0~Simply brilliant philipstaal Sign in Permalink The lights are shut. The red material pulls away, revealing the big white screen. The spotlight starts, and I know - now is the moment. For about a year, I have been waiting to see the last, masterpiece in the Lord of the Ring trilogy. 200 min later the movie is over. This is without doubt one of my best memories of all time. Now, three years later I have still not seen a movie as good as this, and believe me when i say I have seen A lot of movies in this time. Problely more than all my friends put together. Back to the movie. Every single actor is like born for just the purpose of playing their individual role in this specific film. The story is brilliant, and so much better on the screen than in books. I will never forget many of the moments, like in the end where Aragorn says "For Frodo". In there is endless of other moments like that. I can only say that, anyone, who have not like I given this masterpiece 10/10 starts, should rethink. There are no words... I heartily recommend this to every single person on Earth. And enthusiast should see the extended edition.
10.0~the most amazing film i've ever seen ultra_pro Sign in Permalink pay no attention to selfish people who think the films need to be word for word replicas of the books, the last two were amazing and stunning, well acted and truly epic in scale and scope, this one outdoes the first two in every possible way. first thing i have to say is try not to compare these films to the books so closely, they are faithful reconstructions of the core idea behind the books. they are in no way meant to be exact word for word translations, to do that would take far too much time and money, it would be impossible. taking that into consideration, we pick up exactly were we so unwillingly left our heroes, at the brink of war, a nice flash back to smeagul's beginnings starts us of and it is beautifully done and very faithful to the sections i remember from the book. i can honestly say i have never seen anything so astounding, so exciting and so moving, this is quite simply my favourite film, and it rounds of the greatest trilogy of all time very well, all loose ends tied, all characters accounted for, we are not left wondering is all i will say (i dont like to spoil it) its nice to see a director who makes a film not focus on one character but on the strengths of the whole cast, who are fabulous in their roles. frodo and sam are excellent again in their peril, and aragorn is convincing to say the least. gandalf is inspirational and even the 2 annoying hobbits are good for a laugh and the odd tear. the best thing to do is see the first 2 again before going, ignore people who say "tolkien is rolling over in his grave" had he made the films he'd have done no better a job than peter jackson did given reasonable creative control, i mean come on to replicate the whole story onto screen would be like, what, 30 hours or more of film? please just be greatful that peter jackson has tried his damnedest to make them enjoyable films, and in mine, and many others opinions he has exceeded expectations by lightyears. just go to see it and when your so excited that your bum is hovering of the seat constantly at the battles and dialogue scenes, remember that peter jackson had to make realistic and easy to access films because, lets face it, tolkien could babble like there was no tomorrow, and to try to reproduce it word for word would be impossible. if this doesnt get the best picture this year (considering the tripe we have seen so far) i'll be shocked beyond words. do yourself a favour, see this film, you will love every minute of it. and try to remember its a film not a book. how people can be so ungrateful towards such a stunning effort of cinematic gold is beyond me. saying that both films are in the top 10 of the top 250 movies of all time voted by us the fans of FILMS so they must be better than the hardcore tolkien fans lead people to believe. i am going to see this film at least 10 times before it leaves the cinema, and i feel terrible when i think that there wont be one next christmas. oh well, i'll just watch all three at home! 100 out of 10
10.0~Absolutely the greatest movie I've ever seen! altinger Sign in Permalink Fantastic! Brilliant! Mr. Jackson... well done! The Fellowship of the Ring was a great movie! The Two Towers was good, but I still liked the first a little better. The third and final installment was simply mindblowing! I can hardly wait for the extended length DVD!
10.0~An epic ending dkncd Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" is the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien's famous fantasy novels. Once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes, sets, scenery, models, CGI effects and Howard Shore's epic score to create a convincing depiction of Middle Earth. Once again the cast delivers expert performances. John Noble joins the cast as Denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. Three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. Bernard Hill once again brings authority to the role of King Theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. Miranda Otto brings strength to the role of Eowyn and makes the character's best moments unforgettable. Ian McKellen once again brought his commanding presence as Gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together. This film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking Tolkien's work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. The famous battle at Minas Tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. As with the first two films, I found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting, but they didn't add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut.
6.0~What happened to the script? the-pond Sign in Permalink This film was so chalk full of cheesy one liner's that one wondered what happened to the script writers. Gandalf the wizard was reduced to a swordwieilding soldier who merely clubs over the head those who disagree with him. What is clear is that Jackson, Boyens, and Walsh do not have a firm grasp of the source text. One can discern script weaknesses clearly as confused actors muddle through dialogue that they know is suspect at best (see Mortensen's (aragorn) speech at the crowning of the king). I laughed and I cried, but for all the wrong reasons. Rest in peace professor Tolkien, however difficult that may now seem to be.
10.0~How can it be? tommytom Sign in Permalink How can it be that a movie triolgy so well crafted, so well thought out and so well presented, be ended with one of the greatest singular films of all time? I will say that this movie is the best movie that i have ever se, best film of the 21st century as well as quite possibly the best epic story ever to be told and presented. Tolkin a master linguist turned lituraturist has been proceded by a great director which has seen the vision the master had in mind and made it come alive for millions that had not read the epic or heard the tales first hand. This is not really a review, rather a commentary for all to read, see this movie and cherish it. You will never see another one that can match it.
9.0~Glorious. kybo_king7 Sign in Permalink Glorious. Simply glorious. There are no words which can describe the extent to which this film is awesome. As a true fan and die-hard follower of the books, I was astounded by the perfection of the first, impressed by (though slightly disappointed in) the second, and blown away by the third. The highest compliment I can give this movie is that it does for The Return of the King what the first movie did for the Fellowship of the Ring. I think, were he alive, Tolkein would be proud of the epic wonder instilled in this movie. I don't have time or space to describe all the ways in which this film is wonderful, but I will name a few. First of all, the feeling of urgency in the whole thing kept me on the edge of my seat. There is the sense that the war could be lost at any moment. All during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields there is a weight of utter despair, the feeling that against such might there can be no victory. In contrast, the total and complete wonder of the battle is incredible. I spent my childhood fondly imagining gigantic medieval wars, and now that there is the technology to create them on the screen, I am in heaven. When the Rohirrim charge the hordes of orcs, I literally teared up, and I never, ever cry during a movie. It was just so incomprehesibly awesome that I couldn't do anything else. Finally, my very favorite thing that Jackson has done with this story is the ending. Perfectly true to the mood of the book, there is a wistful sadness to it that again made me tear up. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER And the last shot, a view of a hobbit door closing as Sam goes inside his house, visually represents the real meaning of the book and of the story: that despite the size and all- encompassing importance of the war and of the quest, all of it really boils down to saving something that simple.
10.0~Do not drink a lot of soda during the movie. loadbank Sign in Permalink It is a very exciting movie with tons of action. This movie was definitely made for the big wide screen. It has lots of computer generated things in it, but they blend in very smoothly, and don't totally overpower the movie. For sure the best of the trilogy.
10.0~This movie has everything.!! kaisai Sign in Permalink The third and final part of the movie "Lord of the Rings". I am so glad it won all the academy awards it did and very well deserved. Peter Jackson, the film's director, has done something brilliant and remarkable with this movie, that I think will never ever be duplicated again. The whole movie "Lord of the Rings" has something for everyone who enjoys a great movie such as this is. It has a great story line, it has plenty of action, friendship, honor among friends and of course romance. This movie from beginning to end no matter how many times a person might see it, will always offer the viewer something new each time. In my own personal opinion, this trilogy called "Lord of the Rings" has been the greatest movie made to date.
10.0~one movie to rule them all Tyson14 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of "Lord of the Rings" reaches its pinnacle in "Return of the King." The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the "Lord of the Rings" films, but the best. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realises his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel... Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring... The "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess. Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in "Two Towers" and "Fellowship of the Ring," with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In "Return of the King," Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't. But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue. Elijah Wood gives an unparallelled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the "strong" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated. But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the "I'm going to take care of you" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine. Perhaps the most striking thing about "Return of the King" is the final fourth of the film. While the "multiple endings" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron. "Return of the King" brings the epic "Lord of the Rings" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the "Lord" films -- and that's saying something.
10.0~Just Fantastic sprogers Sign in Permalink Well, I've seen this movie about 3 times, twice in theatres and once on DVD. I loved it. I never read the books, but I do believe from what I've heard that the movie was very well orchestrated to bring to life the very essence of the book. I know it was a bit long, but it was worth the special effects and great acting. I myself am trying to get into the business so I know how much dedication and hard work it takes. But this movie is not for the people with bladder problems, as I said, it's LONG. But if your like me you already have the extended edition on reserve from Suncoast Video. But if you just got over seeing a horribly bad movie like Terror Toons, then this will balance out the void that the movie created.
7.0~The least satisfying of the series, but still good pjmuck Sign in Permalink I am less enamored with this one then I was with the previous two films (particularly Two Towers, which is my favorite), though I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and say that had I seen this film on it's own without the previous prequels, I may have given it a higher rating. No doubt about it, these films are revolutionary and the pinnacle of fantasy film making, but I just found this one a little tiring. You more or less generally know how it's going to turn out anyway (good guys will get their butts kicked a few times, but will prevail after many long, tedious battles later), so I guess I can't blame the film for delivering exactly what I expected in a final chapter, but I guess I found the journey to get there (first two movies) far more interesting than the end result. After a while, all the eye candy of CGI-created battles gets a bit tiring to look at. So I'll give it a 10 for craftsmanship and artistry, but a 7 for holding my interest.

5.0~*yawn* Whatever... mr_bill_jr_5 Sign in Permalink Right, so another endless movie based on those not great books by Tolkien. I could rant and rave about how terrible just about every aspect this movie is, but instead I'll keep it to just a few: 1) Acting was terrible- with the exception of Sean Bean... oh yah, he died in the first one. Oh but that guy who played Pipin... he was kickass in Master and Commander. 2) Graphics- where some of the worst I've ever seen. More pisspoor CGI and ridiculous architecture and so on. Looked like a video game or a cartoon. 3) Cinematography- *yawn*, if I wanted to see things spinning around (mountains, cities, whatever), I'd rent Spy Game. 4) Plot- hole after hole after hole... why didn't the hobbits and Gandalf just fly in at the very beginning of the first movie with an eagle and drop the ring into Mt. Doom? Why didn't the evil dude... you know... starts with an S? Anyway, why didn't he leave SOMEONE guarding the Mountain? 5) Script- when Strider was giving his speech to his army (who's cavalry suddenly vanished... oddly enough), I was just waiting for him to utter the immortal words: "This is St. Crispains Day!" Then he and Branagh could have a little Picnic while the armies went to fisticuffs. 6) Scenes- I think there were 3 memorable scenes in all off these movies combined, one from the third and two from the first (when the cavalry makes their doomed charge and when Borimir dies; and that one little seen where Borimir holds the ring in his hand while everyone trudges through snow). That doesn't speak highly of a trilogy this long. 7) Names & Stuff- all these damn characters sounds the same. Elves are lame. Good vs Evil is tired as hell. In conclusion; this movie is the Ben Hur of its time. It's too long, full of wholes coupled with lame graphics and shitty acting. It'll be forgotten in a fortnight. FYI- the best movie ever made is Barry Lyndon. Just so those reading this know where I'm coming from.
10.0~Stunning! Breathtaking! Brilliant! susan7 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has not done an exact representation of Tolkien's' work. That will always remain as impossible as it is to force an apple tree to grow an orange. Some things were left out that could have been put in the movie(s). And some things were put in that in my opinion should have been left out. I was disappointed that in The Return of the King the story line of Faramir and Eowyn was not pursed. And I was VERY disappointed that Peter Jackson did not deal with Saruman in the theatrical version. I felt that this was unfair to Tolkien, to the actor Christopher Lee, and to the viewer, who was left with the fate of a major character in the films unaccounted for. Indeed, I see this as nothing less than a transparent ploy to force the viewer to buy the Extended DVD Version when it becomes available. Shame on you Mr. Jackson. We would have bought it without you having to resort to the use of a cheap conjurer's trick. As for The Scouring of The Shire - I am disappointed that it was not filmed, though the truth be told, I see why it was not shot. The movie holds its own quite well without it. The power of The Return of The King as it was presented would have made The Scouring appear to be the longest and most boring ending to a movie I can imagine. At the very least, we would have had to cut out the Gray Havens as well and put them both into a shortened fourth movie, along with such things as the recover of Bill the horse, and frankly, that just doesn't sound like a movie people would pay to sit through. As I sit here just thinking about it, I can almost hear the howls of the purists and the general public alike. Still, I can not help but think that had The Scouring been filmed, at least the footage would have been available for a follow-on short feature on a separate DVD. It is something of a minor tragedy that no footage of this part of Tolkien's work was shot. Yet despite these omissions, I must rate The Return of the King a solid 10, no question about it. And may I say, "Thank you , Mr. Jackson. Thank you." There are those who are so troubled by the fact that every word that Tolkien wrote isn't in this film that they can not see what is there. These people say that despite all that Peter Jackson has done, The Lord of the Rings has still not been done in film. Oh how very sorry I feel for these poor, wretched souls. So lost are they in their bitter and abusive criticism that they will never be able to appreciate the stunning, breathtaking brilliance of Peter Jackson's achievement. Guys, set aside your sanctimonious points of view and come smell the roses. Despite its failings, the movie HAS been done. As for the series as a whole, I regret that I must give it rating of 9. It would have been a 10, but I too am subject to the illness of not letting go of some of the failings in Peter Jackson's work. Peter, you should have done right by Faramir.
10.0~Greatest Trilogy ever todd2u Sign in Permalink I'm not much of a book reader. I remember going to watch the first Lord of the Ring movie and I thought it was excellent. I saw the second one and it was better than the first one. I just saw Return of the King and by far this was the best of all three. This is truly the greatest trilogy of all time. There was nothing bad about these movies. They are truly perfect in ever way. This one was flawless just like the other two. The action was awesome. I loved every moment of it. I recommend to any fantasy or Lord of and Ring fans.
10.0~An Epic Masterpiece FilmFanatic03 Sign in Permalink This movie represents the result of a hard working and amazing director Peter Jackson as well as amazing and emotive performances and the whole look is beyond epic. I love this film for its moral values, there is nothing offensive in this movie which is refreshing and rare. An amazing conclusion to the best trilogy ever. Expect amazing battle sequences, great acting, great CGI, amazing moral values and messages, just a perfect film. This is more than a movie, it is an experience and rightly deserved the 11 Oscars it proudly won. Peter Jackson really understands what the whole concept of Lord of the Rings is about, he managed to capture the purity of Frodo and Sams friendship, the epic nature of the big scale action sequences, and i respect the script writing team (philipa, Fran, Peter) for creating the emotion which is filled in the film. This is a brilliant film which will last for generations :D
10.0~Crowning Achievement (no pun intended)! spencersb Sign in Permalink I had a tremendous headache yesterday, but was not about to miss a movie I had waited two years to see! Hard to describe without overused words. By far the most moving of the three. If Sean Astin does not get Best Supporting Actor they should close the Academy, they don't know what they are doing! His fantastic portrayal of loyal Sam, faithful, self-sacrificing Sam contrasts strikingly with the treacherous, scheming Gollum. The scenery is, of course, spectacular! The sets, especially Minas Tirith make it easy to forget you are looking at a model! Unbelievable battle sequences, tops even Helm's Deep! The Paths of the Dead sequences were very well done, also. Would have liked to see the Saruman scenes that were cut, and more development of the friendship between Legolas and Gimli, one of the best sub-plots in the books. Some (many) will complain about the length. Allow yourself to be drawn into the story, believe in its message, and it's not long enough! Tolkein speaks to real world truths: Good will triumph over evil, but not without cost; Evil will win if good men merely do nothing; good cannot overcome evil by using the same weapons, evil has only the power to destroy, it cannot create, only pervert. ROTK does not have the memorable lines that FOTR & TTT had: Gandalf & Frodo in the Mines; Sam's epilogue to TTT; Frodo to Faramir outside Osgiliath; but it features some of the most memorable visuals of the trilogy. I had never read Tolkein before FOTR, but the day after the movie, I bought the trilogy and started reading TTT because I could not wait to find out what happened next. I have become a true fan, having read through the Silmarillion, went back to the Hobbit through FOTR, and am now halfway through Unfinished Tales. Especially at the end, the goodbye scenes take a while, but I think Jackson gave fans a glimpse of what the actors themselves have said. After filming for four years, they really didn't want to say goodbye. And neither did I.
10.0~The crown on the trilogy MorHeru Sign in Permalink I have seen this movie yesterday in the Lord of the Rings marathon. And when you have seen the other 2 movies, you can make a very good comparison. In every aspect of this movie you can see that Pj has put all of his 'powers' in this movie. I think this is better then LotR1 and LotR2 combined. I especially liked the scene where Faramir and his men ride out to save Osgiliath and there is a switch between Denethor eating and the riding of the men. I have read the books 3 times and I thought this movie was the closest to the book in comparison with the other 2 movies. I give this movie a 9,9 (The cutting of the Saruman-scenes, made this movie no 10)
7.0~Weakest Link in a great trilogy allaboutthefamily Sign in Permalink I thoroughly enjoyed the lord of the rings movies, with the exception of the last hour of the final film. Of the three films this was quite honestly the weakest, but it was still a pretty good movie and worth the price of admission. There is a point at which things become too "feel good" and commercialized and the last hour of this film more than crossed that line. 60 plus minutes of goodbyes, elves huggin (frolicking in bed together is a little weird but OK), just to wrap up the story. I like the movie but not enough that i want to watch elves kiss goodbye for an entire hour, it was just plain boring not to mention uncomfortable. The reason i say this film is more commercialized is that in all super popular movies things become less about the story and more about "cameos" from all your favorite characters which makes me think of them as marketing tools and actually takes away from the character (think xmen). anyways it really is worth a watch, but do yourself a favor and just turn it off once the conflict has been resolved.
10.0~Greatest Movie Ever Made... RearEchelon Sign in Permalink We all loved Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers was even better. Now add the "goodness" of these two movies together and multiply it by a million. I saw Return of the King at a midnight screening and it was by far the greatest experience I've ever had at the movies. From the moment the movie began, I was on the edge of my seat and I did not move from there once until the movie was over. The suspense was almost too much to bear. I found myself wishing I could fast-forward to see what happens. The culmination of the Lord of the Rings trilogy did everything I wanted it to and more. MUCH more. For starters, it was perfectly put together. There were no weak links, plot holes, or continuity problems that I could see. The action flowed right in from The Two Towers and then didn't miss a beat. There were a few tiny points I was curious about, but only because I'd read the books, and also because I'm sure those things will be included in the Extended edition DVD next November. Including ads and previews (but not credits), the movie was about 3h40m long. This long running time might be a little more than what you're used to, but trust me. The achy bladders and numb rear ends are definitely worth it. It allowed Peter Jackson to tie up everything that might have been considered a loose end. Each main character has his/her own stories concluded in a well-thought-out manner. Once again I would like to commend all the actors for an extraordinary performance. The emotion displayed by every character was almost overwhelming, and by the end, had a great majority of the audience in tears. The production crew must also be acknowledged. The scenery and sets were breathtaking. Minas Tirith, the White City of Gondor, was one of the most incredible sights I've ever seen (yes, I know the long shots were mostly CGI, but I'm sure there were models used as well, like with Helm's Deep). Speaking of CGI, the effects in RotK were nothing short of stunning. The Battle of Pellenor Fields, where the action of the trilogy culminates into a huge siege, made Helm's Deep look like a minor skirmish. All in all, the addition of Return of the King has catapulted the Lord of the Rings Trilogy into a timeless classic, and in my opinion, is not only the greatest film ever made, but probably will be for a long time (and even after it has been dethroned, it will still be used as a basis for comparison). Rating: 10/10 (only because I couldn't give it a 1,000,000,000,000)
10.0~I'm converted! AnaisKarim Sign in Permalink I never got into the first two installments. I saw them both on dvd only. But I saw this one on the big screen and all I can say is WOW!! EXCELLENT! Now I will have to purchase the whole trilogy. The opening sequence with Gollum's transformation really captured my interest and makes me want to go back and read the books.
10.0~Peter Jackson is Gandalf in disguise hubng Sign in Permalink Everything is perfect. A fitting ending to the trilogy. I have to say this is the best of the 3. I watched Fellowship of the ring again on HBO after I came back from the Cinema after Return of the King. I cannot help but notice how much the character developed. Seriously everyone out there should go watch Fellowship after Return of King, you can actually see visibly how the character developed. I guess I have to attribute it to PJ shooting all 3 together because emotionally and character wise, you the actors grew with the role seamlessly. For example, Frodo's face was so much sadder at the end than beginning and how Merry and Pippin's innocence in the face left them at the end. The fight scenes are much better here. However, the funniest line was still by Gimli after Legolas singlehanded down a Oliphaunts. "It still counts as one". The ending though could have been better. Theres no closure on Arwen's fate in middle earth. Theres no mention of Sam taking the last ship to the East and Legolas and Gimli traveling off together. But then again PJ would have to squeeze in another 20mins. 10/10 Oscar Best Movie Designated
5.0~Disappointing conclusion Elori Sign in Permalink I was rather hyped for the third part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as I suppose everyone was. Unfortunately, I found it boring and lacklustre. The Return of the King barely exhibited the epic quantity that I awaited from the finale of the trilogy. It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien's original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale.
10.0~WOW mario_bendeho Sign in Permalink This film is just too good for words to describe, go and see this spectacle, it will blow anyone away! Im not the biggest fan of fantasy adventures but this has blown me away and what an ending for the the brilliant trilogy. Return of the king is better than the other two LOTR films in my opinion but all three films are a joy to watch over and over again, Can't praise Peter Jackson enough as i said earlier on he created a peace of film making which is too good for words to describe and everyone should go witness this spectacle!!!!!!
1.0~BETRAYAL moodyblueteen Sign in Permalink SPOILERS Frankly put, this movie sucked. What could have been spectacular with only a little care was ruined. Oh, don't get me wrong. If you are some lazy movie-goer who considers yourself an expert because you own the Extended Editions of the first two movies on DVD, you will certainly enjoy this movie. If you are, like me, a hardcore fan who has practically memorized the books, I don't see how you can enjoy this film. It starts out fairly well, and continues like that for most of the film. Although the changes are not usually welcome at all (cite Arwen's magnified part to make it sappy, or Gollum and Frodo leaving Sam altogether,)I could have accepted that. Sure, Shelob's lair was all wrong. Well, yeah, it did annoy me that at some parts Aragorn was more important than the whole ring-of-power-which-must-be-destroyed. The whole love triangle was blown way out of proportion, and by editing out his almost-death it might have been possible to film some of the wonderful scenes in the book that the movies carelessly deleted. But, like I said, it was all right until the end. The ring was destroyed magnificently, I admit. The aftermath was done well. But there is no excuse for skipping straight to the Happy Ending. Lalala, sunflowers and daisy chains and frolicking puppies for all. WHAT THE **** JUST HAPPENED? No scouring of the Shire. For that, Saruman just might have been left out altogether. No adjustment for Frodo. I might also add that by having Gollum and Sam make so much external conflict for him, it practically obliterates all the internal conflict. The audience is unprepared and confused when he decides to keep the Ring. However, back to the mangled ending. Put aside the major parts. In an effort to appeal to teenage girls, I assume, the filmmakers decided to give Arwen a much larger role, and make Eowyn's affection for Aragorn much more serious as well. So why do they not bother showing her courtship with Faramir? A large part of the books is condensed into two camera shots of them standing beside each other at the coronation of Glorious King Aragorn, who seems to have washed his hair for the occasion. I know, he was on a trek in the wilderness, no shampoo, but how come he shaved more then? But back to Eowyn. Her sudden attachment to Faramir makes her seem like she is nothing but a man-chaser. First she goes after Aragorn, future king and current war hero. When he spurns her love, she takes Faramir, steward and war hero, as the next best option. Ridiculous. Just ridiculous. to sum up, do not see this movie. Do not waste your money. This review is long, I know, but it could be so much longer if I wanted to mention everything wrong with the movies. Anyone who is a true fan will regard this as nothing but filth, a pure waste of time.
10.0~TRULY AWESOME! vorlance Sign in Permalink See the movie... It rocks! It's the best of the 3 and perfectly completes the trilogy. I'll be seeing it again and again and again. After seeing it, go back and watch the extended additions of 1 and 2. Everything I saw in 1 and 2 makes total sense. Cool foreshadowing of people and events, too. I can hardly wait for the director's cut to come out!!!
10.0~I am born anew in Peter Jackson's genius. C_lav Sign in Permalink Okay. Let me start by saying that I saw Fellowship of the Ring and it's been, unquestionably, my favorite movie of all time until six days ago. The Two Towers was also an excellent film, but wasn't quite as great as its predecessor in my opinion; it lacked some of the depth, complexity and smooth continuity that its predecessor delivered in spades(though the Extended Version corrected these losses nicely). With that out of the way, I can go ahead and say it: Return of the King has tied Fellowship of the Ring at the very least for best movie of all time. The battle scenes are incredible; while the Battle of Helm's Deep dragged on a bit, the Battle of Minas Tirith is much longer and yet manages to be much more entertaining. More and more curve balls are thrown your way, with the Orcs, the Cave Trolls, the siege towers, the catapults, the bizarre battering ram...I could go on and on, for that's just a few of the many "holy crap"s you'll be saying to yourself when you see this battle. And yet the film continues, like its predecessors, to be more complex than just flashy computer animation and action-packed battle sequences. It can easily be felt that the intensifying relationship between Frodo, Sam and Smeagol/Gollum is nearing its climax; some scenes focusing on those three are so powerful they'll nearly bring you to tears. Merry and Pippin have come a long way from those bumbling comic-relief hobbits who make you constantly ask yourself: why hasn't the Fellowship sent them home yet? Now they are at their most useful and serious, and it's surprising how well that's done. And then there's Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Legolas and Gimli have to step aside a bit to let Aragorn become worthy of the film's title, but the parts that feature the Elf and the Dwarf are purely brilliant. And once again, Ian McKellan comes through as the perfect Gandalf. By the end, the 3-hour and 20-minute film seems to drag on a bit, but only with stuff that you know truly couldn't be left out. Just one thing bothers me; everyone claiming that there are multiple endings. I won't tell you what happens at the end, but I have to get this off my chest: Folks, everything happens in order, there are no alternate realities. It's a perfectly normal, single ending like you'd see in a vast majority of movies. Well, that's all I've got to say. See this film at the theater while you still can, and trust me, you'll want to again(only if you've seen the first two, though, 'cause otherwise it'll make no sense whatsoever).

4.0~Extremely Overrated sschlenker Sign in Permalink Good art direction and visual style prevent me from giving this a lower rating. By the way, this opinion applies to all of the Lord of the Rings movies, not just this one. TLofR is a hugely overrated trilogy, with a hugely overrated director. I like the books, but I'm not such a fan that I will hate anything that is different from the source. These not only drop the poetic and beautiful style of the books, these movies wrench them into by-the-books action movies, with overly dramatic acting and dialogue that is common in most modern historical epics. Legolas is transformed into a typical sci-fi/superhero character who does flips and slides down stuff while managing ridiculous feats that just embarrass me. He's also played by the king of pretty-boys, the great Orlando Bloom. Meanwhile, Aragorn, who is probably the best of the main characters, is still very much the wise, down-to-earth, gritty hero a la Obi-wan- Kenobi or John McClaine. Gimli, in true Hollywood fashion, becomes a sidekick. He's the short fat guy who makes little self-deprecating comments that rarely are funny and actually seem to insult the audience. This, like the other grossly overrated movie, Titanic, is a movie that plays off people's stupidity. It uses the cheapest way possible to get wide popularity, mainly with the most stereotypical, overused trash that makes up the components of your typical crowd-pleaser. It just makes it worse when people consider this "amazing", "original", "unheard-of", "unpresidented", etc. Hello! Get a life, this is your typical action flick that has one goal: to be popular without any real originality or creativity. That said, whoever did the production design on this did a good job, and that's pretty much the only award this film deserves, even with the flashy CG that seems too animated to work for such drama. I know people in the Academy can see this too, but why did they vote for this. Next time, give 11 Academy Awards to something that truly deserves it.
10.0~Number one movie of all time? daygo448 Sign in Permalink Wow what can I say. I have used IMDB to look at reviews and comments, but I have never written one. This movie is jaw dropping awesome. The movie has everything for someone. I felt that it was the best of the 3, and Jackson did a marvelous job in doing so. The movie has moved into the slot as my personal all time #1 movie beating out Godfather!!!! That should tell you something in and of itself. The movie is definitely the best movie I have ever seen. Star Wars and Indiana Jones are the only other Trilogy that come close, but it's a distant second. I only hope that the rest of you feel the same way, and that also goes for the people in charge of the Oscars. If this movie doesn't win the Oscar for best picture, I will personally feel robbed. I don't know what else to say really, except that everyone needs to see it in the theater and that goes for the LOTR haters out there!!! In closing, YOU MUST GO AND SEE THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!
6.0~Overall solid performance, 6 out of 10 stars. arickrol Sign in Permalink I just got back from seeing RoTK today. I went with two friends (they say it last night at a sneak peek but this was my first viewing of it). The film is a major epic and highly memorable but it suffers from some major flaws. It glosses over the conclusion of Battle of Isengard, doesn't bother to explain the Palantir, contains some dry/poor acting and lines (mainly poor jokes revolving around Gimli and Legolas that do not get pulled off well), and the ending is highly inappropriate and disappointing in conjunction with the film. The ending is great but not at the end of THIS film. The film contains one of the best battle scenes I've ever seen, akin to that from Spartacus, bringing viewers to an emotional high with adrenaline pumping but then goes into a "where are they now?" series of subdued scenes mainly with an orchestral (albeit incredible orchestral) piece serving as the main auditory feature excepting the last scenes in which some dialogue is jutted forth. Jackson attempted to utilize some of the novel's closure but it turned out to be poorly done/placed in this film. On a more positive note, the film flowed incredibly well and had some of the best special effects I've seen recently in a film that has an overall solid performance (I'm thinking a 6 out of 10). I'd definately see it again in the hopes that it grows on me.
10.0~Incredible!!! lje32677 Sign in Permalink There isn't too much to say about this latest installment of the Lord of the Ring's trilogy. INCREDIBLE!! Is probably the only description I can come up with. I thought this was the best of the three. All the acting, directing, editing were great. The scenery was breathtaking. With all the work and heart that everyone put into this movie, I saw one person who topped the pile. Throughout all 3 movies, Sean Astin, portrayed Sam Gamgee with sensitivity and heart. But in this third movie, it was as though a damn opened up and Astin let loose with everything he had inside of him. I cried with him on the mountain above the ghouls castle. Of all the characters, Sam grew the most and Astin led the way with his performance of the young sensitive, shy and insecure Hobbit who became a hero in every sense of the word.
10.0~Beyond Expectations Clyde Jets Sign in Permalink This movie ended the Trilogy perfectly. This is either the best trilogy ever or the best 9 hour movie ever. While each movie left me extremely satisfied, especially after 3 hours, I think the continuity of the storyline makes it more like a long movie. The Return of the King was very much like the first 2 except that it somehow managed to push the intensity and the fighting to greater levels, and kept the storyline riveting. Now, grant it, Peter Jackson had a great story to with which to work, but how he kept his vision alive and thriving was phenomenal. The cast as a whole had an unbelievable chemistry, which was key to the success of the movie. The dialogue was as good as any movie. Much was said of the long ending, but a 10 hour movie requires an extensive and comprehensive epilogue. Ultimately and totally satisfying. Oh, one other thing, if the Award Shows don't acknowledge this one, they will lose much credibility.
9.0~Great movie ryannewest Sign in Permalink This movie will forever be ingrained in my mind as one of the best movies i have ever seen.2003 was undoubtedly a great year for movies and this work of art will be one of the most memorable movies of the decade. I won't lie I started to develop mixed emotions about Sam and Frodo and their mental health but i know and understand that they were under large amounts of pressure at the time if their magical quest through amazing environments which never ceased to amaze my mind.This was a great one that will go down in my book as one of the greatest of this centuary and i will never forget the magical direction which lead me to believe that maybe one day i should take up a career in directing. However directing is hard so i decided to become a movie reviewer instead.
3.0~Peter Jackson owes me five bucks! dsr12 Sign in Permalink This ponderous, disappointing conclusion to the Lord of the Rings needs to back to the edit room. The film moves along like director Peter Jackson had all of this film footage and couldn't decide what to do with it. If I didn't know better, I'd think that the producers thought they had a built in audience for LOTR, so they didn't have to work very hard to finish the trilogy. Shame!
10.0~Fabulous newleaf Sign in Permalink With more than 1,000 comments already listed here, I doubt if anyone will have read far enough to get to this one. However, in case you have, I'd like to point out two glaring errors that seem to be commonly repeated by those who wrote before me. First is the odd notion that "The Return of the King" can be called better, or worse, than the other two films. It's important to realize that even though "The Lord of the Rings" was printed in three volumes, it was one continuous story. It wouldn't make any sense to read just one of the books, nor would it make any sense to write a literary review of just one. So it is with the movie. Comments like "this one was boring" or "this one was better" are meaningless. This should be considered one long movie, presented in three parts. Second: This trilogy is a film adaptation of a book, and that book is considered an important literary work. So comments like "the ending went on too long" are ridiculous. The ending was faithful to the story that Tolkein told ... and in fact, there were things that the movie left out, so if anything, the ending could have been longer. Possible spoiler follows, regarding the ending: Some reviewers here suggest that the movie should have ended with the destruction of the ring, or with the crowning of the king. They overlook the fact that the story celebrates fellowship, and sacrifice. To deny us the chance to see the characters afterward, cherishing the type of closeness that such an ordeal fosters, would be inconceivable. And it is very, very important that we learn what finally happened to Bilbo and Frodo. That's the story that Tolkein told, and that's the story that the movie, faithfully, leaves to us. Speaking of the trilogy as a whole, I thought it was brilliant, and highly fulfilling.
10.0~Already a classic filmfreund Sign in Permalink The "LotR"-trilogy is already a classic like Star Wars (the original of course) or, if you are in the music business, "Der Ring des Nibelungen". Some people will enjoy it, others will avoid it, but you cannot say that it's bad 'cause it isn't. Don't get me wrong, the book is still better, it has more depth than the movie version, but you had to make six movies with six hours each to come close to what J.R.R. Tolkien imagined - and still people would complain. But Peter Jackson did a good job and I'm looking forward if he's rewarded by an Academy Award.
10.0~Sees movie as uplifting, inspiring, greatest ever alphaleonis Sign in Permalink I attended The Return of The King with my two teenage sons and one of their friends. While walking out of the theater, my 17 year old son asked me if I had cried in the movie. I replied: "Before I answer that I want to ask you a question. Did watching this movie make you want to be a better person?" He replied in the affirmative. I then told him that I had cried throughout the last 30 minutes of the film. This surprised him since he had been watching me to see if I was crying and it had been well hidden. No audible sobs or visible tears that were telltale signs, but believe me, my heart was in my throat and eyes were misty for a solid 30 minutes. Also at many other times in the film the same thing happened. And during those many times, if anyone had tried to get me to talk to them I would have been unable to. What had me so misty eyed and choked up? The bravery and genuine goodness of the characters, just as Tolkien had depicted them in his books. Also the reaffirmation of the fact that good will always triumph in the end, in spite of current appearances. I am in my mid fifties and have seen maybe two or three thousand movies in my lifetime, and this is now #1 and will be for some time. It not only uplifted me and made me want to be a better person - more selfless like Frodo and Sam,Aragorn, Theoden and the rest. But it did the same for my two sons, and this is worth a lot to me. The scenery was breathtaking, the acting superb, the storyline almost as true to the books as could be done in a movie this short. Hope more true in the extended version. In my opinion, the best movie ever made.
10.0~A perfect ending for a perfect trilogy! felipe-18 Sign in Permalink There are many things changed from the book, many things missing or shortened. You will miss some really interesting parts here and you will discover others have been changed. Some of the special effects are really badly done. The makeup have some flaws and the hobbits look sometimes really fake. Sometimes you can notice there are small kids dressed like the main characters... The good thing is that...you don't care about the changes in the story, the bad FXs, the kids in costume, or the 3:15 hours of reel. The movie is so amazing, so perfectly well crafted that you forget about any possible flaw and you just dedicate to admire the incredible explosion of images, sensations, colors, sounds, and lessons of good cinema narrative you are living right there. Cause is a movie you live, not just see. Peter Jackson shows again and for good he knows to tell a story, a complicated and long one, with art and taste. Dedication and respect for the viewer, this movie delivers in every aspect, in every frame. You will be wishing for more after the movie have finished, and you will forget the little flaws but to remember forever the experience of the best trilogy ever made.
10.0~It's Return of the King. What more do I need to say!? quatoff Sign in Permalink Okay, so here it is, Return of the King. The final episode in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Is it better than the first two, no. "Why?" you ask because, they are not three separate movies, they are one continuous 10 hour movie, and this 10 hour movie IS the greatest film ever made. Now if you want to look at this as a single film, then yes, it is better than the first 2. This film is absolutely fantastic. If you're reading this and haven't seen it yet, what in the world are you waiting for. Go see and have it knock all of your other favorite films off of their pedestals. I will not ramble on for my 1,000 word limit telling you all of the details of the film and telling you how fantastic this (these) movie(s) are, because if you don't already know, then you cannot be saved and must be tossed into Mt. Doom yourself. So do everybody a favor, and go see this movie. You can thank me later.
10.0~This movie had everything I wanted. hok_herman Sign in Permalink Beautiful. Give that man an Oscar! Peter Jackson has proven himself with completing this incredible trilogy in one of the best ways possible. The only thing that bothered me a little were the extremely fake lighting of the beakens. The rest of the movie was just breathtaking. I can't wait to get my hands on the directors cut.
10.0~Amazing jbrimhal Sign in Permalink Best work of cinematographic genius I have witnessed to date. Simply amazing all around. To truly understand the workings of Middle Earth, one must read the book itself. However, this is the best I could possibly imagine this amazing literary work being translated into a film. No words give this film justice.
1.0~"We Cannot Linger!" (-Legolas/Peter Jackson when wrighting the script) master5000 Sign in Permalink The expectations that were built up by the first film, and the second (allthough slowed down), really plunged down into the lava of Mnt Doom with this one. It really makes you nauseous thinking about everything that is wrong in this film (I'm not talking about the extended version, that one is a lot better - but still far from perfect) and how everything could have been. Where should I start?... ... It's overly sentimental. I mean really. And I like that s*** usually - I'm a sentimental guy. But here it's really out of proportion, and out of timing. Oh, it's really sad when Faramir rides to meet the orcs when he has no chance of winning, while Pippin is singing som silly song like he's castrated and then breaks out and cries just like that. Bu-hu, this is a mythological-style heroic fantasy-tale, not... Titanic! Everybody are so overly emotional. And I don't even wanna talk about Sam and his constant speeches about bravery and not giving in, with the hand on the chest, looking out over the horizon, with the orchestra at full volume (the only thing missing is the American flag bellowing in slowmotion behind him), and Frodo and his constant twisting-your-head-like-a-puppy-and-looking-with-big-eyes-and-a-"OH-I-love-you-so-much"-smile at Sam every time he saves him or helps him to keep going... OK I'm getting carried away.... I liked Braveheart for example, even though it has some major flaws. And people think THAT one is overly sentimental. But that one is at least down to earth-sentimental. RotK is up in the sky, almost gone out to space, like (I thought I'd never say this, but), it seems they (producers, crew and actors) really take the film TOO serious. Really. It's a Saga! Not true. It's a 20th-century, made up mythology-history about an IMAGINARY land. It's NOT a record of the Holocaust for Christ's sake!... I understand how they needed to cut some scenes, to save up time. but, well... First of all, they didn't succeed enough with that, the films are 2-3h long and still it feels you're rushing from one place to the next, like you're on a Middleearth-8hour-safari or... cinematic tourbus. Maybe they should've cut it even more, so we could at least get the feel of BEING someplace and not just passing by? But what's really unacceptable is when he wastes all that preciously gathered time on exploring uninteresting or unimportant scenes and scenes that don't even belong in the story! Completely made up-scenes, for no logical reason! *The ugly made-up bull/rhinoceros-beasts pulling orc-wagons (whatta F--- is up with that? I don't even know if George Lucas would accept such a badly designed creature in the Star Wars universe!)... *The really AWFUL orc liutenant/chief-guy, who's by the way made up out of thin air, who doesn't even look like an orc but more like the aliens from Peter Jackson's early lowbudget cult-films (Mr. Jackson, this is NOT the time and place to have cameos, or draw funny parallells to your Bad Taste-films, that's really... bad taste... disrespectful to the Tolkien-fans)... *The Mûmaks are really cool, but really too big, I mean, they're not dinosaurs-beasts - hey're just big elephants! *All the small details, costumes and armour etc. are really beautiful, really more than you could ever ask for. But the White Dwarf-miniature-esthetics of Minas Tirith is really bad, cause it gives a whole synthetic-comic-book/computer-game-look to Middleearth. Where are the beautiful, classical and authentic designs of Edoras and Rivendell? And no catapult can throw rocks as big as whole houses! That too is just corny and childish like in computergames. All this, and the excessive use and naive belief in CGI-technology, turns the Battle of Pelenoor Fields, which should be the total culmination and action-peak of the film into a foney uninteresting StarWars/Warhammer40000-mess, it's nothing compared to the battle of helm's deep - and that's not right. And this CGI-trend seems to be a virus infecting everybody in the film-business. It's really sad, these films will be outdated in 10 years. But maybe that's a good thing? RotK isn't the worst of the three, technically. But with the expectations you have from the first two, the books (if you know what's gonna happen), the demands should be pretty high; and, in my opinion too, especially after the hint in 2towers that the trilogy was going downhill (just like the matrix), this is the film that disappoints the most. RotK is the greatest and heaviest of the films, the first two would completely crumble under it's weight if it didn't hold, but they could also rise with it if it really grew as strong as it could've, and that is what it should have. Anything else is unacceptable to me, and this is also why I hate it. Cause it really doesn't live up to it's potential, it doesn't even outdo the 2towers and it doesn't live up to the old exited expectations you had from the first film. I can't understand how a New Zeelander, who used to make underground films could turn this old British tale into shimmering Hollywood-cheese. It's too pretty, too pompous and sentimental and all the computer graphics gives it lika a fake sugarcoated shine or crust. It's like food, add too many ingredients and spices and they'll take out each other and the dish'll just taste bland... It's just too much of everything, and the whole film falls flat. It's still stunning, but rather tasteless, and the only profound experience you might get from it comes soely from the overwhelming magnitude of the whole thing. I still wanna congratulate P.Jackson on successfully bringing this gigantic project home. Thank him, even if he's made me more irritated than delighted, cuz I'm still glad that I'm able to watch these films. He didn't deserve all those Oscars, but he definitely deserved a few, maybe not for directing, but for Best Film - for the production. But this film should NOT be ranked as the best fantasy-film of all time! /Sebastian
10.0~best movie juliewozniakstar Sign in Permalink Well, actually this is the best movie i've ever seen. Not only it shows a beautiful story but also the production is excellent. I think that nowadays there aren't many movies that can be as successful as Lord of the Rings series. It not became a classic. In my opinion everybody should watch the movies, that's all in the topic
10.0~Fantasy at its finest kamran_pro Sign in Permalink If you are a fan of fantasy and Tolkien, this movie is probably the best you'll ever see. If you are a fan of fantasy and haven't read Tolkien, this movie may inspire you to pick the books. If you are just not of the imaginative type (i.e. you can't get into a fantasy world because it is 'unreal'), this movie may seem boring. This is a sci-fi movie. And your brain needs to be stimulated to accept the details of a new world. So the ones who complain about it being long shouldn't just see it in the first place. They aren't the type suited for it. For people who do care about depth and thought provoking ideas in a fantasy, the extra long nature of the movie is just what they had been in dire need for. Also, if we didn't have such a long run, the first tag to be thrown on the movie would be 'mindless action'. Incredible story and direction make this the finest on-screen moment I've ever seen. There are those who would complain about The Army of Dead being too unreal. But if you look closely, the whole trilogy including The One Ring bit is unreal. The way that you connect part of imaginary world to your own is the real thing. And the story clearly expresses the desperation in which Aragorn used the Army of Dead in the battle for Gondor. Whereas he did comprehend the fact that the army can be used only for a single time and this certainly wasn't his last battle before Sauron's downfall. This is one of the main aspects that I love about the trilogy, i.e. the relationship between hope and actions based on it. The story is a dark one which holds many paths and choices for the main characters. And though they don't have any hope, they still go for the best they could have hoped for. And through the complex plot line, we're explained many bits of sayings we interpreted only as 'quotes'. Such as "even the smallest one can change the course of history" or "don't be too eager to deal out death and life, for even the wise cannot see all the ends". To summarize it all, this movie is as much for eyes as it is for brains. Lord of the Rings did change many aspects of my thinking. And the movie trilogy was my introduction to the phenomenon. So, a 10/10. Because that is the maximum rating I can pull off on IMDb.
10.0~Thank you, Mr. Jackson BDFielding Sign in Permalink Brilliant. Beautiful. Stunning. Detailed. Mr. Jackson, you have given us a gift. I was completely lost to the movie's glory. I gained interest in the main characters, a RARE thing in a third movie. I loved every minute and had not a single moment of disappointment. Thank you, Mr. Jackson.
10.0~Easily, one of the greatest film experiences you will ever have. Period. croatiansensation29 Sign in Permalink With "The Return of the King", Peter Jackson's trilogy based on the works of Tolkien, come to a dramatic and climactic end. Throughout all of my movie going experiences, never have I ever wished a story to never end, but unfortunately, all stories do have a conclusion. The story, for those of you that have been sleeping these last few years, concentrates on Frodo and Sam's journey into the heart of Mordor to destroy the One Ring. While, in the meantime, Aragon, Legolas, Gandalf, Gimli, and the surviving members of the fellowship, prepare to do battle with the minions of Mordor. In retrospect, let me just say that this film has everything anyone can ever wish for in a movie! Action, adventure, romance, humour, mind-blowing special effects, a superb story, and characters that you actually care for. During this film, I think I experienced every feeling that we, as humans, can feel. Joy, sadness, excitement, awe, and obviously just being stunned and speechless. Peter Jackson did the impossible when he made this film, and I applaud him for his efforts, as he genuinely deserves all the credit he has received for this, and the previous two films. If there is one film that you MUST see, "The Return of the King" is definitely that one film. Run out and buy (don't rent) the extended version of this film, as this is the true vision. An utterly mind-blowing experience. For once, the Academy Awards were right in their choice for Best Picture.
10.0~One of the best Emilian_Calina Sign in Permalink Personaly I consider this one of the best film series until now. Deep level of lore Amazing interpretation from all actors involved in the plot Precise costume art relating to the book descriptions Simply one of the best.
10.0~I'm sensing some patterns amongst the negative reviews... archiewheeler Sign in Permalink Take your time to read this; I think you will find it useful. I watched ROTK while on a day-per-movie marathon of the LOTR trilogy. The only time I had come upon it before was having watched the fellowship at the age of 9; but MY GOD, was it worth going through. My favourite film before seeing this was The Shawshank Redemption. While I'm not a very critical person, Shawshank was a film in which I could see where it's cinematic excellence comes from. On the other hand, The Godfather was the film I most couldn't understand the love for; it seriously has not aged well, and I think my stance on it is the same as those of the critics who say this film has some serious critical issues. However, I still don't understand those people who like the first two but dislike this one; there is no doubt that it is the strongest one, even from a critical viewpoint; not a lot really happens in the first one; it follows linearly danger after danger, Balrog after the weird creature in the lake, and yet some people are saying that is the best. ROTK, however, has some epic fight sequences, amazing character development, and the most incredible climax scene I have ever watched. Those who are wondering about the title of this review: I noticed that most of the negative reviews were about the film being disloyal to the source material. Yes, I understand those peoples' motives and ideas, but I feel it is better to focus on what it is than what you believe it is meant to be. In my opinion the loyalty to the books doesn't affect the quality greatly if at all, and sometimes the changes are for the better, something I can apply to How to Train Your Dragon. However, a few book-to-film changes DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD DEMAIN YOUR RATING DOWN TO A ONE. This is what I have seen many reviews doing, and I just don't see the rationale behind it. All I can say to to summarise the likability is that it seems split from a critical viewpoint, sometimes good, sometimes bad; but for a simple moviegoer who is not too bothered about book-to-film changes, this is the cinematic masterpiece it deserves to be called.
10.0~The greatest movie of all times ? forever_changes Sign in Permalink Is the Return of the King the greatest movie to ever appear on the silver screen ? It grossed over 1 billion dollars, it got 11 Oscars, 4 golden globes and countless other awards. You could argue that awards are always a subjective thing and don't necessarly say anything about the quality of a movie. But you can't argue that the movie reached a huge amount of people all over the world. But does this mean that the movie itself is actually good ? Well that again depends on what you define as good or as bad. For my part, I went into the movie with quite some prejudice, since I'm not a particularly big fan of fantasy films, nor did I ever read the books. As a cineast I didn't expect much. But I was shocked. This movie is truly fantastic and as perfect as it gets. What's most important about a movie is obviously the story and it's themes. Well the Lord of the Rings has a fantasy overlay, the stories underneath it though, are the very stories that concern us all, like love, friendship, confidence etc. So if you're able to read between the lines, this movie has a lot to offer, but the great thing is, that the movie is also able to entertain. I mean ask yourself, what do you want to see, a dialogue heavy slow paced movie, that almost sends you away in the land of dreams, or a movie that entertains, but still doesn't leave the themes of our everyday life out of sight ? The Lord of the Rings movies shouldn't just be hated because they're fantasy movies, it's not what they deserve, so much love has flown into these movies, that they surely deserve their place at the top of cinematic history. The greatest movie of all time ? Well the Return of the King surely stands among the top. And we should all be proud to have been a part of the experience.
9.0~Different and very good mkcrbl Sign in Permalink To keep rating simple for my vote, let's just say that I'll give this film 9/10, but don't ask me what I'd say for what's lacking, for I wouldn't know what to say. It's a generously long film, no commercial breaks, if a person wants to call those interruptions breaks anyway, and I definitely am not qualified to criticize this film in any respect. Still, I'll give 9/10 rather than 10/10, to be conservative, say. :) People should, however, learn the basics of the story before seeing this film in order to get the most satisfaction from it. I read Tolkien's story in book form and later saw the three-part film for LOTR. So, seeing this film directed by Peter Jackson, I had no pre-study to do. One thing viewers need to know is the importance of the ring. I guess that it is the most elementary part of the story. Otherwise, people can naturally wonder what the fuss is about a ring even if it appears to be made of gold. If it's supposed to be gold, then that's not what's important about it. What is, is the magical or mystical power that it provides to whoever is wearing it and that this power is related, say, to evil. This becomes obvious in this film, but only far into it. Great film though.
9.0~My thoughts on LotR: RotK... SPOILERS AHEAD Black-Out Sign in Permalink The experience is finally over. Or at least until the Hobbit is made. SPOILERS AHEAD!!! This movie was a great wrap up to the trilogy. It was nearly flawless besides for a few missed parts and the long... very long endings (yes I know I put an "s" at the end I'll explain later). The main scenes that were missing from the movie was the House of Healing scene (which caused for the mortal wounds of Eowyn and Merry to be disregarded) and the Scouring of the Shire. Both scenes hopefully will make it into the RotK EE, but I guess we'll just have to wait for that epic of a movie to come out. And just a bit of advice, this movie is one that should be scene in a good theater, not only for better sound quality and picture for the tremendous scenes that take place but also because you are going to want a comfortable chair. The effort to make this part be superior to the previous two shows. Not only does the Gollum CG look better, but it seemed to have a better visual appeal all around. The Battle at Pelenor Field was AMAZING! Thats about all I can describe it as. Not only did the cast and crew find new and interesting ways to make this a better battle then Helm's Deep, it was also during the day which allowed for a much better view of the battle field. And now my only real gripe with movie was the ending. First of all the scouring of the shire, one of my favorite parts of the book, was missing. I realize that it would be a little out of place at the end and also the neglect of Sauroman, but c'mon we all wanted to see the hobbits kick some ass. Now I realize that they were attempting to tie all the loose ends of the movie, but they seemed to make every one of the last nine scenes climax to a huge musical score or white out the screen. There were a bunch of people who started to get up behind me after various ending scenes. Well all i can say is this was a beautifully done movie, and trilogy.
10.0~what can i say jonesbros-2 Sign in Permalink what can i say about this movie. well,it one of the best movie of all time. i saw this movie for the second time last night and came away from it thinking what a great movie and how it made me feel.i have to been to movies where i came out and say to myself what a waste of money and time ,but with this movie i would spend all my money and spend all my time watching it. i cant understand how some people don't like this movie. peter jackson take a bow.you are the best and i am proud to be a new zealander when guy like you have done such great things for new zealand. the cast are the best ,and i take my hat off to them ,because to, film three big movie in a year and make them great is wonderful. this movie should get the best film ,if it doesn't then the people who vote for them should have their heads look at. again ,well done to all of the lord of rings cast and crew 10\10
10.0~The perfect example why should a trilogy filmed all together Aposplace Sign in Permalink I can't stop thinking how Lotr:TTT and Lotr:Rotk would be if were not filmed together with the first film.Maybe Peter Jackson would thought that he should change some elements of the two last films in order to improve them resulting in many complains by the audience because The Two Towers and The Return Of The King lack the atmosphere of the first one.On the other hand maybe he could actually make them even better(History made me doubt this perspective).No one really knows .what we already know is that Jackson had some excellent material into his hands and made some wise decisions about how he would use them.Way to go Mr Jackson!Now give us Silmarilion on screen too...
10.0~Best film of all time jasonmorley Sign in Permalink The epic conclusion to this outstanding story. I have never watched a series of films that have been made with utter perfection that as you stare at the end credits, you are left in awe of the pure brilliance of Peter Jackson's work - reflecting on what you have experienced throughout the trilogy. The combined flawlessness of the the acting, the script, the filming, the special effects and, most importantly for me, the music have made this film a rarity of unmatched excellence that sets the bar for all other films. An outstanding achievement in film making that should be seen by all. A 10/10 for this film along with the previous two.
10.0~Favorite Performances morrisv8 Sign in Permalink Gandalf stole the show for me. He had some of the greatest lines and did such an incredible job. Theoden also did a remarkable job. And also I thought Pippen was great as well. I'd say those were my top 3 favorite performances. "Show us the meaning of haste!"
10.0~you have to see this movie lauraAKAaudrey Sign in Permalink as a fan of both the books and the first two movies my expectations for ROTK were high, and i'm happy to say i wasn't disappointed. Peter Jackson has secured his place my list of legends, the actors were on top form and the battles and CG characters were spectacular. I was particularly impressed by Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. He really shone in these films, reflecting his own characters journey to become the ultimate hero of the film. Viggo Mortenson is also fantastic, giving yet another stand out performance in the final installment of Jackson's masterpiece. other aspects i should mention. Legolas and Gimili's comic duo were great again, providing us with some much needed relief from the emotion and trauma of the film. also, nice to see singing in the last film, such an important aspect of the books. in particular, Billy Boyd perfectly compliments a dramatic and moving scene with a folksy song sung beautifully. i would definitely recommend seeing this film if you've been on the moon for the last six months and failed to see it yet.
10.0~David leppard33 Sign in Permalink I really liked this movie in my opinion I would think this is the best movie ever, I really like how Frodo (Elijah Wodd) and Sam (Sea Astin) were looking out for each other Sam was always there to help Frodo, o ya and I liked the battle to I really liked how they faced the Orks they won that battle thanks to Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) ya When he fought them with his soul Army and destroyed them all. o ya and another thing that I liked was when that Eye got Destroyed after Frodo burned the Ring it looked nice how it broke down. Thanx Peter Jackson Ur the best the is the best film I have ever seen in my life, I don't think I'll like anything better than this in my entire life in the future.
8.0~Good, but ultimately not great. Uthers Sign in Permalink (Review contains spoilers) I loved The Fellowship of the Ring. Aside from the expansion of Arwen's role, the portrayal of Elrond, and the reworking of the fords of the Bruinen, I do not have any problems with Jackson's interpretation. Above all, Fellowship managed to capture some of the magic of Tolkien's books; as much as I like the grander elements, it is the smaller touches, like Bilbo's song as he leaves Bag End, that have really stuck with me. The Two Towers was great in parts, but was very uneven. The usage of Elrond and Arwen, the changes to Faramir's character, and the addition of Elves at Helm's Deep all took away from the movie. As much as I liked Gollum, the Ents, and the non-Elvish parts of Helm's Deep, I was disappointed with the movie as a whole. Return of the King falls somewhere between Fellowship and The Two Towers; while its shortcomings are not as pronounced as those in The Two Towers, it does not capture the spirit of the books quite as well as Fellowship. As should be expected, the visual effects in Return of the King are very good. Gollum is as well done here as he is in The Two Towers, and the battles of the Pelennor and the Morannon are amazing to watch. If nothing else, Jackson has crafted a technical masterpiece. The acting in Return of the King is, like in the rest of the series, uneven. Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, and Andy Serkis turn in particularly good performances, while Hugo Weaving, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom do the best they can with their bastardized roles. Viggo Mortensen continues to be mediocre as Aragorn, while Elijah Wood still tries to substitute forlorn staring for acting. Liv Tyler, in her mercifully short time on the screen, manages all the characterization of a piece of balsa wood. The script, while good in parts, has its share of shortcomings. The use of Elrond is particularly weak; while Jackson seems fascinated by the aesthetic of the Elves, I do not think he truly understands them. In the movies, Elrond comes across as arrogant and condescending towards the humans, playing the overbearing, disapproving father more than the wise ring-bearer. Elrond's appearance in Rohan to deliver Andúril to Aragorn is an unwelcome detour, an uncharacteristic move that would not be necessary if Jackson had paid more attention to the books. Return of the King is somewhat well paced, though it could definitely flow better. At certain points during the movie, particularly when the Shire theme played and the characters lapsed into overly long discussions of life and death, I felt like I was sitting through a three and a half hour movie. The various false ends during the denouement also interrupt the flow of the film. The ending was fairly well done, but could have been much better. Gimli and Legolas, for instance, have no ending; after we see them at Aragorn's coronation, they never appear again. The same fate has befallen Faramir, Éowyn, Éomer, and most other characters. The only characters who are given a proper ending are Aragorn, Arwen, Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf, Frodo, and Bilbo; even Merry and Pippin, whom we see at the end, and Sam, who has the final line, are left with uncertain fates. While I am sure this will be fixed in the Extended Edition, Jackson should have at least allowed the members of the Fellowship to have proper endings. Return of the King is a good movie. It is visually stunning, had a good soundtrack, and managed to capture some of the spirit and magic of Tolkien's books. Still, it is flawed, both as an adaptation and as a film. It is by no means a great movie, but it is one of the better movies I have seen this year. 8/10
10.0~a great 11 Oscar winning movie duygugerceker Sign in Permalink I think Return Of The King was a great final for the trilogy and it was really i good movie. Cinematography, visual appearances, settings are very well and cast was very successful. I was filled with admiration to the frame of New Zealand and Minas Trith, also Mount Doom was very realistic. It is known that all the crew had done a 4 year job to create these. Elijah Wood was spectacle in Mount Doom scenes, and it his dialogues with Sam once again showed us the importance of being accompanied. &#305;an Mc Kellen was very successful too. Gollum(Andy Serkis) deserves his Oscar definitely. And In Shelob's lair i was very afraid of all that stuff. Anyway in my opinion we should all thank to Peter Jackson for enabling us to watch such a good movie.
10.0~Deserves More Love rwoodruff-937-481346 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is truly an amazing film and the middle part of the sweeping Lord of the Rings saga of films by Peter Jackson. It is obviously very highly rated and critically acclaimed but for whatever reason it is not as loved as the first and third parts of the Lord of the Rings franchise. The first part obviously sets everything up and begins the journey and part three is all about the climax and resolution with some obviously really huge stuff going on, but part two has just as much action. I'd rank them: Part 3, then Part 2, then Part 1, in order of enjoyment and how much action there was in each film. My only downside for part two is that it ends kind of abruptly in a weird place, it would have been better to have the story go a bit longer in part two instead of saving the spider etc and so much more for part three.
7.0~Mostly Great, with a few bad moments. insane-romantic Sign in Permalink I like the Lord of The Rings trilogy and this is certinately the best of the 3 movies. It has lots of battle scenes, which is always a plus in this sort of film, and some funny moments too. There is some pretty impressive computer animation, and the actors are mostly very good. Unfortunately, we do not see much of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, three of the main characters in former films; and considering that the title is "Return of the King", I expected a bit more of an Aragorn-based storyline. Nevertheless, the film is very good and a great conclusion the the prequels. Another gripe I have with this film is that the ending is quite drawn out. It is almost as though they had a choice of 5 possible endings and couldn't decide, so they just put them all in. As the film is over 3 hours long, by the end you almost want it to finish, but it just goes on and on! Still, it is a must see!
10.0~If you've not seen this.... what the hell is wrong with you onx99 Sign in Permalink This is the greatest epic ever, couldn't find a single this wrong with it, i just can't wait of the extended editions, so I can watch the lord of the rings in it's complete form. This is the best part of the 3 films, but together they make the STORY, they should be watched one after the other..... Note: watching them one after the other wastes much time and causes tiredness, You have been warned
10.0~Cut To Pieces in the Commercial Release mikeh-54044 Sign in Permalink If you know and love the story, treat yourself to the Director's Cut. This presents the story as written - rather than the chopped-up mess released in theaters
2.0~crap ynotmd Sign in Permalink This morning I was sitting in Japanese literature class, while Murakami's Novel "A Wild Sheep Chase" was being discussed, and a student so boldly suggested a number of parallels between it and "The Lord of The Rings." To my dismay a majority of the students in the class started to giggle, thinking this comment was almost a joke. What's sad about it, is that his points were valid and made perfect sense. He was comparing the Murakami novel's narrative, characters, and moral messages to LOR, and it was a most convincing comparison. Literally everything from how the characters are similar to how the plot concludes is very similar. Based on the class reaction, I have to ask, when did Lord of the Rings cease to be literature and become another Hollywood movie? 15 years ago, if the same comparison were made, people would value it and even consider it. Before LOR became a movie it was one of the most read books in the 20th century and its readership and importance in a country like Japan was present. So why couldn't this parallel exist? After all Murakami was and is heavily influenced by Western literature. Before this class, I only criticized LOR as a film in itself, and gave it credit for exposing people to a classic story. In fact, I'm pretty sure these movies will introduce millions more to the books. But now I feel differently. The lack of integrity these movies possess will pollute the books and therefore reduce their real cultural importance. When I watch these movies, I see Hollywood on a grand scale. I see little of what is in the novels and instead see an inverse effect from what I expected. Now when I consider the novel I can only picture the dumb-wit characters, so shallow and bland following the plot line like a trail of breadcrumbs. If I could go back and reverse the money and time I wasted watching these films I would. In fact, I wouldn't suggest them to anyone, because they in no way enhance the original work. I'm not critical of film adaptations of novels in many cases. Don't get me wrong. A great filmmaker can take a great novel and show you things about it that you could have never thought of yourself. He or she can interpret a work of literature as the original author originally interpreted reality itself. Italian and Japanese cinema seem to have a good track record of adaptations, but American cinema Its %@#$! Please don't butcher anymore great works.Please.... Leave something for those who actually care about art.
10.0~This was awesome! axeman-6 Sign in Permalink *POSS.SPOILERS* It is fair to say that both my daughter and I had been hotly anticipating this film, so our expectations were very high. We both came out of the cinema, and were lost for words as to describe how good this was in terms of film-making. Peter Jackson has ended this trilogy in a suitably grand and immersive fashion, and I honestly believe that this series of films will be recognized as classics in years to come. Sure, there may have been one or two minor gripes - Mr Jackson cannot handle the "love elements", and the triangle between Aragorn, Arwen, and Eowyn was a bit stilted and forced: The conclusion was somewhat over long, with some cheesy moments to achieve a "Happy Ending". But despite these (very minor) criticisms, this was epic film-making at its very best. The film is very much darker in tone than the first two, and this is not purely down to the narrative - It is quite obvious where Peter Jacksons background lies! In short, a fitting end to a wonderful triumvirate of cinema. The best film of the year (and most other years!), by a very, very long way....
9.0~Phenomenal jacklottfilm Sign in Permalink One of the greatest films of all time and never disappoints as a re-watch.
10.0~What a Way to end, Truly amazing and one of the best films ever made Angel-Shadow Sign in Permalink Truly a masterpiece. This film was more than worthy of its 11 Oscars. The fellowship was stunning, the two towers was inspiring but the return of the king was truly the greatest film i have ever seen. The thing that is most amazing about the return of the king is that it fills the jigsaw of its predeceors and does it with such epic granduer emotion, and inspiration that i know very few people who were not amazed by it. I myself have read the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien and in light of this can say that this film has to be one of the adaptations in recent times. Peter Jackson, I feel simply could not have done a better job in using the beautiful new zealand landscape to portray Tolkien's vision. Without a doubt the speech, roars and sheer numbers of the rohirrim at the pellennor charge in the sunset is truly the greatest sequence of film i have ever seen. People say the ending is too long, I say it was perfect as it gave a heart felt and fitting deneaumont, and ended a truly remarkable trilogy that will not be soon forgotten.
10.0~What A Trilogy! rocketbuzz Sign in Permalink This is the final movie of the lord of the rings trilogy and its summed up perfectly! it is a very memorable movie! 10 star
3.0~...hmmm hej86 Sign in Permalink I was actually really disappointed with this movie. I suppose it's because I read the book first and you usually get disappointed with the film based on a book if you've read the book first. Anyway I think it's so obvious that the most important reason to make this film was so make a lot of money. The film makers have put too much energy and time to all these boring and endless action scenes that only anyway are destroying the mystic feeling of the movie. All the other parts of the movie are actually pretty good and I wonder why they didn't give these parts more space in the movie. I don't see why they had to change that much, especially in the ending, if it wasn't just to get more time to the fighting scenes, and then be able to make more money. And that's not good movie making is it?
10.0~The best 17 endings of all times! DerSongsurfer Sign in Permalink I think that almost everything that can be said about this trilogy has been said already, but still I will try. There are so many films that destroyed the beauty and perfection of the novels they have been built upon, not this one. In front of an amazingly beautiful scenery, Peter Jackson was able to create a fantasy-movie, which unlike so many others before did not deal with old clichés and thus is far away from any trash-movie a lot of people had expected it to be beforehand. Although I am sure that the cast of this film will soon be forgotten, The "The Lord of the Rings"-trilogy will stand the times and be one of the most renowned pictures of the las decade.
10.0~The best movie Ever!!!!!! YaoMing11Dynasty Sign in Permalink I'd have to say that i was pretty damn surprised about the first two movies. I never imagined that movies could be that good. But then again, Peter Jackson showed us that perfection is possible. Lotr: Rotk is easily the best movie of all time and I can't see how another movie got more nominees for Golden Globe Awards but this is easily the best movie ever.
6.0~An Orgy of Ugliness, Death, and Destruction fha-2 Sign in Permalink Even though this puppy won Best Picture at the Golden Globes last night, you can no doubt surmise that I was not very taken with the (hopefully) last of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy. Although I was extremely impressed with the special effects, the story itself was as tedious as reading the book. I wasn't terribly impressed with the idea of the diminutive Hobbit heroes, Frodo (Elijah Wood), a sweet, gentle dwarf and his flabby sidekick Sam (Sean Astin), from some yah-yah land called Hobbiton, traipsing across the geography while risking life and limb so that he could ultimately drop an evil ring into an erupting volcano while wholesale death and destruction rage on nearby. It seems that the film was primarily interested in exposing the violence-hungry audiences of the world with as much death, suffering, ugliness, and gore as they could cram into their painfully long (3 ½ hours) cinematic colossus. It is easy to cheer the slaughter of the adversaries since most of them were masterpieces of ugliness, decay, and disease. Some of the evil crowd depicted an orthodontist's fantasy come true with teeming examples of really bad dental decay and deformity exploited at every opportunity. To compound the repulsiveness, director Peter Jackson must have scoured the dermatology handbook for examples to create puffed out, discolored, and distorted skin tissue; lesions, cancerous oozings, and other disgusting aberrations. Of course, there were also the obligatory humpbacks or other physical anomalies to add to your visual distress so that when the heroic saviors sliced and diced them by hundreds you would not feel so bad. One cannot help but admire Gandolf (Ian McKellen), the wise wizard with his flowing white beard. He is not only all knowing, omnipotent, and full of convenient magic when it suits him, but for a guy in his sixties he rides like a cowboy stuntman and brandishes his sword in battle like a twenty-something. Since this is all a fantasy, why not do something far-fetched now and then? The good guys in this piece of prolonged carnage are extra nice and the female love objects like Arwen (Liv Taylor), are truly heavenly to look at. Frodo and Sam look like they would be terrified to walk around in downtown Carmel, let alone to take on the hideous lineup that seem to lurk behind every bush. Why they put up with the whims of the numskulls who insist on slaughtering the entire leper colony entourage is beyond my comprehension. If you see this movie just to enjoy the special effects, it is well worth the price of admission. However, if you want to see a good film, well that is another matter entirely. If you enjoy lots of blood and destruction, this piece is for you. There is enough carnage in this flick to make war films like `Saving Private Ryan' or `War and Piece' seem like a walk in the park. It is one helluva commentary on the American public who seem to enjoy a lot more violence than they are willing to admit. It is hardly a wonder that Americans so easily rallied to Bush's deceptive war cries when the Nation ostensibly professes to be such a peace-loving people
10.0~Absolutely breathtaking. gonenova Sign in Permalink By and large one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure to watch. Peter Jackson has really outdone himself with the finale of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Whether you have read the books or not, but have seen the first two installments of the trilogy, this is an absolute must see. This is by and large the best movie not only of 2003, but I believe it has set the standard for the fantasy genre to be judged against for the rest of the century. A top rate performance by all the actors, incredible direction, and once again, the scenery is an absolutely wonderful backdrop in every scene. It truly immerses the viewer in a cavalcade of sights and sounds. The plot picks up where the Two Towers ends, with some flashbacks scenes to remind you of where you left off. I will not put any spoilers in my review, period. This is a cinematic masterpiece that will have the viewer leaving the theatre not only satisfied, but totally blown away, even if you have read the books.
10.0~A journey that will always be remembered. Jules45 Sign in Permalink Having carried the burden of guiltily concealing a debt to Peter Jackson's widely known and acclaimed trilogy, only now do I realise I can truly call myself a film fan. Calling it outstanding, brilliant, perfect, would simply being echoing past recognition, which you already know of. Up until the point of watching I was convinced the likes of other trilogies (such as the repetition dodging Toy Story and Star Wars) would always out do what I used see as a medieval fantasy filled with mythical creatures. Yet there's something incredibly humane about LOTR as a whole, the pointy ears and hairy feet may dismiss such an idea but when the soundtrack swells (as does your heart) you get, to quote the narrator of Fight Club: Lost in oblivion. Before watching I didn't know my elf from my hobbit, now I know my Gollum from my Gandalf, my Gondor from my Mordor. Back in The Two Towers our hairy footed friends had grudgingly united with Gollum who continues to offer his schizophrenic 'assistance' of taking Sam and Frodo to an unknown entrance that will let them pass into Mordor unnoticed; while the rest of the divided fellowship meet up at Isengard in the aftermath of the Ents' Greenpeace revolt – which compared to the also CG rendered but vastly epic battles in Return of the King, was just a taster. The effects themselves clearly cusp the 3D phenomenon, that was breached several years too late not that it doesn't spell in-your-face politely either. They still remain cinematically impressive, particularly when the heat of the battle flourishes fresh new soundtrack scores on such a vast scale. My only criticism is (sounding like a severe case of fanboyism here) that whole film goes so damn fast, even though it clocks in at the three hour mark; and that's coming from someone who had little prior knowledge beforehand. Why? Because it's a journey. Never in my pitiful viewing history have I felt more transported to a different world so fluently, flawlessly, fixatedly. A world that could blister your eyes with tears and have your heart wrenching new-fangled rewards it didn't know existed. Not in the sense of being such a bum-numbing saga, but that it's a film that couldn't feel any less of a film, and it will be revisited again and again and again.
10.0~DeMille Smiles Upon Peter Jackson! Keyframe Sign in Permalink The first time I saw FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, I really didn't like it. I gave it another chance on DVD and was able to appreciate much more of the rich texture of the characters and story. I saw THE TWO TOWERS and loved it for its epic scale and scope, as well as the themes of honor, responsibility and hope in trying times. RETURN OF THE KING continues those themes and takes them to the highest levels. RETURN OF THE KING features the most incredible battle sequences ever put on film, without losing sight of the characters that are the heart of the tales (George Lucas take note). Peter Jackson structures the story in a way that makes you feel every bit of hope, despair, fear, victory and betrayal that his characters feel. The CGI effects are flawless and even Gollum/Smeagol, who is balanced out just short of reaching a Jar-Jar like annoying presence never makes you think he is anything less than real. As with the other films, the sets, costumes and overall production design are unlike anything ever seen. Cecil B. DeMille would be proud of the epic scale of this film. Only one real problem exists with RETURN OF THE KING. It has a hard time reaching a conclusion. Being a fan of the films, I enjoyed seeing how everything wrapped up, but it was edited in such a way to mislead you into thinking each event was an ending. Really, this was only a problem because when you've had a large fruit punch before a 3 1/2 hour movie, the last few minutes can be painful. Overall this film is a magnificent triumph, the Best Picture of the year (maybe of our time) and bookends the most incredible trilogy ever made.
10.0~Stunning... dhart-2 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the last movie in the Lord of the Rings triology. It continues where the The Two Towers left off and contains the same stunning imagery and special effects as the first two movies. Anyone who enjoyed the first two will not be dissapointed. David
10.0~Simply one of the best films ever made malturley-1 Sign in Permalink Simply one of the best films ever made. Acting, storyline, pace, drama, costume, effects, all set new standards by which future films will be judged. As close to perfect as possible given the current technology and science of film making.
9.0~a fine close to the trilogy didi-5 Sign in Permalink The core of the final film in Peter Jackson's mammoth 'Lord of the Rings' series is Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring, assisted by Sam and opposed by the ever-desperate Gollum. At the end of 'The Two Towers', Gollum had sworn to kill the hobbits and take the ring for himself - at the start of this film they (or at least, Frodo) still see him as a friend. So there's scope for conflict there which is exploited admirably. The other main storyline concerns the quest of Aragorn to reclaim his crown - will the king overcome all enemies and claim his birthright? 'The Return of the King' is darker and more bloody than the preceding films as the full force of Sauron and the enemies of man, elf, dwarf, and hobbit regroup and find their strength. We see a decaying Gondor lost somewhere in time, with Denethor (powerfully played by John Noble) wandering in distain of his surviving son, Faramir, and mourning the loss of his great child Boromir. We see the young hobbits Merry and Pippin both grow up and serve with distinction in battle, while Gandalf, now the all-powerful white wizard, rallies the armies to victory. Four scenes stand out for me - Aragorn and Legolas commanding the hidden armies to join their king one last time; Frodo's battle with the spider; the final confrontation between Frodo, Gollum and the Ring (although I was disappointed at the decision to make the last key fight an invisible one); and the final grateful bow of Aragorn to his little friends. Is 'Return of the King' exciting? Yes, there are many meaty battles and situations here. Is it involving and touching? Yes - with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin giving their all as Frodo and Sam, and even Pippin making good. Not to mention the resolution of the story of Arwen and Aragorn. Is it the best film of the three? I'm not sure. For me, the huge scale of the first film, the beauty of Rivendell, the innocence of Middle Earth, the heart-stopping appearance of the Balrog, possibly had the edge. Is this version of 'The Lord of the Rings' really worth the hype? As a nine-hours plus film, undoubtedly.
9.0~More of the same (which means it's very very good) basrutten Sign in Permalink CONTAINS SPOILERS Peter Jackson finally concludes his "Lord of the Rings" trilogy with "The Return of the King". As could be expected, the movie is about the same as the first two installments in the series, which in this case is of course of good thing. Like the other movies, "RotK" looks absolutely marvellous. The landscapes are beautiful, as are the special effects and architecture. There are still a couple of "fake" moments, but over 95% of the time it's completely convincing. The mass battle scenes, already the highlight in "Two Towers", are even more spectacular this time around. In addition to great action scenes, the movie offers a lot of suspense and a feeling of impending doom, and even though many of the characters are quite flat the movie does manage to really make you care about them. The relationship between Frodo, Sam and Gollem is particularly well done. Still, there are some small downsides to this movie. For one, I still think there are too much coincidences and very lucky last-minute escapes/rescues in the movie. The way the battle for Minas Tirith is finally won is an anticlimax (it just feels cheap), as is the ease with which Sam and Frodo simply march into Mordor and destroy the One Ring right under Sauron's nose. I also think the ending gets drawn out way too much...the movie should have ended after the coronation of Aragorn, instead of boring us to death with 20 pointless minutes of tying up loose ends. In the end though, "Return of the King" is a worthy conclusion of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The story has a bit too many flaws, but its execution is (except for the very end) nearly perfect and results in a spectacular, beautiful, suspenseful and very touching movie. ***1/2 out of **** stars
10.0~MY GOODNESS!! THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF OUR TIME!! nivekj1 Sign in Permalink Wow!!! If you've never seen a LOTR movie before, go rent the first two JUST FOR THIS ONE! Everything was incredible, and it is flawless. As for the endings, beautiful, touching, and potent stuff on film. Just stop reading and go see it, then go see it AGAIN!!
10.0~Excellent and best ever! apadilla Sign in Permalink Who is George Lucas?, who is James Cameron? who is Steven Spielberg? Sorry guys you are not longer so recognized, since the name of leading directors will bring PETER JACKSON to scene! Lord of the Rings ends in a fantastic sample of vibrating courage and emotiveness. This is the most great and excellent motion picture ever shot, best performance on effects and cast roles, all in a great full package of fun, reflection and after all: the many, many portraits reflected in real life, although the Tolkien universe is fantastic fiction. Hats off to Lord of the Rings!
10.0~Masterpiece dula01 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson and co. have done a simply stunning job with these films. They fuse visual, dramatic and thematic elements in an unparalleled cinematic triumph of incredible beauty and poignancy. My only "criticism" of the Return of the King is that I know that the extended version, as with the previous two films, will be even better. This is truly a special and unique contribution to the art of cinema the greatness of which will only become clearer with time.
10.0~Yes loved the books, and I love this Movie..So there enazwo Sign in Permalink Grand, sweeping, and at times monumental. But nevertheless captures your emotions for the characters in the nostalgic manner, of Tolkien's writing, that makes it-lump-in-your-throat-difficult to say good-bye to these beloved characters. Yes I will treasure this movie and its predecessors till the end of my days.
8.0~Non-Epic: Horses and Mountain tops can't always make something memorable codoelrubio Sign in Permalink When someone says epic, three movies immediately come to mind, "Dr. Zhivago", "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Seven Samurai". Never in my life will "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy" be viewed in my opinion as epic. Peter Jackson and Andrew Lesnie failed to capture what determines an epic. From their MTV-style of cutting to the lack of original shots and lack of long takes, to the over-abundance and poor use of CGI effects and 'over the top' lighting make "Return of the King" just another Hollywood movie. Maybe a little better done, but in essence, devoid of art and a far cry from J.R.R. Tolkien's vision. It's disappointing when the original cartoons have better screenwriting than the filims. The last third of "Return of the King" really started to come apart. Here, an in tune audience can actually see right around the time when Frodo, Sam and Golem are climbing the stairs that the story is taking a turn for the worse. At the end of the film things really start to come undone, bouncing here and there from Gondor, to the Shire, to Rivendale, trying to give the audience a sense of closure, but instead leaving an film enthusiast dizzy and spinning and wondering and waiting when the film will finally just end. Don't get me wrong, the "Lord of the Rings Trilogy" is the best thing to come out of Hollywood since Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch-Drunk Love", but to put Peter Jackson into a category of filmmakers that includes the likes of PTA, Wes Anderson or Francis Ford Coppola or even Terrence Malick is to lie. Peter Jackson is just another Spielberg or Lucas, lacking in artistry and shining when it comes to gimmicks and thrills. There was so much good that could have come of this trilogy if it were planned out properly, but instead it's just slightly above-average and in no way, ever, an epic (just for clarification, The Star Wars Trilogy are not epic films either, sorry).
6.0~Worst of the trilogy... soulcharmer Sign in Permalink I guess I saw it coming... I only write the review on this one cos there are enough positive comments on the previous parts already. And I liked the first and second part. But Return of the king was such a dissappointment... SPOILERS I think none of those fanatical admirers will give a damn about the following elements that truly spoiled the movie for me... Cliches were everywhere, I was yawning all the time to those stupid stupid dialogues spread throughout the movie. Some of the characters had nothing but pompous phrases to say (Gimli), some had nothing to say at all (Legolas). The last 20 minutes was so melodramatic, it was completely unbearable. Shortcuts like Sam sitting at the table and next moment he's married... yeah, right. Coronation at Minas Tirith heliport was sooo unoriginal it was plain stupid. Ghost army in action was completely unimpressive; just a moving green mass, boring. I can't recall more stupid thing than that Legolas and war elephant acrobatics. Not worth even commenting. The battle subsided every now and then so someone like Gandalf or Eowyn had a time for their melodramatic chatter. Gandalf, supposedly most powerful wizard didn't cast at all during the whole movie save that light bulb that repelled the wyverns. I don't get it, was he retired from casting or what? And how exactly is it that one ring keeps whole Mordor from turning to rubble. Or did the whole land break up that way, so even the mentally retarded individual understands that Sauron is no longer in charge, giving the satisfying impression of grand climax?? As a bonus the soil sank only under orcs' legs, the humans observed, all safe. What a smart deus ex machina... Not to mention the orc army though coming from one direction (Black Gate) surrounded the human contingent within what, one minute? And more, hobbits lying one meter from several streams of hot lava, only barely sweating. Please. Shame on Peter Jackson for these things. Some can call them minor details but all together they melted the good impression I had from part one and two. Sure not the whole movie was bad, animated effects, scenery and overall technical quality was superb as usual but that is just NOT enough for me. Oh well, just another movie diluted with cliches and nonsense; everyone else seems to be happy after all so what's the big deal? My score: 6/10
8.0~Best movie ever nafuva Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movie ever, I love the story and all actors here.
10.0~How much I loved this one? amazingpilgrim Sign in Permalink I absolutely loved this movie. I've seen this already five times in the theater, and now I own it on DVD. And yes, I cried everytime I've seen it. This is one of the best pictures, ever. My favourite part, actually, is Eowyn killing the Witch-King, but there are many more good scenes. The acting-skills are good, everybody gave his/her heart in it. I really don't understand, how on Earth did they forget about Sean Austin at this years Oscars... Also, I recommend watching the three parts together. It may be long, but it IS NINE HOURS of MAGIC, and I mean real MAGIC. Peter Jackson and his team, lads, they really take you there, to the middle of Middle Earth. Hope, you'll have fun, at least as much as I had.
10.0~Big dilemma. rash0 Sign in Permalink Oh, should I buy the trilogy? Oh my God! This question is just stupid. I can't wait to have the trilogy right here in my hands. ;-) It was just great I saw a revolution on cinema industry happening. Those three movies (that I'll count as one) were really beautiful.
10.0~A change of my top 5 movies intelboy Sign in Permalink This movie is the best of everything, the charaters are the best with each other and their environment. You have to love the pros, as well as the antags. This movie as one reviewer once said of this movie, it is the best movie of this generation! The saddest part, it is the last movie. The only thing I have to say that was a downer, it needed more epic battles! So, my top 5 have now changed: 5=Scarface,4=Matrix,3=Lord of the Rings 3,2=Godfather,1=Citizen Kane.
10.0~Sad that it's (almost) over kvala_530 Sign in Permalink I have the same feeling with these movies as with reading the book again: the feeling of leaving your own world and getting absorbed in this fantastic world that has history, mythical creatures, languages, a great story, wonderful characters and so much more. Every time I've finished reading the books I have wanted more - this is why people read the Unfinished tales and the Silmarillion, books not as wonderful or accessible as the LOTR, but more of this world. Now when I read all the comments on this movie, I see that people are like me and want more of the same world. It's just difficult to accept that this world never actually existed.. That we won't find more stories from Middle Earth... *warning: spoilers may be ahead!* I really enjoyed ROTK. The battle scene on the Pelennor fields was wonderful, especially when the riders of Rohan came and just rode OVER the orc armies. Grand. Then when they in turn had to swallow a couple of times when they saw the oliphaunt army. Some things surprised me positively by being so true to the book, like the scene at Mount Doom when Frodo has to get rid of the ring, or Éowyn slaying the Witch King (I loved that!). Some things disappointed me slightly by being unnecessarily black-and-white or different from the book. Éowyn, having been in love with Aragorn, doesn't get to show her growing affection for Faramir. Denethor is just crazy and bad in the movie, while he was treated more fairly in the book. Arwens part is too big, and I don't know why she always has to pop up everywhere. Sure, for the romance part, but hey, we get it. One way the occupation of the Shire by Saruman could have been dealt with was a voice over telling us about it, showing some quick battle scenes, and then a peaceful Shire with the four hobbits drinking beer together. I was happy that the remaining pain of Frodo was shown, and his thoughts on how hard it was to pick up his live, and how damaged he was. I appreciated details as his chain with the ring cutting into his flesh, even though this was not mentioned. Sean Astin was great as Sam, and gets a lot of credit for it, but Elijah Wood was great as Frodo too. He showed his agony, pain and the force of the Ring on him very well, in a subtle way. He was quiet and bore his burden as I would have thought Frodo did. The hobbits were all great characters and were acted very well. Two more things that I felt could have done better: the book frequently mentions how Aragorn became larger than life at times, especially when he had embraced his destiny as King of Gondor. This was not so clear in the movie. It would have been nice to see him shine more. The same goes for Gandalf. In the book his very presence often induces fright on the enemy's side - the one time we saw this was when he kept the nazgûl away from the army outside of Minas Tirith. Despite my comments I loved the movie. I was happy to get to see wonderful Minas Tirith, Minas Morgul, and the Grey Havens, though the latter passed quickly. It makes me want to read the book again and see what is different, and how the cast and crew has interpreted and worked with the book. ROTK (and the entire LOTR) is an outstanding performance. I can feel the dedication of the people involved, and I thought all leading and supporting actors did outstanding performances. At one moment during the movie I wondered: who in New Zealand hasn't contributed to this movie?? Now it's just waiting for the extended version on DVD... At least we'll always have these movies to rewatch and the books to reread. Thanks JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson!
10.0~The best movie of the year! three_am Sign in Permalink I absolutely loved this movie. I have already seen it four times. I can't believe the journey is over. I appreciate everything Jackson & co. has done to bring the epic story of the Lord of the Rings to film. Everything was excellent - the acting, the landscape, the special effects, the direction. Even though the ending of the movie was totally long, I agree with what most of the people have already said, it needed to be long. The movie ending was as close as possible to the way the book ended. The handsome, handsome men in the movie is worth mentioning. Hugs and kisses to the actors who played Faramir, Aragorn, Legolas, and Eomer! Looking forward to owning the special edition DVD. Would love to see the same makers of this film do "The Hobbit."
10.0~an awesome and exhausting movie experience jonathan-harvey3 Sign in Permalink spoilers contained in comments below. I have been a fan of Tolkien and his books before Peter Jacksons films appeared and I was really afraid that the films would be a mess with pantomine characters and tiny little battles that would not do justice to the epic world created by Tolkien. Having seen the first two films many times and having just seen ROTK, i can say my fears have been totally washed away like Sarumans filth from Isengard. I left the cinema stunned, exhausted and delighted with just about everything about the film. Let me get my criticisms out of the way first, i did think the portrayal of Arwen was a little too weak at times for an elf and the army of the dead made the defeat of Saurons army on Pelanor field looked a little too easy. Several minor characters seemed to be completely neglected like Beregond and the dark captain at the Black Gates. Other omissions like Saruman, the scouring of the shire and the houses of healing were also conspicuous by their absence. Right, on a more positive note the main parts of the film were just fantastic. I was astonished to see all the parts of the book i love the most were there. The mustering of Rohan, Shelobs lair, King Theodens demise at the hands of the witch king, the awesome battle of Pelonor field in all its fearsome glory, the incredible battering ram Grond, Denethors madness, Sam carrying Frodo up Mount Doom, the paths of the dead......on and on it went and finally Frodos finger was lost and it was over! Unbelievable, it made me laugh, cry and cheer. I cant decide how it fits in with the first two films in terms of which one i like the most, a few more viewings are required to sort that one out. I am also a big star wars fan and i hope George Lucas is paying attention and goes to ask Peter Jackson how he did such a complete job on such an epic project. Usually, I dont pay much attention to the oscars, because i rarely like the film that wins the main awards, but if ROTK doesnt clean up the lot then it shows how short sighted the people that vote for them are. Peter, can we have the Hobbit sometime please?
10.0~Nothing like it! chismgroup Sign in Permalink I truly loved this trilogy! It was an experience that I will always remember!
9.0~Main concepts grahammastel Sign in Permalink Really good movie, good cinematography has really great shots throughout the movie. The writing is phenomenal and is delivered with excellence. The plot of the movie is thorough and well explained. Overall this movie is great and a must see even if you have not read the book.
10.0~Simply amazing, despite absence of Soromon & a drawn out ending. DrumRobC Sign in Permalink Even without Soromon and a long, drawn out ending to this trilogy, this is most definitely the most amazing visual/emotional experience I have seen on a big screen since Return of the jedi. It has everything... Love, honor, betrayal, hope, courage, laughter & triumph, most of all. though I'm sure it's difficult to put closure to this trilogy in a consice manner, the addition of Soromon would've made the movie feel a bit more resolved. Those are my only two small complaints. The drawn out ending and the absence of the wicked wizard. he will, however, be in the extended DVD next year, so I'm looking forward to that. If you like LOTR, obviously see this right away- don't wait for the dvd- This is the single best installment in the trilogy and Jackson has evolved movie-making as we know it.
10.0~Excellent ending for the best trilogy of our time. jvsantos Sign in Permalink For those who want it all: action, adventure, romance, great battle sequences, eye-opening special effects, etc. here is a very rich story worth seeing for anybody who can have the patience to sit for 3:20 in a movie theatre. Not that the movie gets boring at any time, just that 3:20 is an awfully long time. The worst part of the movie is the ending, where you realize that it is finally over. There is nothing to look forward to now, just the Extended DVD. It used to be infuriating not to know what happened next, but people just don't know what they have until they don't. The movie is very well adapted. All the storylines presented in the previous movies are given closure (except for Saruman's maybe). It is not perfectly accurate to the book, but no matter. The movie is great!
10.0~"KING" WILL BE LORD OF THE OSCARS halloweennight1978 Sign in Permalink I say: "The final chapter that is "THE LORD of the RINGS: THE RETURN of the KING" is by far the only truly great movie of 2003! Every bit of craftsmanship, from the costume design to the wonderful acting proves that this film is THE BEST FANTASY ADVENTURE OF ALL TIME. Bravo to everyone involved in this GROUNDBREAKING, MIRACULOUS ACHIEVEMENT! Words simply can't describe the true MASTERPIECE this film really is, which is why I am naming it THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR!"
10.0~Breath-taking adventure mirks Sign in Permalink Been there - done that! Over 9h watching Lord of the Rings! Awesome! Just arrived at home again from watching the 3 films. Amazing! Really fantastic! But it seems to me that the Second Part (The Two Towers) comes up with more fighting scenes and action than the third. In my opinion the third film can't "beat" the second - but he has other advantages. But nevertheless the third part is worth watching it. It`s just about finishing the triology. Jackson did a very good job - not too much of action, continuing the love story(s) and bringing on the dramas. I'll watch it again on Saturday!...
10.0~They saved the best for last mhodges Sign in Permalink An unbelievable achievement! I felt that the "Return of the King" (ROTK) theatrical release was better than either "Fellowship of the Ring" (FOTR) or "The Two Towers" (TTT) theatrical releases. I felt that ROTK stayed pretty close to the book, having re-read the book last week in preparation for the movie. I'm a big Tolkien fan, but I can see where someone who hasn't seen either of the first two movies or read any of the books might feel a little left out. If you haven't seen either FOTR or TTT, I would strongly suggest viewing those two films prior to viewing ROTK. Of course, if you're going to see ROTK and haven't seen either of the first two films, you must have been living under a rock. As for me, the only movie I have left to look forward to is for the extended edition of ROTK, or possibly "The Hobbit" if Peter Jackson is allowed to make it.
10.0~Tears welled up on at least five occasions. (Spoilers) mecandes Sign in Permalink An absolute triumph, and the bittersweet ending to the best films of all time. I'll start with what I liked about the film by telling you where the tears welled up: 1. Arwen's vision of Aragorn holding her child. 2. Gandalf describing what it is like to die to Pippin. 3. Eowyn holding Theoden as he dies. 4. When Frodo awakes in Minas Tirith, the moment when his eyes meet Sam's. 5. When King Elessar, and the masses, kneel before the hobbits. I really liked the pacing of this film; a vast improvement over TTT, and I have to admit, I didn't even miss Saruman -- like Jackson has said, "it's old business" from TTT, and I was happy to just get on with ROTK. Unlike TTT, there is less jumping around, and you really have a feeling throughout the movie that the fates of each group of people (Frodo/Sam, Theoden etc., Gandalf etc.) are closely intertwined. The acting was top drawer, to be sure, and the emotional intensity of the trilogy definitely reaches a crescendo in ROTK. I do have some nitpicks -- the things that kept the film from "exceeding" my expectations: First and foremost, I despised the part where Elrond claims Eowyn is dying because "her fate is tied to the ring." It defies all logic, all sense, and it just comes out of left-field without warning or precedent; especially when the last scene of Arwen is when she has a vision about "living happily ever after," and now all of a sudden she is dying, and shown lamenting that she will never see Aragorn again? It simply didn't make sense, and seemed an incredibly cheesy plot device. It seemed strange to emphasize Eowyn's heartbreak, and Theoden passing on the rule of Rohan to her, but then to cut out the Houses of Healing scenes where, in the book, she hooks up with Faramir. After she slays the Witchking, Eowyn is only seen for a fleeting instant in the crowd at the coronation... sure, she's standing beside Faramir, but it doesn't seem a fitting end to her tale. I'm surprised that the Mouth of Sauron wasn't in the film; it seems like it would have been nice to have him present Frodo's mithril shirt as apparent evidence of his destruction, and then have Aragorn take his step of faith in Frodo in spite of this evidence. I was excited to see Merry and Pippin's strong roles in the film -- but saddened to see that Legolas and Gimli have very little to do, besides basically an exact repeat of their "counting game" from TTT. We've been there, done that... mumakil or no mumakil. The "web" Shelob wraps around Frodo looks too fake during the scene when Sam is holding him (thinking him dead) -- it took away from the dramatic tension of the moment, and killed the "suspension of disbelief." I don't feel like the army of the dead should have looked like grotesque rotting corpses -- they WEREN'T corpses, they were spirits, and should have looked fully human; but leave it to Peter Jackson, the horror film maker, to throw in a cheap horror element. That whole sequence fell flat because of it: had we seen the spirits of dignified men of yesteryear honestly seeming to be trying to redeem themselves, it would have been a much more powerful aspect of the plot. A bargain with corpses makes Aragorn look to be using evil to fight evil, and I doubt that's how Tolkien would have intended it to appear. I could have done without the Smeagol/Deagol introduction; I quite disliked the make-up jobs as they attempted to show Smeagol degenerating into Gollum; it just looked aweful, and forced me to give the make-up 4 out of 5 (that and some fake looking hobbit ears and feet -- and the awfully over-done aging applied to Bilbo at the end.) At the very end, when Frodo is invisible and Gollum jumps on him, the struggle should have been a bit more dynamic -- the shots of Gollum floating around in the air went on too long -- people in the theatre thought it was comical and started to laugh... well, clearly, this is not a moment in the film when people should be laughing. (And what's the deal with Gollum sinking into the lava without any look of pain and the way his body must be burning and melting away?) There was something that failed to grab me about the Grey Havens scene at the end, and I finally realized what it is: we're never shown the ocean. All we see is the ship in an extremely sheltered cove, sailing towards a tight passage between two huge sheer mountains -- I wanted, no, NEEDED to see the ocean's vast expanse. (And, I had always secretly hoped that we would see the ship "leaving Middle-earth" in the way it does in that old John Howe painting... some how.) I was surprised, after reading so many reviews that said "it has long, multiple endings," to actually feel that the ending seems quite short. Sure, if you think the Ring's destruction is the end of the story, maybe it would seem long -- but no, this isn't a movie about a Ring, it's a movie about, first and foremost, Frodo -- his journey isn't quite over just because the Ring is gone, and we must follow it through to the end; quite right. When all is said and done, I think Fellowship of the Ring will remain my favourite film of the trilogy -- that's not to say anything about about ROTK, though, because FOTR has always been my favourite part of the book, too, and I always expected I would like it best. ROTK will obviously be most peoples' favourite, though, and understandably so; it is a stunning achievement. One final word: No offense, but I actually hope Peter Jackson lets someone else direct The Hobbit (maybe he could produce it or something). I think I'd rather not see the horror film maker put his hand to what should be a lighter, children-oriented movie.
10.0~A few problems, but near perfection the_shadow_guard Sign in Permalink As someone who has read the books and spoken with people who saw the movie before I did, I can still assure you that the movie was extremely suspenseful and emotional all the same. Very engaging. My main problems were that there was a perfectly fine opening where they could have shown at least a few seconds of Saruman pacing around, or have had Grima thrown the palantir out of the tower in anger, just to explain why the heck the ball just happened to be sitting in the water, rather than upstairs in the tower where we last saw it. The movie actually explained the ghost characters to me where I had been very confused about them in the book. Simple and straightforward. This movie was more or less like the book, but was not all that "pure"--the book had a much longer, detailed resolution. The resolution phase of this movie worked well; it was quite a tearjerker. Which brings me to the problem of having heard some people comment on the sexuality of some of the characters. Those made no sense to me; the characters had obviously become much closer friends after the adventure, and if anything, their interaction was very toned down in comparison with the book. There was nothing "gay" about it. Obviously, this movie does not take place in early 21st century America, nor is our culture also that of Middle Earth. Don't forget that when watching. Good job changing the book into a movie; beautiful visuals that did not detract from the actors or their performances. 9.5 out of 10... that'll round up to a 10 here.
10.0~How can you explain this film in words? kiizzo957 Sign in Permalink This is the best movie EVER to be created in the whole of the cinema world, and i have seen many great movies. I really do believe it is NOT physically or mentally possible to put another film above this.'IT IS A GIFT'. and a blimmin good one! If you didn't like this film then i completely don't understand. I sat in the cinema and as soon as the music began i was hooked. I don't even know where the time went. It was the most awe inspiring thing i've ever witnessed and God help anybody who wants to make a more successful film than this one. I really don't know what to say. I loved that film so much i can't put it into words that would do it justice. see it! see it again! buy it! and buy it again!(just to make sure) WELL DONE TO EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS MASTERPIECE. YOU FULFILLED YOUR AIM. AND IT'S VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.
9.0~"Songs for great halls" Steffi_P Sign in Permalink Before Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the world of high fantasy has not been particularly well-served by cinema. The genre was not even really taken seriously in literature until the 1960s. During the 80s, there was a fad for fantasy movies, but while most of these looked nice and were good enough fun, none of them really had magnificence (although the 1981 Excalibur movie comes pretty close). It was not until the first decade of the 20th century that we saw fantasy cinema's rather delayed coming-of-age. As with the first two movies in the trilogy the transition from novel to screenplay is exceptional. There's a lot more action and a lot less dialogue in this one, and yet the plot is still clear and the narrative never feels repetitive. The idea of binding the various story lines together in time – such as when the Witch-King arises near Frodo and Sam, but the tower of green light is seen miles away by Pippin – are great for building up the tension. They also really help to establish this vision of Middle Earth as a real place with vast dimensions. And again Jackson proves himself to be an action director with that little extra flair of intelligence. At first glance his work seems very much aimed at those with short attention spans, but there is so much loaded into each and every shot, the camera following an orc as he falls to the ground, or coming to rest upon a woman holding a baby as panic erupts in the city. His horror-tinged imagining of certain scenes is truly unnerving. There is some all-round improved acting in this instalment. Perhaps the years wrapped up in the production were taking the necessary toll on the cast. There are some truly heartfelt moments from Bernard Hill and a wonderfully spirited turn from Miranda Otto. For me, Billy Boyd always stood out as the finest of the hobbit performers, and this is the movie where he comes to the forefront, demonstrating great dignity and emotion. The best performance however, as previously, belongs to Ian McKellen as Gandalf. There's something strangely knowing in his final scene. One of the unfortunate things about The Return of the King is that it suffers worse than the first two movies from a lack of dignity at certain times. The CGI Gollum is too cutesy and it's hard to believe in him as an antagonist, although funnily enough the glimpse we get of partly-transformed Smeagol biting into a fish with Andy Serkis in prosthetics would have been perfect for the whole thing. Some of the most serious bits become silly. I remember laughing out loud in the cinema when Gandalf says "So passes Denethor" when the man is still pathetically running around in flames. But by-and-large, this is an exceptional production, with its most outstanding touches in the way the whole thing has been put together. When the beacons are lit stretching a line across a mountain range, it's done in such a smooth, rhythmic way we are simultaneously impressed by the immense scale, the beauty of the landscape and the sheer brilliance of it as a means of communication. When Pippin's haunting song continues in the background as the men of Gondor ride off to their doom, we feel the depth of what is going on in a way the images alone could not impart. This is the kind of thinking you don't see in those numerous 80s fantasy movies, or in sci-fi's big trilogy, Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings movies put us right within both the excitement and the sadness of the story, for me with greater weight than Tolkien himself achieved. It elevates this above being merely another CGI action flick and grants the fantasy genre a status and stature it has never enjoyed before.
9.0~An impressive success in every possible way. lewiskendell Sign in Permalink The extended version of Return of the King is slightly over four hours long. And other than the excessively drawn out and overly indulgent ending (the only thing that keeps it from perfection, in my eyes), every minute of it is wonderful. The best compliment that I can offer, is that it makes those four hours pass by in the twinkling of an eye. The first two movies laid all the groundwork, introduced most of the major characters, and set the stage for the end. All that's left for Return of the King to do is deliver...and deliver it does. The Battle of Minas Tirith makes The Battle of Helms Deep seem like a minor skirmish, and it's not even the climactic battle of the film. Each of the characters (and the entirety of the world of men) is in perhaps more danger than they've ever been. Frodo and Sam must face the perils of Mordor, the ring's continued burdening of Frodo, as well as the treachery of their guide. And the Eye of Sauron and the smoke and flames of Mount Dhoom cast a disheartening glare over all, as evil's final push to conquer Middle Earth moves into its final phase. RoTK stands as the best of the trilogy, in my humble opinion. It handles the events of the book incredibly well, only changing or excluding things when it's of benefit to the film. It's astonishing to see the world of Middle Middle translated so well from page to screen. Such a great adaptation of a complex work of literature as The Lord of the Rings should be nigh-impossible, but Peter Jackson, WETA, and New Line managed to pull it off. Return of the King is an achievement, a marvel, and almost a miracle, but most importantly, it's a near-perfect film and a great end to the trilogy.
10.0~Greatest movie ever! berkeley Sign in Permalink I thought the first two films were great and then I saw Return of the King... somehow this made the first two even better while at the same time making them pale by comparison. This movie is beautiful, breathtaking, exciting, thrilling, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring, heart-pounding, and humbling. The movie stands for itself and words are not fit to descrribe it. This is the film by which all others should be judged!
8.0~A great epic but some flaws and in a hurry Challeman Sign in Permalink I'm one of those who like FotR more than TTT. I don't know why but that's just the way. Yesterday we had a marathon with the FotR and TTT before we went to see RotK. Both of them were EE and I hadn't seen TTT:EE before. It was a whole lot better than the TE. TTT rose in my eyes. The same thoughts and hopes do I have of RotK. *spoilers ahead* The film starts out very well. Beginning with Smeagol and Deagol and the history of Gollum. Felt a little strange... Weird people Smeagol and Deagol. The first part of the film follows the book the most (as I remember it) and it is definently the best part from a Tolkien/film "critic"-view. I takes time to focus on the caracters and build up the tension of the coming struggle. Then something happens. The war begins (too early it seems to me...) and everything in a haste. The last half of the film is rushed. It is so much story and information that has to be in the movie but at the same time Jackson puts in stuff that only add to the time and not to the progress of the film. This is definently the film in the triology that really, really needs an EE to slow down, take a breath and expand the scenes. Then it'll probably be a 10 or a 9 but in the present shape a can not give anything more than a 8 and that one is weak. There are alot of other things like maybe overabuse of cgi (or wrong purpose and/or use of it), the battle feels to short (although it really is long in real counted time), the ending goes on forever, some lose ends, very long-winded dialog at the end, to many dreams and "lookbacks" among other thing. I don't want to descibe them all more than this. It is still a great movie, but not as good as the other (imho). I be watching it again twice but I'm really waiting fo the EE. It'll rock. btw The battlescenes a so awesome. Worthy the ticket alone. Don't even think of not seeing this move!
10.0~The Greatest Movie Ever Made. bishsam Sign in Permalink Without a single doubt, 'The Lord Of The Rings' is the best film trilogy ever, and 'The Return Of The King' is the best of the best, and in my opinion there is nowthing better than this film. It's dramatic, tense, climactic, exciting and just sinply wonderful, which is everything you want in a film. Peter Jackson has earned the name of my favourite film director ever.
10.0~Best film ever CompreCompra Sign in Permalink Best movie ever. Everything here even after 16 years still keeping this film as one of the best films ever
9.0~... just precious captain_robert_april Sign in Permalink The final installment packs an expected wallop and sums the film series up with expected bedazzlement and intrigue. It is perhaps all too expected due to Mister Jackson's previous ability to impress us with his work. Still, the movie did have a few flaws... mainly being that there was a lot of "just take our word for it" in our film, such as when Saruman is said to be a prisoner in his tower, powerless and Treebeard is put in charge of him. We assume he's up there glowering down, but we never even get to pan up to the tower. This reoccurs a few times when we just have to assume something worked out. Is this a major flaw? Of course not... the epic is a success... a rare event in these days. Perfectly watchable and then some!
8.0~Very well done and triumphant. Great pick for fans of adventure or Middle Earth. CinematicInceptions Sign in Permalink The triumph of this film is pretty much only paralleled by the first two of the series. This is actually my least favorite of the three, but that's not at all to say that it's bad. The main reason I like it less is the ending, not because I didn't like how it ended, but because it doesn't have that much of an effect after the first viewing. The rest of it is very solidly done, though. There are too many characters to address all of them, but I'll do my best to give them all some justice. Frodo is kind of our main character, but he's not very active and that makes him less likable. However, you do have to give him props for accepting the burden of the Ring and resisting it as best he could. He's still my least favorite of the many protagonists, but his subtle strength is noteworthy. Aragorn takes prominence in this installment as he makes himself a worthy king of Gondor and leader of men. We don't see quite as much of an internal struggle with him as in the first two. Gandalf continues to be the constant mentor and armour-less warrior we've come to love him as. But Sam is the one who really takes the cake here as Frodo needs him more than ever. His courage and companionship are what really brings the series full circle. Gollum/Smeagol is still a main antagonistic force as he submits to his avarice for the Ring and betrays Frodo. All the less important characters (Pippin, Merry, Gimli, Legolas, Theoden, Faramir, Eowyn, Eomer, Denethor) are also very prominent, important, and valiant in their own big or small ways, but I don't have space to talk about them all. All of them have a moment of heroism or have already had one in the prior films, excepting Denethor whose only accolade is winning Worst Fictional Dad of the Year. My top three characters are Faramir, Eowyn, and Pippin. The story picks up near the end of the Two Towers book, which was probably a good decision even though the capture of Frodo at the end of book 2 led into ROTK a little better. The two main plot lines are Aragorn and Gandalf bringing Rohan and Gondor together to make a final stand against Mordor, and Frodo, Sam, and Gollum completing the journey to Mount Doom. It's pretty simple to follow, though remembering all of the characters and their names can be difficult. I liked the Gollum/Frodo faceoff at the end, even though it reduces Frodo's heroism. There's about 30 minutes worth of resolution after the Ring's destruction. The ending of Frodo having to leave the Shire forever is very bittersweet, and completes the theme of sacrifice. The technical execution is amazing even ten years after its production. The CGI and effects are pretty impressive, but there are a couple of points where the graphics look a bit cheesy. Howard Shore gives us another great and vast score to accompany the Middle Earth landscapes. The script is well paced and the dialogue isn't bad for the most part. The ultra-dramatic language can get a little old, but that's all the screenwriters had to work with and they seem to have done their best. The acting is pretty good from everyone, but there isn't a place for any mind-blowing performances. Peter Jackson's directing is awesome. Say what you will about what he's done with the story of the Hobbit trilogy, but you can't deny that the guy knows how to call shots. Outside of the epic battle scenes, he does an excellent job introducing intimidating characters and creatures. It is very long, so make sure you have it for a few days if you're renting it. I wouldn't recommend watching it too often, because I've fallen prey to that a little and it's not good. If you liked the first two, they are all basically equal in quality, so definitely watch it, but know that it may not end up being your favorite. Overall Rating: 9.2/10.
10.0~Best movie ever EmmanuelMalaj Sign in Permalink This trilogy is the best movie I ever seen. It contains everything that you will see in a movie fantasy, horror, drama, action, romance, some comedy and more. The effects are great and it's based on one of the best book I ever read. Either the cast is very good chosen. Jackson made everything good. It was great as I saw it for the first time. After that I saw the movies about teen times and every time I liked it more and more. I was very happy as I heard the news that the Hobbit begun to be filmed and as I saw the first part I was very happy. Only the cast was not very good for me but in all it was good. I can't wait to see in the cinemas the second part of the Hobbit.
10.0~Better than I had ever hoped. slhanna Sign in Permalink Everything considered, ROTK is better than I really hoped it could be. As a Tolkien fanatic, I was disappointed immediately after seeing the first two movies: I wanted them to be the books. But soon after seeing each one, I came to appreciate the movies as they are. There is little for me to complain about in ROTK, Denethor's portrayal as gross and incompetent; the Army of the Dead's complete victory (I hate "and then a miracle occurs" solutions). Almost all the characters were very good to excellent. The battle scenes were never tedious, the editing was great. PS. Was that Andy Serkis with the pumpkin in the Shire at the end?
10.0~A Flawless work of Art jordman10 Sign in Permalink OK Words cannot explain the sheer greatness of this movie. It is no questions asked the Best Movie Ever Made. This movie is a Masterpiece. I don't care what you think this movie made me cry several times. With Brilliant casting every Freaking emotion in this movie was so Believable that I worship it. IT...IS...Flawless. Absolutely Flawless. Brilliant battle sequences while at the same time staying so completely true to the book. I worship Peter Jackson and J.RR Tolkien. It would appeal to the most diverse audience in the world. This is the Ultimate movie. I know a person who was in this movie very personally. Literally the most thunderous movie ever. Like I said earlier words cannot explain the sheer greatness of this movie. More than a movie but a brilliant, Flawless Work of art...a FREAKIN" WORK OF ART.
10.0~Imagination jenniriach Sign in Permalink This to me is the best of the three. Of course there is the fact that it completes the story, but the overall emotion and excitement in the storyline are amazing. The characters really mature in this one which left me with a sense of satisfaction. I loved the special effects, and you get to see some really interesting characters in this one. The special effects and the live action blend together seamlessly. You will feel like you are experiencing this with the characters. I read the Trilogy and I can't believe that someone tapped into my imagination and put it on film. The one thing I had a hard time with was knowing that this is the last one. I cried, I laughed, I gasped, I LOVED IT!!
10.0~Simply Amazing scart940 Sign in Permalink I have never seen a movie quite like this, I was not bored once during the entire movie and that is 3 hours and 20 minutes. I don't think I've ever been moved as much as I was at the end of this movie. Once the credits came at the end it felt like the perfect ending, Jackson did not screw this trilogy up a bit and I thank him for making three of the best movies of all time. 10 out of 10 I say.
10.0~Very nice movie jaap_westerbeek Sign in Permalink The story wasn't finished as it should, but I'm expecting much from the "extended" edition. Beautiful pictures, and the story is hardly altered. A bit much CGI at some points but there's so much eyecandy that doesn't bother me. I think it will rise to the top of the TOP 250, and will be known as the best movie of all times...
9.0~The best mjm10000 Sign in Permalink I think this was the best of the three movies,although Two Towers is really close, although they chopped whole sections of the book out and changed(unfortunately) other sections it was fairly well done. After seeing all three movies I now know what my biggest problem with the movie(s) is, my biggest problem is that in my opinion they took a lot of the focus off the hobbits and focus more on other characters. I hope that they release a huge special edition set of all three movies that perhaps with a little editing can make it look like one long movie so we won't have to sit through opening credits of three movies, but of course with DVD's now it is so easy to skip the opening credits.
10.0~Epic Battle of all time to save middle earth! faisal-khan-527-369524 Sign in Permalink I love the lord of the rings return of the king it is my favourite film of all time. I was sad that it was the last lord of the rings film, but they did well to end the film as the one ring was finally destroyed in the pits of mount doom and Saurons forces were finally ended. the film is very emotional and epic. When I was watching the film for the first time allot of questions were flowing through my mind, will the ring be destroyed?, will Sauron survive? and most importantly is this the end? The fellowship had split apart as Frodo and Sam had to go to mount doom alone, while Gandalf was defending Gondor from siege and Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas was getting reinforcements from Rohan to help Gondor. Aragorn had to be who he was born to be, the king! and he had to take the dangerous path to the army of the dead to get help from them to save Gondor. I think this was very heroic and brave of him. Finally when the Orcs were driven back to Mordor i was thinking Frodo and Sam will never get to mount doom safely. Then Aragorn saved the day again by reuniting the armies of Gondor and Rohan to go to the gates of Mordor so Saurons eye was focused on them, therefore the eye wasn't fixed on the one ring (Sam and Frodo). Aragorn by far was one of the most bravest characters during return of the king, but it was Sam and Frodo who saved the world of middle earth and managed to kill Golem who wanted nothing but the ring!
10.0~Pretty much outstanding TheLittleSongbird Sign in Permalink I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring. My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum. Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic. The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in. The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result. All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox
9.0~Just another praising comment on the biggest film of our time keuhkokala Sign in Permalink This film has been praised to high heavens by everyone, it is currently #2 in the IMDb highest-voted movies of all time-list and it won 11 of the most wanted of all movie prices, including Best Picture. So why should I write another review of it? I probably won't have anything new to say, unless I absolutely loathed the film. Which is the furthest from the truth as can be. I'm writing this simply for my love for the biggest film of our time. This film as anything finally shows us how perfectly Peter Jackson has captured the book. I still don't think anyone could make a better adaptation. Jackson was wise enough to choose actors instead of stars in the roles as this part requires them more than anything. And although I was suspicious at first, all the hobbit actors hit just the right spot, Billy Boyd and Dom Monaghan ARE more than just token comic reliefs and Sean Astin really shines this time around as the bravest hobbit of them all Samwise "the brave" Gamgee. Without great actors, this movie could feel like a regular hack 'n slash action movie set in a fantasy world, but with great actor work and a great script the story's themes of friendship, courage and sacrifice are really the main attractions, not just the stunning action scenes. Just like in the good ole epics like Lawrence of Arabia. Something that should also be noted in the trilogy is the wonderful music of Howard Shore. Truly, he is the new John Williams, who can create noticeable and endlessly hummable main themes, threatening pre-battle music or soft, idyllic music for a simple village like Hobbiton. The viewer feels easier the atmosphere of the location with the help of fitting music. And it couldn't fit better than in this one. It's notable now that the most respected directors, such as Quentin Tarantino and Steven Spielberg talk regularly against using too many fake-looking computer-effects in movies. I agree that the traditional effect-making is usually more stunning and some classics, like the Thing or An American Werewolf in London couldn't have the same effect if they were made with computers. But The Lord of the Rings trilogy really shows that sometimes CGI can be as magical. They probably couldn't have made the epic battle scenes or characters like Gollum without computers. The trick seems to be to use them just the right amount and not just to attract the viewers, as most movies nowadays do, but to help the story, as they did in this one. If some downsides should be mentioned, it would be that even with 3 1/2 hours in the regular cut, the story doesn't focus enough on some things and tells a little too much of some other things. Most people think, that leaving Saruman out was a mistake. I agree, but I'd rather had seen the Houses of Healing scene between Eowyn and Faramir. The movie needs also some tenderness and at least one fully written female character. Fortunatlelly, these scenes are on the DVD and also there's plenty of Miranda Otto otherwise in the theatrical cut. ***** (10/10, the best films I've seen #2) The Best Part (SPOILER): A very hard choice, but I would say the part when Gollum and Frodo have a final fight from the ring inside Mount Doom as Aragorn and co. fight Sauron's immense army is the most effective for me
6.0~die Saruman naderea Sign in Permalink Tolkein got bombastic as the books progressed. The prose increasingly indebted to the King James Bible. Similarly I could have done with less portentous speeches and lines in all 3 films. But here is the climax the impeding destruction of evil. Where the hell is Christopher Lee? He rightly complained bitterly about filming all his work putting his soul into it , to the point where he dismissed Star Wars in interviews as fiction and LOTR as being 'real'. The story for those of you who have better things to do than read 2000 pages of goblins, revolves around a magic ring which will give its possessor immense power. The tyrant Dark Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen and is the worse for it as the animated version in the 70s didn't give enough screen time to the most evil character since Satan.) demands the return of the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be used for evil purposes, as it corrupts its wearer as a result of being forged by Sauron himself. . At the beginning of the final part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the kingdom of Gondor. The film relates the story of the conflict which follows. Again more big battle sequences, many are impressed by this , I would rather have a substitute with less battles. The acting is uniformly good, as a result of Peter Jackson being a proper director unlike Lucas who is only interested in translating sci fiction technology to the screen. The magnificent New Zealand scenery,is matched Howard Shore's musical score. This mixture of talents and nature raise this piece of fantasy far above other examples in the genre.
6.0~Over rated Mitski007 Sign in Permalink Way too long, boring and repetitious. I hope the editor didn't get payed too much. Besides, they tried to make it like a Star Wars spectacle too soon. Didn't work. And Elijah Wood is horrible. I probably would have enjoyed the battle scenes if I hadn't already seen a bunch in the first two movies. And if they could cut out some stuff from the book, then they could have cut out the Tree Beards or whatever. That was just stupid. The whole relationship between the evil king and his son, Sean Bean's brother was ridiculous. I don't think Peter Jackson filmed enough shots of the king eating the grapes. Well everyone hypes it up and I just don't think it was that great. Too many endings! Pick one.
1.0~Has Jackson actually read the books properly wormtongue Sign in Permalink I watched the Fellowship & could live with the changes. The Two Towers made my heart sink too many alterations & additions, yes additions I can understand cutting the story to fit but shovelling lumps of extraneous storyline in that is not in the book WHY? extra elves at helm's deep WTF! Why cut bits that those familiar with the books are expecting to add garbage that no-one expects I can't explain. The Return of the King was for me the last straw, the Return of Jacksons Ego more like. Why they saw fit to change dialogue from the original, in some cases only a few words & in others changing the speaker of the words. This is Peter Jacksons LOTR not Tolkeins, I haven't checked but the credits should show "inspired by JRR Tolkein" because this is not his work. I will stick with the BBC 4 version, which While abridged is true to Tolkein & the pictures are better on radio.
1.0~Way too long dejongfloris Sign in Permalink The movie is too long for the few stuff that is happening. 2 and a half hour is just walking.
10.0~The best adventure trilogy ever emmanuelcarranza Sign in Permalink If you like movies with magic environments, magic creatures, and war fights between massive armies, this is the movie for you is pure poetry in a movie.
10.0~The best film i have seen so far in my short life! whizzkiduk-311-648630 Sign in Permalink I've watched this about 20 times now, and i'm captivated from start to finish every time. It's a gripping, emotionally draining and exciting film. I'd go far to say that it is the greatest film of all time. Along with the best trilogy of all time. This film set a new standard in film making and Jackson is probably the most sort after Director going thanks to this movie. You have to really watch the last film as it starts straight after the last one had finished. Frodo's task is hanging on a knife edge has he starts to lose strength and his trust in Gollum grows to strong. Andy Serkis and WETA do an absolutely fantastic job of Gollum once again. He looks extremely realistic once again and really plays a big part in the film. I thought the expansive scenery and battles added to the brilliance and build up towards the end. In particular the battle of Pelannor fields just left me jaw-dropped at how brilliant it was filmed. Some of the huge backdrops played a big part also, I.E. the part where Gandalf finally see's Minis Tirith. You feel very involved throughout the film with Frodo's quest. Jackson creates the sense of pity fantastically on the viewer regarding Gollum. The only issue i have was Jackson did squeeze to many endings together making them feel a lot less emotional on the viewer. I thought it was awfully sad when Frodo passed into the west, and they should of just left it at that, however it was a lot to cram in and i think 3 hours of film was absolutely masterful. It's hard to review a film with so many qualities, and very few faults. If you look at professional critics they will agree at how good this film is, 11 Oscars well done and more awards. The most solid 10/10 i've ever given.
10.0~Gorgeous Work thomasschweighofer Sign in Permalink I enjoy this film so much until these day. It has such intense characters and a really deep and complex story. One of my favorite all time movies. The director, Peter Jackson, is just a hero. Organization and Costume departement were unbelievably good. The whole crew was extremely motivated. I would love to be part of such an intense experience nowadays.
10.0~I thought Two Towers couldn't be duplicated, I was dead wrong. callanvass Sign in Permalink Return Of The King is one of those rare movies, that I have so much trouble coming up, with a decent review, because I'm absolutely speechless. Return Of The King is also one of the rare films, that actually surpass the hype!. I have rarely been so emotionally exhausted in my life time!. It's a known fact, that I dislike Fellowship, but adored Two Towers, so I had high hopes for this one. Return Of The King has so much action going on, it's honestly hard to keep up. There is something going on at every turn, with unbearable suspense. All the characters are even better this time around, especially Frodo. I was amazed at some of the selfishness he had this time around, instead of the goody two shoes routine he usually did, it made for some really gripping suspense. The performances are absolutely incredible for the most part, everybody has truly grown up. I avoided the Lord Of The Ring series, for so many years because of the constant over hype people gave the series. Well It's nice to be proved wrong once in a while, and Return Of The King especially, shut me up but quick. Bottom Line. Return Of The King is a masterpiece plain and simple. It's one of the best movies in the history of cinema, and I thank Peter Jackson, for giving me 3 or so hours, of wonderful cinema. The Two Towers is a masterpiece itself, but it does not compare to the brilliance of this one. Even if you aren't a fan of the genre, this is still an absolute must watch. 10/10
10.0~PERFECT!!! LG72387 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a magnificent epic that could not have been made any better even if Steven Spielberg was directing it instead of Peter Jackson. Elijah Wood gives a tour-de-force performance as Mister Frodo in the final film of this series and should receive his very first Oscar nomination. Sean Astin is brilliant as Sam and should also receive an Oscar nomination. The story itself has brought much more depth to its characters giving it a superior strength that makes it unstoppable for 3 hours and 21 minutes. Yet the real brilliance comes in the form of visual effects. Shelob looks absolutely realistic and absolutely brilliant. The Dead Soldiers look amazing in every sense of the word. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields is without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest battle ever put on the big screen, surpassing that of D-Day in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Gollum is absolutely fantastic. The art direction is extraordinarily superb. The cinematography and editing of the picture is nothing short of brilliant. Viggo Mortenson gives a fine performance as does John Noble as Denethor, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and Bernard Hill as King Theoden. Hugo Weaving (Elrond) is just as good as he was in Fellowship. Miranda Otto is nothing short of fantastic and stunning as Eowyn. What more can I say except that every aspect of this movie is brilliant and it will go down as one of the great movie classics. It shall win the Oscar for Best Picture without any competition from Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain. Accolades to Peter Jackson for taking a literary masterpiece so grand in scale and turning it into a film masterpiece so grand in scale. He should and will win the Oscar for Best Director. The Lord of the Rings shall forever be a classic movie trilogy and will go down as one of the greatest stories ever told not just in the cinema but also in the world as well. Lenny's Grade: A+
10.0~ROTK exceeds very high expectations dennis-gustafson Sign in Permalink Having been looking forward to these movies for years and having read the series approximately 8 times, I went into opening day for each of the movies with very high expectations. Fellowship met my expectations. Two Towers was slightly below expectation, mostly due to what he chose to do with Famamir. Although I own the extended version of Two Towers, I chose not to watch it and saved it for Trilogy Tuesday. After seeing the additional 45 minutes of coverage, I was very impressed and now Two Towers has met and slightly exceeded expectations. Return of the King highly exceeded my expectations for two major reasons. 1) The emotions that were brought out during the movie, both joyous laughter and tears. 2) His loyalty to the third book. I still have goosebumps
10.0~Stupendous. Simply and utterly stupendous. Peter_Gunz Sign in Permalink First, no storyline description is needed for this movie, seeing as how the majority of the known universe has seen it. Second, I have read the books, thoroughly and repeatedly, so I may offer my humble opinions on the film's comparable continuity. In short, this movie cannot be topped. By anything. Ever. Period. But since this section is meant for me to voice my opinions, I will justify my judgment. Peter Jackson had his work cut out for him when he took up this task with New Line as his backer, mainly because it is a presold product. The LOTR books have a following second to none, and failure on Jackson's part would likely have led to his assassination by an overzealous Tolkienite. However, he has performed admirably, and has managed to stay as close to the literate plot as possible. There are several jagged details which cause me to cringe every time I encounter them on the silver screen, but as a whole, I remain nonetheless satisfied. The most obvious of these is the romantic subplot. While I am by no means sexist, I believe that this subplot was added simply to keep female viewers who had not read the books interested. Arwen and Eowyn's romantic involvement with Aragorn in the books is no more than a passing mention, if that. There are no long dialogues between Aragorn and Arwen, and there are no dreamlike telepathic connections. In this matter, Peter Jackson certainly took some creative liberties, but I suppose it did help romanticize the plot slightly. But only slightly. I have several other small complaints about altered plots and over-dramatization, but I will continue to annoy my friends and relatives with these, instead of subjecting the worldwide audience to my extremist scrutiny. The CGI effects of this movie are mindblowing. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields will stand out in cinematic history as the crowning jewel of combat sequences. It will be many years, and many failed attempts before this battle will be paralleled, nonetheless succeeded of it's title. Also, no doubt through the aid and constant vigil of the Official LOTR Fanclub (who always had Jackson's ear) I often found myself thinking "that was exactly how I imagined it", and was very pleased and even surprised by how accurate he had done his craft. As for Gollum, what can I say, but that he was a continuation of perfection from The Two Towers. I especially enjoyed how it further explained Smeagol's past, and his finding of The One Ring. Now some quick ratings. Some of these may spoil their appearance in the movie for some, so be warned. Gollum: A Siege of Minas Tirith: A+ The Oathbreakers (Ghost Army): A+ Death of the Witch King: A- Arwen: C Frodo and Sam's "relationship": B Film length: A (will be explained) That is one matter I feel I should address. These books were written in a time when it was completely acceptable for one man to say to another that he loved him, strictly in a platonic way. Leave your homophobic inhibitions outside the theatre, and please do not say lewd comments during what should be rather emotional scenes. The other major source of much moaning and groaning in the theatre is the length of the film. Yes, it is three and a half hours. Yes, that is a long movie. Yes, you knew how long it was when you bought the ticket. No, other people do not want to hear you moan about how long it is. And finally, yes, Peter Jackson stayed as close to the books as possible. The storyline does drag on near the end of the books, so by making the movie similar to the books, Peter Jackson was simply doing his directorial duty. These books mean a lot to a lot of people, and if he had sold them short on what (for many people) are the most influential novels of their lives, he would not be a very good film maker would he. Peter Jackson had an enormous task ahead of him, and he most likely had two main challenges on his mind during production. First, to satisfy the already obsessed LOTR fanbase; second, to captivate the part of the audience who do not live and breathe LOTR. There is a fantastic volume of story to be told on those pages, and much of it has been left out from the movies, leaving only the core events and their inspired emotions. Had Jackson not trimmed them down to where they are now, each movie would easily surpass twelve hours. Easily. It is a minor miracle that Jackson was able to convert such a literary masterpiece from pages to picture, and the audience should be pleased by its creation, not moan every fifteen seconds waiting for it to end. All in all, Return of the King was a flawless finale to a fantastic trilogy. Few trilogies can boast the numbers that LOTR can, and still remain captivating when it comes to it's end. Return of the King is a shoe-in for Best Picture at the Oscars, and will likely sweep the globe in a flurry of well-known and not-so well-known awards. Despite my gripes over minor details and plot alterations (Where's good ol' Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Downs?), I know cinematic perfection when I see it. That is why I gave this film a ten.
10.0~Cannot get better than this priyankamutsuddi Sign in Permalink When I saw LOTR1 I knew this is special. Peter Jackson has done it in the biggest human possible way. The Return of the king was almost like rising from your sits and shouting at Frodo to drop the ring. I am sure nothing is bigger than this movie and I don't think anything will be bigger than this . This is the best movie though it is second most income movie but about satisfaction nothing is more excellent than this. I loved this Trilogy from the bottom of my heart and honestly I want to thank Peter Jackson for such a movie. From Legolas to Aragon to Frodo and Sam and each and every character will be remembered. I am now 18 and when I grow up I want my children to watch and even my grandchildren.
10.0~Professor Tolkien would be proud! JediMasterCheryl Sign in Permalink This movie is wonderful and emotionally stunning! I can hardly wait to see the Extended Edition DVD as the only parts that were glaringly absent to us book readers were the scenes in the Houses of Healing. I would like to see how Eowyn and Faramir finally wind up together. If I have any criticism at all for the series it is the creative liberty that was taken at times. I will never agree with the elves arrival at Helm's Deep or the way in which Faramir was portrayed (although the EE of TTT did go a long way toward redeeming the character's decision). I understand the needs of a movie v. a book, but for those of us who have wanted to see a live action version of this sweeping saga for many years (face it - the Bashki film was incomplete and visual yuck!) - there were a few (but only a few!) disappointments. ROTK does a great job finalizing the story - the scene in the Paths of the Dead was fantastic! The only real regret of the film for me is that Saruman is not given his due and the scouring of the Shire doesn't take place. This leaves the Hobbits with no idea of what Frodo, Sam, Merry ,and Pippin have accomplished for them and gives them no real reason to hold these special fellows in the awe that they deserve...in the books they are given the kudos they deserve because of the way in which they drive back "Sharkey's" forces and reclaim the Shire. The Shire Hobbits have no idea how close they came to losing their beloved homes. A bit disappointing - but the only remedy would have been a 4 hour movie with an intermission (which went out with "Fiddler on the Roof, I think). Anyway, the film itself is beautiful - both visually and emotionally. I am thrilled that the series has reached its end and am glad that so many new people have been exposed to life in Middle Earth - I have been living there in my heart for the last 25 years since I first read "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings". I even created my own character and history years ago when we played Dungeons and Dragons in high school...I am Anadorn of Gondor - the hidden sister of a hero in the books! Silly, I know, but we had so much fun back then! I believe that Professor Tolkien would have enjoyed Mr. Jackson's rendition and would have cried, along with the rest of us, at the final parting of Sam and Frodo. I thank God that JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson were put on earth in my lifetime and that my fondest wish - to see "The Lord of Rings" become a live-action film in my lifetime - has been realized. My life will never be the same... Anadorn of Gondor
10.0~This 200-minute long film is as lean, mean, and keen as it needs to be.. spartan_gamemaniac Sign in Permalink The final installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a make-or-break preposition. After building up so much expectation and anticipation amongst hardcore Tolkien fans with the first two episodes, whether New Zealand director Peter Jackson could finish them wih necessary flourish remained to be seen. If Return of the King failed, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, celebrated for its detail and energy, would end up being as disappointing as the final stage of The Matrix films. In its original version, this 200-minute long film is as lean, mean, and keen as it needs to be to tie up all the loose plots lines. Return of the King necessarily has many, many endings but that is its purpose. Newcomers and non-fans will not be able to see Return of the King as a stand-alone feature, as there is very little exposition (even less here than in the previous The Two Towers). Elijah Wood's painful adventure as Frodo, the ring bearer, finally comes to a close but not after the most harrowing threat yet (those frightened of spiders be warned). Gollum, the trilogy's most fascinating character, made actor Andy Serkis a household name. Released in a year full of cinematic disappointments, Return of the King has a giddy perfection about it. Its success made The Lord of the Rings series a new benchmark of excellence that future trilogies, sequels, and prequels must try to match or surpass. As a three-part film, The Lord of the Rings can transport viewers effortlessly to other lands where heroism, love and sacrifice make perfect sense.
10.0~I Don't Want it to End! godjunior71 Sign in Permalink I've just gone to see The Return of the King today. After waiting for quite a long time freezing my buttocks in the cold outside the theater (this was a Saturday morning) with over a hundred other people, I finally got in and got a great seat (A Note: Stadium Seating is the only way to really experience this movie). When the tedious ads and previews finally ended, the Newline logo screened and the movie began. Nearly 3 and a half hours later, I walked out of the cinema with tears in my eyes. I cried because the film was better than I could have hoped it to be, I cried because it was the most emotionally stirring piece I have ever seen in a theater, but most of all, I cried because the film symbolized the end of this wonderful and unforgettable tale that will be remembered for generations and cherished. After a delightfully frightening opening flashback of Smeagol's transformation into Gollum, the film picks up where we left Frodo and Sam, in Ithilien, nearing Mordor. The atmosphere here is notably more tense and frightening than it was in The Two Towers, with an undeniable sense of fear and dread lurking up the road. It's scary, but attractive, and drew me right in. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Helm's Deep victory, Aragorn, Theoden, Gandalf, and co. are partying in Edoras. An unexpected and deadly twist of events though sends Gandalf and Pippin riding to Minas Tirith, the citadel of Gondor, and an absolutely mind blowing, enchanting, and terrific setpiece. There they meet the steward Denethor, who has gone mad over the loss of Boromir and has condemned his other son Faramir to protecting Osgiliath, which is under horrific attack by battalions of orcs. From this point, while the armies of Rohan gather in the North and Aragorn sets out on a terrifying test to claim his position as the king of men (hence the title), Middle Earth prepares for what Gandalf accurately calls, "The Great Battle of our Time". This of course, is The Battle of Pelennor Fields, which like Peter Jackson said, dwarfs Helm's Deep in scale and excitement. Watching 200000 Orcs, Elephants, Southrons, Trolls, Siege Towers, Wargs, and more besiege the city in what has to be the most spectacular battle scene ever filmed is indescribable. However, the real power of the battle really lies in the feeling behind it. In Helm's Deep, despite the bad odds, there was always a hopeful feeling that Rohan would win. Throughout much of Pelennor Fields, there is a feeling of utter despair, terror, and courage. It never becomes tiresome, is shot brilliantly, and will stay in your mind for days. Another important thing to mention is the treatment of Frodo and Sam, with their journey to Mordor. Since a lot of the second book was saved for Return of the King, the two hobbits had a lot of ground and places to cover. THankfully, they receive much more screen time here than they did in THe Two Towers, and in truly fantastic (and scary) places. The character of Sam emerges as a true hero and friend in this final chapter, and Sean Astin gives the preformance of his career. Andy Serkis becomes much less funny and pitiful, and more vile and hatable as Gollum, in an absolutely fantastic role. Finally, Elijah Wood gives a final heart breaking and admirable preformance as Frodo, now more hurt and tortured than ever. Their journey is the real center of the movie; the bond between Frodo and Sam, their strength and determination. The ending for the film couldn't have been more satisfying. Diehard fans of the book may criticize Peter Jackson for changing it a little, but it really suits the film perfectly. If you loved the other movies, I guarantee you will have tears in your eyes by the time the first credit rolls. Kudos for Jackson, an absolute genius and wizard of a filmmaker for bringing this to screen in such splendor and glory. The acting here is beyond words. Like I said earlier, Sam was my favorite character, but it was hard to choose. Viggo Mortensen made a wonderfully valiant Aragorn here, Sir Ian McKellen still is Gandalf, and Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies are once again hilariously competivite but touchingly close in their friendship as Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf. Miranda Otto really impressed me here as Eowyn, who trades in her royal robes for armor and sword here. I'd always liked Billy Boyd (who can really sing!) and Dominic Monhagan as Pippin and Merry, but this was their moment of triumph. The two of them were just wonderful. David Wenham and John Noble were fantastic as the noble Faramir and the crazed Denethor. Their tear-jerking relationship was outstanding and so sad. They were great. Finally, the Orcs themselves rise from scare-inducing baddies to truly brutal and horrible villains (their commander makes the Uruk-Hai look like Oompa Loompas). They even turn the term "Release the prisoners!" into a threat. Just wait and see. One of the greates parts of the movie is the score. It is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo much better than those of the other films, which is saying a lot because both of the first two had fantastic soundtracks. My favorite score points: Gandalf and Pippin arriving in Minas Tirith, Frodo and Sam climbing Mount Doom, the Finale, the classic Rohan theme, and the score for the heart-breaking last scene in the film. If Howard Shore doesn't win Best Original Score, the Academy will have a lot of hate mail to read. People say that Mystic River or Cold Mountain will win Best Picture. Not only do I think that they won't but I think they don't deserve it. As much as I liked Mystic River, it did not come close to the marvelry (battles aside) and emotion expressed in Return of the King. And as for Cold Mountain (ugghh) Nicole Kidman may be an Oscar favorite as the genre of the film, but the lack of originality and emotion of the film should have knocked it off the nominee list. This is truly the film of the year. For something you will remember as more than a film you saw at the cinema, get your butt down to the cinema and see The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King jboothmillard Sign in Permalink The third and final part of J.R.R. Tolkien's most celebrated trilogy is by far the best of the three films. Oscar winning director Peter Jackson has touched hearts and created many emotions in this outstanding ending to the film. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are near to Mordor, but are heading for danger by the devilish Gollum/Sméagol (Andy Serkis), the most convincing CGI character in film. White wizard Gandalf (BAFTA nominated Sir Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have found Merry (Dominic Monaghan, now in TV's Lost) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) and are all preparing for war against Mordors many terrifying Orcs and other beasts. I can admit the ending does drag on with teary moments, but it still manages to make me cry. Also starring Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Bernard Hill as Theoden, Sir Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins and Sean Bean as Boromir (flashback), no Sir Christopher Lee (at least not in the cinema version). This film won 11 well deserved Academy Awards (all nominated), equalling Ben-Hur and Titanic. These were Best Sound Mixing, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music for the powerful score by Howard Shore, Best Song for Annie Lennox's fantastic "Into the West" (also won the Golden Globe), Best Visual Effects, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for the Audience Award, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it won the Golden Globes (all nominated) for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Cate Blanchett was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Sir Ian McKellen was number 4 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actors, the film was number 19 on The Ultimate Film, and as part of the trilogy, all three films were number 11 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Outstanding!
10.0~Ending to the best series there was, the best series there is and the best series there ever will be veselva6 Sign in Permalink Great finale that does justice to this masterpiece. It is difficult to find a single flaw in the whole series and the last movie in the trilogy is no different - from exceptional actor's performance, throughout the wonderfully made environment, to the heart moving story-line (including the finale). I think Tolkien would love this, just as every movie lover does. Thank you Peter Jackson for making this happen.
10.0~Too good for words chris-3056 Sign in Permalink Well, this is truly a magnificent film beyond all others. The screenplay is excellent; the music emotional where it matters, masterfully blasting when the fighting is at its best, and soothing in many places; and the Special effects breathtaking, especially, it must be said, Gollum and the mûmakil. Certain liberties are taken with the books that will be disliked by purists but this does not exactly detract from an excellent film - I think all would agree that, for once, we cannot say 'They could have extended the time the film goes on for to add in (INSERT SCENE),' and if we did say that then there's always the even better extended edition. As I mentioned, Gollum is masterfully created and the role of Serkis was amazing. The CG character created was one that was believable, won sympathy even when you knew he deserved none, and had a raw sense of being lost that man characters don't have. The lavish detail was immense, if you've read the 'Art of the RotK' you'll know that in fact they made so much detail meticulously in the workshops, including such things as an orc brazier in Cirith Ungol - that gets all of about 2 seconds screen time obscured by a mass of fighting orcs - and this in itself shows a certain dedication to the film. Jackson was not in this for money, creating a film with a paltry budget to be forgotten in a week or two - he wanted his films to be special and boy has he succeeded. My only negative on this is that the end is toooo long. It is, hypothetically speaking, the end of an 11 hour epic but for people in the cinema 30 minutes of weddings, celebration, travelling home and reunions is too much to bear, especially after the first 3 hours consisted of battles of such magnitude. However, if you've read the book, you'll think it was too short and they needed the Scouring of the Shire... However, the positives outweigh the negatives and overall this film deserves a place at the very pinnacle of film history.
10.0~i laughed, i cried, i cheered bookworm_anna Sign in Permalink I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Loved it. It was better than I ever thought, or hoped it could be. I went to a midnight showing and even though I got home at 4am and had class at 9, it was totally worth it. There is nothing like going to a midnight showing because you know the only people crazy enough to be there are the true fans. I don't usually like cheering at the movies, but last night I was clapping and cheering along with everyone else. and I'm not ashamed to say I used up five tissues. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole 3 and a half hours and I would have gladly sat for more. I hope Peter Jackson and the rest of the crew get recognized for all their hard work.
10.0~My favorite sequel. antoniomlconde Sign in Permalink I have seen The Lord of the Rings several times. Which of the three is the best? Are the first two, only because I know that there is still much to see. J. R. R. Tolkien was a genius of literature. He had a magnificent imagination, Middle Earth is an invention of genius, where nothing was left to chance. To adapt to The movie is fantastic, Peter Jackson did a great job, where everything is perfect. To adapt to The movie is fantastic, Peter Jackson did a great job, where everything is perfect. The responsibility of Peter Jackson to make these movies was great, he was to adapt a great work of fiction for the screen, but did well.
10.0~You don't want to miss this! pandora_20002 Sign in Permalink Lord of the ring: Return of the king is everything that you would expect it to be and more. I know it's three hours long but I can tell you that you won't even notice the time after the movie starts. Arragon and Leglas will keep you wanting more and Frodo and Sam will make you cry. The action sequences will keep you on the edge of your seat. And you can't go wrong with a good sword fight. Something they keep giving you in this movie
10.0~More then excellence it's beyond excellence!!!!!!! KGRIFFIN7 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, is without a doubt a MASTERPIECE!!!!!! Of course, the whole trilogy is MASTERPIECE!!!!! But The Return of the King is the best movie I've ever seen!!!!!!!!! I've seen The Return of the King in the theater Many, Many times already and plan to go back and see it again and again!!! So, as you can probably guess I can't wait until The Return of the King the DVD is available to buy! I believe that the theatrical version will be available on or around May 25. And I will then buy the theatrical version. But when the Extended Edition also becomes available I plan to buy that as well. I do already have in my possession both the theatrical versions and the Extended editions of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. Both EXCELLENCE MASTERFUL movies in thier own right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10.0~Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! captain_jacksparrow653 Sign in Permalink All I can say is WOW! Definitely the best of the trilogy! I mean, The Fellowship of the Ring was amazing when I first saw it. When my mom bought me The Two Towers, I was so excited! When she got me The Return of the King, I was ecstatic! My friend had taken me to see it in theaters.... it was all together just too awesome! "These peasants are broken, you have to get some new ones!" Hahaha!Yea, Holly! Yeah, don't ask, my friends and I were way weird on the ride home. I'm pretty sure my dad was scared of us at that point! Heeheehee! Oh well, it was all worth it! Wootah!
5.0~is everybody crazy? betsywetsy Sign in Permalink I still don't like these films, but this was the least intolerable of the three. I think it had the greatest departures from the books in plot, but was perhaps the closest to the books in meaning. I'm not even talking about all the characters and events left out; there's lots of stuff here that never happened in the book. The acting is sometimes painful. Frodo and Sam are particularly given to intervals of mawkishness. Gimli is shamefully used for comic relief. The dialogue's just horrible; exposition is awkward ("A diversion!") - I suspect the actors are giving the director what he's asked for, it's the director and writers I question. Anyway, the adults come out okay except Eomer, reduced to mere grimacing in the background. It's the little people who suffer. Visuals are often not to my taste, but are impressive. Frodo always glows. Everything hobbity is very golden-lit and twinkly and twee - I think that's the worst setting mistake. Hobbits should be those we identify with most closely, not those we're distanced from. Minas Tirith is barely glimpsed before it's overrun by the Goths and Visigoths; Edoras outshines it. I don't like the battle scenes. Cuts to show the sea of Orcs menacing a small city of troop of Men are unimpressive after so many repetitions, and the fighting scenes are very rapidly cut and look kinda undercranked and unfocussed, especially when using lots of CG troops. Necessary perhaps, but it still looks bad. What was right? They made a great scene of the lighting of the signal fires, and the relay from hill to hill, though it went on too long. The songs were good. The human kings rallying their troops to hopeless battles were actually magnificent. Gandalf was less the remote magician and more the humanized power than in the first two movies. The tone is more epic than in the first two installments - they seemed to use scale of battles and scale of scenery as a substitute for theme and pace. ROTK didn't make me look at my watch nearly as much as FOTR and TTT. And there's more Viggo, whom I love, but he may not be quite as good. *sigh* Anyway, it's still pretty crummy. Gak! Also, I think this one would be _very_ hard to understand without having read the books or seen the first two - I wished I'd refreshed my memory of the previous movie before watching this.
8.0~"Star Wars" for the Pepsi Generation ween-3 Sign in Permalink Considering that sword and sorcerer movies ain't my usual cup o' tea...gotta hand it to Peter Jackson and the extraordinary effects crew for "King" and the first 2 of the "Ring" series. The third installment was a little long on the battle scenes for my taste but the sound, CGI and animation (in particular, Andy Serkis' Gollum) was just terrific. Sure, the acting is a bit overwrought, but hey...it is what it is...(this ain't "Hamlet")...and Ian McKellan could read the phone book and still rock the joint, anyway. Newbie Peter Jackson is pretty much a lock to win the Oscar for direction...the trilogy was a monumental effort and he's earned the accolade. The tech awards are a no-brainer...this is the state of the art in the year of our "Lord" 2003. And ya gotta figure that Billy Crystal is gonna come out dressed as either Gollum or a hobbit on the February Oscar telecast.
9.0~Brilliancy messed up, Extended Edition to the rescue? Ettepet Sign in Permalink What should have been the peak of the trilogy got butchered (on the cutting floor?), and left me with mixed feelings. Some people here already summed it up: *SPOILERS* * The opening scene (Deagol - Smeagol) should have been part of TTT, as it is unfitting for this late stage in the story. * 'The Voice of Saruman' should not have been cut. * Too many things left unexplained, like Denethors behaviour. * The lighting of the Beacons took too much time. * Ill-pacing of the movie in general. * The battle in front of Minas Tirith should have been in a dark(er) setting, just like in the book. And it should have appeared to last (much) longer, as it did in the book. Now it feels rushed. * Frodo and Sams journey through Mordor should have taken more (screen) time. * Viggo Mortensen's performance at Aragorns crowning looked to be very poor. A great waste, because he had been doing so well before. * The movie should have ended with the crowning scene, and several farewells, preferably mixed with naration (showing in short images the future of each main character). The current endless endings if anywhere belong in the Extended Edition. That said, I think this movie has at least 1 1/2 hours of brilliant stuff in it. The climbing of the stairs, and the preceding departure of the witch-king from his castle are probably my favorite scenes. Hopefully the Extended Edition will fix many of its flaws, as I rate ROTK well below the first two installments.
9.0~A great film, but something is not quite right Barky44 Sign in Permalink The final episode of Peter Jackson's telling of the JRR Tolkien classic comes to screen. Return of the King is the big wrap-up to this landmark project. The filmmakers have done an excellent job bringing this "unfilmable" project to screen. As always, they deserve kudos for such a beautifully crafter work. From the set designs to the costumes to the scenery, the CGI, special effects, sound, all of these elements are Oscar-worthy and far surpass anything ever shown on screen. The performances, too, are stellar. Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Andy Serkis are all excellent. Even the supporting cast gives it their all. It is a shame Christopher Lee didn't make the final cut, but alas, it wasn't meant to be. Even with all these kudos, this film still has problems. The sequence with the Palantir in Edoras is very silly, I have heard others call it the "Glowing Bowling Ball of Doom". Rather sloppy for the quality the filmmakers have shown to date. And the ghost army is way too ... phosphorous and Disney-like. But beyond various technical flaws, the real problem is both the rush to the ending, and the drawn-out portion after the ending. For the former, we have the tense lead-up to the great Battle of the Pellenor Fields, which by itself is unlike anything ever put on film before. We have Frodo and Sam facing great dangers all by themselves. Then, suddenly, Frodo and Sam are back on track, the battle is over, and we rush right along to the climax of the film. That whole portion is simply rushed right along. So then we have the Big Finale ... and fifteen more minutes of movie (at least). Depending on how you count, there are five or six endings of the film. Here, unlike anywhere else, the writers have actually been too faithful to JRR Tolkien. His books also end (or not) in this fashion, and that is acceptable in a book, but not in a movie. The multiple endings simply drag us along to collapse. PJ should have kept some of that footage for a future DVD release. Even with these flaws, I have a hard time grading this movie poorly. I am, after all, a huge fan of LOTR and PJ. So I am cutting him some slack, and give the film 9 out of 10.
10.0~The best part of the best trilogy EVER made! Excellent!! arielpip Sign in Permalink This film is so brilliant i wasn't embarassed to cry, the effects are outstanding, and by far the most amazing I've ever seen. If people want to say that this film is "nothing like the book" then i challenge them to do it any better, the film is the best it can be to stay true to the book, Ok so bits were in a different order at times but this kept it more interesting for those who have read it, the acting quality was superb! Viggo Mortensen was amazing! and Sir Ian MCkellen was perfectly cast, as for Orlando Bloom well he's already made his mark on the world.
10.0~Triumphant Ending! audreysaucerman Sign in Permalink I may be biased because I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan, but I just loved "The Return of the King." My favorite is still, of course, "The Fellowship of the Ring," but Peter Jackson was certainly able to tie the movies together well with the third and last part of the "Lord of The Rings." Of course, this movie will be part of my purchased collection.
8.0~Profound Satisfaction. orchidthief Sign in Permalink A great, great movie. This is, as a trilogy, the greatest recreation made upon a story. A well known story if you happen to be an anglo-saxon. A deeply cherished story if you ever happened to be a child. Every single boy who was ever told about Tolkien's world fell in love with it. This is an spread-up truth. We all guys love fantasies and portrayed worlds of adventure. Yet, when we were put against one man's recreation of that very same fantasies we all had the same doubts: Is Peter Jackson capable of portraying my own and deep imaginary picture of this huge universe? Is he truly capable of filming an overwhelming picture that could reach beyond levels of my own already beyond-like experience? Me myself read the book too many years ago to have an objective judgement about the story. I was only able to tell my friends that if there was a man capable of taking the challenge of making a movie about - and only about - The Lord of the Rings there were only two possible outcomes: 1) A perfectly horrible movie, where all the characters would have ended being badly played, and the whole story would have been minimized to a circumstancial therefore stupid excuse for a film. Or... 2) A tremendous and breathtaking classic, where everything had to be in its right place, all the actors should believe their roles and obviously nothing could be doubtful or even mediocrelly portrayed. This is the picture i watched. Three years ago, when i first went into a theatre and payed a lot of money to watch The Fellowship of the Ring i was thinking about all this. When i got out, i was tremendously satisfied. In the very same way i am now. Peter Jackson managed his way out (and in) of this great novel. He changed a few truly complicated things (when it comes to making a movie) yet he stayed entirely loyal to the very and most important elements of the story he was portraying: Nothing in anyone of the three pictures is really worthy of bashing. (Except, maybe, the 20 minutes he took to end the work of his life) The trilogy as a whole is almost perfect and he, as well as the entire cast, and especially the screenplay writer and the cinematographer, have made the greatest epical/adventure film the world has ever been able to watch. I hardly believe anyone would ever be able to create a picture like this. It took several years for them to achieve it, and there was no film-maker so in love with his story like Peter Jackson was when he first started to make his dream come true. Congrats to everyone that loved this movie, and congrats to the guys that believed in this project, as well to the guys that made it happen. A lot of people got happier even when the real world is breaking down even worse than the Middle Earth did.
10.0~couldn't be better vjman_in Sign in Permalink truly speaking, return of the king is in fact the best movie ever till date. Inspite of all the talks that the book doesn't really depict the story totally, i think the war scenes are one among the best ever. I believe even tolkien couldn't have picturised them as good as peter jackson. You could say peter jackson got better than him. One could see his brilliance in using the special effects. There was always a possibility of over using the special effects, but jackson never let special effects get in the way of the story. They were very apt in supporting the story. A must watch fairy tale for every adult who likes movies.
10.0~Perfection swaquilino Sign in Permalink well what can i say, this has to be best movie ever made. the scene peter jackson changed is very nice done. those "tolkien purists" shouldn't even complain, cause it's SIMPLY impossible to make a movie the same as the book. get a life or something. i've also read everything of tolkien, but why would you hate on a movie just because some detail isn't in the movie!!!! just like you(purists)can make a movie like that lol. i would rate this movie a 10+ and the whole triology also a 10+
10.0~Phenomenal!!! almuktadirkhan Sign in Permalink Deserves all the Oscars it got. It's a masterpiece.
10.0~The completion of a masterpiece arwel Sign in Permalink Two years ago, after I saw Fellowship of the Ring I told some friends that if I died before Christmas 2003 I would be _very_ annoyed! Thankfully I'm still here, and I'm extremely happy to have seen the completion of Peter Jackson's masterpiece -- this is a work of genius, both in the direction and the production, and all praise to the executives of New Line Cinema for having the guts to bet the company on this project -- see, virtue is rewarded! If Peter Jackson doesn't get the best director Oscar and Best Picture, then it will only prove that the members of AMPAS are a bunch of Philistines who don't recognise genius when they see it. While it's rather invidious to select one out of the cast, Sean Astin's performance as Sam was remarkable, and I have to confess that even this hard-hearted middle-aged viewer was surreptitiously dabbing tears out of his eyes at several points in the movie.
10.0~Brilliant doesn't begin to describe it TomParr Sign in Permalink What can I say? This is the most wonderful film ever made. Tolkien's story cannot be better of course, but the way Jackson presents it is so spectacular that it was beyond all expectations. I consider myself very lucky going to see it on the day it opened here in England and am going to go again on Sunday. See it.
10.0~totally loved it!! koos_junkloos Sign in Permalink i was a little bit critical before the beginning of the movie... i totally loved the the book of j.r.r. Tolkien(read it twice) The two towers, was a little bit disapointed in my opinion., but this part was TOTALLY great... Best part of the trilogy!! and that is something VERY special... U all know, mostly part 2 or even 3 are much worse, than the original.. but this time... wow, sometimes it was really breath taking (and that really happens very rarely for me).... i don't want to hype this movie... because if u expect to much of a movie.. it always disappoints you. But for me, clearly 10 out of 10, even better than kill bill(and that's worth something imo)
10.0~The perfect conclusion to the one of a kind epic trilogy. Ice_Queen19 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one of the best movies of 2003, if not in history of adventure movies. This movie was filled with numerous battles sequences and contained more dialogue than the first two movies. Some critics believe this dragged on the ending, however, it was crucial for the conclusion of the trilogy since it doesn't leave any loose ends. Personally, I'd rather have a long ending than be left hanging and compelled to wonder at after the movie is over (although with this movie, it wouldn't have mattered since I've read the books by J.R.R. Tolkein). Unlike the ending to the Matrix trilogy, Matrix Revolutions, this movie has set raised the standards of epic movies and most likely, we will never again be able to have such an experience as with the Lord of the Rings series. Such scenes as the battle scene with Frodo and the Spider, as well as the attack on Mordor will leave many breathless. Overall rating 9.8/10
7.0~What the heck is LOTR doing on the list? sxjTheFirst Sign in Permalink I asked myself "What the heck (actually ***k) this movie is doing here in the list of Top 250 movies of all time?". But hey this is a list decided on votes and popularity nothing to do with the quality of the film I bet as time continues its inexorable march and the movie isn't that fresh in viewers' minds it wouldn't be rated this high...but then you never know popular taste is so unpredictable. An average movie with nothing deep or thought-provoking about it. Nice special effects and scenery though. A movie of the time a blockbuster but certainly not a great one. I was very bored when I saw this movie. What the movie has going for it is the LOTR enthusiasts like Trekkies they watch/buy anything that has to to with the movie and the cult around it. I know a guy who works in the California branch of my office who has the entire set of LOTR characters as small figurines on his desk ---Insert Rolling of Eyes icon here---!!! My rating is 4 of 10
9.0~Epic Saga nitingite Sign in Permalink A story line which will keep you engaged for the whole duration and takes you on a ride of imagination. The cinematography , direction , visual and special effects, etc etc...everything just makes you live each and ever y moment of the Film.
10.0~Awesome moviebuff316 Sign in Permalink I give it a 10 because its a perfect ending to a perfect story..I think that the very end in which is after the battles is over done. Otherwise it was a very good movie. Very good story, and battle scenes. It has a little of everything.
10.0~ALL-POWERFUL FINALE! byarger Sign in Permalink As a long-time Tolkien LOTR fan and almost annual reader of the trilogy, I was left drained of, and at the same time overflowing with emotion, by the Return of the King. Nothing I have ever experienced in my 50 years of movie-going prepared me for the masterpiece Peter Jackson gave us. Jackson really did it - he transcended all that Tolkien gave us in that immense world of Middle Earth and placed it on the screen for all to revel in. From Gandalf to Gollum, the characters in the movie leapt from the screen into our hearts. If you didn't spend the last thirty minutes with a giant lump in your throat and tears welling up in your eyes, then you shouldn't have bothered to get out of bed, let alone go to see this movie. This film is no longer entertainment - it is art.
10.0~Best of the LOTR Trilogy, an Instant Classic nhawdon Sign in Permalink This movie was simply fantastic. Action packed, suspenseful, and yet still enchanting. Acting in the movie is terrific, especially from McKellen and Mortenson. Peter Jackson reached new heights with this masterpiece, completely deserving the best picture Oscar. The plot follows the continuing adventures of the disbanded Fellowship of the Ring, in their quest to destroy the powerful One Ring. Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, and their guide Gollum are on a quest to the Cracks of Doom, while the rest of the Fellowship is preparing for war with Sauron (forger of the One Ring) and his soldiers. It this complex plot that is part of the reason that this film is so good. The CGI is breathtaking, especially for 2003. Everything in the movie looks lifelike. The cinematography, in the movie is astonishing and sweeps one off of one's feet. Battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed, intense and high-octane. I know I don't seem too exited about this movie, but this movie is terrific. If you haven't seen this movie, see it. It is a classic, and one of the best films out there.
7.0~The Hobbits bore me Shink Sign in Permalink When I left the movie theater, I felt somehow underwhelmed. I couldn't quite put my finger on why, but I was disappointed. Was it because I was too excited to see the movie? Was it because the action sequences were similar to Two Towers? Was it because the movie was too long? Was it because the movie just wasn't that great? I just wasn't sure. Then, after reading a review, I realized why I felt that this movie wasn't as entertaining as the Two Towers. HOBBITS! For whatever reason, the quest of the Hobbits is fairly boring to me. I enjoyed following the plights of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas much more than of Frodo and the Ring of Power. That being said, I gave this movie a 7/10 rating. It's definitely above average, but not nearly as entertaining as the other huge blockbuster I couldn't wait to see this year (Pirates of the Carribean). If you've watched the first two movies, then definitely check this one out. If you are really into the plight of the Hobbits, then you won't be disappointed. If you are just in love with Orlando Bloom, you might want to skip it as he (and the rest of the non-hobbits) gets much less screen time than in the Two Towers.
10.0~The great film saga of our time. sniffle_wiffle Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings is without doubt the most epic and staggering film undertaking of all time. How Peter Jackson pulled it off I will never know, maybe he used one of Gandalf's enchantments! Rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment, every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. From the writing, to the production crew, to the acting, to the scenery,to the music (oh god I love the music)and just everybody's determination to pull this near impossible feat off, even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. Never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. Peter Jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune, (Viggo Mortensens' last minute replacement says it all), it was as if the spirit of Tolkien himself was guiding it along. As I see this as one whole movie, I won't be reviewing just 'The Return of the King'. I saw the first film 'The Fellowhip of the Ring' when I was 12, and I'm 21 now and I still haven't been more absorbed by a movie in the cinema and I doubt I ever will. The transition from the innocence and lightness of the Shire at the start to the dark epic of the quest later is nothing short of brilliant. I think 'Fellowship' is my favourite of the three, it goes through the most development and felt the most satisfying. The whole mines of Moria sequence is my standout moment of the entire trilogy. To the battle with the cave troll and the escape from the balrog, it is exhilarating, involving and most of all - emotional. 'The Two Towers' has the hardest task of being the middle film, but it more than rises to the challenge. It drops you straight into the action and doesn't hold up. The Rohan sequences are the best bits of the film, culminating in the battle of helms deep which to me is the most personal and intense battle of the trilogy. The creation of Gollum was revolutionary, through CGI and motion capture never has a computerised character seemed so real. 'The Return of the King' delivers the emotional finale we all hoped it would. I remember sitting in the cinema hearing all sorts of sobbing all around me during the climax on mount doom. There are so many stand-out moments in this movie but the one I will mention is the charge of the Rohirrim. This scene actually pushed me to tears on first viewing, not because it was sad but because it was so... awesome. I was so happy when this film won 11 Oscars, it more than deserved it, I was hoping it would win more than 11 but oh well. Any gripes I have for the trilogy, would be the portrayal of its big bad Sauron, and considering that Sauron is the centre of 'The Lord of the Rings' this is definitely a problem. If there was one thing from the books that is unfilmable it is definitely Sauron. How do you portray a villain that hardly appears and any descriptions of him there are, are so vague and surreal? Is Sauron a big flaming eye or did he have a physical form? This is never made clear in the books and poses a big obstacle for film, where the audience needs to see their villain. Peter Jackson and co do the best they can with the material, and chose to literally portray Sauron as the big flaming eye. However this is not enough to satisfy, especially during the climax of 'Return of the King' where the dark lord is basically a lighthouse! The films make the mistake of bigging Sauron up through the films, and ultimately it fizzles out by the end which is a real shame. As you can tell from what I have said, I love 'The Lord of the Rings', and I would say it is my favourite film of all time. No other film has moved me as much as this and given me so many different emotions from fear, to sadness to laughter. I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else playing the characters, it was if they were made for them. The actors all generally had a special relationship with one another and with Peter Jackson (just watch the extras), and that what you are watching on screen is genuine. It was almost to the point that the actors weren't working so hard out of professionalism but out of love and devotion to Mr.Jackson. Hardly any other films can claim they had this kind of magic behind the camera. Honourable mentions will be given to Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Elijah Wood as Frodo, I felt these three literally became the characters they were playing, but of course there are countless others to mention but I don't have time. Howard Shore's score is possibly the best movie score ever, and the films would be nothing without it. Ultimately say what you will hardcore Tolkien fans about the films, you cannot deny that they did so much for Tolkiens' greatest work and made it one of the most recognisable stories in the world. If you have somehow not seen these films, first of all slap yourself and secondly go buy the extended editions as these are the true versions of the films and include many great scenes that were cut - especially 'The Return of the King' which had many vital scenes cut aka. Saruman's last hoorah and Gandalf confronting the Witch King. Peter Jackson I salute you, and New Zealand!
9.0~complicated fahimtahmid Sign in Permalink The culmination of nearly 10 years' work and conclusion to Peter Jackson's epic trilogy based on the timeless J.R.R. Tolkien classic, "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" presents the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil fighting for control of the future of Middle-earth. Hobbits Frodo and Sam reach Mordor in their quest to destroy the 'one ring', while Aragorn leads the forces of good against Sauron's evil army at the stone city of Minas Tirith.
10.0~Best film I have ever had the grace to view! berbcd Sign in Permalink This movie tops off what I as a fantasy lover have always dreamed of seeing. A world class true fantasy movie. This has to be one of the best movies I have seen in recent memory. The plot, story line, and Peter Jacksons vision were amazing. Again if you want to see a movie with heart, passion, determination, soul. Then this is one that I would recommend! A++
7.0~slightly disappointed sscsgh Sign in Permalink Perhaps it was because I wasn't in the best of moods prior to watching the film but I was slightly disappointed with the final part of LotR. I don't think that the makers have done anything differently in style or tone to the first two and I'm sure it is their equal. I think I possibly have Rings fatigue, all the weighty speeches, ham-fisted attempts at comic moments, and truly epic battle scenes have become a bit done for me. I want to stress I still liked the film and maybe if I watch it again my opinion will change. Three hours+ passed really quite quickly, which is always a good sign, and I think it would be spurious to criticise it for going on a bit too long at the end as it is based on a book, loads was cut out from the end as it was and it was necessary to show most of those scenes for narrative closure. The world is a better place for having this trilogy in existence but weighing in over 9 hours long proved just a touch long for this particularly viewer.
10.0~Beyond epic! PetrosZoric Sign in Permalink I'm just gonna say: A movie worth watching for a lifetime! This epic adventure is everything what every fan of such genre wants to see. Even after almost 20 ears, it's still watchable. It's even better. Why? Because the movie has the quality in every aspect. That was a time when special effects were not that much immportant, it was all about story teling, directing, acting, and living the movie. That's something what nowadays movies lack. Back then, they used dolls and costumes. And that, my friends, was much much better than special effect. Because it feels so real. For a moment you forget the fact that this is just a a movie. Like I said before, it feels so real. And I really miss those times. Times, when making money from movie was not number one priorety. But to entertain the audience throughout the world. :-)
10.0~Wonderful finale, sweeping emotions and action manalone923 Sign in Permalink Where do I start? Those who have already seen this movie don't need a review, and those who haven't will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. So, I'll just say how this movie personally affected me, as a fan of the books and of movies in general. I absolutely loved the original film, Fellowship of the Ring, and did enjoy the Two Towers, though not as much. I loved the emotion of the original (subtle scenes like Frodo's long decision-making boatside scene at the end), and found that the Two Towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters' feelings into the background. But this makes sense, as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. Return of the King, however, is just simply fantastic. I try to avoid statements like "gets everything right", and "I enjoyed every minute of it", but in this case, it's true. I was so moved at the presentation of this film that I couldn't help getting misty at the end, despite knowing exactly what would happen (based on the books of course). I credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music (Annie Lennox's moving "Into the West" is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the film's themes). And also, I couldn't help being moved knowing that it was now all over, and there will probably never be another Lord of the Rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime (and rightfully so). I just felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends. The movie, although beginning with an important flashback, begins immediately where the second film concluded, and every character has a conclusion. The main part of this movie that I loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchanged; the main characters have their own moments of screen time and good dialogue, from Gandalf telling Pippin what beautiful peace awaits him if he should die in battle, to Sam heroically carrying an exhausted Frodo on his own shoulders through sheer determination. It's all done well, and it takes its time to do it, which I wouldn't have any other way. Whereas Fellowship of the Ring dealt more in emotion and character development and the Two Towers was more hurried and action packed, I was delighted to see that return of the King found a perfect balance between the two and devotes ample time to both. The battle scenes are the grandest in scope and awe, and the highs and lows of sheer emotion are quite gracefully handled as well. And when everything is said and done and the battles are over, there's still a journey home for some of the characters and a good amount of movie left to enjoy. But everything moves along so smoothly, it's sometimes easy to forget that it's a 3 hour and fifteen minute ride. If there isn't action going on, there are scenes of pending action or drama at an almost nonstop rate, making sure that there's something to stop even the most restless from becoming bored. If for some reason you've chosen my review out of the many available, let me at the very least leave you with this, and it will hopefully help you to decide to see it if you haven't yet: As the finale of a trilogy, this is the masterstroke that ties everything together and is successful on a multitude of levels. It's action packed and stirringly heartfelt at the same time. And finally, from someone who loves the books, I can say that although some omissions were made, the story doesn't falter as a result and the film as a whole was handled in about the most graceful, pleasing way I can imagine. It is, quite honestly, a cinematic masterpiece and a major accomplishment. I left teary eyed, happy for having been thrilled for more than 3 hours, and also quite sad that I don't have another of these films to look forward to.
9.0~great movie with a long ending deathrob Sign in Permalink I really liked the movie, but the end was just to long, i wanted to leave for the last 35 minutes, i know they wanted to tell the story true, but i would have rather seen more in depth action scenes than the ending being dragged out, i'll get it on dvd, but when it gets to the end im not watching it again. im sure ill get flamed for saying that.
10.0~BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!! Eowyn1 Sign in Permalink I thought that this was by far the best movie that i have ever seen in my life. it was soo good. everything just made it sooo good. the acting, the cinematography, music, costumes, screenplay, direction, sets, everything was just beyond marvelous. i think that it is a great movie and if u haven't seen it yet then u are missing out on something sooo greeat. so go see if u haven't i think that though it cuts out many things from the books it is still sooooo great. i loved it.
10.0~The best trilogy of all time. cutekatty-57093 Sign in Permalink I can't describe this feeling I get when I watch Lord of the Rings.I must have watched these movies for more than 100 times but I would still watch them all tomorrow and not feel bored. The setting, the plot ( thank you J.R.R Tolkien!) , characters and the atmosphere of Middle-Earth and everything in Return of the King and the other two movies are just perfect. Even after 15 years, this trilogy has succeeded by staying as one of the highest grossing movies of all time. I would not need comparing this perfection to other movies. LotR stays as the most successful movie in the theater-history. My conclusion is that Lord of the Rings is by far the best trilogy that has ever been created, and I don't think there will be any other trilogy that will pass far beyond that perfection of these movies. I also recommend reading the novels. They are amazing.
10.0~Most Amazing Movie I've Ever Seen!! dreamgirl609 Sign in Permalink When I came to the movie theater I had high hopes for the last installment of LOTR. I was not at all disappointed!!! It was a masterpiece and it was so intense that I actually had to remind myself to breath!! I love how in the theater their swords are bigger than your heads. The cast was so powerful in their acting that you had emotions about all of them. I LOVE this movie and highly recommend it if you've seen the first two!!
10.0~best of the year rehh Sign in Permalink Finally, it took three years to see all three, but the wait was worth it. This is more than just an epic, it is, in combination with 'Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers' a classic to go down in history as unforgettable. Peter Jackson rocks as being by far the best director of our time. He put New Zealand on the map and made people aware that reading classic literature can be a good thing. I myself have read the trilogy three times and this will not be the last time. Maybe I'll take up learning Elvish, who knows. I was very impressed at how the final film came to it's conclusion and can't wait for the extended version to come out.
10.0~awesome! cgwrestler09 Sign in Permalink i like a lot of people in the world are am a lord of the rings freak. i love these movies and the first two were amazing so return of the king had a lot to live up to. Ending the trilogy this movie is action packed with your massive fighting scenes to the touchy feeling parts. This movie will go down as one of the greatest in film history. Peter Jackson has shown that he is an amazing director through the lord of the rings trilogy and i strongly strongly encourage you to start with the beginning and work your way to the final film. It is quite hard not to spoil parts of the movie so i will refrain from doing so...but you seriously must check this movie out because it will blow your mind away with how amazing it is. Watch it and become a Lord of the Rings fanatic like me and millions of others.
10.0~Absolutely Fantastic doc23-1 Sign in Permalink WARNING SPOILERS I saw Return Of The King last night and i was stunned by how great this film is. The time just flew by and before i knew it it was over. Its hard to pick a favourite scene. The start was really disturbing showing smegols transformation into Gollum but was well down and it was great that Andy Serkis was seen as himself not in CG. It was a pity some of the characters got sidelined a bit, notably Gimli and Legolas Though Legolas had a great moment going on the ollephaunt. The battle scenes were class as well , excellent work from WETA. Out of the characters in this film Sir Ian Mckellen is a standout as Gandalf and Andy Serkis, his final scenes at the Mt. Doom are brilliantly done and speaking of that sequence i really thought this was the end of Frodo. If i have any reservations its that Christopher Lee was cut out which was a shame and the ending was a bit too cheesy but at the same time it is only a small argument. It was great too to see Bilbo again and to see how old he has become. To finish ROTK along with the other two is the best Trilogy i've ever seen. Way better than Star Wars im surprised to say. Well done to Peter Jackson and his team. Hope he does the Hobbit.
10.0~Greatest Movie Ever! foleyisgod1981 Sign in Permalink After walking out of the theaters I thought to myself, "is this the greatest movie I have ever seen" and I still think that it is to this day. When you see Lord Of The Rings:The Return Of The King be prepared to see one of the greatest stories ever written come alive on screen, in the next 3 and a half hours you will be blown away on how well put together this movie is and how great the acting is especially from Sean Astin, this is not just a movie but it a epic that will go down as the final chapter in a brilliant story. My rating for this movie is 10 out of 10.
10.0~these are the films of the decade grumpy-3 Sign in Permalink and so we come to the final part, and what a part it is, for three and a quarter hours you experience every emotion, you are on the edge of your seat, and you see scenes in a film you have never seen before. the acting from the spot on ensemble cast is without flaw, the look the direction, the music i can go on and on. a film/story with real heart and courage, and with a depth that nothing i have seen recently comes close to. forget super heroes forget matrixs this is back to real cinema with characters that you care about who matter 10 out of 10 for jackson and the cast and crew of an out and out masterpiece
10.0~Masterpiece Zpaze99 Sign in Permalink I went to the cinema last night...and WOW! I've got to read the books again some day (third time). Can't wait for the directors cut version :-) If you haven't seen it yet...then WHAT ARE YOU DOING???
10.0~The best of the three vifteovn Sign in Permalink This was totally the best movie of the three. No bomb though, they saved some goodies to the last movie. If every movie had been made like that, I would have to live in the movies. It's grandios battle-scenes made me get quite a few goosebumps. But thats my sign that the movie is good ;) I do like the book better, and they could have used prince Imrahild. But it's a movie, I can't complain. It's the best fantasy/action if those two can be combined, movie I've ever seen.
10.0~The best fantastic movie ever seen... psychosisx Sign in Permalink First time I saw all series in theater but still effect me when I see on TV or my Blu-ray archive.. Atmosphere was amazing. You can join directly inside of Middle Earth.. It was final chapter on these series but one of the best part of them. We loved all characters. Maybe we put ourselves like Legolas or Aragorn etc. but the most significant point is J.R.R.Tolkien gave us what a wonderful fantastic world. Moreover novel was amazing still when I have time start a new journey to the middle earth. Thank you all J.R.R.Tolkien and Peter Jackson !!!

10.0~Recommended for family movie night. jcundiff-893-468113 Sign in Permalink This movie is great for family movie night because it has something for everyone, small children might be scared by some scenes, but overall it is a good family movie. The action scenes are all shot and feel authentic and unlike in most action- driven films the acting in this film exceeds all expectations and is fantastic. J.R.R. Tolkien's series was in safe hands with director Peter Jackson who made sure to remain authentic to the text while still bringing the story to life in breath-taking detail. This is a must watch for any fan of the books or movie buff. The only downside to this movie is its length which is understandable due to the amount of material that needed to be covered. However, don't think you'll sit down for an hour and a half and finish the movie. You'll need twice that amount of time. So you have been warned.
9.0~The Ring's The Thing dunmore_ego Sign in Permalink Precognitive Spoilers. Okay, tattered robes deployed?  check; multiple story lines at the ready to entwine and entangle viewers?  check; sets constructed on a budget which would've stamped out hunger in Ethiopia?  check; everyone smeared in poo?  check  let's roll! Trust me, Gentle Viewer, if you've not seen the first two installments of this bloated, beguiling masterpiece, or if you've not read the rambling, roiling Lord Of The Rings book (often regarded as a 'trilogy'), do not watch The Return Of The King. It will only necessitate calling the Dial-A-Geek Hotline to elicit logical explanations as to how a supernatural being could manifest itself as an all-seeing Eye and then have the Abbot&Costello mentality to only monitor the spots where this Eye is actually "looking"; and why Gandalf, who rescued Frodo from Mount Doom at movie's end with the aid of deus ex machina giant eagles, could not have done the same three hours ago and *flown* Frodo to Mount Doom in the first place; and why Viggo looks so masculine in Return Of The King and so uber-gay in Hidalgo. Us outsiders to the Dungeons & Dragons phenomenon will never know If taken as a movie unto itself, it is merely noteworthy, though disjointed. But this movie should be regarded as the last three hours of a grand tale so epic and awe-inspiring that it *needed* nine hours to faithfully tell it. (Even so, we get the superfreaks complaining that it was *too short*!). Of the eight endings in the film, there was one in which Aragorn actually found some soap. There was also another ending in which Jackson let slide the fact that we could clearly distinguish (in rear views) the child-actors in place of Hobbits; thrown in somewhere was a happy ending, a sad ending, a token African-American ending and one which involved everyone jumping on Frodo's bed in slow motion like a lingerie ad. I must admit to shedding a lonely tear whenever I think of how massive the delight of J.R.R. Tolkein might have been had he the opportunity to see his masterpiece transformed into such a  well, a masterpiece. Peter Jackson is a genius  there's no doubt about that. And these Rings films are unparalleled in cinematic history. Words fail. The wealth of creative staff employed by Jackson brought a depth to the visualization of Tolkein's wonders that Tolkein himself would never have had the capacity to envision  case in point: those elephantine war-chariots. Take a close look at their armaments and battle-ornamentation and then imagine a lad from 1950's British society seeing this on screen  to him, this "reality" would be literally as magical as the tale he was telling. Nonetheless, I find I am constantly torn between piling praise on the herculean movie-making task that Jackson succeeded in fulfilling, and nitpicking plot holes in the storyline, which is no fault of Jackson's, and which, if Jackson is to remain faithful to the book, must necessarily be integral to the film's storyline. For example, if all elves are immortal, shouldn't they all attain a certain age and then stop aging? Ultimately, your father should end up looking exactly like your brother - and fathers and daughters would look like brothers and sisters  correct? Yet why does Elrond look like Liv Tyler's drunken, old, cross-dressing uncle? And why should they all go sailing off somewhere into the sunset in order to be immortal? Immortal is immortal, no matter *where* you spend your days cross-dressing. In Two Towers, why is Theoden's Kingdom located so far from their stronghold, Helm's Deep? In order to retreat to this supposedly strategic bastion, one must put the lives of the whole kingdom at stake by taking women and children over unprotected miles of open ground  good strategy! Wouldn't it make better sense to simply make your kingdom's residence at Helm's Deep? And those Dead Souls from the Mountain  did they really have to take a BOAT to the battle at Pelennor Fields? And I cannot, cannot, CANNOT, stomach predestination in any form; too much prophesying and foretelling and precognition and idiot phrases like, "What does your heart tell you?" If Elrond foresaw Frodo's demise in delivering the Ring to Mount Thunder (Galadriel tells him this via some kind of mind-meld in Two Towers) - well, why go at all? Oh, that's right: because we have the power to CHANGE our destiny  well then, all your prophesying and soothsaying is HEARSAY anyway if you're going to adopt that standpoint! Whenever Theoden shouts orders amidst a battle, or when Saruman speaks to 10,000 slavering orcs, I'm reminded of Monty Python's Life Of Brian, where Jesus speaks to the multitudes and those in the back are yelling, "Speak Up!" and "He said, 'Blessed are the cheesemakers!'". Inconsistency: In Two Towers, those elephantine beasts are called "oliphaunts" by Sam, yet these same beasts are called "mumakil" in Return Of The King. Tolkien did not describe either beast in detail in the book. The biggest question of all, surrounding this whole shebang, is, of course, if a supernatural entity has the wherewithal to forge a talisman of illimitable power  The One Ring, that which all the poking and puking is over  upon "losing" it (which would seem almost impossible in the first place, for a being who can "sense" The Ring's presence)  well, why not simply forge another? End of story. Poor Frodo and Viggo and Don Gandalfino, when all they had to do was tell the Big Dark Guy to make another ring and leave us be; instead spending three years putting on the sour pusses and being covered in poo. Anyone got the Dial-A-Geek hotline number? (Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
10.0~Epic movie. Takethispunch Sign in Permalink Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Théoden to Isengard where they reunite with Merry and Pippin. With Saruman defeated, Gandalf retrieves Saruman's palantír. Overcome by curiosity, Pippin steals a glance into the seeing-stone, and suffers a mental attack from Sauron himself. Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith, so he rides there to warn them, taking Pippin with him because Sauron thinks Pippin is the ring bearer. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a 2003 epic high fantasy adventure film directed by Peter Jackson based on the second and third volumes of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is the third and final installment in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, following The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and The Two Towers (2002), preceding The Hobbit trilogy (2012–2014).
10.0~The greatest Movie ever made but have u seen the extended edition? Cunnilingilator Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy in my mind are the three greatest movies ever made. I saw the Return of the King at 12:01 AM on the day it came out. I had already purchased the Fellowship extended DVD which by the way is amazingly better than the theatrical version. This Christmas I got the Two Towers and The Return Extended DVDS. I watched both of them in the same day and was in awe when I was done. The return of the King extended edition is absolutely mindblowing. There is no word to describe how much better the extended DVD is than the regular edition. The two towers is extremely well done in the extended version. If u have not seen the extended versions I strongly strongly urge you to go out and either buy or rent these dvds. The will astonish you. Please comment if you have seen the extended editions and have something to say. SEE THESE DVDS THEY ARE AMAZING!!!
1.0~I think this is just an ordinary movie not a great movie NiculaMadalin Sign in Permalink Why? I'll tell you why this is my opinion. First of all I can't believe it's in top five of all times!!! This is unbelievable and I think even the producer is surprised of the position of his movie:) I'm just asking you to think about what major revolutions the movie has brought. First of all the story was already used in a previous movie(The Lord of the Rings 1978). The special effects are great but what about the Matrix? The music and the costumes are great but this is ordinary for a movie with that budget, and the plot is for kids(let's face it) with no passion or feelings etc. just the old war between good and evil witch is present in any Jean-Claude Van-Damme or Stallone movie. I'm very sad, not because the world is insane about the movie, because the movie is in top 5 of all times, so they leaving me no chance but to vote the movie with 1.
10.0~Sheer perfection theninja Sign in Permalink This, being the final movie in the trilogy, is also the climax of the story, and what a climax it is. This is just perfection. Sheer perfection. I hope this movie makes it to position 1 on the imdb's top 250, because it really deserves this place. This is unlike anything I have ever seen. It is such a magical movie and you must see it!!! This is truly a milestone in the history of cinema. Go and see it and be a part of movie history... Absolutely fantastic. 10/10
10.0~Best LotR. By far. (10/10) turgon2000 Sign in Permalink Being relatively disappointed by the second LotR movie, because of the decision of the director to alter the Tolkien story significantly (with Frodo's visit to Osgiliath being the worst of these alterations), I went to see Return of the King with mixed feelings, fearing for more bad alterations. My fear was unfounded. The movie was excellent! I enjoyed it so much I went to see it five times. And each time it looks fresh and exciting to me. The power of the Rohirrim, the battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Siege of Minas Tirith. Everything was there and felt right. It really swept me off my feet. Even the minor alteration of the lighting of the beacons left me breathless. My belief in Peter Jackson and his dedication to the story is restored and I recommend this movie to anybody who is a Fantasy fan or just happens to like great movies!
10.0~The best movie I have seen in years. Guy_W Sign in Permalink Perfection, pure perfection. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is without a doubt the most exciting movie of this year. The second third of the movie concludes the best fight scenes that have been seen in the theatre through all history (beats the last LoTR) and puts the word 'epic' to another level, Peter Jackson succeeded here where many other directors failed. Although the movie is 200 minutes long, It runs like it's a 100. That's the way to end a trilogy (Matrix Revolutions - for your consideration) Final score: 9.8 / 10
10.0~Two Thumbs & Toes UP christianr Sign in Permalink I check ratings here for movies i would like to rent or sometimes when i want to see a movie with my wife. the only reason i registered is to say that this movie is simply AMAZING. there are many movies that are good but LOR 3 is awesome!
10.0~Finally, a movie for European Americans whitedawn-1 Sign in Permalink A movie finally cast appropriately that European Americans can relate to. I'm so sick of bad casting in so many recent movies. This one was filmed in New Zealand away from the Hollywood influence and the director was able to use people who fit Tolkien's descriptions. Rather than cast Jennifer Lopez or Halle Berry as an elf, or The Rock as Aaragorn, we have people who look the part. The above mentioned casting would be similar to casting Ben Affleck as Shaft. Also, a great message that good defeats evil, and you should never ever give up. Even when you think it's hopeless, there is always hope. This movie is safe for people of all ages, and a relief from the usual garbage, profanity and vulgarity that is coming out of Hollywood now days.
10.0~One of the greatest. DVJohnson7 Sign in Permalink TROFK has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not only does it hold true to the book, but it lets you know what happens to each character. I hope this walks away with many film, actor(s), etc. awards. It deserves to be called the best of the year or even decade.
8.0~the most overhyped movie ever, as well as the greatest cinematographic achievement of all time - at the same time. nedwong2000 Sign in Permalink movie was a wonderous technological acheivement, unparalleled. Very clean, cinematographically flawless. Beyond well executed, technologically. But for all the visual awe and excitement, it lacked emotional edge. This is because it lacked believability and personal identification. Strip away all the cgi, etc and were left with awkward editing, mediocre acting, and trite, overused character employment. omissions made the movie too methodical. Didnt flow. Dumbed-out dialogue left me without identification with the cause. Where's the challenge? This is what I learned from the movie: protagonist die > friend protagonists sad. protagonist live= friend protagonist happy. Bad guy die = protagonist happy. The movie was an emotional simpleton, full of cliches. and above all this, I was still not convinced that the ring was that important. Jackson failed to bring me to understand why the ring was so powerful; the only conscious allusion to it's importance in the entire trilogy was in the beginning of the first movie when we were briefed about its powers, and then abandoned; left to accept its worth with barely a sort of narrative indication to me of its value, origins, backstory etc - only to know that yes, everyone has always seemed eager kill for "my preeecious". Maybe being atheist has to do with my inability to buy into what I feel should be the most expressly and carefully told part of the story, because, the ring was like God, with no beginning, we have only to accept it's importance b/c peter jackson says so. And how about the eye? what was its role in the grand scheme of things? How abour Sauron? what happened to him?
10.0~All good things must come to an end... canadasbest Sign in Permalink ...but what a way to go out! Having watched all three LOTR films in the last 24 hours, I can honestly say that this trilogy marks a milestone in filmmaking. As other reviewers have mentioned, this installment seems to go by quickly, despite being over three hours long. I am thankful the scriptwriters left the comedy out of this. It would have been easy to toss in a funny line here or there but thankfully there are virtually none, although I always get a kick out of Gimli and Legolas keeping track of their battlefield kills. The battle sequences in this movie were masterfully done (the army of the dead is something to behold) and although some may argue the movie has five separate endings, each serves a purpose and by the time we are all done, every plot thread has been tied up. Yes, the films don't exactly match the books, but the same is true of every book based movie. Considering the monumental task that lay before him when he took on this project, I think Peter Jackson should be commended for taking a much beloved literary work and transforming it into a spectacular film trilogy.
10.0~An Opus eonbluedan-1 Sign in Permalink Whilst some may argue it is over-long, "The Return Of The King" is simply too powerful, with too many wonderful elements, and is ultimately too great an achievement to not be in my list of favourite films of all time! Peter Jackson's adaption of this story, whilst having the occasional stumble along the way, was ultimately stunning. This film ties up the themes of the previous two instalments, of which there are many, in an emotional tour de force, on a rather grand scale. When you have performances from a top-notch cast, in a film about ideas as fundamentally moving as this, you are hardly going to go wrong, and at the centre of it all is the friendship between Frodo and Sam, so brilliantly played by Elijah Wood and Sean Austin. Friendship, loyalty, sacrifice, love, and the struggles we all face can be found committed to film in the intense few hours of "The Return Of The King". The reason Lord Of The Rings worked so well is that it did not become a stage for special effects (which are wonderful, as shown in scenes of battling with a giant spider); the story is always first! What is impressive is how, for an original story with such scope of themes and ideas to be explored, not much is really missed in the film, and it is so expertly adapted, one cannot fail to overlook any of the flaws purists might make a point of, and be simply overwhelmed by its power
10.0~The best movie I've seen nicole-plank Sign in Permalink This film is going to be a classic for years to come. I don't think I've ever seen a better movie. The special effects were eye-popping, the acting was superb, and the plot was seamless. I enjoyed the depth they gave to Gollum's character. I was stunned by Sean Astin's heart-wrenching performance as Sam. He did a fantastic job of making the audience feel strongly about this story. The film deserves every star you can give it.
10.0~By far the best episode r.scholten Sign in Permalink Never have I seen such a overwhelming movie as this. Beautifull landscapes, enormous fighting scenes and great buidling structures. I read the book and even in my imagination I could not have dreamed that it would be possible to exceed these thoughts. Perfect special effects, impressive visual effects and a good mix of emotions in the different scenes. To bad, this is the last part.
6.0~Disappointing finale ninabird42 Sign in Permalink I am not a big scifi/fantasy movie fan, but i really enjoyed the first two LOTR movies, and expected this one to be even better. What a let down. This movie lacked any real acting, or character development. I found myself nearly snoring at the neverending battle scenes. It might have been a great movie if it had been reduced to 2 hours, but this movie seemed to never end.
1.0~Unfaithful trash krbodkin Sign in Permalink That's what these movies are. I've tried to watch these many times over the years, and the experience is always a painful exercise in eye rolling. I fully understand that there is no way the entire books could have made the transition to film intact, but the sheer amount of things changed for the sake of Peter's "vision" is just insulting. Even little things like the party's arrival at Bree was given an entirely mood for the sake of making it unsettling. Every event feels horribly rushed. The transition aside, the movie(s) aren't even good by themselves without knowledge of the lore. The acting is, for the most part, atrocious. The music feels largely unsuitable for the mood set by either the books or the films themselves, and also feels incredibly repetitive. Even the director's cuts of these films feel more like an insult than a tribute. I hate these movies.
9.0~Epic! - except for the last 15 minutes shoalin Sign in Permalink Simply put  EPIC! A near perfect cinematic adaptation of the last book of the trilogy that was relatively respectful of the source material, as were the two earlier episodes. Peter Jackson and all the creators deserve a lifetime commendation for what they have accomplished with these three films. The only flaw with The Return of The King' is the excruciatingly drawn out ending, most notably the tearful goodbye scene at the Elfin boat dock which could have easily been cut in length by two-thirds (around 8 minutes). After three hours of ultra-entertaining nearly non-stop action, everyone in the theatre was squirming in the seats saying, `Come on now, let's get on with it already!' Similar to the ending for Excalibur' (where a knight makes an totally unnecessary 2nd trip to the lake to retrieve the sword), the creators seem to have fallen so in love with the story that they had a tough time letting go. But this is the only flaw in a near-perfect film, so it still deserves a massive 9 out of 10 in my books.
1.0~long, boring and overrated spam-587 Sign in Permalink The whole trilogy achieves to translate admirably well the deep boringness of the book, replacing infinite descriptions with long, empty, tired, repetitious and over-emotional sequences, totally misplaced considering the Britney spears-like deepness of characters. Characters are so flat and numerous, that you waste half of the movie trying to remember who is who, but it doesn't really matter anyway. Actions sometimes come to wake you up, they are mostly entertaining but the most decisive and very awaited one is reduced to a game-like greenish flow that is the only thing that happens to be fast in the whole movie. Be happy, the end is near. (Should be rated 5 to 7)
10.0~Best Set Ever! adammya23 Sign in Permalink Loved ALL of these movies! Can't go wrong no matter which one you watch! I would watch them over and over!
9.0~Whoa there, wait a minute here... magistervex Sign in Permalink I have nothing against this movie, and as a matter of fact like it very much, BUT it is nowhere near the quality of story as The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather, nor many other movies out there. This movie, while great, does not deserve as high a ranking on the Top 100 list as it has. There are many other movies out there, and while they may not have all the shiny special effects that the producers spent way too much money on, that's not all that you can base a movie on. While a great author, J.R.R. Tolkein's medium was the written word, not the movie. If you want to rate this as a book, it would definitely not appear anywhere near the top 100 or 1000 or perhaps even 10000 of all time, and should therefore not be among the top movies as well.
10.0~Cinematic Rarity azazel2099 Sign in Permalink Only once in a very long time do we find a movie like this! Only a few movies can stand up to it, such as "Gone with the wind," "Forest Gump," and perhaps even "Saving Private Ryan." Very rarely do you find a science-fiction/fantasy epic such as this that has both the stunning vizualations and the acting prowess as "The Lord of the Rings." 11 out 10 if I had it my way!
1.0~The emperor has no clothes manofhood Sign in Permalink Lord of the rings has been hailed as The literary work for half a decade. There are some of us who are completely baffled by this, this hysteria. My conclusion is that this story is celebrating tyranny, hierarchy, racism and attacking basic feminism. And that's why it is so popular. People like to have a mirror of their own daily life, a life they desperately claim is a good one. It is the defense of a world filled with ignorance, injustice and intolerance. So, when the source material is this bad, the movie couldn't really be much to speak of. And it isn't. From the first moment we're confronted by the old, trite ideas of good versus evil, foreigner versus patriot, and so on. This story could just as well have been used and written as a propaganda tool for old Britain, and it was, and it is. So old fashioned and so supportive of strong «leadership» that one wants to puke. Tolkien supports strong leaders, a hierarchical society. Doing the good vs evil illusion. Two countries going to war, generally speaking are basically equally bad. The village is presented as a kind of ideal life. Yet, they are kind of simpletons, who enjoy village life and don't want to take part in ruling society. They leave that to the kings, the lords and such. Life, society in his stories is basically fair. Sauron (outside influence) and "traitors" make it bad. Nothing about society itself being bad. Agriculture is hailed as a paradise. Nothing about the amount of pollution and poisons being produced by it. Even the virtual complete lack of blacks in the story is proof in itself that it is racist. The orcs are another telling example. Women, in the sense they are present at all, are merely ornaments. The worst part is Arwen, who is sacrificing immortality to follow a man and his preferences. And this story is hailed as some of the best of the previous century? Unbelievable. Intelligent men and women don't dislike the story because of the action, but because it is an insult to their intelligence. Let me point out that I have respect for the amount of work Tolkien put into it. Or would have had, if the end result had been better, if he wasn't soiled in conservatism. As stated the emperor has no clothes. 1 of 10
10.0~Goat hasanboss-81406 Sign in Permalink Not much to say pretty much perfection from start to finish
10.0~TEAM WORK James-maeva Sign in Permalink The ultimate movie in trust, honor, adventure and belief. A must see adventure movie.
10.0~It's too long but still... Satua Sign in Permalink ... It might be the best movie of this century. I'm writing this the morning after and dreamt about it all night... So it's all a bit messy at the moment. The film is huge. Everyone acted their best and I've always said that I don't think Wood is so good as Frodo as he should be but I'm taking it all back now after seeing whole trilogy in a row. He's absolutely amazing! Anyway, the film is great and I probably have to see it many times that I can be more critical. The ending is too long but like some critic said; I don't know what could've been left out?! Go see it!
10.0~The Greatest Film of all Time!! Inferno856 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King was by far the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The entire 3 and a half hours that I was sitting in the theatre I was blindly captivated by the film. The Return of the King is even better then the first two! The entire movie was done with such state of the art special effects that your eyes will be thanking you when the movies over. There were so many on the edge of your seat scenes that I kept on finding myself falling out of my seat in the theatre! This film is a true work of art and deserves an academy award. I dont want to spoil any of the film for you, so all I can see is see The Return of the King, you WONT regret it! 10 out of 10
10.0~Images, Story and The Lord of the Rings unscathedicarus Sign in Permalink *SOME SPOILERS HERE, CAREFUL PLEASE* Sublime and mindblowing were the two words that reverberated in my head after stumbling out of the theater at 1 am. Two days later, I've decided to try to make sense of the trilogy and think a little instead of simply raving (which of course I was doing the entire night after the movie). I still feel that The Fellowship of the Ring remains truer to Tolkien's series of books, simply due to the fact that as the flagship for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, director Peter Jackson was required to meticulously and beautifully paint a portrait of Middle Earth and establish the character of various peoples. The realms of Hobbiton and Rivendell receive wonderful treatment and illustrate the distinctive qualities of the inhabitants of the two places. While The Fellowship of the Ring functions as an exploration of Middle Earth, The Two Towers begins the actual conflict of Middle Earth, the Great War between good and evil. It expanded the tale of a small group of people (primarily the Fellowship) into the epic story of an entire world. As the scope of The Lord of the Rings increases during this middle chapter, Peter Jackson's ability to concentrate specifically on its protagonist's struggle naturally diminishes to a degree, as he now must also tell the story of the rest of Middle Earth. Tolkien's heroes are sucked into a whirlpool of battle and conquest, their original goal of the destruction of the One Ring swept aside for the moment as external conflict blocks their paths. The original quest of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, their search for the hobbits, transforms into the greater goal of saving the land of Rohan. Far from their role in the first film of companions to Frodo, Merry and Pippin find their purpose in convincing the Ents to siege Isengard Tower in order to aid their friends. Even Frodo and Sam's much more direct goal of reaching Morder is diverted when Faramir drags them to the battle of Osgiliath. Cinematically The Return of the King finds itself with more stunning material, wonderfully crafted and tailored to Jackson's particular sensibilities. It strikes a balance between the epic and the dramatic, taking some of each of the first two films. Because Frodo and Sam have escaped the War into Mordor at this point, Jackson is able to focus tightly on their journey now and the impending dangers and doom that await them. The presence and mastery of his earlier horror work expresses itself very strongly here, both in the rapid camerawork and cutting and the art direction. Specifically the Stair to Cirith Ungol and the den of Shelob reflect the director's love of frightening and creepy atmosphere and the monsters that lurk in the back of our minds. Aragorn's quest to enlist the Dead army of the mountain are very visually reminiscent of Jackson's Dead Alive (the trail through the mountains seems to be the same canyon that he used in the opening sequence of Dead Alive as well). While battle still runs rampant in The Return of the King, it yields to specific and more personal moments in the War. Eowyn's battle with the Witch King and Denethor's growing insanity punctuate a vast and somewhat static epic battle, bringing the story back to its heroes rather than expanding it to the whole of Middle Earth. Return of the King seems to take the reverse strategy of The Two Towers, sidetracking the War with the personal quests of the film's protagonists. It seems that director Peter Jackson tires of dealing with the material on a large scale (for the point is made that many have sacrificed and lost in this war after several minutes of carnage), most apparently when Aragorn's Dead Army ravages the hordes of Mordor in a split second, neatly cleaning up the rest of the battle to allow the film to progress to its smaller-scope climax on Mount Doom. Ultimately it is the characters that represent the races of Middle Earth that interest us (primarily the Fellowship of the first film), not the actual masses of people themselves, as Aragorn clearly enunciates with his cry of "For Frodo" as he charges the ranks of Mordor. The Rosebud enigma in Citizen Kane allows Orson Welles to explore the deeper puzzle of the identity of Charles Foster Kane. In the same right, the story of the destruction of the One Ring, while compelling and wonderful in its own right, is a device that allows Tolkien's characters (and thus the film's audience) to traverse the whole of Middle Earth and sample its wonders. The Ring becomes a concrete metaphor for evil in general and the struggle of the small hobbits is a specific manifestation of the theme of the weak struggling against great adversity. While the films' detractors criticize Jackson's inability to remain true to the original books, I believe that he has more than adequately illustrated the world of Middle Earth. Subtleties that are readily available in the printed medium may be impossible to transpose onto the silver screen. The three films carefully balance an energetic storyline with lush, imaginative and breathtaking visuals that represent the world of Tolkien to the audience. Imagery and visual splendor have always been the strength of the cinematic medium more than anything else and it will be the beautiful images that Peter Jackson created in the Lord of the Rings trilogy that remain with us for years to come.

5.0~Somehow it seemed all far too distant evoid Sign in Permalink After I have seen the first movie, when it was shown at the movies, I thought it was the best movie I ever watched. Forgive me, I was a child. Because I could not wait for the second one to be released, I read the whole trilogy. When "The Two Towers" and "The Return of the King" were released, I watched them in great expectation. My thought on the second part was, that it was different from the books, but it was still great in it's own manner. But the third movie disappointed me. I could not find any sign of the Tolkien-feeling that I knew from the books and that was partially carried on by the first two films. Yes, for sure "The Return of the King" is the most imposing one of the trilogy, but somehow it leaks depth. To me it seemed like this movie focused/decreased only on views of great fortresses, huge marching armies and heroic battles. Unlike the previous parts, this movie left me totally cold. I was never feeling inside the happening or feeling with the characters, I never experienced something like catharsis. I can remember sitting in the cinema and being just sad. There was a lot of action, a lot of things went haywire, but somehow it seemed all far too distant. It was like eating something you haven't eaten for a long time and expecting a certain taste, but realizing that in truth it tastes totally different, much more synthetically. I think it's a pity and I hope that one day there will be a non-Hollywood adaptation of The Lord of The Rings.
3.0~A huge disappointment (spoiler) hosr1 Sign in Permalink I came to the 3rd installment full of hope for greatness, having loved the first two parts, but I have to say I was greatly disappointed. Not to put too fine a point on it, Peter Jackson has blown it. This is all the sadder when you consider that the first half up to the siege of Gondor is stupendous. (Apart from the ludicrous bit when the palantir of Saruman appears in a pool at the foot of Isengard - without any explanation as to why the most precious thing in the tower has ended up there.) But after the siege the problems really begin ... The brilliant moment when Eowyn slays the Witch King of Angmar is cut into two halves, denuding it of much of its power. Arwen continues to be a drippy character. Sam has some more toe-curling soppiness. Sauron remains a bizarre electrical 'thing' - he doesn't even have the character of the introduction to the first film, even more he has none of the self-doubt that comes through in the book. The moment we've all been waiting for (a very very long time) through three films - i.e. the downfall of Sauron is a bitter anti-climax. Over 10 hours of struggle and we end up with a minute's collapse. Then we're treated to another Sam moment (argh!) and a particularly dreadful moment where the hobbits jump on Frodo's bed. The Shire at the end looks like it's just been planted with not a petal out of place. And the whole thing peters away. Some of this is of course the problem of the book - but Jackson should have grasped the nettle and been better and bolder with the ending. I'm afraid this could have been so so so much better. Really disappointing and, basically, poor.
10.0~Best of the three whizkids Sign in Permalink I don't plan on giving away any of the important stuff, but this is to let you know that if you have seen or heard anyone trashing the Return of the King, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM! The story line is amazing, how Peter was able to make the changes from the book and still have it come out like it is beyond me, the acting was incredible, and the effects were so great, there were parts where if I hadn't seen on the web certain things were CGI, no one in my family would have known. Such noble themes come on the screen as friendship, loyalty, love, perseverence and selflessness, to name a few. A lot of violence, but it draws the line to where you see spears getting thrust through an Orc, but you don't see anything pouring out of him. As a note to christians, this movie has great spiritual aspects to it. There are lots to things that Tolkien had that you could compare to the Bible that Peter Jackson wrote into the script. If you are only able to get one of the three films of the Lord of the Rings, get this one. It's perfect!
10.0~The Mona Lisa Of Films............. SmedlyMc Sign in Permalink It may be over 10 years old now, but Return Of The King definitely hasn't lost any of its shine. After a lucky victory at Helms Deep, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and there new friends from Rohan set out to Isengard to rescue Merry and Pippin. We also see Sam and Frodo bravely continuing there journey to Mt Doom, with the 'aid' of Gollum. The acting throughout this film is brilliant, with more amazing performances from Ian McKellen (Gandalf), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) and of course, Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee). Andy Serkis (Gollum) also deserves a lot of credit. He did a fantastic job of playing Gollum and really put his heart and soul into creating such a memorable character. And with two major battles, this really is the icing on the cake for the Lord Of The Rings series. With stunning backdrops, impressive effects and a brilliant ensemble cast, this is a must see film for any fantasy fan. It also has the perfect balance of action, fantasy, romance and fighting. Looking back, its no wonder this film won 11 Oscars, and Peter Jackson deserves all the praise he gets for adapting Tolkiens wonderful stories onto the big screen. Whether you watch the original, or the extended edition, this film will NOT disappoint you.
10.0~Best of 2003 xjustinxgrayx Sign in Permalink This movie is the very best out of the trilogy. The CGI is amazing and the action scenes great to watch. Even though the movie is most 4 hours you won't notice it. A few places of bad dialog does not diminish this movie at all. Some inconsitancies in the plot fail to bring the movie down. It is truely the best movie of 2003. It makes up for the dismal Matrix Revolutions. Still upset about that one.
6.0~Cool visual effects and a whole lot of action, but didn't you get enough in The Two Towers? Bingoberran Sign in Permalink I've had enough of special effects and war already. Peter Jackson was afraid that the second movie would be less interesting but I think that the amount of interest descended throughout the trilogy. The first movie was all Gothic and scary, until it reached the climax of Moria, and then they threw in the beginning of the second book to give it a better end. The second movie lacks pretty much in storyway but it has the wonderful helm's deep scene (apart from the ridiculous skateboard thing and gimli's low quality jokes) to make it one of the greatest war movies ever. The Third movie just keeps bringing action, but since the palantir was already revealed in the first movie, and both Saruman and Elrond's sons are completely removed, they throw in the forging of anduril here instead and fucc up the whole deal. However they did deserve many of the Oscars; the music is great, wonderful setting and great effects.
9.0~Great final! calmen1 Sign in Permalink In my opinion, The Return of the King is the best film in the trilogy. There where more excitement, more drama, more battles. The final battle will be remembered the most. Ghosts, pirates, BIG creatures and thousands of men and orcs fighting for Minas Tirith and Gondor.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King(2003) funtvut Sign in Permalink This movie is amazing to watch ,good time to watch this movie ,
10.0~An excellent conclusion to one of the best modern day trilogy's Fluffy-13 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in my view has to be one of the best (if not THE best)conclusions to any trilogy in movie making history. When I first heard that Peter Jackson had begun filming the LOTR films, I was a little apprehensive as I'd not long finished reading the books. I thought there was no way, he'd be able to do them justice and that the films would go the same way as many trilogy's had gone before, by starting on a high but sadly lacking at the end. My apprehension however was not needed. The return of the king stayed (more or less) quite true to the books. The size and scale of the battles is immense and the sets, scenery and CGI's are thoroughly stunning.I can't wait until the extended version comes out on DVD, so as to see the bits that had to be omitted due to time constraints. Peter Jackson can now sit among the big boys of direction and I only hope that if he gets the go ahead for the Hobbit, it will be made in the same style and panache as the LOTR trilogy. I would recommend Lord of the rings: return of the king to anyone!
9.0~Better than TTT, but not quite up to FOTR (spoilers) Mulliga Sign in Permalink There's no pulling punches - ROTK feels rushed. It's certainly the best movie of 2003, and it makes the entire trilogy the best movie series ever, but as a third part and conclusion, it has some flaws. Most of these relate to the ending(s). Let's face it - the end of ROTK in the books wasn't the strongest part, either, and neither is the end of Jackson's film. It goes way overboard when Frodo leaves for the Grey Havens - the scene seems to take as long as Trinity's death in "The Matrix Revolutions," though it certainly works better. On the bright side, the battles are spectacular, the acting (especially Sean Astin, who deserves at the very least an Oscar nomination) is spot on, and the finale works well. I definitely liked how they changed the final encounter with Gollum in the Cracks of Doom - it's more dramatic, and it makes more sense than having Gollum simply fall off by himself. In this case, Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens improved on Tolkien IMHO. 9/10
10.0~The Lord of the Fantasy Movies, part III RichardKleiner Sign in Permalink What has been said that hasn't been said before? The story? The characters? The music? The Special Effects? The Visual Effects? The CInematography? The Source Material? The Endings? The plot in a nutshell: Frodo and Sam are on Mordor's footsteps with the doubtful intentions of Gollum leading them. Meanwhile, Sauron is angry at the Heir of Isildur and sets to attack Gondor. The greatest battle scene ever conceived and made takes place. But it's not the end. The good guys win the battle, but the war is still on. Frodo has been betrayed by Gollum and left to die with Shelob. He survives, but unconscious and is taken right into Mordor by patrolling orcs. There, after being rescued by Sam, they set off to Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. But, in order to distract Sauron's eye from witnessing all of this, Aragorn and company set a fight in front of the the imposing Black Gate. They're more than positive that they will lose. But Frodo fights and falls repeatedly, until he gets right above the fire. When he's about to turn away, as the Ring always manage to do, Gollum appears and fights Frodo for it. Thankfully, the once hobbit falls with the Ring in hand and both are melted in the lava. Mordor, Sauron and the Orcs are destroyed. The good guys win. Aragorn is crowned, but it is he who bows to the hobbits, for their services were even greater then what anyone could have ever done. This is where you can turn off the TV, stop the DVD or change the channel. The rest is just Frodo saying goodbye. My opinion? I loved the movie!! Never in the history of film-making there will be a fantasy movie as original, engaging, universal and pure fun as The Lord of the Rings. I'm not sure if Peter Jackson had in his mind that the movie would be the ultimate epic that it has become. This chapter is the best in the three. Yes, the many endings drag, but at least when I saw it in the Theater, I didn't want it to end (seriously). The score here goes all out. While it has the same dramatic touch from the previous, it bigger in scope, even the simplistic boy chant when Gollum contemplates the Ring for the last time is epic and ecstatic. I personally would have ended the movie with the final shot on Minas Tirith and a pan on the map of Middle Earth. A beautiful, perfect scene. The Rosie Cotton loose end had to be tied up, I think because people wouldn't think Sam and Frodo had more than friendship (which, due to the sociological contamination of the media, is rather ambiguous). But, even as it has some drawbacks, these aren't enough to take away any stars from this picture's rating. It has made history, and it has become the "Star Wars" for a new generation (not even the prequels could imitate the impact this new trilogy had). Best fantasy movie EVER!!! (This is not a naive statement that will pass on whenever another fantasy movie is made. It's for real). You can just feel astonished. How can a movie be that great!
10.0~Quite Possibly the Greatest Movie EVER Made. rpannier Sign in Permalink This movie is so great it's hard to believe anyone didn't like it. But, then there are people who think Jerry Springer is quality television. The movie was long and it probably should have ended when Frodo woke up, but no matter. The movie had quality acting, a great and compelling storyline, awesome special effects and some clever directing. When compared to other epics and trilogies -- This one is the very best.
10.0~It's no hype; It Is the greatest movie ever made. rdesveau Sign in Permalink One would think, with all the praise, all the books & the first two movies, I would be prepared for the final installment of the Lord. But no! Like all movies, it's not perfect: too long of course! Especially the first act. It seemed like it's designed for people without knowledge of the first two films, but once it get's going, wow! Acts two & three are probably the most brilliant, greatest & most satisfying of my movie going life & I'm nearly 49 yrs. old! And not only should it get the Best Picture Award, but Sean Astin should get best actor, too. A simply brilliant job of acting in the single brightest film yet made.
10.0~As good as the first allucaneatbuffet Sign in Permalink Having read the lord of the Rings trilogy, before ever hearing about the film, i knew i needed to see these movies. It has been so long since movie-goers have been able to enjoy a fantastic trilogy (indiana Jones, The first Starwars movies). I guarantee that if you have taste in movies, you will enjoy this trilogy. If you have a HiDef TV, or surround sound, this movie is a must see. However, in order to completely understand the plot in its entirety, it is almost necessary to view these movies in complete succession. Some may see this as a daunting task, but it is definitely worth it. For fans of the original books, i believe this movie to closely follow the plot of the books. While it can be assumed that some of the original plot has been removed, these movies are still quite enjoyable. After reading some of the other comments, i must ask why anybody can give these movies a 1, because of being over-hyped. Even with the Hype, these movies are great.
10.0~The Return of the King is an epic finish to the LOTR. dantheman0056 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings saga. Peter Jackson's portrayal of the film is a masterpiece in an already stunning trilogy. ROTK is an epic tale of sacrifice, courage, and friendship. Frodo and Sam's journey to Mount Doom is scary and filled with heart breaking moments of triumph and defeat. Elijah Woods once again portrays Frodo wonderfully as well as Sean Astin. The rest of the fellowship are very good in all of their scenes, especially Viggo Mortenson and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Visually the cities and battles are simply fantastic and very realistic. This has been a long journey of film starting with the Fellowship 2 years ago and now it has ended wonderfully.
8.0~Not really satisfying. pro_crustes Sign in Permalink Oddly, Tolkien's wonderful book(s), which seemed to create that all-important sense of "this matters" when read, did not translate for me to a "this matters" experience when on the screen. The movie(s) did a masterful job of rendering both the scenery and the characters. But, I had to ask myself, "If this were not based on Tolkien, would I care about the story at all?" It's amazing and puzzling to me that they don't stand on their own. The book certainly does, and this series of films is rather faithful to that text. Still, for reasons I cannot fathom, I enjoyed the eye-candy, but not the story. If you love LoTR, you must see these films. But, to be honest, they would never have gained much of an audience, I think, without the connection to their famous progenitor.
1.0~American Aragorn riffraffffan Sign in Permalink Amazing special effects have been used to mask Peter Jackson's mangling of the original plotline and script. Warning- this film is a prime example of a brilliant book being 'Americanised' i.e. hammered into the boy meets girl, girl loses boy, boy and girl reunite format. It has a couple of elvish words thrown in to preserve an illusion of adhering to the original book, but with Aragorn's American accent often intruding, this performance is hardly spell-binding.
10.0~Brilliant beyond words... zombear Sign in Permalink Once again, the world is treated to a work of art disguised as glorious, rousing entertainment. The Return Of The King is exciting, heart-breaking, and mind-blowing in its scope, scale, and spectacle. Even moreso than the first two films, believe it or not. Surely we'll see some major Academy Awards for Return Of The King. The Lord Of The Rings movies have been a blessing to us all, the kind of films that will stand tall until the end of the world. They are worthy of the great books that they adapt, and are a testament to the depth and breadth of the story that Tolkien gave us. Hail to Peter Jackson and the crew that brought the films to life. Hail to the cast, who flawlessly portrayed the characters that so many of us have loved for many, many years. Hail to the King.
10.0~Completely Awesome! coolestrachel Sign in Permalink I think Lord of the Rings is the best. It is the most exciting movie in my life not to mention favorite... I play the video game a lot and every single day I can't stop thinking about Lord Of The Rings.The third part of the trilogy is the best, although I wouldn't understand it if I didn't see the first two. My favorite character is Craig Parker(Haldir), he's totally amazing even if he's not a main character. Most girls like Legolas though, but I think Haldir is better(thats just MY opiion so don't get mad) and my brother thinks Im a Lord Of The Rings geek. I've watched Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King 3 times in theaters and will probably watch it everyday if I get it on DVD I'm lucky cause I dont get to watch movies very often. I keep on thinking if Isildir (I dont know if I spelled his name right) just tossed the ring into Mount Doom then it wouldve been over.gee.. what a short movie that would be. J.R.R. Tolkien did a splendid job on his book but I like the film better. Peter Jackson is a brilliant director, it made the film come to life. I think he should create the Hobbit and other stories... I dont think there should be a sequel, it might ruin the name Lord Of The Rings and it might be horrible. (except maybe if Peter Jackson does it)I don't want Lord Of The Rings to end at the 3rd film though... I want it to continue. What about you?
10.0~By far the work of the saga mikekabu Sign in Permalink First movie not so impressive slow build up, second movie good with decent battles, but the third movie is great conclusion to the epic trilogy, best movie out of all six peter Jackson's vision of the Tolkien work.the battles are of an epic scale, CGI was good for a 2000's movie. there are no negative point to this movie and i have watched the trilogy more than 20 times (extended versions).
1.0~like watching the weather channel. teejay17 Sign in Permalink More attention should have been paid to the eyes in the blue screen sequences in the film---it is all too easy to see three distinct light bulbs reflected in the eyes. If we are to believe the actors are on the mountain, then they should not be lit as if they are in a studio. At times I felt like I was watching a weather broadcast--you know, the ones where it is so blatantly obvious that that what is going on behind them is only a projection. I'm sad to say that there is still a long way for CGI to go in terms of becoming believable.
10.0~Excellent jpintar Sign in Permalink Despite the 3 1/2 hour running (my only complaint), this is a great ending to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is the final battle between good and evil in Middle Earth. I hope this is the year Lord of the Rings wins Best Picture and Peter Jackson gets Best Director at the Oscars. I think this year's competition is weak. If it doesn't win, it will be a travesty. All three films are a remarkable achievement and should be honored. Honoring the last of the trilogy would be good.
10.0~S P E C T A C U L A R !!!!!!! celticrose62 Sign in Permalink This movie IS SPECTACULAR !!! i LOVED it !!! Lots of action and suspense and it was sad and funny also .. it surely deserves many Academy Awards !! and i hope that Peter Jackson is duly rewarded for excellent work as well as the other actors and everyone else involved in the production of this Masterpiece !!! i HIGHLY recommend this picture for one and all !! if i could give it a higher rating i would !!!!
9.0~Applause shall be needed NorthutheWise Sign in Permalink It is impossible to convey the expectation evoked in me by this film. I loved the first two which are amoung my 'favouritist' of films. I am happy beyond words to report that this did not dissapoint. The acting in this is even better than that in the original with characters such as Merry and Pippen making very emotional performances rather than being used for comic relief. Also Sean Astin deserves a nomination for his performance as Samwise who is the real hero of this film. Once more technical quality is the best around. The score by Howard Shore tops the first two and the sound is perfect. The Visual effects are the best around, clearing blowing the matrix sequals out of the water; indeed there are a few shots which lack complete photo-realism but thats being too dogmatic. Minas Tirith is also by far the best 'bigature' yet. Much has been said of the cutting of Saruman from the theatrical cut but it does not detract from the film in any way, what is done seems both fitting and simple. Also the only common complaint by critics is that the ending is too long. I believe it is of perfect length; after watching about ten hours of plot you do not want it to be wrapped up quickly, it is given room to breathe so we can understand the full impact of the story on the characters. This film is very true to the book and while some scenes are missing nothing has been seriously changed. Overall this is filled with so many sublime scenes that to criticise it would be blasphemy. The Ride of the Rohirrim, Gandalfs arrival at Minas Tirith and Shelobs Lair stand out as principally breathtaking scenes. Indeed the only fault was the fact that the two girls sitting behind me talked through the entire movie... " I ought to wring their filthy little necks"... sorry. Anyway... This is by far the best part of what is shaping to be the best trilogy ever, for once we are given a concluding part that not only lives up to the first two but exceeds them in every way. People applauded at the end, thats never happened any time ive been at my local cinema before. Go on... give it ten, you know you want too.
10.0~The Conclusion of an Adventure in the Same Level of the Other Two Parts of a Splendid Story claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink The conclusion of the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made is in the same level of the other two parts of this splendid story. The journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends in this movie is again outstanding, stunning, a masterpiece. I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie. The eleven Oscars, the IMDB User rating of 9,0 with 62,820 votes and the 2,219 reviews are sufficient. I just want to record my enthusiasm with such a film. Unfortunately the same did not happen with the sequence of Matrix, where the first film was excellent, but the sequences were very disappointing. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): `O Senhor dos Anéis: O Retorno do Rei' (`Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The')
10.0~Poetry in Motion Cydone Sign in Permalink This simply cant be surpassed. With Return of the King we are taken to a whole new level of Epic scale movie making, and it is breathtaking and overwhelming, bringing more to life in dreams, than what is alive for real. So clear and coherent is the message for man, sent to him through the media he understands the best but neglects the most. Accept this fathom of art, recognize what it has to say, and perhaps we will all one day embrace hope as we today embrace the grand lies of our time. Extraordinaire!
10.0~Beautiful Fantasy! willrams Sign in Permalink I saw this film today with trepidation because it was the longest film I ever sat through without going to the bathroom. I was thrilled and glued to my seat by the story of two pals, Fredo and Sam, as they approach Mount Doom to destroy the one golden Ring, unaware of the great battle that was to befall them. The Hobbit is a real deceptive menace. The medieval war between humans and barbaric ugly men is an unending story. Several anti-climaxes, but still the whole production is a beautiful fantasy with beautiful music and choral passion! The acting is super! I've never seen anything like it. Nothing can really compare to this film 10/10
10.0~Best Cinematic Experience EVER!!! afroman_123_3 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King is with out a doubt the best movie to see in theatres. The film itself is breathtaking to begin with then put it on a huge screen, just plain old wow! The special effects are barely noticeable and Shelob is the best spider in cinema history. The story itself doesn't go word for word with the book and is missing several great scenes, but most of them will be in the Extended Edition this fall. It won 11 oscars!! There's not much else to say. Acting in this film is great. Action is through the roof. The story is still great. Character realization is right on. And to top it of The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King has the biggest battles scenes EVER!! If you haven't seen this masterpiece, than what the hell is your problem?
10.0~My ROTK experience dajuse Sign in Permalink I got to see the show at midnight Monday night (before it "officially" opened) and I can honestly say I cannot remember ever having a more awesome, amazing, incredible movie experience in my life. It completely blew me away. I went in with high expectations, obviously because of the quality of the first two movies in the series and how much I really liked them, but this movie easily exceeded my expectations. I loved it. After seeing FOTR and TTT, I came out of the theater thinking about what I didn't like about the show: Galadriel's weirdness, or Gimli's unnecessary "comic relief" or something like that. When I came out of this movie, there was none of that. I could not think of what I didn't like. It didn't even cross my mind that I might not have liked this or that. I was just awestruck. I didn't really know what to say. Fellowship of the Ring was my old favorite in the series, but this one is my new favorite. After the movie I went to my car and started it to get the heater going and sat there for probably 20 minutes just soaking it all in. The movie took me to an incredible world. I just sat there, still experiencing it. I didn't want it to end. The show is listed as 3 hrs 20 min, but it was too short. I couldn't get enough of it. I just wanted more. The CGI in the movie was fantastic. It wasn't until the next afternoon (the day after the show) that I realized that Shelob was CGI. Gollum was just another character. It seemed so invisible to me that it didn't even cross my mind to think about how good the CGI was. I even got emotional talking about it with my co-workers because the feelings that I had in the movie just came back to me as I was talking about it. There was joy, sorrow, amazement, breath-holding, disgust, surprise, revulsion, awe, laughter, just the full range of emotions. It was just incredible. I seriously did not expect that. I don't know that she will like it as much as I do. I guess I'd probably be surprised if anyone else did like it as much as I did, but I guess it doesn't really matter that much to me what other people thought of it. It doesn't change the experience I had. The other cool thing is there will be an extended version that will come out later. I could kind of tell where some parts seemed shorter than they should have been because the scene seemed to be missing a little something. That sounds bad, but it wasn't really that distracting because the movie would whisk me away somewhere else. Just fantastic...
10.0~The perfect ending for a flawless trilogy haterofcrap Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy made by Peter Jackson is easily one of the best fantasy flicks ever made. Not only the visual aspect of those three movies surpasses any single fantasy movie to be released before this film, but also the story was magical, captivating and unforgettable, with great characters, excellent performances and beautiful music. This was one of the most incredible films ever made, I think those three "Lord of the Rings" flicks are the greatest achievement in all the history of cinema, and the only movie to be almost as good as those movies was "Avatar" from James Cameron. "The Return of the King" is the excellent third (and last)part of this great trilogy, and shares all the good elements of the two previous film. This movie was excellent from beginning to end, being epic, emotional and thrilling. The battle scenes were memorable and magnificent: The ending was perfect and closes in a satisfying way one of the greatest movie franchises ever made. This movie is magnificent, and it is one of the best flicks ever made.
10.0~Authenticity Is The Heart-Call kerrykugelman Sign in Permalink "The Return of the King" is one of the most authentic and emotional epic movies ever made. I'll avoid belaboring story (as others have ably addressed that) and instead speak to the emotional authenticity that makes this such a compelling film. The myriad effects, spectacle, and so on are effective because they are made a transparent part of a believable world, a world that the viewer believes in because every person in the film contributes their belief in that world as well. The sum of all this belief is Middle-Earth itself, and the herculean struggles undertaken by Frodo and his companions. Our emotional self is engaged because of the authenticity with which the actors portray their struggle. While the first two films also worked in this way, ROTK is, if you will, the "perfect storm" within the trilogy, the culmination of a life-or-death struggle between the forces of good and evil, a struggle that moviegoers avidly followed over the three-year release cycle of the three films. In ROTK, the narrative comes to a conclusion that thrills and fills our hearts, and amazes us with a story that seems both a part of our time, and forever beyond it.
3.0~bed-time watching... papadig70 Sign in Permalink I have actually watched this movie having watched the previous two too. I guess the reason why I did it was because I was still hoping that something of some value would eventually come out of it. I was wrong. Truth is that I fell asleep after the first half of the first movie - the guy sitting next to me gave me a push to wake up. That was admittedly one of the slowest and most boring movies I had ever come across. Things went slightly better during the second part, mostly because of the battle that managed to keep me awake due to noise. Third movie just gave another back to the rule that if something starts wrong most likely ends up the same way. Frankly I don't know why people value this movie that much - if you exclude the fancy effects the rest is absolutely flat. I suppose it is always a matter of perception. But placing this movie higher than other jewels in IMDb ranking, hey, something is wrong with this picture! I give trilogy a 3 since it gave me a good sleep.
10.0~wow! charlottehutchings_89 Sign in Permalink I absolutely love this film! It's a definite must-see and an amazing end to the trilogy. It has something for everyone whether you prefer fighting or love. There are many scenes which will bring a tear to your eye and I cried so much at the end (and quite a bit all the way through!). Elijah Wood and Sean Astin did a superb job of portraying two friends on an incredible journey and facing death but staying together through it all, while Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan had me giggling with their antics as Merry and Pippin. Also, Gollum's cunning and betrayal is realised in the third film, ultimating in a bitter struggle between him and Frodo. So all in all, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is an emotional journey through a battle of good and evil but in the end love and friendship conquer all.
10.0~Perfect film.The best of the trilogy Argemaluco Sign in Permalink A few years ago I saw The lord of the rings:The fellowship of the ring and I think it is a masterpiece.Then I saw The lord of the rings:the two towers which is better than the first one.But The lord of the rings:The return of the king is the best of the three and one of the best movies of the story of the cinema.The movie is very long,but never boring.The battle scenes are perfect.This is the best movie I have ever seen and a great masterpiece in the story of the cinema.I totally recommend this movie to everyone because movies like this deserve to be seen.Thank you Mr.Jackson for this masterpiece. Rating : 10
10.0~work of art cafeenjarrito Sign in Permalink The lord of the rings: The Return Of The King is, undoubtedly, the best movie of the trilogy (the first one in my opinion it is kind of slow, the second one i loved it but still the third one is the greatest). There is not even a second of the movie that we can afford to waste, it is a work of art from the beginning to the end, besides the actors performances are excellent. The visual effects , well what can i say about them, its simple, you really believe that the nazguls or the orcs, or gollum exist, thats enough for me. The adaptation from the book it is excellent , Jackson wanted to tell everything that appears in the book, maybe that is why the finale its a little long, but that doesn't care. Peter Jackson's work its really a work of art . My rating : 9/10
10.0~Words don't begin to describe how much I enjoyed it! Axel-9 Sign in Permalink Magnificent. This is one word and it does the film the justice it deserves. It's a triumph on so many fronts, technical and creative or both at the same time. Great story, innovative and clever direction, super editing, high quality acting, stirring soundtrack composition, nigh on flawless special effects, well drilled stunt performers, wonderfully 'authentic' prop design. Hell I could go on all day, there are so many elements here that are excellent I find it hard to spot and point out the flaws. Maybe as well the fact that the film has left me speechless on three occasions. Fundamentally though one could strip away the fantasy elements, the huge battles and dazzling effects, and you'd still be left with a fine film. Why? Well because the themes it deals with are so affecting and beautifully written and acted that there would still be a gripping humane drama to play out. The corrupting lure of power against the strength of friendship. As the ring takes hold of Frodo he could be lost to the evil that has taken the pitiable Smeagol, but through courage and willpower from both himself and Sam, his character triumphs. It is to the credit of Elijah Wood and Sean Astin that they convey this spirit so well on screen. It is also to the credit of Andy Serkis and the nice chaps at Weta digital that Smeagol/Gollum is so compelling. He must be one of the most complexly deceptive characters to have ever been written about. Sweet and innocent, but brutally cold and calculating. A true enigma of a person. This could've gone wrong, but we are at once disgusted and pitying of Gollum, frightened by his treachery, but understanding of Frodo's continued trust in him. He is the dark heart of the film. The other cast members also do fine job, bringing the heart and emotion of Tolkien's text to the screen. There is tragedy and heroism in equal measure through to the film's lump in throat climax. When you have these elements welded to some of the most stirring and powerful battle sequences put to celluloid, picture thousands of horse riding warriors riding to battle tens of thousands of orcs and assorted monsters, then you have a genuine classic. I can safely say this film will be loved for years to come and will sit well next to the likes of Casablanca. Ten out of Ten. I would give it more if that were possible!
10.0~Conclusion to the greatest trilogy ever made... drimas Sign in Permalink I don't think it's necessary to go into great detail why this film is so fabulous. I just want to say if you haven't seen this trilogy yet, get off whatever mind-numbing drug you're on and GO SEE IT. Some people (who have not yet seen it) tell me that they're not "fantasy buffs" but I don't think that matters. This is real drama and if a film tells a wonderful and thankfully now complete story, the genre is not important. 10 out of 10
9.0~Quite amazing Koenig-2 Sign in Permalink This was a really good movie. Epic battles, excellent acting and breathtaking special effects made it very worthwhile. Both Minas Morgul and Minas Tirith were really great to look at, as was the march of Saurons Army out of the gate. But a few shortcomings should also be mentioned, most of them are differences to the book. First, I really missed those cool Southrons from TTT (infantry and cavalry as in the book, that is) on the Pellenor Fields - the mûmakil were, while massively animated, a bit disappointing all on their own. I really looked forward to Rohirrim battling those really smashing Southron Infantrymen. Then the Frodo-Sam breakup. This was not really necessary, Gollum was nasty enough as it were. Then the Army of the Dead. In the book, they only defeat the corsairs at Pelargir and don't come to the Pellenor Fields. I think their appearance at Minas Tirith was a bit too showy, this could have been managed differently. In the book, the victory was achieved by Gondorian and Rohirrim forces alone, without the assistance of the Dead. Last but not least: the crossing of the Plain of Gorgoroth somehow felt very short. They could easily have incorporated the Orc incident that brings Frodo and Sam to Udûn to ease the pace - it all went a little quick at the end. They hardly left Cirith Ungol behind and hoopla! they are at the Sammath Naur. I hope the EE will take care of that. As a summary, I still think FOTR was the best movie, it's closest to the book (especially the EE). TTT was somehow diminished, only the EE shows it's true qualities. And I had the same feeling in some places for ROTK - lets see what the EE can rectify.
10.0~Jackson made Tolkien new for me again bethpalladino Sign in Permalink Reading "Lord of the Rings" for the first time at around 16 years of age was for me a seminal experience. The impact of the work was so strong that I read the books three times in a row before I completely digested the enormity of this masterpiece. Much of who I am today was formed from how that first reading made me look at myself and look at life. Since that time I've read the books more than 30 times. Each re-reading has deepened my appreciation of Tolkien, but the joy that I felt when reading the work for the first time is something that I thought would always be in the past. When I first heard about the Jackson films I was both pleased and anxious. I was pleased because I love movies and have always looked forward to someone attempting a filmization of my favorite author. Of course, I was anxious because any adaptation of LOTR would probably not be good enough (recalling Bakshi's attempt in the late 70s). When I first saw Jackson's "Fellowship" I had to watch it about 3 times before I could rid myself of my own idea of what a Tolkien film should be like. After this happened I realized what a great film this really was. My experience with "Two Towers" was that I was so upset with the choices that Jackson made that I only watched it once and have yet to discard my disappointment with the film. However, I am planning on seeing it again when I purchase the DVDs (extended, of course) of all three films. I am pretty sure that several re-viewings of the film will also rid me of my disappointment with it. My more recent experience with "Return of the King" was a bit more complicated. On first viewing I liked it way better than "Two Towers" even though I was disconcerted with certain plotting choices and spent a lot of time arguing with Jackson (in my head, of course) while watching the film. However, at one point in the film something suddenly clicked for me that hadn't clicked in any of Jackson's three films until this point--Jackson somehow managed to distill in this one moment everything I loved about Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings". I started to cry, not so much because of how moving the scene was, but because Jackson managed to make me feel exactly the same ecstasy of emotions that I only had been able to feel when reading (and re-re-re-reading) "Lord of the Rings". The first time I saw "Return of the King" I had (literally) to run out of the theater the minute the credits came up to be on time for a choir rehearsal. I really did not have time to completely digest everything that I was feeling about the movie. So I decided to go and see the film a second time. In the past, when I had watched "Fellowship" for a second time, it was after I had purchased the video. This was the first time that I had returned to see one of Jackson's films at full price at a theater (which is now $10.25 in most NYC theaters). This second viewing was an eye-opener--not only did I feel the same emotions, I felt these emotions during the whole movie regardless of changes in plot or character. I also started to forget that these people were actors in a movie and started to feel for them as if they were real people with real problems. This is the first time that this has happened with a fantasy, or science fiction, film. I even went to the film a third time (still at full price) just to see if it still made me feel the same. It certainly did, only even more so. I have now come to the conclusion that Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" films (not just "ROTK") are among the greatest movies that were ever filmed. Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" films are perfect in way that Tolkien's books themselves are perfect. Which is not to say that the films (or even Tolkien's books for that matter) are without flaws, but that the films (like Tolkien's books) are masterpieces that reflect much of the minds of their creators. The fact that Jackson is not Tolkien (and visa versa) means, at least to me, that rather than a mere filmization of the work we have two completely separate, if at the same time completely related, works of art. Both are masterpieces, and while it is true that Jackson's films could not exist without Tolkien's books and the primacy of creation goes to Tolkien, Jackson's powerful vision gives something back to Tolkien. Having seen and loved the films I will never be able to read Tolkien in the same way again. Peter Jackson in "Return of the King" has done the miraculous--he has made Tolkien new for me again.
10.0~The supreme film adventure of our time finglonger24000 Sign in Permalink Just by saying its the greatest action film of all time, then breaking for lunch, doesn't do it justice. It was the best film, not only of 2003, but in years. A stunning ending The ending is so spectacular, Frodo's climb up Mt. Doom with Sam and the ring is a masterpiece of a scene, as well as the battle inside the mountain and the finale afterwords. Great battle scenes the Battle of Minas Tirith may be the most intense battle scene since the beginning of Saving Private Ryan. Even a little scary Gollum is frightening with his multiple personalities, as well as the intense battle with Shelob the Spider and Aragorns meeting with the ghosts. All in all A spectacular film, visually amazing, and even good acting, which you don't see in films like these **** out of ****
8.0~Most Overrated Movie On The Planet! boys-goldennotebook Sign in Permalink I only give this movie an eight, just because it was entertaining with decent action sequences, but apart from that being rated an 8.9 is highly overrated and its a longing 3 hours long which makes the movie even vaguer at stake. This movie is so boring and there are really unnecessary scenes in this picture. The whole sequence with Aragorn and the princess is stupid and it gives unnecessary story lines to the movie. I rank Frodo as a weakling with complete over drama on Elijah woods part and basically stating that he flopped like a deer when "the eye" almost saw him. Peter Jackson has recreated the series into a charming, entertaing, bunch of movies but they don't deserve all the recognition and the 17 oscars, I mean come on, thats ludicrous its like India winning the World Cup.

10.0~Best Cinematographic Masterpiece Ever Made florian_florica Sign in Permalink It is such a good mix between almost any kind of movie genres, the best adventure-drama-action film, mixed up with thrilling scenes, and a little bit of comedy and mystery. Such a perfect recipe for making this perfect cinematographic masterpiece. New Zealand landscapes which are part of the film made, in my opinion, the difference between this film and the other good films of our movie history. Almost all the actors are now famous because of the lord of the rings films so this says it all... At the same time, all the soundtrack is majestic and thrilling at any part during the film. Peter Jackson undoubtedly made history producing the Lord of the Rings films and especially the Return of the King, he will remain in history for ever and he will never be forgotten.
9.0~Excellent, but dragged on a bit. anubissy Sign in Permalink An excellent conclusion to an excellent trilogy, as good as i expected it to be. I found that the last 30 mins of the film dragged out a bit, maybe the film could have been a tad shorter. I might have only found it a bit long due to the hour I watched the film, the midnite showing.. Maybe watching it at a more sane hour will make it more manageable ;P Still, excellent film.
10.0~Honest to the book, technically sound; a visual treat enigmaticleo Sign in Permalink I know its not necessary for a movie to be honest to its book but when it is, the praise that comes its way is well earned. The closest of the 3 movies to the book, it was the finale that closed an epic. Sequels are never easy to make (ask Lucas about it) since comparisons are inevitable but this movie surpassed expectations and came on the very top. Ofcourse there are reasons for it. Firstly, there already was a script, and secondly, the 3 movies were shot together. For those of us who had read the book, the charm was to enjoy its implementation and for those who belong to the 'other half of the English speaking world who are yet to read the book', it was a mystical story told with some spectacular special effects. This is the trilogy that makes everything ever on cinema look small and the finale deserves to be the numero uno film till date.
10.0~THE BEST MOVIE EVER! iluvbball90 Sign in Permalink This movie, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, is the greatest movie ever. I enjoyed the other two LOTR movies, but lets face it...ROTK just rocks! I thoroughly enjoyed the action in this particular film because it included humor...WELL DONE!
10.0~Stunning, absolutely stunning... goth_marilyn Sign in Permalink This has to be the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life! The acting, the storyline, the action and the end of an amazing trilogy! I must have cried about 18 times throughout the movie, the time flew by and I never wanted it to end. The characters and the bonds you form with them is so rare, I have never gotten into a movie so much! Please see it, you won't regret it! I loved this movie and want to see it again and again! Overall: 10/10 P.S Doesn't Pippin have a gorgeous voice?
10.0~The Greatest Film of All Time!!!!! danyrats Sign in Permalink This is the greatest movie of all time. From the dialog to the story. Has some of the greatest characters and some of the most emotional moments. Has one of the greatest, and most underrated soundtracks ever. There is a big reason this movie won 11 Oscars(should of won 12 for Sean Astin's incredible performance, and it should have been nominated for another for Andy Serkis's (Smeagol) outstanding performance in the beginning scene of The Return of the King). It has the best writing of all time and is just such an amazing movie. Never gets old I have seen the movie 5 times just in the past year. Peter Jackson is a genius and J.R.R Tolkien is a God. The characters are so amazing. Aragorn: The most humble character who led an army to victory and helped Middle Earth be saved. His battle speech is one of my favorite speeches of all time, and his line "For Frodo" was epic. In the ending of The Return of the King when he said to the hobbits "You bow to no one" was just so powerful and amazing. He is one of my favorite characters in this film for sure. Gollum/Smeagol: Corrupted by the power of the ring and can't control it is amazing and his two separate personalities are different. That one scene in the very beginning of The Return of the King was just awesome. When he kills his friend Deagol for the ring. Gandalf: One of the greatest characters ever. So amazing how he pretty much saved the whole of middle earth. YOU SHALL NOT PASS was epic and how he came back to life to finish off his mission was amazing. Merry/Pippin: The lovable funny twins brought entertainment every time they were on screen. Merry's stupidity is hilarious. How courageous such a small person can be was amazing Samwise: My favorite character in any movie or book(other than Severus Snape). The greatest friend anyone can ever have. His amazing speech in two towers touched everyone. He should have won an Oscar or at least been nominated. He is amazing in The Return of the King when he is telling Frodo about the Shire and his sadness when Frodo decides to keep the ring. When he saved Frodo from the spider and from the tower in Mordor was so epic. He is the friend everyone should have.
1.0~shockingly awful cinematography... phil-932-237806 Sign in Permalink I could not watch this properly, far too much shakycam jerking the camera around all over the place, could not see what was going on without feeling dizzy... I recommend you give it a miss unless you want a headache.
1.0~WORSE THAN STAR WARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(just about) DeadlyOutlawREKKA Sign in Permalink I think it is the worst film I've seen in a long time and I've seen the original Star Wars.The characters are so annoying and I wished they all died at the end of the film. I wised Orlando Blooms character Legalos would be shot in the face with an arrow by Lurtz. Also I think Aragon should get a hair cut and have a shave because ll you see is hair! Also what is up with that little guy Gimli he is so annoying he makes little jokes (which are not even funny) during a supposedly serious film. The group always overact about everything what is the point of Leglos saying "Blood has been spilt this night" and walking right up to the camera this look very mincy. How did it win Best Film Award! How did it win any award!Also the other two films were just as bad They could have cut the films lengths by half if they did not put in so much pointless chatter. It would also help if they had real actors and did not rely on CGI so much
10.0~here at the end of all things rosscav3 Sign in Permalink I can not say enough words about this trilogy, and especially not about the way this movie tied it up. I have to admit that last year, I was slightly disapointed with the Two Towers; it did not quite live up to the Fellowship in my opinion as far as likeness to the book. The Return of the King made such an end to this trilogy that will never be forgotten by moviegoers or (hopefully not) the Oscars. My only complaints were that it felt a little too rushed, especially at the end. When I first heard that Saruman was cut I was very upset, but I completely forgot about him after ten minutes. I definitely look foward to seeing him and the other filmed scenes (Houses of the Healing, Faramir and Eowyn, Mouth of Sauron, etc.) in the Extended Edition but not having them in the Theatrical Cut makes something to look foward to in November. Overall I give this movie a 10/10 and commend Peter Jackson and all of his crew. Here at the end of all things, I realize that this trilogy now outweighs Star Wars (yes, even the originals) and Indiana Jones in my book. Thanks for listening to me. ~rOss
3.0~Overrated maverickpl Sign in Permalink Minus the special effects there is nothing redeeming about this movie. The characters are one dimensional. The story lines (of which there are several) are predictable and uninteresting. The ending is far far far too long and completely unnecessary. Even the way this movie is filmed isn't particularly interesting. Every third shot seemed like a pull away crane shot or an aerial computer generated fly by. The film did do a good job of wrapping up the trilogy, but otherwise I was unimpressed with this movie and the other two for that matter. What really bothers me is that contemporary movies, especially science fiction movies get rated so highly on this site. There is no way this movie is better than Casablanca or La Dolce Vita. Yes, I would say it was mildly entertaining for a popcorn movie, but at 3 hours it was just too much.
9.0~A++++++ ajrabbits Sign in Permalink This is an excellent movie. I would say the best out of the three. Superb acting by all and the special effects were outstanding! Sean Astin was the best, he deserves an Oscar nom this time. What an emotional rollercoaster. I will definitely "return" to this movie over and over again! A+++++
9.0~Film Review pedro_velasquez Sign in Permalink In Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) is the last movie of the lord of the rings trilogy. (Spoiler) In this movie Frodo(Elijah Wood) and Sam(Sean Astin) are close to Mount Doom where they are playing to throw the One Ring on the Fire. On the other hand Gandalf(Ian Mckellen) and Aragon(Viggo Mortensen) are leading the World of Men Army which is going to fight against Sauron's army. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam(Sean Astin) have been away for a long time and the rest of the fellowship doesn't have any news or know if anything has happened to them. Smeagol (Andy Serkis) is leading Frodo (Elijah Wood) to Mount Doom. (Spoiler) Multiple plots occur during this movie. One of the most important ones is that World of Men army is not as powerful as the orb army. Even if they added the young men to the army they would still not be a match for the orb army. Elmord(Hugo Weaving) has the sword put together and gives it to Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) to take back his place as king. Also the Eye of Sauron is able to get into Pippin's (Billy Boyd) thoughts and see what the plans of the fellowship were. There is no other film like the Lord of the Rings but if any other can come closer to it, it would be The Matrix because they were also on a war to free humanity. Lighting was a very important technique use during the film. It allows the characters to become more realistic, by having the view focus on the amazing backgrounds or clothing rather than facial expressions. Since there were hobbits and humans together in some scenes the lighting helped disguise the computer generated characters and make the screen very realistic. The angles were also very important, they help the cameras make some characters smaller than the others in other to have them look like hobbits. Most of the scenes for the movie where computer generated in order to make them realistic to the viewer they had to utilize the correct angle. Gondor and Minas Morgul where astonishing. At the end the movies Theme was that One Ring to Rule them All created with a different purpose than what it was intended and Frodo(Elijah Wood) got drag into the journey to destroy it. They accomplish their goal and it was a movie with a extremely well done ending.
6.0~A wonderful film, but extremely overrated. keelhaul Sign in Permalink I really liked the films, being a LOTR fan.(I read it 10 times or so, and I also read the other books about Middle-Earth) It's good, beautiful and everything you could imagine. BUT: it is clearly over-rated. Magnificent battle-scenes, etc. BUT: It did NOT move me, as the book did. (Which would be 7 out of 10, for me) So it is six.(I was somehow bored during watching it, and I really missed some kind of atmosphere that was in the book. Sorry.) Artistically it is NOT a great achievement. It is the best that could be done of LOTR. It _could_ have been better, if all the films were about 10 hours' long. My best vote goes to Two Towers (that part of the book is 8 out of 10), that film will get 7.
1.0~Simply ... awful ragerb61 Sign in Permalink I can not believe that this movie received all the awards that it did. It was long, slow-moving, predictable, and the acting was terrible. I can't believe that they cut out over an hours worth of video to get it down to this length. I wish that Gandalf would have just given Frodo a giant eagle in the first movie so that he could just fly in and drop the ring in the volcano and save us the pain of watching this series. I was also worried that there was going to be a love-fest between Frodo, Sam, and the other hobbits. Also, with all of the computer generated scenes, why go all the way to New Zealand to film it. At least it is all over with now.
10.0~EPIC Trilogy dmetuku Sign in Permalink As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, over dramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street. We all saw the catastrophe of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise. That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe- inspiring collection of films ever created. The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words. If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out). As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.
10.0~Staggering yet flawed jimmyjazz987 Sign in Permalink I just saw ROTK last night, and I must admit that it was a truly awesome spectacle. I enjoyed the first two films very much, but this film exceeded my expectations. Of course, there are those who will read my positive comments and just assume I am another "fanboy" with too much internet access and too little human interaction. But let me assure you that this film is completely worth it. I am not a fanboy, just merely a fan of cinema. I spent all four of my college years immersed in the film department at the University of Buffalo, and considered my self one of the cinema elite, someone who would never, ever watch something as Big Hollywood as LOTR (or go on to join the military and not completely use his film degree, but that is another story). ROTK is sheer spectacle, a technological achievement that will be unsurpassed for years to come. To miss it in a theater would be a crime. Battle scenes sprawl and swirl with such grandiose yet individual vitality. The massive armies move with such unique detail. that your eye won't let your mind agree that they are CGI. Moments of pure emotion, dread, fear, and pride swell like rising waves on the screen and throughout the audience. I'm sure there will be someone on here saying "the acting was weak", "they didnt stay true to the source material", or some other gripe. Yet, the fact is they still went to see it opening weekend, and were, on some level, undeniably thrilled. Fellow cineasts, ROTK is a MOVIE, not a film. It is here to entertain, maybe expand thoughts a little, but nothing more. Simply sit back and enjoy. You don't see all these whiny postings on here when hollywood adapts Shakespeare wrong do ya'? And folks, I've read Tolkien, and he's no Shakespeare, no Chaucer, no Faulkner, no Melville, etc....His poetry literally hurts, his narrative was questionable, and his style was erratic at best. But what he did have was an unsurpassed imagination, creating an entire world out of his own fertile mindscape. And thats what these films have; the cinematic equivalent of that great imagination. So fanboys, I ask you to quit the inevitable griping and enjoy this final installment; you may never see two men's imagination so vividly poured onto screen again. For the casual filmgoer, prepare to be completely enthralled.
10.0~A great movie lotrgurly Sign in Permalink I absolutely loved this movie. After seeing the first and second movies I was already a Lord of the Rings fanatic. But this one sticks pretty close to the book, and entertains you with action while giving you important, extremely deep life lessons at the same time. Love, friendship, and fellowship all encompassed into a action packed fantasy film. For me, the third and final movie was by far the best. It finally wrapped it all up, told you the end, and gives you a satisfaction about the character's lives in the future. The other films left you hanging. I enjoyed it, and bought it, and watched it again. I highly recommend this movie.
10.0~Why is this film number 4 all time? QuenyaSpeaker Sign in Permalink It should be #1!!! Titanic beating this, PLEASE. There's something wrong with that. I have nothing but good things to say about this movie. 1) Visually this was the greatest film I've ever seen. The Fell beasts, the Dead Men of Dunharrow, all spectaculer. Amazingly though, ROTK used a lot of bigatures. Minas Tirith was the most used bigature in the film. The model was over 15 feet high, and hand sculpted and painted. 2) The cast was probably the best ever assembled. They were not the most well known people, but for their role, they were the best. 3) Peter Jackson's attention to detail is unrivaled. Just to give you an idea, he had all the undergarments of every character hand sown and embroidered. THAT'S DETAIL. 4) The battle of the Pellenor fields was THE biggest battle sequence ever shot. 200,000 orcs and Haradrim against the forces of Gondor and Rohan. AMAZING. 5) Andy Serkis is the most valuable actor in this film. Like he did with TWO TOWERS, he does all of Gollum's moves using motion-capture. He supplied the voice and the moves. What he did was truly remarkable: he acted out the role with Frodo and Sam on set in his tightly wrapped mummy suit, then had to do exactly the same thing by himself wearing the motion-capture suit. Unbelievable. And the voice was hard too: he needed to drink a liquid which the cast and crew dubbed Gollum Juice to soothe his aching throat. When he makes the Gollum sound his throat gets scratched to the point where he could barley talk the next day. The Gollum Juice consisted of tea, honey, syrups and several other items. 6) Howard Shore deserves a monster pat on the back after this score. BRAVO! Extremely well done. I could elaborate on this movie for years without getting tired, but I'll spare the readers. Can anyone guess why my screen name is TheOneFan? Definitely MY greatest film of all time!!! *Alexander Smith*
7.0~Disappointingly predicable The_Wicker_Man Sign in Permalink *** Mild spoilers contained *** Well i waited, i prebooked my tickets and i queued for minutes but to be honest i dont think it was worth it! Dont get me wrong this is still a good film, but its not what i expected and its not what we've come to expect frm this otherwise-excellent franchise. The film was beautiful to look at, but then what else could be expected from Jackson after the previous two movies? The fight scenes in this film were perhaps the best out of all three of the films, but even they seemed drawn out in parts and yet strangely short in others - for example when the ghost army turned up i expected to watch them kick som ass but you saw tem take on a handful of orks and then the battle was won! Very odd. Where i felt the movie really lacked was in its plot. It was far too long for what actually happened within the film andit focussed entirely on 2 characters - Frodo and Aragorn. I know they're the leads and that the story is supposed to be focused on their lives but the film left Gimli with a handful of one-liners and the Ladies-Favourite Legolass with even less. His only role in the film appeared to be to look into the camera to distract from the fact that this film is actually qite disappionting. The predictability of the end of the film is perhaps what left the bitterest taste in the mouth. From the first battle of this film it became apparent nobody important was to be killed off during this film and at no point did i fear for the lives of Frodo, Legolass or Gimli. To see the King of Rohan perish was actually relieving because after being out-numbered in almost a dozen battles and still surviving was becoming ridiculous. Even when aragorn looked back to his army during the final battle at the gates of Mordor, not once did i think his time had come. The happy ending that ensued left me feeling cheated by a potential classic.
10.0~Awesome!!! cokeycyn Sign in Permalink You would think that there is no way to top "The Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Two Towers" , but Peter Jackson continues to amaze! In the DVD of the Two Towers, Elijah Wood warned us all to "expect MORE" and WOW did they deliver! From both a Tolkien fan's point of view and as an avid movie goer... this movie is awesome!!!
10.0~one of the most incredible movies ever made jamesmsp Sign in Permalink for me, the absolute best film i've ever seen.... it left me quite astounded and emotionally exhausted... the only bad thing i could say was that I WANT MORE!!!! ~is now counting down the days to the extended edition~
10.0~I dunno rem1 Sign in Permalink Stupid people will enjoy this movie but will say "it's really not all that great". Smart people will say this movie was beautifully done and almost perfect. Yes, the ending was long, but necessary. Just think of how many characters were built up throughout the three movies. They all deserve an ending. Try to think of the movie as 3 hours long and think of the ending as like the clips they show during the credits or an extra feature or something like that. Somethings I would have liked to see different or removed: { The ending was too perfect. There should have been more tragedy. However, you have to remember that Peter Jackson had no control over this. The book was already written a long time ago. The scene with Legolas jumping on that elephant thing should have been removed or somehow reshot to make it seem less crazy. I know elfs are strong and more agile but it was still a little crazy. Maybe some plot changes but the book was written a long time ago so I cannot dis the movie for those. That's about it I think. } Watch it more than once...read the books if you have the time...and try to understand. Great overall. Peace. Remy.
10.0~No words can describe how brilliant this film is, but I'll try! magikalcrab Sign in Permalink Admittedly, this is the first Lord of the Rings movie I actually saw in the theatres. This is because I was working non-stop when the first two were out. But enough about me. The basic point is that some people may feel this clouds my judgement. However I feel that Peter Jackson should be given a medal and the cast and crew knighthoods (or damehoods in the case of the females!) for this movie was utterly breath-taking the the way it was shot, edited and cast, let alone the effects and music! It all came together in a culmination that no movie I've seen has matched, and I especially love the way that the stories are wrapped up at the end- Aragorn and Arwen happy. Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin at home in the Shire, weddings, babies, Elves heeding the call of the ocean, and the rings of power where they belong. Return of the King was a true masterpiece and shall remain so for many years to come yet!
7.0~Disappointing PeterRoeder Sign in Permalink I had expected more of this movie but in the end it turns out just as boring as the book. I´d give this 7/10. It´s really nothing but the story of an old schoolmaster who has trouble manifesting his will to power and Freudian problems as well. The interesting characters are not given a chance while the boring ones are given full play in this last series. Also the computergraphics are uninteresting. What has Peter Jackson been thinking? Surely he could have done better than this.
10.0~The sheer breath of scale & attention to detail astound !! belinda-crawford Sign in Permalink Almost impossible to review this movie without sounding like some tragic geek but If you don't come away from this movie feeling like you have shared the best cinematic event ever... then please get someone to check you still have a pulse. Don't listen to all the hype, it is not without some fault but I have yet to see any movie that is 100% perfect. The scenery is spectacular, the effects superb, the portrayal of every character exquisite. If there is any justice OSCAR records would be broken. All this, and Aragorn's transition from man to King was really powerful. Beginning was great, ending was never going to be easy but I thought it worked as the focus had to be on the ring bearers.... My only criticism was the final fight between Frodo & Gollum for the ring was a little too long. Go & see this in the cinema and then spend the next ten months waiting for the EE on DVD !!!
10.0~About The Lord of the Rings. tanjir_anta Sign in Permalink Look, the movie was good. The best that can be done turning the compelling, but slow-paced and sprawling, Tolkein trilogy into a movie. I loved the books. I liked the movies fine. But I never understood the intense love-a-Thorn thrown to the movies - they aren't exactly masterpieces of anything but special effects (though the special effects were incredible). It isn't like there's any acting in the movie, and it isn't like they were somehow better than the books, you know? Its a fantastic movie. When I watch it 1st time, I was really shocked. Because I wasn't believing this film making. Thanks the movie maker. Also thanks the all artists of this movie. I think this is a idealism of movie making. In future, any one will interpreted for this movie. Again thanks all the artist and director of this movie. I hope that Bangladeshi director will inspire to watch this movie. And they will try to make as same movie.
10.0~A triumph for mind, heart and spirit Wajz-the-Puce Sign in Permalink How can a fantasy movie feel so utterly real? How can mythical creatures like Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits seem closer to your heart than almost any character from so-called "realistic movies"? That question may never quite be answered, but a fact is that Peter Jackson delivered big time with Return of the King. A grand finale to an already incredible trilogy, that delivers on every level. Yes, the action is incredible. Yes, the excitement is heart-stoppingly good. Yes, the wow-factor is there. Yes, it is infused with genuine emotion. And not unimportantly: yes, it stays very true to the books by Tolkien, and that's a good thing in this case. In short, Return of the King is an iconic movie, a stepping stone in cinema history, a brilliant exercise in story-telling that will always be loved and adored. This is, even more than 'Fellowship' and 'Towers' a movie where the mind, the heart and the spirit will end up being satisfied to the point of tears. This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. Only the original Star Wars comes close in terms of impact and in setting the standard for a new generation. It may well be another quarter of a century before Peter Jacksons vision is approached again, let alone eclipsed. 10/10... but I may have to downmark all my other 10's to 9's!
10.0~Mind-blowing matt_shute_07 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is my personal favourite part of Peter Jackson's amazing adaptation of J R R Tolkien's epic, though only by a narrow margin. The three films are in a different league to anything else I've seen. I wasn't even remotely a Tolkien fan until The Fellowship of the Ring first screened - now I read his work avidly, and that's entirely down to Peter Jackson. I (slightly) prefer RoTK to the other two masterpieces for two main reasons. First, the scale of it is even greater than that of The Two Towers. After seeing the battle of Helm's Deep, I didn't think I'd ever witness a better battle scene on screen. Then came the siege of Minas Tirith in RoTK. While not quite matching the sheer horror of the night attack of 10,000 savage Uruk-hai (considering the meagre defences), the Minas Tirith battle is just mind-blowing in scale. The relentless march of 100,000s of Mordor orcs, supported by huge mountain trolls, catapults, Haradrim and the undead Nazgul on wings... is simply mind-blowing to behold the first time you see it. Second, this is the concluding part, and therefore more emotionally involving and satisfying. You would have to be stone-hearted indeed not to be moved somewhat by the mutual friendship and love between Frodo and Sam - and the ultimate fruition of their courage. Returning for a moment to the great battle sequence of this film, I would have liked some dialogue between Gandalf and the Witch-King of Angmar (as in the book) but I can forgive this small thing. There are other differences between all three books and the films, some minor and some quite major, but none really damage the films all that much. For instance, I'm actually glad that Jackson omitted Tom Bombadil from TFoTR - a major character but one I personally find quite tedious. Other highlights in this film include Frodo's passing through Shelob's lair, the fall of Osgiliath, a great scene at Minas Morgul where the Witch-King first unleashes his vast army, and Frodo's final arrival at Mount Doom. In short, like the other two films, this is not just great but in a totally different class to the majority of films out there. As for people who hated all three movies, I can only guess that there is something dead inside them - the childlike capacity for wonder and awe, plus the willingness to suspend disbelief, that is required to get the most out of this type of story. Some people just hear the word 'orc' and become offended by what they imagine to be subject matter beneath them.
10.0~Awesomely Brilliant Ferg-12 Sign in Permalink I absolutely loved this movie! Not only is it the best of the series, but it is also the one that most closely matches the books in terms of the 'feel' of Tolkien and Middle earth. An Outstanding achievement!
6.0~A filmed, violent painting-book sascha-2 Sign in Permalink Before the first big battle in this movie, the "good guys" around Theoden do not scream "Victory!" or "Freedom!" - no, they scream "Death!" That made me feel pretty uneasy, because if even the "good guys'" only aim is the death of the "bad guys", then where is the difference between these two groups?! Compared to a movie as serious, adult and mature as "Mystic river", "The return of the king" is nothing more than a filmed, violent painting-book: 6 out of 10.
9.0~If you have read the book, this movie is a perfect realization of that experience. makers99 Sign in Permalink SPOILERS! I thought I would be let down because of my high expectations, but thankfully I wasn't. The battle scenes were truly breathtaking. I was on the edge of my seat, even though I knew what was coming! My favorite parts came when the battle was over and the king was crowned. It was so sad to see everyone saying goodbye. I feel as though they are my friends too that I am saying good bye to, which is sort of true, we have spent three consecutive years together. All the monsters and evil creatures from the book look great. The vistas and scenery are beautiful, Frodo and Sam's journey finally reaches its end, Eowyn gets to kick some butt, as does Legolas who battles an Olyphant, and Aragorn is excellent as he assumes his role. The army of the dead is an awesome sight, one of the best in the movie. All of my dreams from the book have been brought to life by the movie. This is the best onscreen adaptation of a book I have ever seen. Both experiences were enjoyable and I had the same feelings from both, I didn't feel cheated by the movie as some adaptations can leave me feeling. An excellent movie and I hope to see it win some awards, the cast and crew more than deserve it.

10.0~Amazing gonishamir Sign in Permalink Really tho, I've watched this movie so long ago and still remember how amazing it felt to watch this masterpiece.
10.0~A Touchstone for all others garddaljord Sign in Permalink A review of "The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"; Audio/sound: 10/10 "Return of the King" deserves much praise for its auditory work, making the viewer really enjoy this movie. Audio/music is a very important part of a movie, and this movie certainly reaches sky-high on that level. Every bit of music and sound mixing fits extremely well with the scenes in which they have been placed. Editing: 10/10 With a very few exceptions, the editing done for 'RotK' is close to flawless. It does not get confusing to watch, neither is it boring or slowed down at any time. The pace is done with the mind of a perfectionist. You are kept on your toes throughout the movie. Visual Effects: 10/10 Although not completely perfect, there is not any moment of bad effects which would have made many disappointed. They are in fact, extremely well done, and deserve 10/10. Screenplay: 10/10 The screenplay writers deserves extremely much praise for what has been achieved. When watching the movie, everything seemed to fit perfectly well. Screenplay is a very important part of any movie, and in comparison to 'RotK', no movie I have ever watched comes close to it. Directing: 10/10 Peter Jackson is a perfectionist, and he boldly takes on one of the hardest directing jobs possible, and, he succeeds! The 'LotR'-trilogy is beyond doubt the best that has ever been made, and 'RotK' is it's crowning masterpiece. Acting performances: 10/10 There is no best acting ensemble, but there is best performances by an acting ensemble, and in 'RotK' everyone does a truly amazing job. There is a harmony in the ensemble and all are clearly doing the best that they can. Every actor glows in the scenes which they are a part of, and makes the movie ever so much more enjoyable. 10/10! Art design: 10/10 Every detail, from minor to major, is done to perfection. We really get a feel that this is "Middle-earth", which is not by any means an easy job. In this movie, this remains one of the most important aspects, and is done beautifully. Costume designs: 10/10 As with the art design, this is also done to perfection. We really see "Middle-earth" and with very much thanks to the clothing and costumes. Make-up/Hair: 10/10 This too plays an important role, and is of course extremely well done. From the beautiful elf to the ugly orc, all is congruent and we believe what we see to be "Middle-earth". Summary: What we have here is a movie that is done with careful perfection and a loving heart and with the utmost respect for the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. The achievements of every part of the movie is undeniably close to perfection, and what we are left with is a stunning experience that will leave marks on anyone seeing it. It is no exaggeration to call this movie "the greatest of all time", and the evidence is there for all of us to see. You don't have to enjoy the story to see that what is created is a masterpiece of movie-making. This is the only movie I have seen that deserves a "10/10" overall, and I am in fact surprised that it is not above all others at the "top-list" of IMDb. But on top of the list or not, this IS the best work ever done in the motion picture market, and has made movie-making into an art!
10.0~One the greatest movie i have ever seen Demyxq8 Sign in Permalink one of the greatest movie i have ever seen its squeal to LOTR two tower the actors are amazing and also the story its amazing its contains lots of goods scenes u have to watch lord of the rings trilogy before u die and thank u peter Jackson for this great movie there's no good movie like the lord of the rings basically the lord of the rings trilogy are amazing and also i hope you like it
10.0~Greatest film EVER? Agent L Sign in Permalink Um, perhaps not (Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai still hold those positions for me), but it IS the best film I've seen made in my lifetime, and dare I say it, the Lord of the Rings trilogy now supplants the Star Wars trilogy once and for all. I am flabbergasted at this monumental achievement. Yes, I'm a little sad to see Christopher Lee cut from the theatrical version, but what is, is. Otherwise, I can't think of one bad scene in this film, and according to Howard Hawks, a good film comprises of three good scenes and no bad ones. There are far more than three good scenes in here. Even the small moments are exceedingly well done, the dawning realization on the Orcs faces as the Rohirrim charge; the fog enshrouded battle of Osgiliath as the humans are picked off one by one made me shudder more than Shelob's scenes (and she made me shudder quite a bit); Billy Boyd is one damn fine singer. There is so much to see here, and so much to feel. I recommend it to the ends of the world, ten out of ten.
7.0~Too long tom1994 Sign in Permalink The movie is better than a kick to the face, but it is too long - I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I read the book(s) and felt the same way about them - TOO LONG! In fact Tolkien said he wanted, "to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them." Well he got the really long part of it down and so did Peter Jackson. I didn't rate this film lower because it is a good film, and it did manage to bring to my attention some parts of the story that I had forgotten. Of course the film (and the whole trilogy for that matter) left out a whole lot of stuff that I do remember (and that I liked) - but I can't complain too much - if they had put those parts in the movie I might still be in the theater watching it! 7/10
10.0~Utterly Magnificent Trantoriano Sign in Permalink This movie is definitely fantastic. Every minute of it is a delightful piece of magic that you can taste with total fascination. The work of the whole crew is admirable, for the emotions in this film flow as water in a waterfall... I must say, i didn´t have so high spectations for ROTK, but mister Jackson has accomplished his work in the best way. The only thing you can rebut or criticize to the film is the montage. It was so evidently that some scenes were removed by force and some abrupt changes denote that the edition was very complicated. Despite this problematic situation I believe that the work of this people is being rewarded for all the effort and passion put in it. You must see it; the epic will stick in your blood. (Thank god Peter Jackson love Akira Kurosawa´s epic work, didn´t he?)
10.0~a worthy ending to a great trilogy Hotspur-8 Sign in Permalink I saw the midnight screening, worrying if I would fall asleep and miss some of the film, however even though the film was 3+ hours long I was enthralled from the first scene to the finale. What an amazing work. My experience was altogether different from seeing the first two films. I have read the Fellowship and the Two Towers but had never finished reading Return of the King, thus (even though I knew the general outcome), I was able to allow the movie to unfold to me without saying as I watched, "That's not in the book...That's not there either. Thus I will say that this movie is amazing. It is a triumph of filmmaking, cinematography, special effects, and compelling drama. The opening flashback to Sméagol's "finding" of the ring enhances the One Ring's already understood psychological power. The film then starts to build energy and emotion and then delivers a powerful climax. What makes this film more believable even though it deals with fantastical images is that the emotions of these characters are real. We see in various characters the gambit of feelings and motivations. These heroes are not all supremely brave and daring souls. There is fear, apprehension, anger, reluctance and despair. Everyone said that the battle of the Pellenor Field will be greater in scope than Helm's Deep. I was not sure that was possible. How I was wrong. The Oliphants and winged Nazgul are not only formidable but deadly. Many of the battle scenes are as harrowing as they are amazing to watch. It is truly stunning. Jackson effectively builds further on the relationships that were built in the first two films. My only complaint is that other important yet peripheral characters are not developed more fully. However this would add time to an already mammoth film. As great as this film is, one must look at it as part three of a epic work. I don't think that this film can rightly be judged individually (although it does stand alone as a great film). Some say that the emotions are somewhat lost. I could not disagree more. The emotion builds over the three films and the climax does not disappoint. Peter Jackson uses all of the pieces of his "orchestra" to complete this masterpiece. This trilogy will be the measuring stick for all trilogies done before or after. 10/10.
10.0~Stunning... dhart-2 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the last movie in the Lord of the Rings triology. It continues where the The Fellowship of the Ring left off and contains the same stunning imagery and special effects as the first two movies. Anyone who enjoyed the first two will not be dissapointed. David
10.0~Immerse in an Epic Tale sempergumby Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson delivers again; while not perfect, Jackson transports us for a few hours to the wonderful world of Tolkien. The special effects, acting, and directing allow fans and movie aficionados to lose themselves in Middle-Earth. I love movies that I can immerse myself in and ROTK is definitely one of those films. Jackson is very skilled at capturing the theme of the books and ROTK does not disappoint. ROTK is not true to the books and like TTT there are a number of unnecessary added scenes as well as scenes that would have explained things to those who hadn't read the books. Despite its imperfections ROTK surpasses the expectations fans had for painting such an elaborate tapestry the reflects Tolkien's beautiful but terrible world. Definitely another 10, the strengths of this film soo far outweigh the weaknesses that 10 is the only rating I can give it.
8.0~Great is the only word to describe it Hellsinger Sign in Permalink I have seen the movie when it came out for the first time in Manchester. I will only put a few points that will be of help. Even though the movie is like 3 hours long, the time really flies by. The battle scenes are so breathtaking that the viewer simply relives them in the mind. Although, the Two Towers was emotional, the Return of the king is even more. I really wish we went back to days of swords and shields and the courage of men, because this movie shows all that. Especially the last battle when Aragorn charges the ennemy alone. -I can always compare it to the 1980(?) cartoon, and this movie was definitely more deep. It has many elements, i doubt even the book has. In so many ways, this movie is better than the book, especially the finally logical ending. Compared to the cartoon, the movie also had many ogres fighting alongside orcs, but also evil men of the South. As a future worker in the cinema business, i always admire the deepness of the detail in those movies. In particular this one. All the shots are simply fantastic, and the camera angles perfect. It mixes the in-battle camera view with an external view, for example when the piece of rock flies out of Minas Tirith...From a design point of view, the trilogy is simply excellent. Even though there are three movies, as there are three books, i still consider it as one big movie, i cannot say which part is best, since it just builds on previous stages. I just consider it as a 10 hour movie, without seeking to break it up. The Return of the King shows the proper use of cavalry though, as Theoden leads the piercing charge into the ennemy lines. Thank you Peter Jackson, and all the crew without exceptions for delivering such a high-quality movie :)
10.0~The Best Movie of all Time! Southy01 Sign in Permalink With the final installment of the LOTR trilogy, The Return of the King delivered everything I had hoped for. It was emotional, intense, funny and brilliant! The music was amazing and the battle of Gondor was the biggest battle scene I had ever seen. The mass Calvary attack by Rohan was amazing! The Battle of the Black gates was amazing. It was awesome when the Eagles showed up and all the men fighting. The movie was also chilling when it came to Shelob's lair. Gollum( Andy Serkis) had his best performance and really brought Gollum to life! Overall I give this movie 11 stars out of 10. The best movie I have ever seen and the best movie of all time. Also, nothing could ever come to the emotions of this movie with the depature of Gandalf and Frodo and with the music they used for scenes. Return of the King stood out and made it seem real.
10.0~A truly superb film--ironically pieces missing and ending depressing screenhound22 Sign in Permalink Okay be warned SPOILERS WITHIN This is truly an awesome film and it definitely deserved its Oscar. All the performances were great, the direction and cinematography were superb. But there were one or two quibbles. Just a general plot comment for openers. In the film (though probably not the book), a big part of the reason that Aragon had to approach the cursed army was the attack of the pirates that only he and the elves knew about as the Rohan forces were preparing to leave for Minas Tirith. So he proved his credentials and recruited that army of the undead. Then, they all surprised and eliminated the pirates--OFF-CAMERA. How, precisely did they do this and where did they intercept them? We aren't told. They appear as almost dei ex machina to eliminate the rest of the siege force. I'd have been interested in the pirate battle (but then the film probably would have been a full four hours). In my opinion, the third film also had a couple (probably unavoidable) failings. 1. Unlike the first two films, the third didn't portray the weight and difficulty of bearing the ring enough to demonstrate the Herculean labor that Frodo was undertaking. Quite honestly, for most of the film, I was more impressed with "Samwise the Brave." 2. This one is also probably mostly my fault. Arwen loves Aragon and he loves her. That's given. Apparently, she gave up her immortality to safeguard him during the war as much as possible. I have to respect that. Possibly because of the screenplay choices (but isn't the romance between Arwen and Aragon a mere footnote in the text of the books) we aren't really reminded of the elf princess and her personal courage and love quite enough to do her character justice. In the films, particularly this one, Eowyn strikes me as a much better match for Aragon at least during the war--the warrior king and queen uniting Rohan and Gondor and safeguarding peace. Of course, the two kingdoms are joined another way that's equally valid but the relationship between Faromir and Eowyn isn't developed AT ALL on film. Did they speak to each other before they got engaged? They must have, but how did they bond? 3. The ending--at least as far as Frodo is concerned. I have to admit that he has the hardest row to hoe in the entire saga and he puts himself through no end of torture and danger to save the Shire. And his reward for all this is--an inability to enjoy peace (rather like combat fatigue syndrome) so he has to leave with the elves. By the way, why didn't Legalos have to depart on that transport. I guess this was also a self-sacrificing move to give Sam peace, but why couldn't Sam have enjoyed his family life with his best friend and former employer as a neighbor? Once again, an excellent film that should definitely be watched. Those were just some questions I had coming away from the film.
10.0~Praise them with Great Praise documentaryman Sign in Permalink Now that this 12 hour film is complete the process of evaluating it can properly begin. It's not perfect - what is - but it's not far off. What a stunning, magnificent, accomplishment. To all who worked on it, Praise them with Great Praise. They have created one for the Ages.
10.0~Jackson comes of age Sparrowmaniac Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson finally completes his epic tale, and what a tale it was. An unforgettable journey through middle earth comes to an end with the destruction of the one ring, and Sauron, the dark lord. The Age of men comes and the elves and the wizards leave the middle earth. That's just about what happens in the movie. But nothing can be expressed, about what the actual experience feels like, the fight on the fields of Gondor, the Rohan's armies war cry, it still fills me up, with emotion. It's just about perfect. I mean I literally cannot write anything about this movie, untoward. The special effects will be a benchmark for days to come, the score was mind blowing, the acting was stupendous, the screenplay, costumes, well, I'm running out of words to write in this review... It's a must watch for every man, woman or child capable for a movie going experience... A perfect 10/10...
10.0~Finally, a finale that didn't disappoint mitwee Sign in Permalink Nothing is perfect, but this movie was as perfect as it gets for me. I've never had such high expectations for a movie, but this movie met or exceeded them all. There are some changes from the books, but they make sense and are few. Completely enjoyable.
10.0~The best movie ever ? daniel1974nl Sign in Permalink I just got home after a long night. Seeing all 3 movies in a row and finally saw the last one. Return Of The King is as good as 1 & 2 together. We went there seeing it, realizing we might see a good movie, but that it wpuld be so good. Not even in my wildest dreams I could have imagined a movie like this. I think Peter Jackson should not only got the Oscar for best director and best movie, but a special one for a Life Time Achievement Award as well. Some here were complaing that it was long and that it was raffled off. Personly I dont think so and really think that for once they not not raffle it off, and took all the time to tell the plot and bring the stories together. That this meant it would be a long film, is something I really did not care about, and cant wait till the directors cut. The last 45 minutes are probably the most touching of the whole trilogy, I really had to swallow a few times by certain scenes. Whatever others are telling you, whatevery you feel, be sure that you dont miss this one, cos else you might miss the best movie of the year, if not of all time.
8.0~homoerotic overtones.... kyrat Sign in Permalink I will have to reread that book, I certainly don't remember such homoerotic overtones in the book. All those lingering looks, protestations of undying devotion, etc. etc. At the end we were cheering for Frodo & Sam to kiss! :) (Even the other hobbits Pippin & Merry seemed more like a couple than just friends). They almost could've just left out the three women in the trilogy and made it completely male centered universe. It was quite amusing to watch from this perspective. It was also an excellent movie and a fine adaptation of the trilogy.
10.0~My first "10" rsaintj Sign in Permalink I never thought I'd give a 10, let alone to such a big-spectacle type film, but I'm happy to make an exception for ROTK. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for the gift of this trilogy. Never as an adult have I been immersed in a film experience before. I thought I'd lost that ability after "Star Wars". I now hand the reins of my favorite all time film to ROTK, and my favorite film trilogy to LOTR. I had high hopes for the SW prequels to bring an adult sensibility and modern sophistication to what was the best film series of all time. Who'd have thought it would be Peter Jackson and LOTR? The only downside to ROTK? It hurts to say goodbye to these remarkable characters and creations.
10.0~My world is made anew Enayla Sign in Permalink I am, and always will be, an avid fan of Tolkien's books. I suppose I am different from some fans however, in that I don't mind changes made to the books when they're translated into movie. I had high expectations upon entering the theatre last night. So high expectations that part of me was, perhaps, a little worried that I would be let down. From the moment that the movie started, though, until the very end - I was pinned to my seat with the realisation that no matter -what- my expectations had been, they were not ENOUGH. I could never have imagined the movie would stun me like it did. I went there thinking I would see a movie as great as my other favourite movies -- -- What I found was something so far BEYOND any of the movies I've ranked as my top movies previously, that to give it any rating I would actually have to go back and change the tens I've given to other flicks into fives. That's how much better it is. It's inconceivable. I'm not even entirely sure if I can rank it as a movie at all. It's more of an experience. An epiphany. Something else altogether, so well put together and so FLOWING that I must have cried through half of it, and sat with my hands clutched to my heart for the rest. It is beyond me how someone could claim that fans of the books can't be fans of the movies. It is, in fact, beyond me how a fan of the book could NOT be pushed over the edge and into pure worship when seeing something so beautiful realised so gorgeously. I adore you, Peter Jackson. I wish I could meet you, I wish I could shake your hand, and I wish I could somehow thank you for showing me something as unique as this. I wish I could thank [all] of the cast for their enormous performances, and that I could somehow show my gratitude to the script writers, Howard Shore, the musicians, the stunt crew, WETA, and anyone, everyone, and everybody who had even so much as a tiny part of making this complete. So, thank you.
8.0~too much frodo/sam/gollum tbbnbb Sign in Permalink The amount of sam/frodo/gollum was too long for a movie. The same sense of pain, frustration and suffering could have been had without subjecting the audience to the same fate. The ending section could have been longer. I was looking forward to the battle to retake the shire.
10.0~The buzz behind Peter Jackson's final trilogy installment is more than we might expect. earlejohn3 Sign in Permalink Majestic. Mighty. Glorious. No other words would be fulfilling enough to describe the final chapter in Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's, 'The Return of the King.' A work of cinematic art that we, as tortured movie-goers, haven't been treated to for decades. However, we are all asking: is this one good enough to seize the little naked gold statue? Oscar experts are readily saying, "Yes", but there is always that ever-present fear in the back of our minds; a little voice that says, "That's what they said last year...and the year before!" Truthfully, nobody can really know how the game will be played out in the next 2 months up until Oscar time, but for some odd reason there is a special air about Jackson's final installment. If the first two chapters in the trilogy, ('The Fellowship of the Ring', and 'The Two Towers') lacked anything at all, is was a strong emotional side to the story. Jackson and his team perhaps have learned what exactly the Oscar voters are looking for: drama. 'Fellowship' and 'Towers' received handfuls of technical awards, (Film 1: Cinematography, Visual Effects, Make-up, Score; film 2: Visual Effects & Sound Editing) but neither one took home Best Director or Best Picture at the Oscars. Who can guess what exactly the Oscar voters wanted in their Best Director both times around, though when 'A Beautiful Mind' grabbed Best Picture over 'Fellowship' in 2002, Brian Grazer, the producer of, 'Mind' came up on-stage to accept the award, and added courteously, "'It was very close', they said." The musical 'Chicago' won Best Picture over 'Towers' in 2003. 'The Return of the King' took a stylish turn for the better as it pranced into theaters across the globe on Dec. 16. Opening with a prologue-type scene involving Smeagol and how he came to posses the Ring, it drew us right back into Tolkien's vast world once again. The depiction of Frodo's slow progression into evilness as the Ring's hold on him grew stronger, forced us to feel the same pain he was going through...as we realized for the first time just how much the little Hobbit had changed since we saw him for the very first time back in Dec. of 2001. Sam melted even the coldest hearts as we saw his unconditional love for his master in a much more powerful light. As Tolkien once said, "His will was set, and only death would break it." How could there be a more superior story? There isn't. Every moment in 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy' has lead up to this point. The point where everything that this fellowship has been through is put to the ultimate test. Even as Frodo denies Sam's loyalty and harshly turns him away, Sam never looses sight of what brought him thus far: love. That's the magic behind 'The Lord of the Rings.' Not the breathtaking visual effects, the exotic costumes, or even the vast sets and locations it was filmed on. (All of which are spectacular!) If this majestic film receives any award, it should be Best Depiction of Unconditional Love in a Motion Picture. I give it A++ and 101% for over-all achievement. "I can't carry It for you, mister Frodo, but I can carry you!"
8.0~Great finale to a great saga!!! Dennison327 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best movie of the three movies. It needed to go over a lot, with the 3 hour and 20 minute mark, but that time did not seem long and boring to me. I was hooked on that film from beginning to end, and to all of you who believes that this film is dull and too long, shame on you. If you had read the books, you would have known the length of the films, but I won't get much into that. All of the battles in this film are the greatest. The battles in this movie makes the Battle of Helm's Deep look like nothing! There is so much in this movie that is satisfying in every aspect. Great acting, storyline, directing, editing, and especially, the special effects. Frodo and Sam get closer to Mount Doom, with the suspicious Gollum, or Smeagol, as their guide. The one Ring will determine the fate of the people of Middle Earth, so it is up to the Hobbits. Aragorn earns his place as King and leads the world of Men to great battles against the servants of Sauron. The Lord of the Rings saga is one of the best ever made, next to the entire Star Wars saga. Return of the King is a great finale to a great saga, as said in my title. So this film gets a for-sure 10 out of 10 stars!
9.0~Amazing JokerMichel Sign in Permalink This is probably the best way to begin the 21st century with a great trilogy and this movie is the best way to end this amazing trilogy It couldn't have been better
7.0~Worst of the trilogy berlinmitte Sign in Permalink I have no idea why people freak out with this movie and vote it to #3 already. It's the worst part of the trilogy by far, it never finds its rhythm, the special effects are flawed, the music is overdone and it's boring. It really looks like a 6hr movie cut down to 200mins by some guy who has no idea at all of storytelling. Parts that must be short are overlong, others are way too short which could need some explanation. No character developments at all, hints at stuff that doesn't appear anywhere in the movie (confrontation of the witchking and gandalf for example) and a heap load of boredom really spoiled my experience. It looks like a 3hr trailer for the extended edition.
10.0~Best of the three drumtrav Sign in Permalink This movie was simply amazing. Definitely the best of the three. Hats off to Peter Jackson. I do not believe that anyone will be let down (ie... Matrix) in the last installment of this epic trilogy. I would like to know why some parts of the book were left out. Particularly when the hobits go back to the Shire.
10.0~Exceeds expectations (admittedly high) msuffern Sign in Permalink Thrilling conclusion to an epic film saga. As an avid fan of the books, my eagerness to see how the major plots points would play out in Jackson's retelling of the story was sky-high. My fears were unfounded, though, since for every momentous buildup of emotion and action, there is an immensely satisfying payoff. Also, whenever I thought the film was about to lapse into cheese (Faramir's sortie to Osgiliath, for example), Jackson and his crew deliver on a poetic level I've never seen in a film of this scale. Bravo for keeping the elements that comprise the film in perspective. Enough of superlatives, though. Go experience it!
10.0~The BEST movie ever made...!!! hemalmamtora Sign in Permalink First of all I salute Peter Jackson for this amazingly beautiful moving work of art. This trilogy is my all time favorite and will remain forever and i must say that it has touched my heart which very few movies have done till date. In terms of technicality its just PERFECT. The direction was on the mark. I did not, even for a single moment, feel that a particular scene or shot should have been taken in a different way. The part i Loved the most was the cinematography. Andrew Lesnie has done an extraordinary job. The editing and the sound are incomparable. Everything fits into place so perfectly. The set design is enchanting. The costumes are splendid. The most important part was to stick to the book (which is hardly seen these days in the fantasy movies). And by doing so Peter Jackson has created a saga that is true to its roots. I don't know why but i've often seen that directors decide to leave out certain very important parts of the book that make the movie understandable to the viewer. They instead decide to go for more flashier things. I was greatly disappointed by Eragon and Order of the Phoenix because they did not stick to the book and made me heart broken as the books are a masterpiece. The acting is awe-inspiring. In their own space every actor has done a convincing and brilliant job. Sir Ian Mckellen who is one of my all time favorite actors plays Gandalf with such elegance and ease, that he serves as a spirit of motivation. One of my favorite scenes is the one with Gandalf and Frodo in the cave in the 1st part after Frodo had seen Gollum following them. That scene touched my heart. I could go on and on about this trilogy. So to sum it all up i personally feel that this movie deserves the No. 1 spot in every list for all the reasons that make a movie the BEST. This trilogy showcases movie making at its best and must be, will be, remembered by generations to come.
8.0~Mighty movie,but some unnecessary scenes as well. larsson88 Sign in Permalink Very, very big and mighty, the battle in Minas Tirith is an awesome scene. Although i miss some scenes, Gandalf's meeting with Saruman etc. Some unnecessary scenes should have been removed and replaced with scenes such as the one i mentioned. Overall a great movie and a worthy end of the trilogy.
9.0~The Lord of the Rings sunwearvvt Sign in Permalink Very good movie to watch. I am looking for next chapter. It seems the end of story
10.0~wow klw83 Sign in Permalink Brilliance! Thats all I have to say about Tolkiens fabulous imagination and Peter Jacksons amazing way of bringing it to life and film! This movie made me cry, laugh, and kept me on the edge of my seat in suspense. This is by far the best movie I have, and probably ever will see in my lifetime! It deserves every bit of a 10 :) if not more...
10.0~VERY Impressed!!! RMBuster Sign in Permalink All I can say is Mr. Jackson and the gang have outdone themselves considerably. The SFX work was by far the best I'd seen on film to date, and the flow of the story was done quite well. Not to mention his use/accuracy of the timeline in the film, is outstanding. I'd almost say he didn't skip or misplace a beat in the entire film. The best part of the whole movie has to be that Jackson and crew actually finish off the entire book....by that I mean this movie really could have ended at the destruction of the ring (even though the book calls for more), but Jackson finishes the film in style and even adds a small bit to it in the end, but what an addition! I say bravo to you Mr. Jackson, and to your entire crew, a trilogy that can properly be called "The Lord of the Rings"! Thank you.
10.0~The End of All Movies Wallace_the_Windows Sign in Permalink Peter Jacksons' Lord of the Rings trilogy is likely to be the movie event of my lifetime. I may never see anything to equal its combined ambition, scope and cinematic invention in my days on this earth. People who carp at and critizise little individual facets of The Return of the King are surely missing the boat - it's like looking at the Statue of Liberty and saying 'Oooh, see there, I think there's a flaw on her elbow.....' For heaven's sake - these film-makers took on a vast, multi-plotted fantasy that defied being told on a screen. The fact that they didn't turn out a stinker is credit enough - that they told the entire story coherently and well, with every moment brimming with drama and visual imagination beggars belief. The project is the cinematic phenomenon of our time and anyone who doesn't see that, whether or not the genre of which it's a part floats their particular boat, just isn't looking. Having said all that, the Extended Editions of these movies are, for me, the definitive versions, so I await with huge anticipation the Return of the King box-set, where the sub-plots can be leisurely played out in all their glory. Maybe I'll post a full-scale review then.....
10.0~Absolutely amazing silverlve Sign in Permalink ...and so the story ends but it's a wonderful ride! Not giving any spoilers in this - only going to say: bring tissues and enjoy the amazing movie which Mr. Jackson gives us. Here's hoping he DOES manage to make the Hobbit, for this director/writer/producer is especially talented in making Mr. Tolkien's words into movies. 10/10 - in my opinion!
10.0~great movie adnan_drmc Sign in Permalink a great movie from the one of the best selling novels ever.ending was too sorrow for me but the theme tune was beyond imaginable.once you get the hang of it,you will be an addict to lord of the rings.I am now also watching the hobbit being inspired by it.hope that every one also likes it like I did.again you should keep your schedule because this movie is of 3 hours.But when you like it you would not move an inch from your seat without watching it totally.this movie won 11 Oscars and it deserves that.frodo baggins is now one of my movie favorite characters and all the characters are just wonderful see.From the fellowship to the mount doom each phase had a different theme to it and we can say after watching the movie the IMDb ratings should have been even higher.
9.0~No Loose Ends sumytra-2 Sign in Permalink When I saw the third part of this trilogy, I realized it didn't need to be a trilogy. The second part could have been left out. It had way too much fighting in it. I would say the same thing about this one but there was enough plot, setting, and character development to make this the best one of the lot. While the Fellowship of the Ring laid the necessary groundwork, the King Returns tied all the loose strings together rather nicely.
9.0~Fitting end to the trilogy Jonas-4 Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed the first installment of the Lord of the Rings. It worked on just about every level, and was as good of an adaptation as I could have imagined. I saw the midnight showing and have watched it three more times on DVD since, and it has yet to get old. I liked The Two Towers, but less so. I was tired when I saw it at midnight, for one. Two, there were far too many changes to the book for my liking. Three, it suffered from being the middle part of the trilogy. There was a pervasive air of desperation throughout the whole movie; and without any major changes in setting, plot or character to offset that, the movie suffered. I liked it overall, but watched it just once on DVD and did not enjoy it anymore. I think I will like The Two Towers more now. One gets the sense when watching Return of the King that Peter Jackson (like J.R.R. Tolkein did) views the Lord of the Rings as one work, one film. One that will not be complete until we have the extended DVDs in our living rooms and we can watch them all sequentially (all eleven hours of it). If anyone was disappointed with any individual installment of the trilogy, as I was, I recommend holding your judgment until it can be experienced as a homogenous whole. That said, Return of the King works on its own, provided you remember the other two films vividly. The battle scenes are more epic than ever, truly awe inspiring. Frodo and Sam are given a lot more to do in this one; their journey had all of the interesting stuff saved up for the last film, and it feels a lot more like the book for them. Merry and Pippin finally have something to do other than act like idiots, and it brings forth some great performances. The characters of Legolas and Gimli, alas, are reduced to pure comic relief and action, but I suppose sacrifices had to be made. Disappointing nonetheless. Gandalf seems a lot more human in this film, as opposed to the grandoise pomp of his character in The Two Towers. The plot rolls along very well, and the scenes last just the right amount of time. You may have heard that the end is too long, and it is. Keep in mind though, that the people saying this were in uncomfortable chairs at four in the morning. More importantly, as a conclusion to the film, it is too long. As a conclusion to the series, it is the right length, further cementing the idea that all of this is irrelevant until we can experience The Lord of the Rings as one film. I'll be waiting until then, but make sure you see this in the theater once, to experience the grand battles in their big-screen glory.
8.0~Not as Impressed as I thought I'd Be dbarbanti Sign in Permalink I was fortunate enough to see the trilogy as it was meant to be seen, or as good as it could get at this point. I went to an all day trilogy screening and, aside from the forty-five minute breaks in between each of the films, saw it as one. And I'm just not impressed as I thought I'd be. I do not deny the work that went into making this movie. I think it does the book justice however there are elements that not only annoy me about these movies but literally make Peter Jackson appear as though he has no directorial style what so ever. The over all feeling of the films are incohesive and stressing the fact that they were not shot in chronological order. I am not saying that movies should be shot in chronological order but usually when you see a film you get the feeling that what you just saw happened. I could easily tell that many scenes were shot on many different days and spliced together to get a complete sequence. Also how could any kind of cohesive directorial element be brought to the piece overall when Peter Jackson was only even present at maybe 40% the scenes being shot. He had two or three assistant directors that were at the healm of several camera crews just so principle photography coul;d be finished. And there is an air of that "rushed" element present. How could he mainain continuity....which brings me to my next argument: CGI IS GREAT IN SMALL, SWALLOWABLE DOSES. No, I'm not talking about Gollum, or Smeagol, I think the team at Weta workshop did an admirable job and hats off to Andy Circus. Mainly I speak of the fact that Jackson's lighting was mainly done by a computer program where you choose and highlight sections of frames or scenes and choose hues and intensities. On some scenes someone really went to town because I feel as thought I'm looking at Aragorn and Legolas in front of a blue screen...A simple sun set is not difficult to shoot. I got sick of the models...they were good ...but thats all...when it was a model, I could tell it was a model. Also the armies gave me a headache. I know of the huge numbers Tolkien spoke of in his book but there are points in the Tow Towers and Return of the King where one might say to themselves "did they not kill any!!!!!???" Plus the editing was poor on some sequences where you would have a medium shot of dialogue and in the background you would see an army two or three rows deep and then you have this sprawling wide shot overhead and the army is just this mass of identical bodies. Plus- and this is to who ever reads this- if you go to see Return of the King DO NOT clap every other scene- PLEASE! I was subjected to this and I don't mean "hey that was cool", I mean extended applause. It is not needed, we're all there to enjoy the movie lets do that. By the time I walked out of that movie theater I was unimpressed with the final product as a whole and ready to murder the majority of the audience I was trapped with. Overall- good but it could have been better. I wish more people would simply see through the title and criticize it. Pick out things that you didn't like- it's ok. Just because it popular doesn't mean it's perfect. It's not sacreligious to judge something.
10.0~A fitting climax to a peerless cinematic legacy pyrocitor Sign in Permalink As the saying goes, "All good things must come to an end", but seldom does one wish to refute such a statement as strongly as in the case of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien had become a holiday tradition, leaving the prospect of a December without Middle Earth an almost overwhelmingly bleak future. After struggling through over six hours of emotional investment, viewer expectations were at a critical peak: how could such a painstakingly, lovingly constructed journey possibly be brought to a satisfying conclusion? Suffice to say, the film does not disappoint, its ensuing 11 Academy Awards still seeming to fall short of properly appreciating the triumphant masterpiece of a conclusion. The title proves prophetic, as the film marked the true ascent of Jackson's films into the realm of abiding classics. Debate over which film can be regarded as the strongest of the three continues eternal and remains largely a matter of individual taste, but a strong case can be made for Return of the King being at least the most rounded of the trilogy. With epic, rousing battle scenes to match any set pieces of The Two Towers and heartfelt emotional moments to rival any in Fellowship of the Ring, Return of the King exemplifies the trilogy's strengths while providing the necessary catharsis for the entire painstaking journey. And an emotional climax it is, as Jackson delves into the darkest and most tumultuous expedition into Middle- Earth. From the first notes of Howard Shore's flat out stunning musical score, the viewer is ensnared, as Jackson generates gruellingly heartfelt emotional resonance with awe-inspiring ease. Only in the hands of such a confident filmmaker could such unbridled sentiment steer clear of the embarrassingly melodramatic, but in such an engrossingly crafted world, even the most stilted lines ring as rousing, genuine and emotionally resonant - it would be a feat indeed for any viewer, no matter how jaded, to hold back tears at the film's wrenching finale. Despite the occasional trimmed scene (fans of the novel may lament Saruman's death scene, seen on the DVD extended edition), Jackson as always remains obsessively faithful to Tolkien's vision, and while the enormous running time and conclusion after conclusion may prove trying to those unfamiliar with Tolkien's works, it is impossible to imagine a more satisfying adaptation of the timeless novel. But even viewers spoiled on Jackson's first two takes on Tolkien's fantasy world will find themselves spellbound by the visual mastery on display. Easily a pinnacle of cinematic aesthetics, Jackson's Middle-Earth remains an indescribably lush, expansive tapestry of imaginative beauty. Seldom has a world been so credibly and completely generated, with staggering attention to detail ranging from the vast action set pieces (Jackson gleefully indulges his schlocky horror roots with Frodo and Sam's eerie, unbearably tense battle with monstrous spider Shelob, and lets rip with the enthralling siege of Gondor. And if his cross- cutting between Gondor's face-off with the combined armies of Mordor and the overwhelmingly heightened volcanic climax at Mount Doom can become infuriating - I'm prone to yelling "GO AWAY, TROLL" at this point - it's testament to how painfully invested the viewer is) to the smallest etching on a soldier's helmet. It is such minuscule details which reveal that Jackson's dedication is not just to showy exteriors but in truly bringing to life the spirit of the source novels, and as such, The Return of the King proves peerless. Capturing an audience's interest and sympathies for three vast films in a row would be no easy feat, had the exemplary cast not created some of the most beloved film characters of all time. While keeping tortured protagonist Frodo an engaging and tragic lead instead of simply bug-eyed and annoying is a thankless task, Elijah Wood remains quietly charming enough to master the audience's sympathies throughout. Ian McKellen redefines the word class as noble wizard Gandalf, while mercifully still allowing moments of warm humour to slip through the cracks of his dignified solemnity. Viggo Mortensen's quiet yet ferocious charisma makes his heroic Aragorn a truly powerful and resonant figure, and Sean Astin infuses the wrenching journey of Frodo's noble companion Sam with pulsing emotion and endearing heart, a truly remarkable performance. The forever underrated Andy Serkis generates an enormously powerful performance, riddled with menace, humour, pathos, and exceptional physicality as the viciously obsessive Gollum. Bernard Hill emanates subtle nobility as patriarch Théoden, while David Wenham is truly compelling as discounted Gondorian noble Faramir. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan expand beyond comic relief to true dramatic sentiment as hobbits Pippin and Merry, and Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies continue their comic banter and exhilarating fight scenes as elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli to welcome effect. Similarly, the often overshadowed female cast members more than hold their own despite lack of screen time, as Miranda Otto is rousing and gripping as tenacious noblewoman Eowan, and Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler prove distinguished and mesmerizing as Elven royals Galadriel and Arwen. Such praise could prolong to the extent of the film's succession of endings. Suffice to say, The Return of the King embodies the strengths of a trilogy that, uncontroversially, can be considered some of the greatest filmmaking of all time. A truly stunning melding of exhilarating action, devastating emotional storytelling and sumptuous visuals, The Return of the King proves an engrossing epic of cinematic magic in its most most fulfilling, unpretentious form. Even for those normally dismissive of the fantasy genre, the last of Jackson's cinematic masterpieces is almost sure to enthral and capture the heart as next to no other film can. -10/10
10.0~Best of the three... erikvw Sign in Permalink Not that the others were bad in the slightest. My girlfriend knows the theater owners here so I got to go in for the employee screening at seven last night. Nice to see it in a theater not packed with people although the crowd would have made the battle scene more intense. I have new respect for Sean Astin after this one, he and Elijah (sp?) Wood both did fantastic jobs. The rest of the cast performed beautifully as well, but all 4 of the hobbits were done exceptionally well. Tears welled in my eyes as the Rohirian joined the battle at Pellenor and at the confrontation between Eowyn and the Nazgul King. The scene at the crack of doom was wonderfully shot and the deviations from the books were more than acceptable. I don't have the words yet to describe the feeling leaving the movie last night. I wanted to tell all the folks standing in line in the freezing cold last night that it is all worth it. I really hope this tops "Titanic" on the all time money list though I doubt it will. Peter Jackson and everyone involved deserve every bit of praise offered to them. I might even go see "King Kong" just because of him.
10.0~Best movie of all time ilkinmuxa Sign in Permalink I wish i could give more rating for this movie. Although today is 2019, i still watch LOTR and have never seen better movie. Full of adventure, drama, friendship, amazing things and etc. I am so happy to witness this movie in my life. Thank you Tolkien, Thank you Peter Jackson and everyone else
10.0~Brilliant! alexluna-204-99084 Sign in Permalink A great first film of the Tolkien books. No question my favourite film! I recommend good job to Peter and all the crew and actors for making this such a great time to spend watching :)
9.0~The tale is full in its telling. A finale worthy of praise. Phil_H Sign in Permalink Long has the road been, and long have we traveled it. The circle of the saga is complete, the ring of Doom is destroyed and Middle-Earth is saved from the vile clutches of the Dark Lord. It has not been an easy trek, to be sure; we've seen some very majestic scenery; we've heard the words spoken that before were only intoned in our minds. Through it all, we stood our ground with Aragorn, Boromir, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Sam, Pippin, Merry, and Frodo. Truly we are also a part of the Fellowship. Having seen now the long awaited conclusion to this epic trilogy, I left the theatre somehow wanting more. The ships sailed from the Grey Havens, the last of the Elves have taken their places in the Undying Lands, the age of Men has come  yet I so still wanted to see more. I wanted as well to see the battle of Eowyn and the Witch-King played out as it was written; I wanted to see Shelob in all her majesty. I was hoping that the final installment-that we have waited so very long to see-would be more true to the tale in those important places (well, they were important to me, at least.) At least I am proud to say that I saw King Aragorn kneel before the Hobbits in tribute. At least the Many Partings were relatively well displayed. And to hear Gandalf laugh! This is what I imagined. Indeed, it was like spring after a long winter; like water to a parched land. Pity, there was no Scouring of the Shire. No Saruman. No finale to the final film. For that I am sad. How I wished to utter perfection. Only to leave wanting Still, I will not weep over the ending, nor the telling of the tale. A marvelous ride it has been. So that leaves me with the paramount question: how good is it? It's good. Better than most films; but it's not as good as I had hoped it would be. Thus it cannot obtain a `10' rating. But is it on par with the other two? If you recall, I gave both The Fellowship and The Two Towers a `9' ratinghigh praise, indeed. The Return of the King feels like a hollow victory, in a sense, because I know that next year there is no sequel to tide me. Quite lamentable. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will acquire the rights to The Hobbit after his version of King Kong is finished. But I digress.. Surely, this is a good film, the main points of the novel are covered and the quest is brought to the ending as it should. In the end, I think, the finale is just as good as the others in the trilogy, and it is only my own sadness that we shall not see another next year that makes me hesitant. In my heart of hearts I know this tale is completed, full, and as near a vision to Tolkien's masterwork that could possibly be hoped. And it is with that feeling I shall follow. If you are a fan, or just a story completeist, then you must see this. This is the culmination of your desires and hopes. It's solid, and I give this a `9' out of `10' making this series well worth owning, well worth seeing, and well worth the price. I will be seeing this again. I bet you will, too.
10.0~Quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever made!!!! Snoogans28 Sign in Permalink Whats good about this movie? I have a better question, What isn't good about this movie. Filled with action and adventure. The special effects were amazing, along with the scenery. The acting was excellent. Far better than The Two Towers (which was also amazing), and a lot better than Fellowship of the Ring (also amazing). Even though Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli have little screen time, compared to the first two, they all made up for it. Aragorn, just being plain awesome, Gimli is hilarious, and Legolas was incredible on that Mumakil. I believe that Sean Astin deserves Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, even though he should get Best Actor. But NO ONE deserves Best Director as much as Peter Jackson. His devotion, and love for his film was superb! and to close, this movie should win Best Picture, for I have not seen better in the past few years.
10.0~I had high expectations, and they were surpassed! Vrian Sinth Sign in Permalink I have purposely not read any of the books, although I am a big fan of the genre, so I could enjoy the films without worrying about technicalities. I waited in line for 3 hours to get a good seat, and it was well worth the wait. I won't give any of the story away, but it was incredible and visually stunning. The storyline is perfect, ends are tied and the 3+ hour length of the movie flies by so fast you won't even realize it. This will easily be the best film of the year. The LOTR trilogy has surpassed my old favorite trilogy, Star Wars.
9.0~AMAZING! Anduin13 Sign in Permalink Few times in my adult life have I been so moved by a movie as I was moved by The Return of the King. There were scenes that were as near perfect cinematic as you can hope for. The charge of the Rohirrim should be remembered as one of the most amazing pieces of war ever filmed. I have never heard so many sniffles and people blowing their noses as in this showing. This is the perfect ending of an amazing trilogy. 10/10.
10.0~On the whole, a wonderful fantasy trip! ctremback Sign in Permalink Jackson has my gratitude for this film which far surpasses anything else offered or contemplated by Hollywood and independent filmmakers in this country. Overlooking the deviations from the books, i.e., the Ents not wanting to be involved with Middle Earth's troubles (not true, they were slow deliberating), our king's temper tantrum when he was told Merry and Pippin might have been killed, and the too obvious flirtation between Aragorn and Eowin, everything else is a fantasy feast not comparable with anything else I've seen in my 65 years. It far surpassed my creative imaginings and I never thought anyone could beat that.
8.0~An excellent film, but needed more editing! Polychrome9 Sign in Permalink A bit too long - no need for this movie to be the 3 1/2 hours it was. The first two films were so good, we know this one could have been edited down to under 3 hours! Minor changes in the plot, but basically true to Tolkein's essense. Top-notch action scenes, superb graphics, one of the best films of 2003!
10.0~A life changing film Drachaen Sign in Permalink This film is sweeping and epic yet never manages to lose its human touch. It has a message for each and every one of us and is as varied and personal as the many faces of Middle Earth. If you take nothing from this film other than this, you will be the richer: this is an important, a VITAL film because it has something to teach everyone and we are all the better for it.
10.0~About a Masterpiece stefanva Sign in Permalink I saw the movie 19 hours ago and still I am overwhelmed by the beauty and tension of this masterpiece. After seeing a first glimp of Minas Tirith (it is realy huge) I know it was going to be alright. I am not going to give anything away, just see for yourself. Some parts of the movie even gave me goose flesh and made my heartbeat go faster. It is just fantastic how Peter managed to film the third book, really briliant work. I was so happy when I saw 'the tower' and a few moments later 'the little bird' (acting as a messenger) in Gandalf's hand. People who didn't read the books won't know what I am talking about and those who did read the books: yes, it's all in it! Now we are all waiting for fall 2004 when the Extended Edition of The Return of the King will release. Let's hope it has the same additional 40 minutes as the Extended Edition of The Two Towers. All Hail The King! ps) Don't forget about The Hobbit: Peter Jackson is planning to film that book also :D
10.0~Noooooo it's over (sad face) alansabljakovic-39044 Sign in Permalink You had me at "My friends, you bow to no one. Masterpiece and best movie that won Oscar after the Godfather. I can't believe that the Academy recognized this masterpiece and gave it an Oscar. Performances are out of this world and Serkis is again amazing as Smeagol/Gollum. The end is heartbreaking and soundtrack is perfect the whole time. Clean sweep 11/11 Oscars is the best thing that ever happend to Oscars. They should remember that days and start giving Oscars for best picture to films that actually deserved Oscar( angry Blade runner 2049 fan).
1.0~Best of the 3, but still very average and way too long RIK-22 Sign in Permalink I have now put myself through the sometimes enjoyable, but mostly painful experience of watching these three movies. I have to say I do think the 3rd one was the best, but lets be honest, it didn't have much competition. One thing is for sure, this film and the trilogy as a whole is easily the most overrated event in history. Many films should be above this effort, in the top250. The problems: The plot, for starters, not only did it not make any sense, it was basically after 9 hours about destroying a ring and fighting a couple of battles. All the meaningless subplots and political gesturing really didn't add to the film. The characters weren't fleshed out at all, even after 9 hours. Could you really mention much about any of the many characters? As a result most of the time I couldn't care less about who was doing what and why. For a film, to be a classic, surely it must have some surprises or must be original in some way and perhaps more importantly stir the juices of our soul. All we had were some very good special FX, and some nice New Zealand scenery. The filming was very much join-the-dots stuff, nothing novel or clever it the way it was shown to the viewer. Do we really need to here the word `precious' again and again, do we really need to see yet another slow motion close-up of Frodo's face. All of this made the film and films over long and lacking in any substance.
10.0~Looking to criticize ga7ge Sign in Permalink I've seen the movie 3 times so far in the theaters and am aching for another. After being awed for the first few times, I came to the conclusion that there isn't much to be said in a negative sense. The acting was wonderful, the action was superb, needless to say that the battle scenes are considered the best I've ever seen in a motion picture. I guess the only criticism I have (which will probably be answered in the extended edition) is that perhaps Gandalf could have used his wizardry skills (aka magic) a bit more specially during the assault on Gondor where they would have lost the battle if Aragourn did not show up with the phantom soldiers. I didn't see him use a spell once... except for the Eagles that came and took care of the Mordor Wyvern looking monsters. I'm not asking for too much, just a little display of power like he did in The Fellowship of the Rings against the Balrog or in The Two Towers where he withdrew the power of Saruman from King Theodon in the Great Hall. The final criticism is that the movie should have ended ~20 minutes prior to it's actual ending. It should have ended with Aragourn and the entire kingdom kneeling before the Hobbits. Absolutely wonderful piece of cinematography. BRAVO!
8.0~A Theory to why some were disappointed LivingProof Sign in Permalink Before I went and saw this film all my friends kept talking about how good it was and that its probably the best film ever made. Even the voters on imdb thought the same. So you can imagine my excitement when I sat down in the cinema. First of all, its a good film, don't get me wrong on that. But the trick with sequels is to make something new every time to capture the audience interest. In the first film, "The Fellowship of the Ring", they told us about all the characters, showed us the beautiful landscape, the way that people lived and explained the incredible history of the ring and what had to be done. This film was mainly about their journey towards Mordor. It also had some great action sequence but not those huge battles between the army's, like the ones in the second and the third film. Here we saw how the different characters fought, and it wasn't the same fights over and over again. In the second movie they stunned us by showing the great army of the orcs and built up the excitement by showing us the moral being built in the humans heart, and we knew that they were ready to die defending the castle. You really got chills running through your spine. This battle was powerful and nothing like you have ever seen before. They also had some new characters presented that were very interesting And here it comes, the third film "The Return of the King". Like the previous films it started out very good and you couldn't take your eyes of the screen. And the scenery and camerashots was absolutely amazing! But then it was time for the big battle. OK, it was exciting, but we have already seen this kind of battles in the second film and it didn't feel special to me. Especially when they had these battles over and over again. It felt like watching an "ordinary" war movie. Don't get me wrong, the fights were pretty good but it didn't feel special. And like I said before the trick with sequels is to make something new and interesting. But to me it didn't feel like that. Once again, it's a good movie but I dont think it was better then the second sequel "The Two Towers" I have found out that Im not alone looking at it from this perspective. Tell me what you think! (sorry if the grammar or spelling wasn't correct. English is not my native language)
10.0~Masterpiece TLWB723 Sign in Permalink All I can say is that I am thankful to have been alive at this point in time to experience one of the true masterpieces of cinema. LOTR is to this generation what Star Wars was to the previous generation. Return of the King is a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy, and will go down as one of the best ever. It is an empty feeling to know that this the end of the journey and there will not be a new chapter next December. But that emptiness is overcome with the sense of happiness you feel for the characters. It hard to ever imagine seeing another piece of film-making a king that could rival Peter Jackson's LOTR. A ***** out of ***** for the Return of the King. And a ***** out of ***** for the trilogy.
10.0~A film full of brilliance, flair, luminosity and beyond the vivid intensity of the previous two. pinkliz41 Sign in Permalink This film is the true first epic for the 21th Century and most probably the unbeatable for a very long time. The film is incomparable to the last two. Going a step further and passing audiences expectations throughout it's world wide release. It became a betterment for films today, because of its vividly enhanced and well founded characters including the credible and uncompromisingly harrowing visual effects, that even Tolkien would surpass today. The directors vision has finally been realised, Jacksons dominant role of being one of the greatest directors have come swiftly and within the day count from six years ago, Peter Jackson released a competence of pure ignition and fuel powered, emotional, gratifying and extravagant film.
8.0~Wonderful realization, minor flaws tkdcoach Sign in Permalink The Return of the King fulfills the story lines from the first two Lord of the Rings films, tying up even the seemingly most unnecessary divergences from Tolkien's story. However, the price for Tolkien fans will be the failure of necessary and much desired tears to fall where they should rightfully fall. Jackson's masterful vision wins the day, despite some liberties taken. The battle scenes are perhaps the greatest of all film history, and certainly the most fantastic.
10.0~great bekahemily Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed this movie the story the characters and the graphics were great
10.0~Brought a grown man to floods of tears loco12 Sign in Permalink Well I finally got to see Return of the King last night. I had to wait two days because the cinema was sold out and I wasn't quick enough booking when the tickets went on sale. The wait was excruciating, as I had seen the other two movies on opening day and felt I was missing out. I had read nearly every review on rottentomatoes.com and knew it was going to be great, and guess what, it was stupendous! I must admit to being a tolkien nut. I have read LOTR about 8 times, also the silmarilion, and all of Christopher Tolkien's works on his father's material. Yes I have even struggled through The Notion Papers! So it was with great trepidation that the screen went dark and across the screen came those words cast in gold, "The Lord Of The Rings", together with that wonderfully haunting theme from Howard Shore. For over three hours I was entertained to the max. The visuals were so amazing I just didn't know where to look on screen once battle commenced. Even so the charactors were never swamped by the size of the battles,(or CGI) and we rooted for them all the way! I have read a few complaints about the multiple endings. I found them to be essential and perfect. Sentimental, yes. Forcing us to tears, yes, because we care about these charactors so much we want to know about Sam and Rosie and the rest of the "gang". Just one small point, that I didn't pick up on but the rest of my group did. As the credits rolled, they all said, "Why does Frodo have to go off on that boat?". They had all seen the other two movies at the theatre, but none of them had seen the dvds to recap. They couldn't understand why Frodo had to go away and leave his friends. I knew why, and explained it to them, but perhaps this should have been made a bit clearer to the average movie going public. Obviously the special edition 4 disk set will explain Frodo's problems on returning a bit clearer. And so ends what is to me the greatest film ever. I will probably go and see it a few more times before it's pulled from the cinemas, to make sure I take in all that can be seen on the big screen. Is it going to be a record breaker? It sure is! One billion dollars world wide at the minimum. In fact I am sure in a couple of years time, the demand will be so high that New Line will be forced to release all three movies nation wide in their extended versions.(to more packed theatres!) Oscars? Well I found the Oscar voters behaved disgracefully against Fellowship of the Ring. It was by far the best film of the year, and to be beaten by A Beautiful Mind showed just how out of touch the voters were. Whilst A Beautiful Mind is a good film, (and I own it on DVD) it is not a patch of FOTR, even taking into account the different genres. Last year The Two Towers was again cheated by Chicago, which I felt was even more of a snub. I just hope the academy was waiting for proof that Jackson was capable of pulling off all three films before giving him what is justly his. But don't hold your breath! Best Film, Best Director, best Visual effects, best costume, best musical score to Howard Shore, plus a ton of other minor oscars would be fair and perfect. 10/10 and my favourite of all time.
10.0~A powerfully and emotionally compelling conclusion to the trilogy! gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297 Sign in Permalink After the previous installment succeeded in reaching the same emotional levels of the first in this epic trilogy, Peter Jackson succeeds in bringing the trilogy to a close in Return of the King, the third and final installment which became a blockbuster epic back at late 2003. The cast/acting for the characters never fails to amuse me especially Andy Serkis when he steals every scene as Gollum. Elijah Wood and Sean Austin did great as their emotional bond between Frodo and Sam while on their journey to destroy the One Ring while the two other hobbits Merry and Pippin are not only hilarious, but heroic as well. Other characters, including Viggo Mortinsen, Ian McKellen, and Orlando Bloom (although bland) did great with their performances. The strongest aspects, however, goes to the fantastic visuals, solid special effects, the emotional music from Howard Shore, the action sequences with the battle against the army of Mordor as my personal favorite and it's tear-jerking moments where Sam gives Frodo strength by believing that he will never give up and the part where Frodo leaves the Shire left me crying some tears near the end of the movie. Even the song "Into The West" by Annie Lennox was memorable and tear-jerking it got stuck in my head. Overall, Return of the King is a great finale and has the same epic scope and sweep that makes this epic trilogy a lot worth watching along with most movies.
10.0~A true masterpiece which marks the end of the greatest film-trilogy of all time! MsSmeagol Sign in Permalink The movie does the book justice. It has everything one can ask for in a movie; excitement, friendship, loyalty, action and a story which proves that even the smallest person can change the course of the world. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is one of the greatest movies ever made!!!
9.0~Outstanding!!!! drafterman1 Sign in Permalink I watched the final instalment in the trilogy today with my family. Afterword, something occured to me. My reaction to the first film was 'Wow!'. After watching the second installment, my reaction was 'WOW!'. Now I have seen the final chapters of the film. My reaction - 'WOW!!'. I have never had a series of films impress me the way that each of these did, both singularly and as a whole. This final instalment of the epic tale is an emotional journey through excitement, awe, rage, desperation and sadness with the character's we love. The climax of the series reaches critical mass, then leaves us wanting more, but understanding that it cannot be. The specail effects, sound, and CGI use in the film were all outdtanding. The Soundtrack Orchestration was once again as much of the film as any of the characters. A masterfully done work. Thank you too all involved.
10.0~STILL LEGENDARY alcatraz-50267 Sign in Permalink We have already great movie. There is no need others.
10.0~Visually and Emotionally Beautiful robinmercier Sign in Permalink Might be the first movie that I have seen that both my friend and I had a lot of trouble answering when asked "how was it?". Finding a word from a huge list of positive reactions to describe it in the short manner that is to often expected is not a pleasant task. It is most definately POWERFUL, among so many other things.
10.0~Wow AValverino Sign in Permalink Better than the previous two and definately one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is so good, my friends who despised the first 2 loved it. The battle scene was so exciting people in the audience were cheering as if at a sporting event.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the lord of the New Cinematic Era gurthrog Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King can only be described as a masterpiece, it ends in a marvelous way the story of the Lord of the Rings. Spoiler Content: This Film moves you on many levels, putting you at the edge of your sit during the epic struggle between the forces of Gondor,Rohan and Mordor, bringing tears to your eyes when you watch Sam and Frodo's goodbye. In many ways, the most moving chapter. Friendship, Love, Honor, Hope are the Heart of the movie, because we might have the Great Battles or cool lines, but without a heart, there's no film. There are many memorable scenes,characters and themes,but just as Peter Jackson said, the heart of the movie truly lies on the internal struggle of Frodo and Sam's absolute Loyalty, their friendship and how the ring starts to win over Frodo's heart. You'll laugh,You'll cry, I know I did. The films of the Lord of the Rings,three jewels of amazing beauty, should stop been considered As a trilogy, but rather as one. For that's how Tolkien first intended it. One book. One Film. The Lord of the Rings
10.0~Absolutely Awesome! TomLong0507 Sign in Permalink It's difficult to process something like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King: Its very nature defies comparison. There has never been a cinematic endeavour based on a more daunting...or more beloved...literary work. There have never been motion pictures of the magnitude undertaken by co-writer/director Peter Jackson and his production team. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy will endure forever as one of the most bold and audacious enterprises in the history of cinema. It is, quite simply, a seminal event. Other projects (for example, a movie filmed in space) are already being considered and may someday be attempted. They may challenge LOTR's logistical complexities (or, at the very least, present a comparable set of obstacles), but it is unlikely the numbers of people involved or the sheer duration of the creative process will ever equal this effort. Jackson & Company have made believers out of millions of readers who doubted the works would ever enjoy respectable translation into a more "mainstream" media. They have changed the way production models are approached for large-scale projects. They have forged what may well be the premiere visual effects house in the business (WETA Digital). They have raised the bar for all filmmakers to follow, and reminded millions of jaded moviegoers of one simple truth: Love, attention, and genuine dedication to (and appreciation of) one's material can overcome inconceivable obstacles, and always...always shows on-screen. And now it's over. With the longest running time of any film in the cycle (early indications suggest next year's extended DVD cut will clock in at over 4 hours long), RotK is an all-out assault on the senses. There are times when it is simply impossible to take it all in: Armies of hundreds of thousands clash beneath towering war beasts as deadly, dragon-like bird-things strafe hapless victims on the ground. Mountainsides erupt with pyroclastic fury as lava flows labour to engulf our heroes. This film is off the hook, gloriously so. In tone and "feel", RotK rests comfortably between Fellowship of the Ring's penchant for character-centric drama, and The Two Towers' colder, more mechanical "war movie" approach. What we end up with, is, in essence, an emotionally charged war movie sprawling in scale yet intimate in heart, its effects are frequently overpowering.
10.0~As the jewel in the trilogy's crown, possibly the greatest movie ever made. frodriguez1 Sign in Permalink Brilliant in every way. Yes, it's long, but every time I see it (and I have the extended version of all three movies), upon reaching the end my only thought is, "My God, I have to start at the beginning of 'Fellowship' again. It has had just that profound an effect on me. Yes, I have read the books (both before and after seeing the movies), and they are truly great literature. Peter Jackson did the very best any director of film could do with such a massive amount of information--the actual re-creation of a whole world. I don't think anybody else could have done a better job. They deserved every award they won, and should have won more, as far as I'm concerned. The long debate over the acting awards... well, as Elijah has put it so many times, it really was an ensemble piece from start to finish, so how in the world could you pick any one out of the main group? Sean Astin was the obvious hero in "Return", and probably had the best chance of an individual award, but the whole cast was superlative. The actor who really changed my whole view on acting and actors, though, was Elijah Wood. An amazing person, a hugely difficult role, as the arc of his acting started up and had to go down to the very depths by the end. He did a truly incredible job and appears to embody the almost 'elvish' qualities of Frodo in his own personal life. An actor and a man of real worth. I will look forward to seeing his career advance as the years pass. This could go on and on, but in summary, the whole trilogy (with "Return of the King" as the jewel in the crown) must go down in history as the greatest epic ever made. ("Gone With the Wind" used to be my favorite. It now has the almost-revered second position.) A once-in-a-lifetime experience for any movie-goer.
10.0~The word "awesome" is used too often, but this film deserves it sallyt Sign in Permalink This film deserves every rave review it has received. For sheer spectacle, emotion, humour, and good old plain scale this film has the lot. Peter Jackson has done Tolkien's memory proud and we are all glad of it. This movie could have been just a number of spectacular set pieces, defined by the size of it's battle scenes and pyrotechnics. Instead, we have (occasionally silly) dialogue delivered with warmth and passion, genuine laughter, and real tears. Each character is developed much more than in the previous instalments. What a joy to see a strong female role in Eowyn of Rohan. Miranda Otto, Karl Urban and David Wenham have all achieved stardom through the trilogy and deservedly so. For me though, Sean Astin's Sam and Andy Serkis' Gollum are the highlights. Strength, bravery and loyalty in the first performance, manipulation, weakness, corruption and sheer physicality in the second. If these actors do not get at least one award apiece there will be no justice.
10.0~Something you haven't seen before, and never will again... reinvdbergh_ Sign in Permalink *** May contain spoilers *** 'The End' As the credits rolled on Return of The King and Annie Lennox's voice softly started singing 'Into the the West' I felt something I had never felt before concerning movies. Words almost cannot express my feeling towards this movie. It is almost impossible to write a review about this masterpiece. This is not a movie you see, it is one you experience. You get drawn into the screen and live the story. Because I loved the previous movies so much and absolutely adored the story (I have read the books, mind you), this was THE most expected film of my young life. I expected something pretty good, but this was something overwhelming, something mind blowing. I cannot write a descent review about it, so I will take some aspects from the film and discuss them. The story begins with Déagol and Sméagol having a innocent fishing trip, but a few minutes later it turns into a drama, with Sméagol murdering his friend (That's where Gollum's line 'Murderer' from The Two Towers comes from) and taking The Ring. Smart move by Jackson, putting this 'prologue' in the movie, so that people who haven't read the books know how Gollum came to be. In this film, you see more character depth than in the previous ones. With Sam and Frodo drifting apart, Merry and Pippin's separate paths, Aragorn accepting who he was born to be, Faramir's miserable relationship with Denethor, Théoden showing his iron strong will, and so on. It all shows... The photography here is some of the most most breathtaking I have ever seen. Some obvious examples are the lighting of the beacons in Minas Tirith and the shots that follow it, Legolas standing outside The Golden Hall, the shots when Gandalf is ascending the seven rings of Minas Tirith, the battle sequences at Minas Tirith. The acting is somewhat the same as the previous ones, not something special, but very solid nonetheless. One performance truly stands out, Sean Astin's role as the loyal gardener, Sam. It's moving when you see a person that is so dedicated to his role as his. Excellent... Action, action, action... There is plenty, but unlike any other blockbuster action movie, it's something that will leave you grasping for air in your seat. The highlight of all the battle sequences (and believe me, there are plenty of them) is the charge of the Rohirrim at Minas Tirith. The opening shots of all those soldiers standing there, just seconds before they throw themselves into the armies of Mordor will give you goosebumps. But when Théoden starts speeching to his troops (Ride now!, Ride Now!... Death, DEATH, DEATH!!!) and march into battle, those were the most incredible scenes I have EVER seen. The combination of Howard Shore's Rohan's music that is sped up a little and the amazing editing of that scene almost made me cry out of amazement and had me not breathing for almost half a minute. Sounds strange huh, almost crying during a battle scene? But I guarantee you, you will be moved by this scene. The Army of The Dead was convincing too, not your average CGI characters, but looked incredible. You can really see the fierceness of the dead ones, because they fled from Isildur and went to the mountains to hide in shame, they were so eager to be released from their spell. You can see this in a scene in the background where you can see a Mumakil being torn town to the ground by these soldiers. And Shelob, wow, Shelob. It's beyond the Book. Scarier than I thought it would be, so quiet, so careful, so convincing. The scene where Frodo was stung by Shelob almost made me jump from my seat, very well done. Maybe a small flaw in these scenes is the fact that Frodo was stung, but does have his Mithril shirt on. Maybe this is a mistake, or Frodo just got stung in his upper leg. The Tower of Cirith Ungol and Minas Morgul were exactly as I imagined they would be. The ever miserable Gollum (not in the negative way) continues his way with the hobbits, meanwhile, he's cooking up a plan to regain the Ring. Again, magnificently acting by Andy Serkis. As for Gollum's end, it's slightly different than in the Books, but as he plunged into Mount Doom with the Ring, his expressions were kind of twisted. Knowing that he's falling to his death with the Ring and still smiling. The music, well, one thing is for sure. Howard Shore did his homework, big time. One day after seeing RoTK, I went out and bought the OST (already owning the previous two). It's powerful, but less than The Two Tower's soundtrack. I was surprised by Billy Boyd's and Viggo Mortensen's appearance on the soundtrack. Emotionally charged music, a good way to describe it. And there's one thing that 'rules' the movie. Goosebumps. I cannot count the times I had them during this movie. Maybe some examples to explain this... Gandalf saving Faramir and his troops when they flee to Minas Tirith (Just when Gandalf's staff begins to shine, the beautiful voice of Ben del Maestro is heard on the soundtrack, superb) - Pippin singing to Denethor as Faramir and his troops ride to their doom. - The Rohirrim charge at Minas Tirith as I sad before - 'For Frodo...' - The coming of the eagles at The Black Gate (the little moth appearing in front of Gandalf's face) - 'I cannot carry it for you, but I can carry you!' The ending is maybe a tad long, but still doesn't get boring in the end. As for the parts that were cut out for the theatrical release (being Saruman's scenes and The Scourching of The Shire), the movie is already up to 3h21m. any longer, people will be tired as hell. It's suitable for the Extended DVD, when you have all the time in the world. But it wouldn't work in the cinema, because you already have 5 or 6 endings to finish the movie. And watch out, a lot of people will cry during the endings! Well, that's about it. As far as I'm concerned, Star wars has been dethroned, concerning trilogies. A solid 10/10.
10.0~Sweep me off my feet! catalystnz Sign in Permalink I went, I saw, I.... really needed to go to the toilet! Now I know why people said it takes a long time to get to the end. Once the One Ring was destroyed, I could have happily seen Sam and Frodo picked up by the eagles and then have the credits roll or something, but nooooo... 'twas not to be! The closing scenes of the film with Aragorn's coronation, the elves and Gandalf returning to the sea, Samwise with his family, it was all just too much for me, and I was relieved when finally the credits rolled and the cinema began to empty. I loved the sweeping shot over the battle scene at Mina Tirith(sp) though, the oliphaunts were awesome, the mountain men, the lava at Mt Doom - there were so many things I loved that it outweighs anything I thought was a bit off. Some of the CG seemed a bit rushed, but overall it was a fantastic movie which I know I'll enjoy more on the ext DVD where I can watch it in the comfort of my own home :) Excellent stuff! Highly recommended. The trilogy itself will probably never be matched or exceeded in its beauty, characters, acting, effects, and emotion. Well worth the $13.50 to see it at the movies. Just don't take a drink with you.
9.0~the film was amazing tom-d-shepherd Sign in Permalink The Lord of the rings trilogy is my favourite set of books, i absolutely adored them and when they said Peter Jackson was making a Lord of the rings film I was so exited. When they came out i was relieved and turned out to be amazing. still like the book better but think the film really portrayed it well. I love the way they had all those amazing actors and actresses in it e.g Sir Ian Makellan,Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Christopher lee and Liv Tyler ( i think Liv Tyler the most beautiful actress ever). i really like the Moria scenes Rohan scenes, and minas tirith and pellenor fields scenes as well. i also think that some of the speech's were really dramatic. overall The Lord of the rings is one of my top movies.
10.0~Greatest Movie of All Time VeliousPunker Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson delves deep into the works of Tolkien to bring to life the emotions of the denizens of Middle Earth. The three hours and eleven minutes of the movie leaves the watcher gasping, hoping, yearning! At the end you don't want it to end and you are left with a sence of serenity and peace. It is a must see movie for all who love Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings series.
5.0~Mediocre finale ariconsul Sign in Permalink I'm sorry to say Peter Jackson's team really blew the finale of the LOTR trilogy. I enjoyed the first two (especially the extended editions), and I wanted to love this one, but by 1/2 through the film I wanted to leave. The movie strays from the book in too many ways, none of which improve the film, so it's 60% of Tolkien's ROTK, which, in my opinion is not enough. The ending especially felt like an overly sentimental rush-job tear-jerker -- by the end of the movie I couldn't wait to get out of my seat. Perhaps the extended edition of ROTK will fix some of the problems, but I doubt it. Specific Peeves (**** SPOILERS AHEAD ****) * Superfluous character: the orc leader who looked like a cross between a melted candle and "Sloth" from Goonies (ironically, another Sean Austin movie). * Saurman written out. * Battle of Bywater and the scouring of the Shire completely written out - a real shame. * Eowyn, the "stern and proud" shieldmaiden of the House of Eorl -- is portrayed as a character who doesn't know what the f*ck she's gotten into when she meets up with the Black * Removal of the confrontation between Gandalf and the Black King at the City Gate. * The portrayal of Denethor as a food-chomping idiot (not even close to the savvy Steward in the book). * The Denethor rejecting aid from the Rohirrim and (oh boy!) Pippin to the rescue by lighting a signal fire (again, completely deviating from the storyline) * The nonsense about Arwen getting sick because of Sauron's overwhelming presence. * The Paths of the Dead - aka Peter Jackson's version of Haunted Mansion -- I half expected Eddy Murphy to show his head. Overall, the more the movie strayed from the book in plot and dialogue, the worse it was. I don't think JRR Tolkien's turning in his grave, but I do think he is squirming quite a bit.
10.0~Arguably the best film of all time alwaysthere Sign in Permalink Yep. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is over. It's made truck loads of money. Won too many awards to count. The most critically acclaimed trilogy of all time. Massive fan base. Best adaptation of all time. Wonderfully well-made movies. Yep, I think that qualifies it as the best film of all time. It's easier to look at the entire trilogy as one big movie than it is to look at them at three different movies. And looking back at it, there's just no competition for this league of cinematic brilliance. The story is wonderfully well fleshed out, you really care for the charactors because the acting is perfect, the adventure is so involving that you feel like you are a participant, not a spectator. And the film just looks amazing. The visual quality is so eye-catching and keeps you so entertained and involved that the story just comes naturally, and by the time it's all over, you realise that you had a great time watching it. This is the definition of a good film. It entertains, moves, makes you laugh, makes you cry. It's fun at times, heart-wrenching at others. Awe-inspiring, and also un-nerving (like Gollum's origin story!). When you look at the entire trilogy, you can only commend Peter Jackson and his crew for what they have achieved. Never before has a trilogy been so perfect and well-made. Star Wars comes to mind, but those movies didn't recieve quite as much acclaim as LotR. It certainly got a lot of fans, but LotR got just as many. Godfather also comes to mind, but nobody liked the third movie, so, as a trilogy, it just can't compete. So LotR has earned the title of best trilogy ever. There may a few rouge souls out there who disagree, but it is. The films just flow wonderfully, the story really builds, and the charactors really evolve, and you care greatly for them. The adventure over the three films is so entertaining and transfixing that you can't stop watching them. I honestly don't know how many times I've watch Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. These movies are just amazing. The Return of the King is possibly the best movie of all three, although it's hard to say, since it's all one story. RotK definitely deserves to win Best Picture at the Oscars this year, and it's title as the second film to ever pass the 1 Billion dollar mark at the worldwide box office is well-earned. This trilogy will live forever, and will go down in history. It great to be around when these things happen, because these movies will become classics, and pass down through generations. Quite simply the best film ever made.
10.0~Saving the best for last. Moobythegoldncaf Sign in Permalink As can be expected by anyone who has read the books, The Return of the King is the most impressive and awe inspiring film of the entire trilogy. Purists will be pleased at how closely ROTK follows the book and everything that has been changed is for the better. Some elements are left out in favor of saving time, however most of these scenes will be given back to us in the exended edition.
10.0~GREATEST MOVIE!!!!! mcboston-1 Sign in Permalink This is the greatest movie ever. The series just kept getting better and better! The actors and actresses were superb and the graphics and scenery, as always, were wonderful. 1,000,000,000,000,000 stars out of 10!
10.0~Fantastic ending to the best trilogy ever! SantaClaws Sign in Permalink This movie surpassed my expectations totally, I loved Fellowship and The Two Towers but Return of the King is a masterpiece, it's like a puzzle, all the pieces come together. I would even say that it deserved all eleven Oscar's although I think the eleven Oscar's were for the whole trilogy. While reading other comments, there was lots of critic to the ending and the sappiness of it, well, not to me, I don't think it's wrong crying during a movie and the story really touched me, so yes, I cried, especially the crowning scene(you don't bow for no one). The main battle scene is one of the best I've ever seen, the scenes with the Elephaunts reminded me a bit of the Empirial Walkers in Empire Strikes Back. Best acting, in my opinion, was by Sam(Sean Astin), he plays his role very convincingly, the star of this movie! Also the music is a very strong aspect of the movie, it really adds something to the movie. There is also time to laugh, Gimli and Legolas continue their competition for the most victims, still very funny! Well, I wouldn't say this is the best movie ever but it sure comes close! My congratulations to Peter Jackson!
10.0~amazing magicbowlr1 Sign in Permalink i can't say enough about how amazing this movie is. the cgi is great, the action is intense and it is the best conclusion to any trilogy ever! i'm just sad now that i can't look forward to seeing another LOTR next year.
7.0~Great until the last 20 minutes jasonsurety Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy will certainly go down as a masterpiece overall. The third installment picks up where the second left off. There are battle scenes colossal enough to make it a classic. Spoilers: Both for the review and the film. What I didn't like was the lack of suspense. It seemed certain throughout the whole movie that Frodo would complete his mission. Not a single headliner dies. Frodo loses a finger in a scene and then later we see his hand undamaged. Even worse is the slow motion homoerotic scenes with Frodo and his Hobbit buddies lolloping in bed together with Gandalf and the other humans looking on gleefully. I almost thought it was some kind of a joke it was so gaudy. While these flaws dilapidate the movie I can't say they totally ruin it. If I ever see it again I won't stick around for the last drippy moments.
9.0~A worthy conclusion to an epic adventure but misses some of the spirit of the source material tapio_hietamaki Sign in Permalink When I first saw this movie it was in 2003, in the cinema, as a teenager. I had read the books and eagerly waited to see the conclusion to this epic trilogy, and I was floored. It was everything I ever wanted and more. And when the special extended edition came out on DVD (the next Christmas if I recall correctly), I was first in line to buy it, and my jaw dropped at the amount of all the new material. The Witch King raising a flaming sword! A mountain of skulls tumbling under Aragorn's feet! Saruman's death scene (although it didn't happen at the place it did in the books)! The movie delivered, and I was satisfied. Today, I'm less satisfied. I feel that a lot of the magic of the first movie, 'The Fellowship of the Ring', was in small, everyday things, like Sam Gamgee sitting in The Green Dragon, or Strider tossing an apple at Pippin's head, or Gandalf's frown as he explains why it is impossible for him to be late. 'The Return of the King' is quiet and introspective at the prolonged end, which I always liked (Jack Nicholson said that he walked out before the end because there were too many), but most of the movie is focused on war. And it's not a real war like Helm's Deep in the previous film, but a fantasy war of computer-generated armies and pompous speeches. At the end, when the heroes are at dire need, the fiendish orcs are plummeted into a chasm that opens beneath their feet in one of the most ridiculous deus ex machinas I've witnessed. I think that somewhere along the way Peter Jackson missed something of the spirit of the book, the essence of it. He glorifies action and adventure, conflict and power, not the smallfolk's small wisdom. Sauron was never meant to be a fiery lighthouse, turning his spotlight gaze on Frodo, who just in time hides behind a rock. The army of the dead was never meant to be a green, translucent host of invincible soldiers who tear down a Mûmakil. Legolas was never meant to be a beast-slaying, shield-surfing, three-arrows-at-once-firing superman. All the things that mar The Hobbit trilogy are present here, in smaller doses, but they're there if you know how to look. Out of the three Lord of the Rings movies, this one aged the worst.
6.0~just good dar_yahya Sign in Permalink Nothing important to say anything. but i can say its good movie
10.0~My respect Mr Peter. cordova_juan Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has done the incredible, a relative new, Not Hollywood and almost unknown director, made the best movie ever. I think nobody, not Spielberg, not Lucas, not Cameron can do something like that. And the reason is quite simple, they wouldn't spend 7 years of their life in a lonely project, just for passion ( I am not saying they aren't excellent directors) but at their level they usually do one or two movies per year, for they a ten millions dollars for a seven years job it is not so profitable. Peter was fighting for his believes in a business so big that no ones tried before, He is the proof that not only Hollywood can do the big ones. I Hope his example will follow in another places around the globe. My respect Mr Peter. P.S. Sorry for no talking about the movie but many people already did by the way it is the best movie I seen since Braveheart (And the other LOTR ones).
10.0~An incredible conclusion to an incredible trilogy. Jedinate20 Sign in Permalink Where can I start. I attended to midnight showing of this film, and I must say, it was well worth it. Peter Jackson's film The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King is 3 and a half hours of Oscar worthy filmaking. As a student of film, this picture delivers on all fronts. The first thing I must say is that it is the best film in the trilogy, and it is also very true to the spirit of the third book. Jackson did make some subtle sacrifices, which I'm sure diehard weird fans will cry about, but the film captures the elements of the story very well. The final struggle to reach mount doom by the last two members of the fellowship, Frodo and Sam, is now in its greatest and darkest hour. Their unholy alliance with vile Gollum, is testing the friendship between both Frodo and Sam. I will not give the ending away, but the relationship between Frodo and Sam tests both of their strengths nearly to the point of death, but proves true that friendship and good can triumph over darkness. The other charcters of the fellowship all come to thier own this film too. Aragorn, the movie's namesake, finally comes to meet his destiny as the King of all men, and Viggo Mortensen's performance is rousing and flawless. He was meant to be Aragorn. Gandalf is wonderful as ever, and the performance of his charcter is nothing short of astounding! A new charcter to this trilogy, Lord Denethor the steward of Gondor, is played flawlessly. I can't remember the actors name, but he captures the sickening madness of the doomed lord of Gondor. He is good, but yet very misguided and full of arrogance and pride that do any man in. The technical elements of this film make Star Wars look like a student film. ILM is being given a run for its money by WETA Digital for sue in this film. The visual effects for the battles are breathtaking and very scary and suspensful at times. Although the film runs 3 and 1/2 hours, it dosen't let up. Tension and emotion build from beginning to the end. Terror reigns this time since Sam and Frodo have reached the dark land of Mordor. There are plenty of Orcs, Goblins, and Trolls to go around. My favorite scene though was the charge of the army of Rohan on the Pelennor fields. It does not dissappoint and is very exciting to watch! The other visuals I liked were the ones of Shelob, the spider gaurdian. They were absolutely terrifying, but done so well they make Jar Jar Binks look like a bugs bunny cartoon! If this film dose not get best picture, I will be very angered. It delivers on all fronts, and it is the best film I have seen this year. No other director could have had this vision than Peter Jackson. His earlier films fully prepared him for this ambitious project and it has paid off very well. I think for years to come I think this film will have been the biggest gamble in Hollywood and Cinematic history that was the truest thriumph of a very loved story. I will see this again and again. Rating: 10 out of 10!
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: trilogy is excellent . akshatvaishya16 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings-The Return of the King is surely the greatest movie ever made. I consider that is has the most fascinating plot ever written.The universe of the movie is unique: a fantastic world which includes almost every mythical creature we heard of. Elves,orcs,trolls,hobbits,all these make up a charming atmosphere. The idea of a Ring that can submit the will of it's bearer is surely unique is recalls all throughout the movie.Also, the love story between Aragorn and the immortal Arwen is the most original one seen in the entire history of movies. The fate of king Debethor reminds us of Greek tragedies and the film contains great moral learnings,most in the words of the wizard Gandalf. The fantasy and the charming, sublime atmosphere make me consider this movie the greatest work or art ever created by mankind.
5.0~to big-to fast andyheuvel Sign in Permalink To me it's unbelievable that this movie counts as the second best movie ever made. The book(s) themselves are brilliant which means that Jackson had plenty to work with. He started out alright as far as i'm concerned; the first movie has the feel of a dark somewhat mysterious adventure. His reasons for changing from this feel to the more mainstream "big spectacle" feel remain a big question to me. Alright, this one's better then the second one, but i'm not sure that's that big of an accomplishment. The acting is mediocre from time to time, the special effects are great at one moment and stink the next. The scenario has a great potential, but turned out reasonable at best and to top this all: the dialogs are downright childish most of the time. All-in-all the whole movie, in my opinion, was shot way to fast. It lacks any artistic feeling.
10.0~Is it good? no. Is it Very good? no. Is it Perfect, no... even better! Skylore Sign in Permalink The Final Chapter of this great trilogy will just rip your heart out of your ribs! I don't know how Peter Jackson did it,and perhaps sucha masterpiece such as this has the right not to be questioned. I loved the first movie, its steady pace of adventure is non-stop, the characters are loveable, the costume is nice, the settings are stupendous and the Visual effects is Jaw-Dropping. And I loved the second even better with the Battle of Helm's Deep finally winning over my breaking heart with the Two LOTR Movies already gnawing at the bottom, I had to say a final farewell to Star Wars 4 & 5 and welcome The LLord of the Rings. And with this, my heart is fainally complete. The MArmaluks are unstoppable and Visually Great!!! No words could describe the intensity of their presence alone. And the Battle of Pelanor Fields will get you to want to wish you were there yourself, and not as an orc (Though Trolls are Cool! Though pales in comparisson with the Mass of Undead and, of course, the Oliphaunts.) Gollum is once again as great as ever and The rest of the cast are comendable, with great praises going to be due to Gandalf and most especially Sam! The emotional intensity of the film is a full ten! And after you cry from the movie's story, you'll cry about why oh why wasn't it any longer!!! And indeed, we must now bid a final farewell to our dearest, The Lord of The Rings Trilogy, the only Trilogy to have a complete set of Movies with no equals but each other. Good bye........ sorry, I just don't wanna leave it alone....
10.0~Sheer Brilliance yoshman11 Sign in Permalink I personally think this is the best movie ever made! Now, that is not to say it is my favorite movie to watch, that isn't exactly true, but I have yet watched a movie with a better interpretation of graphics, storyline, and overall entertainment. I found myself trudging through Fellowship of the Ring, entertained by Two Towers, and then BLOWN AWAY by Return of the King! I love this movie, and though, it would eventually get old, as it is not my FAVORITE movie, it comes in a close second behind my favorite, Revenge of the Sith. Still, excellent movie and kudos to Peter Jackson and his like two seconds on screen getting shot by Legolas! He made a truly spectacular movie. I recommend it to all my friends.
10.0~an unparalleled classic, a marvel in movie making pmb34 Sign in Permalink What seemed to be a close to an impossible accomplishment, Peter Jackson & the cast of the film have truly outdone themselves with this final installment in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. The RETURN OF THE KING combines the best elements of its predecessors; the visual story telling of the FELLOWSHIP & the epic battle scenes of the TWO TOWERS. RETURN OF THE KING probes into the psyche of its characters & lets the audience feel the true turmoil & joy they have experienced on their adventures. RETURN OF THE KING is a must see for any TOLKEIN fan or anyone who appreciates good cinema. The only fault is that the end tends to drag but once the film is over, it is truly justified.
10.0~Best film ever. mizzah Sign in Permalink This movie is the best in the trilogi, and i also think its one of the biggest and greatest movies i have ever seen. If you dont see LOTR3 u will miss a big part of the movie history. Also the battles is incredible! GOGO WATCH IT! :)
9.0~An Amazing Conclusion To One of the Strongest Trilogies Ever Created flyguy360 Sign in Permalink When one thinks of famous trilogies, several come to mind including the original Star Wars, and the Godfather. Most trilogies collapse by the third movie and prove to be the weakest link within the three movies. Return of the King breaks this rule and so many more. It is the culmination of all that precedes it and brings absolute and perfect closure to all story lines that come before it. Story: As with the other two in the trilogy, it is based on the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien. The story of Return of the King, in the context of the books, is excellent. The transfer to the screen is almost perfect. Unlike Two Towers, which is not as direct in its translation, Return of the King does not stray from its source material. A+ Acting: No one actor can be taken out of this film. As they should be, they work well together as a "fellowship". The acting is very good, but there is no standout performance that deserves special recognition. A- Directing: Peter Jackson does an amazing job of directing in this final installment. He crafts a near perfect film and he is very much deserving of the Best Director Golden Globe. A+ Overall: As a huge fan of the series, I am somewhat biased in my assessment of this film. I love this film immensely. Easily in my top 5 films of all time, this movie accomplished all I could ever dream of when I envisioned this movie being made. Characters are developed even further in an amazing fashion, especially in the last half hour. The special effects in the battle sequences will blow you away and will bring you within the battles and convince you of the importance of what is being fought over. Enough cannot be said of this film. A rousing and moving epic that should not be missed. A+
1.0~Overhyped Stupid Movie calhobbes99 Sign in Permalink This would go down as one of the worst movie of the year. An overhyped tale, I haven't read the book but after seeing the movie i will steer clear of anything to do with the "lord of the rings". The "convinently call-able" ghost army made it the most anti-climatic ending after the 6-8 hrs spent building the tension over the 3 movies. It is the same as the anti-climatic fight at helms deep when gandalf appears to save the day. What was the purpose of the elves. There were so many holes in the plot. The emphasis that Sam wise was not gay was sickening - meant wasting 5 mins in the end showing he marries a woman and has 3 kids. To make it more suitable to the times, Frodo and Sam wise should have just come out of the closet. It is a shame that people have voted it to become in the top 3 movies at imdb.
10.0~Breathtaking Epic! amarantha_gamgee Sign in Permalink I do not have suitable words to describe how awesome this entire movie/trilogy is! If you haven't seen it yet, do so ASAP! If you have seen it, go see it again! It's just...well, left me speechless. Thank you Peter, all the cast, the crew, and especialy Tolkien, for creating such an awesome place!
10.0~Unbelievable Nightcrawler69 Sign in Permalink To say that this movie is the greatest movie of all time is an understatement. This movie was so unbelievably awesome, that every movie i see from now on can't even compare. You have to see this movie!
7.0~A little too much Greekfish Sign in Permalink I think the Lord of the Ring books are really great, and with a story such as that, and the environments and characters of an awesome tale, you've got that part settled. The actual filming is also impressive, many scenes work really well, but in at the end of the movie Peter Jackson kind of over extends himself a bit. There is crying scene after crying scene, which to me is too much. The ending is very important for a film, and so in my opinion it cannot be given more than a 7. Another thing that bothers me a bit is the academy awards. They mean nothing no more. Even though he might not have deserved them all this year he had to get his 11 awards just to prove that the jury has taste, and to equal it to Ben Hur and... Titanic...(You see what I mean). The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions didn't even get NOMINATED for best special effects. This is probably because they would have had to win...
10.0~Extended version is a whole different movie xzithlan Sign in Permalink I just finished watching the 4 hour extended version of this epic motion picture. It was entirely different than the theatrical version, and I'll add that it was all the more better. If you enjoyed the book, the extended version brings you that much closer to the magic that was Tolkien's finest piece of fiction. See this movie, but definitely in order of the Trilogy, otherwise you'll be drowned in the scope of events. It could stand alone, but with such mastery it can be better appreciated with the background that is portrayed in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. I, for one, can't wait until The Hobbit is immortalized as a timeless classic like this on the big screen.
10.0~My best Yaz_Bak Sign in Permalink Legendary trilogy maybe the best in the history , But I don't like the idea of keeping all heros alive at the end.
10.0~How can you be disappointed at this movie? rocketman777 Sign in Permalink Granted, I didn't read the books, but oh my god, how can people say this movie sucked? One of the best epics to ever grace the screen, concluding the best trilogy ever to grave the screen. Unbelievable movie.
1.0~The most overrated film ever!!! demon-12 Sign in Permalink This has to be the most OVER-RATED MOVIE EVER!!!! What a disappointing year.. first T-3, then Matrix revolutions and now Return of the king. I guess we will never see a 3rd movie better than the first two movies. The same thing happened with Star-wars.. Godfather and plenty of others so its no big deal. Its a curse thats what it is! The Two Towers was perfect compared to ROTK.. oh my god how boring this movie is! PJ could easily have edited and cut out 1 hour of footage which is completely irrelevant, only makes you yawn. oh well.. Send lots of hate mail to me now ;)
10.0~A magnificent ending for an amazing tale silverbell_91 Sign in Permalink I was impressed by the care taken to create this movie, and the enormous attention to details. The music is beautiful and moving, but most importantly it fits perfectly with the changing moods and emotions of the varying situations. The scene with Frodo and Sam on the mountainside, has a wind instrument in it which is painfully beautiful, expressing a pain so deep but inspiring somehow, whenever I hear that music I feel a strange emotion, unable of description. The acting and casting are perfect, and the battle scenes unbelievably real. This is one of the most perfect movie ever made, built to compete with Gone With The Wind, and other classics to be remembered forever.
10.0~Speechless..... Clay-37 Sign in Permalink This is the BEST of the trilogy, and by far the best fantasy film I have ever seen. A must see even if you haven't seen the other two. Now, hopefully, they will move on to the Hobbit and Silmarillion. How can you stop such a good thing at this point?
10.0~Excellent movie from an excellent book jnava19 Sign in Permalink The movie is all what i expect and imagine from the book, excellent effects, actors, direction, photography (is amazing!)..the music!... i have no words... The movie has a amazing develop from the first movie, so this is the most involving, but the end, although the length is ... well.. From USA today: "The three-part story of courage, friendship, honor and duty  spanning The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King, which comes to theaters tonight  is ideally suited to epic film-making. It is steeped in fast-paced action and grand adventure, yet still grounded in humanity  a rare combination among large-scale film extravaganzas. It isn't until now that director Peter Jackson's efforts can be fully and fairly judged, notwithstanding the monumental box office success of the first two films, which have grossed $1.8 billion worldwide. As good as each individual movie is, the third film vaults the work into the stratosphere of classic movies. Key characters are enhanced, new civilizations visited and battles fought more intensely, while feelings and motivations are plumbed more deeply and movingly. After the release of the first and second films, one wondered how the trilogy, as a nine-hour film fest, might compare with other cinematic watermarks. In its entirety, The Lord of the Rings surpasses other multi-part sagas such as Star Wars or even The Godfather. Both Star Wars and The Godfather had weak links, whole movies that didn't work as well as the best of the series. Rings maintains the same standard of excellence with each film and grows more assured with each installment. Of course, some of that escalating power is attributable to the storytelling prowess of J.R.R. Tolkien, upon whose classic novels the trilogy is based. The books depict the odyssey of the humble hobbit Frodo, whose quest is to destroy a powerful ring that could enslave all the inhabitants of the fictional land of Middle-earth. Helping him accomplish his mission is a heroic cadre of creatures: Gandalf the wizard; Legolas the elf; Gimli the dwarf; Aragorn and Boromir, both men; and three other hobbits, Sam, Merry and Pippin. This unlikely alliance comes together in a spirit of acceptance and tolerance to fight the satanic Sauron and his devilish henchmen. Those of us who do not consider ourselves fans of fantasy initially may have thought to dismiss the movies as far-fetched, overblown silliness. It was hard to imagine the films as relevant or transcending their genre. But many of us have come around to another point of view: The films tell a classic story that espouses the virtues of love, hard work and compassion and decries greed, deceit and abuse of power in a mighty struggle against temptation and the corrupting forces of power. The story's message about conserving natural resources has profound significance for our times, as does the notion of taking up arms against an evil tyrant and the importance of overcoming prejudice to work toward a common goal of peace. Ironically, these simple messages were massively complicated to pull off, requiring a budget of nearly $300 million, a crew of 26,000 extras and a production team of 2,400, which included medieval weapons designers, stone sculptors, linguists, blacksmiths and model builders. Bringing to life such a wide-ranging story with technical proficiency and visual dazzle is an unprecedented achievement, one that likely will define Jackson, much as George Lucas is forever linked to the Star Wars movies he directed. Though the acting ensemble is strong, the movie does not belong to any one of them. While Elijah Wood capably carries off Frodo's transition from boy to man, his is not the most indelible performance. Gollum, voiced by and physically patterned after the movements of British actor Andy Serkis, is the most realistic other-worldly character since E.T. and similarly will remain etched in moviegoers' collective memories. Ian McKellen's Gandalf has a larger role in the third film, morphing from wizard/prophet to army general, and one cannot imagine the role played by anyone else. Viggo Mortensen's principled Aragorn is the king to whom the third film's title refers. A key character is the landscape of Middle-earth. The movies feel mythical but look historical. In the third installment, for example, Minas Tirith, a seven-tiered city of kings, looks European, Byzantine and fantastical at the same time. There is a bittersweet quality in the trilogy's coming to an end  even if The Return of the King seems ready to conclude at least three times before the movie finally comes to a rather anticlimactic close. Many moviegoers, like Jackson and the cast  who grew quite close during filming  may understand, and even appreciate, the lingering goodbye. And while scores of film goers clamor to see the final installment, no one is eager for the journey to end. Jackson's masterpiece will no doubt have a long life on DVD and be the subject of countless revivals over the years. The director's next project is a remake of King Kong, which seems a bit like hiring Michelangelo to paint an office building. Though if anyone can make something out of that tired vehicle, Jackson can. Should Jackson sign on to make The Hobbit, the Rings finale might feel more like a temporary "till we meet again" than a formal goodbye."

10.0~Return of the Bling WilsonLau Sign in Permalink There's nothing much to say about this movie, other than that it was amazing. Nothing else quite describes it. Fantastic ending to a fantastic story. The flow of this film was great. Not many slow parts at all. Gives you a sense of whole, or completeness that Matrix could not come close to. Filming these films all in one shot really gives it that advantage of making it all seamless unlike other trilogies or sequels that just don't measure up. Another spot is anxiously waiting on my DVD shelf for this one. 10 out of 10...the perfect movie.
2.0~Dull, Inadequate Finale lissotrichous1 Sign in Permalink Dull, Inadequate Finale. From it's start, you sense the drawn-out nature of this supposedly epic ending... its all over the place, trying to involve you with the tedious "now's a good time to go out for popcorn!" fluff/added-on characters who obviously serve only to pad the whole sequence of events. Peter Jackson heard that trilogies were trendy, so he decided to milk the audience for 3 films, when 2 would have been much more concise. Really, he could have had a very tight and meaningful 2-pat LOTR, but unnecessarily watered it down to make us spend the extra $9 to be bored on the long route to the predictable conclusion. It upsets me that the DVD's are so full of extra's. What ever happened to Editing? Keeping the theme tight? Concise work w/o crappy filler?
10.0~It was awesome shaynahartman Sign in Permalink This movie was one of the best I have seen. The graphics were great. The way they put the whole movie together was just awesome. I loved watching every second of it. The first time I watched it I watched it three times in a row because I couldn't get enough of the movie. The lord of the rings series is just amazing in itself. What they have to go through with the ring and what they have to fight and figure out on the way there. I absolutely loved this movie. One that will definitely go down in the history books as an amazing movie. I think everyone should see this movie and the others before and after it. They might feel the same way that I do about it. I LOVE IT!!!
10.0~Wow!!! BigGash Sign in Permalink If you haven't seen this yet - get off of the moon and get to the cinema!!! This has to be one of the best films of all time. Minas Tirith. 'Nuff said! 10/10
10.0~Great Movie a-vijai Sign in Permalink Best of Movies ever made. Beautiful Visual, Excellent Storyline, Great acting which makes it the perfect blend to be good entertainer. Hours after watching the film, I can close my eyes and see those incredible battle scenes pulsing and throbbing in my skull. They are even more extravagant than his jaw-dropping siege of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers. They have giant elephants and swooping pterodactyls. After the second movie, I compared his epic military set pieces to Kurosawa, but it's a condescension he no longer deserves. His battles are a thing of wonder on their own account. Maybe Kurosawa's battles will one day be described as proto-Jacksonian. And for the first time in this series they are built on to a plot with some narrative force.
10.0~Stunning djjamesbenedict Sign in Permalink Absolutely stunning film from start to finish. Peter Jackson does a fantastic job flowing the story, and the pace of the film is perfect. The acting is superb, playing the characters with style. Staying as true as it can do to the original story, I got several shivers down my spine in scenes as I did when reading the books. This film is also visually stunning and Peter Jackson finishes off the trilogy in style. The effects are smooth with the CGI not over the top, it's just right and extremely realistic. As a Lord of the rings fan I may be a bit biased but this is truly one of the best films I have ever seen. All of the Lord of the Rings films get a 10/10 from me but if there was a rating of 11/10 for The Return of the King i would give that.
10.0~What can you say? stevethepot Sign in Permalink I suppose that someone, sometime, may tell the story more accurately but I doubt very much that it will ever be told better. Nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but Peter Jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of Tolkien's masterwork without pandering, too much, to clichéd Hollywood extravagance. The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema. I'm sure I will love it forever.
10.0~An Epic Final for an Epic Trilogy Scorpio1249 Sign in Permalink THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!! It's definitely the best in the trilogy and the whole franchise. I would recommend you watching this in the Extended Version, cause many things is missing in the Theatrical Cut. The plot begins with two hobbits (Sméagol & Déagol) are fishing when Deagol finds the one ring in the river. Sméagol is ensnared by the Ring, and kills his friend for it. He retreats into the Misty Mountains as the Ring twists his body and mind, until he becomes the creature Gollum. Centuries later, Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Théoden to Isengard, where they reunite with Merry and Pippin. Gandalf retrieves the defeated Saruman's palantír. Pippin later looks into the seeing-stone, and is telepathically attacked by Sauron. Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith. He rides there to warn Gondor's steward Denethor, taking Pippin with him. Gollum leads Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee to Minas Morgul. The hobbits begin climbing a stair carved in the cliff face that will take them into Mordor via a 'secret way' - unaware that Gollum plans to kill them and take the Ring. Sauron's army strikes and overwhelms Osgiliath, forcing Faramir and his garrison to retreat to Minas Tirith. Gollum disposes of the Hobbits' food, blaming Sam. Frodo leaves Sam behind before they arrive at the tunnel leading to Mordor, where Gollum tricks him into venturing into the lair of the giant spider Shelob. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, telling him that he must destroy the Ring for both their sakes. Gollum attacks Frodo, but falls down a chasm. Frodo continues on, but Shelob discovers, paralyses and binds him. However, Sam arrives and drives her away. Sam hides as Orcs appear and take Frodo with them. Sam follows the Orcs into the Tower of Cirith Ungol, and frees Frodo so they can continue their journey. Aragorn learns from Elrond that Arwen is dying, having refused to leave Middle Earth after seeing a vision of her son with Aragorn. Elrond gives Aragorn Andúril, Isildur's sword Narsil reforged, so he can reclaim his birthright while gaining reinforcements from the Dead Men of Dunharrow. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels to the Paths of the Dead, recruiting the Army of the Dead by pledging to release them from the curse Isildur put on them. Faramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath; believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf is left to defend the city against the Orc army, led by Gothmog. As Gothmog's army forces its way into the city, Denethor attempts to kill himself and Faramir on a pyre. Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir, but Denethor leaps to his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Théoden and his nephew, Éomer, arrive with the Rohirrim. During the ensuing battle, they are overwhelmed by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim, while the Witch-king of Angmar mortally wounds Théoden. Though Théoden's niece Éowyn destroys the Witch-King with Merry's help, Théoden dies of his wounds. Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead, who overcome the Orcs and win the battle; Aragorn then frees them from the curse. Aragorn decides to lead his army upon the Black Gate as a distraction, so Frodo and Sam can get to Mount Doom. Aragorn's army draw out Sauron's forces and empties Mordor, allowing Frodo and Sam to reach the volcano, but Gollum attacks them just as they reach Mount Doom. Frodo succumbs to the Ring and claims it as his own. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring. Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum, who is holding the Ring, into the volcano, destroying the Ring and killing Gollum. As Frodo and Sam escape, Sauron is destroyed and Mordor crumbles. Gandalf flies in with eagles to rescue the Hobbits, who awaken later in Minas Tirith and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and takes Arwen as his queen. The Hobbits return to the Shire, where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. A few years later, Frodo departs Middle Earth for the Undying Lands with his uncle Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Elves. He leaves Sam the Red Book of Westmarch, which details their adventures. Sam then returns to the Shire, where he embraces Rosie and their children. You must see it. IT IS AWESOME!!!
10.0~The perfect ending for a great trilogy! Boba_Fett1138 Sign in Permalink Wow, what a movie! It's not only the best of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, it also is one of the best movies of the past couple of years. "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is a totally spectacular movie. It has some of the most amazing battle scene's in movie history. The word spectacular isn't good enough to describe it, it's breathtaking, epic and emotional involving. Who didn't wanted to pick up a sword and shield and charge with Aragorn towards a large number of Orcs for honor and glory? Even though the special effects are far from the best ever, Peter Jackson is a master in mixing the special effect with real life action. The use of it never feels overdone and the result is spectacular as well as believable. I think lot's of people were worried after "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" after seeing the battle of Helm's Deep. How was Peter Jackson ever going to top that great battle? Well, with "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" he topped it alright! The battle for Middle Earth is something you've never seen before. Greatest moment was when the riders of Rohan charged, it was really a moment in which you felt the true meaning of fighting and dying with honor. Also great moment during the immensely large battle were the fights against the oliphaunts, just when you thought the battle was over, those large creatures appeared! Really great moment. The characters are possibly at their best in this movie. No characters need introductions anymore and we get to see the deepest of their emotions in this movie, even Gollum's! Still the movie is not really deserving to be third in the top 250 here on IMDb.com. It's also not really deserving all those Oscar's it won. Like all The Lord of the Rings movies, it's great, spectacular and absolutely breathtaking at times but not classic masterpieces in my book. Also the movie is far from flawless. Once again the editing is just poor at times and what was with the ending? Couldn't they just think of one ending? I expected the end credits to start rolling multiple times during the ending but it just went on and on. Despite some of those flaws it still is an excellent movie with some unforgettable battle's sequence's. Truly a wonderful ending for one of the greatest movie trilogies in history. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
10.0~Epic abboudy_92 Sign in Permalink With the final installment coming through, everybody can recognize the greatness of not only The Return of the King, but of the trilogy as a whole. Despite not being a fan of "fantasy" movies, i was completely taken by the magic of the story, and particularly Peter Jackson's incredible ability to transform such a complicated story into an epic movie, and raise the scales of film making. The Return of the King grabs audiences and places them in with the characters, one by one. It is no surprise at all for the movie to swap 11 Oscars, and we all surely will be looking to the upcoming two installments of The Hobbit to see if Peter Jackson can outdo himself. Rating: 10/10
10.0~Best of the trilogy, best book adaptation yet, probably ever shaidarharan Sign in Permalink This may well be my favorites movie of all time for all time, and the longest of my favorites too. Somehow I found myself in the choice middle seats at 12am on the 17th. Despite being sleep deprived after exams and work, the movie kept me alert, neigh, riveted. I recommend this movie over any other fantasy. The CG will have my respect forever, as will Peter Jackson and all involved. Let me say Thank You to Tolkien, Walsh and everyone that made this movie possible.
10.0~Arrg! My eyes! Boba_Fett Sign in Permalink Boy, sitting in the front row of Return of the King at two in the morning, the sounds of heavy battle coursing through your body can have an ill effect. My eyes, also, are suffering from the prolonged fate of staring at fifteen-feet faces for the past three hours. Still, though, as Aragorn wields the reforged Narsil with an army of the dead behind him, or the legions of Rohan pile down upon a sea of Orcs, or the Nazgul's dragon-things screech through the air, you will know the meaning of the word "epic." Again, possibly an entire fourth (or more) of the movie is extreme (extreme) close-ups of some none-too-pleasent faces. I would definitely recommend sitting far back from the screen. Also, as I mentioned, you will realize that sound can have weight, and that sound can have quite a BIT of weight, and sound could probably knock you off your feet if you let it. Though I must also stress that I am -not- complaining -at all-. These factors do NOT detract from the movie's value. A modern day Star Wars, if you will. Hmm. That sounded kind of funny and cliché... Whatever. And, no, I *still* haven't read the book(s). Be quiet. G'night!
10.0~Perfect davidaschaefer Sign in Permalink The best movie ever made. Absolutely recommend it to everyone who likes Fantasy movies!
8.0~Very very good, but the extended DVD should make it complete ageling Sign in Permalink This movie really blew my mind. Never a dull moment, action after action. However, just like the previous two theatrical versions, I missed the character development. Granted, we see it with Frodo, but what about Arwen, Eowin, Aragorn, Faramir, the other Hobbits, etc...? I can hardly wait for the extended DVD and also secretly hope for an even longer version of the tale! All credit to Peter Jackson and his team. They did a marvelous job! (8.5 out of 10)
10.0~Take a Bow Mr. Jackson lonewolf89-1 Sign in Permalink I just saw this last night during the Lord of the Rings Marathon, and I must say, it is by far the best movie I have ever seen. Flawless performances were given by the whole cast, with Sean Astin and Billy Boyd leading the pack. Peter Jackson did an excellent job of crafting this film. While it may not have been a replica of the books, it certainly held true to the spirit of the story. After seeing Return of the King, you begin to understand the true meaning of the word 'epic.' The entire movie was stunning, the visuals, the dialogue, everything. When I heard how many CGI effects were going to be in this film, I was worried that those might take away from the struggle of the characters, but Jackson balanced them perfectly. The battle sequences are unlike anything you've ever seen in movies before. The Fields of the Pelennor was amazing, with Aragorn and his army of the dead on one side, and Theoden and his Riders on the other. My only real complaint is the ending. It should have been longer. After sitting through a three and a half hour film, I could have waited a few extra minutes for a more polished ending. It felt as if Jackson rushed to tie up the loose ends, but that is a mistake often made in long productions. Despite that, Return of the King shines as one of the best movies of all time. Take a bow Mr. Jackson, you did it.
9.0~I give 9/10 because they cutted too much.. (read more) Genadi Sign in Permalink The movie is great, Storyline perfect, Special Affect as well. Actors did their best all is good, but they cutted little too much and now the Storyline moves too fast - cutedthe battle with Saruman, and many other things. If I think about it, and if I would have home cinema system I would definatly wait for the EE or SE DVD cause w/out those stuff it spoils the whole movie.. perhaps not much but still.
10.0~Without a Doubt The Greatest Film in Cinema History afroman_123_3 Sign in Permalink There is not much I can say about The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King because it wouldn't do it justice. The acting of the leads is enough to make it a great film, but the special effects and music put it over the top. You stare at the screen looking at a cavalry of thousands of men, each looking like he is just another stand in, but every last one of them is digital. When you look at Gollum you don't even think effect you think character performance. You see hundreds of men charging a forsaken city and the music puts you over the edge. I am a stickler when it comes to performances and visual effects. In movies like Scooby Doo you just look at that dog and know its a pathetic effect. Not once did I think that watching this movie. You must see this Oscar winning film and if you have, see it again. The Special Extended Edition will be even better.
10.0~As i walked in to the cinema i was expecting something i could later on call "the greatest movie of all times", i got nothing less. NoeMan Sign in Permalink Return Of The King is a 201 minute long movie, which is well longer than two average length movies combined. To be able to sit for all this time watching the screen without feeling like a minute of your time has been wasted, not even being close to be slightly bored a second of these 201 minutes is simply undescribeable. In this movie everything works out perfectly, nothing feels wrong and every little scene has a purpose. The characters that have been brought to live by the unbeliveable acting crew reach their hight in this movie, this movie is an emotonial rollercoast. During the highlight of the movie, the battle where hundreds of thousunds of Orcs accompanied by Trolls, wargs, ollephants and evil humans my eyes filled with tears and as a sat in the comfortable chair in the cinema i could hardly move a limb and i felt a strange feeling like butterflies were flying through my body, this was by far the most amazing experiense i have ever lived to see in a movie. I give this movie an 11/10, for it has climbed above everything else in this worlds it has also climbed above the average rating system. It is impossible to describe the glory of this film in words, seeing is beliving. Go see it, its an experience of a lifetime.
10.0~Words cannot even describe how incredible this film was Adriane Sign in Permalink Well, we are at the end of the trilogy. And what an end it was. Stayed true to the book every minute. I've never looked at 3 films the way I have looked at these 3. How did they do it? Would they do it again? Say whatever you want about these or any other trilogy for that matter, but this murders every other one (especially Star Wars-Lucas doesn't hold a candle to Tolkien). I think the end is best left unsaid. Brilliant from start to finish, enough said, no more to say....
8.0~An exciting action flick that is so much better than the other two cherold Sign in Permalink I wasn't planning to watch LOTR 3. I had watched the first one, found it as dull and overlong as the book it was based on, watched the second only because I like Gollum but found it dull as well, and figured that was enough. But after I read that the final film of the trilogy had won 11 Oscars I thought that even though the Oscars aren't that reliable I ought to take a look. And from the first, mesmerizing portrayal of Gollum's back story, I absolutelly love this one. It is an exciting, action-packed movie with epic battles and great special effects. The weakest part of the movie is it's peaceful final scenes. If you are deeply immersed in the story they are probably offer a satisfying emotional payoff, but if you're just there for the dragons and the ogres then none of it's that interesting. But that's a small part of a movie that is otherwise wall-to-wall action. Even if you're not a LOTR fan I'd recommend checking this out. You don't need more than a general notion of the thrust of the trilogy to watch this. It's been 15 years since I saw the last movie and 40 since I read the books, but even not being clear on who everyone was didn't cause much confusion. If you're new to LOTR: There's a quest, there's a hobbit, there's a wizard. Now you're all caught up; go watch this.
10.0~Exceeded expectations, which were high. Cybermancer Sign in Permalink I was one of the few that attended the Trilogy Tuesday. There were people in line at 6 AM in the morning, and some people traveled from as far as Oregon, Alaska, and Illinois to see it in Boise Idaho because it was sold out too quick were they live. Watching all three in a row made it really easy to pick out Jackson's kids as extras in each movie. It also added a lot to the experience of watching ROTK. Since the books are all one single story it is nice to see the movies that way. The fact Jackson left off any kind of recap (which was a good move) makes them flow really well. I felt like the movie moved along fine, with a number of very intense scenes that had the whole theater reacting. The ending took a while to wrap up, but if they didn't take the time to wrap everything up it would have been a major disappointment. I gave it 10 out of 10.
10.0~Four hours of pure film making PetarDuric Sign in Permalink Now darkness has closer than ever and Frodo is being consumed by Ring even more, people of Minas Tirith need to prepare for battle and Aragorn with kind Theoden goes into gathering forces. Gollum plans to take control and get his Ring back after a long journey that he has been through. Aragorn received sword Narsil so he can claim birthright while looking for help from the dead. Now Mordor's army has came to Minas and are preparing for a massive attack meanwhile dead decided to follow Aragorn and Frodo has banished Sam. Incredible piece of art and war starts as Minas is under attack, everything from quantity of soldiers to tools and things they used for attack then after Rohan joined to help came Oliphaunt-riders and almost destroyed everybody but Aragorn came with his gift and ended shortly after that beautifully shown battle. Frodo being tricked later on is saved by young brave Sam and now two of them are marching to Mount Doom. After massive losing Aragorn decides he need to draw all forces to doors of Mordor and give Frodo a chance. Giving one of bravest moments on screen a magnitude and facing a horrifying army Aragorn's belief has never stumbled. Frodo and Sam arrive into Mount Doom but Frodo being completely taken by Ring wants to leave and in all that intense moments Gollum takes over Ring and falling with Ring as he is the happiest in the world again. Sam rescues Frodo and now they are facing eruption of Mount Doom meanwhile Aragorn faces his losing and now in desperate moments there is a light as Eye has fallen and everybody is wiped away. Sam and Frodo are saved by Eagles and now all of them are returning to Minas Tirith and witnessing Aragorn's crowning and taking Arwen as queen. Samwise is happily married and Frodo has finished his writing he decides to visit Bilbo and with everything he has seen decides to leave to Grey Havens with his uncle but his friends unaware of that all burst into sadness and movie just put a great end to a masterful tales and incredible film making ever done in history of Fantasy movies and even whole film industry. 4/4
9.0~Impressive! mgm-14 Sign in Permalink I wasn't disappointed. True it was long but having read the books several times over the years I still marvel that Mr. Jackson was able to tell the story in three movies. Having read the books I can see where things have been left out, for this reason I buy the extended versions when they come out on DVD. I can't wait to buy the extended version of this one. My wife reserved comment all the way home and I thought perhaps she didn't like it. She has never read the books and loved the first two movies. When she finally commented she said she wasn't sure if she liked it or not. After a few minutes she said, "To be honest I think my problem is the story is over and there won't be any more movies." I don't think I can give it a better tribute than that.
10.0~Awesome! nathan-1 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson works magic! For all of you who whined about the plot changes from the books; remember this: Tolkien created LotR as a mythology, and it was his aim that someone would one day re-write it and pass it down to new generations (part of the 'mythical process') and that is what Jackson has done - continued the mythical process! The trilogy on the whole is awesome; a MUST see!!!
8.0~well...it's good, not perfect blncub Sign in Permalink just back from the european premiere, and - don't wanna spoil it for others who haven't seen it. just so much: don't expect to be blown away, and you will be very, very satisfied. personally i liked "two towers" much better. i think rotk could do with 20 minutes cut and it would be perfect. it should have stopped at the end, and not gone on and on for another 20 minutes. but let me tell you: the fist 15 minutes of rotk - the story of gollums origin - is the best and most intense bit of the triology.
10.0~My thoughts... kimbe Sign in Permalink In my opinion this is the best movie of the series. Alot was changed, but I think the changes made this a better movie. I'm not a total freak and I dont even expect this to be EXACTLY as the book. some things just wouldn't work in a movie. also, a lot was deleted, but as I hope and believe, extended edition will make this movie ALOT better.. easily the best movie of all time, which it already is. acting was good overall, but Theoden (Bernard Hill), Eomer (Karl Urban) and Sam (Sean Astin) really convinced me. EXCELLENT acting from these three guys! I really hope Peter Jackson wins the 'best director' oscar. the directing has been so magnificent in all three movie that it's about the time to take the trophy! the scene where pippin is singing and Faramir is riding to war is already an oscar worth performance!
8.0~Very good, but too long? SecondOpinion Sign in Permalink As expected, this was a very well made movie. The acting was as good as it has been throughout the trilogy, the scenery was amazing. The seamless usage of CGI and "real" footage was simply stunning allowing for some of the most incredible shots ever seen (the attack on Gondor). Gollum was brilliant, again. This is another milestone for CGI usage. They didn't shy away from close-ups of Gollum either. Other CGI elements weren't flawless but very good nevertheless. But! As brilliant as it was technically, somewhere underneath there is a movie, a story, something that will affect our emotions. I've read about people crying a lot during this movie, but to be honest, I didn't think it had that many super-emotional scenes. I guess you have to be a "Lord of the rings" -geek to immerse yourself enough into the plot, to evoke these emotions. (And I'm not, I've never read the books or anything, I'm just enjoying the movie...unspoiled..) There were scenes I didn't necessarily find briliant but as I haven't read the books I can't really comment whether they should have been included or not. Then of course we have the longest ending in movie history. I suppose Jackson felt that as an ending to the entire 10 hours long trilogy, it had to be of epic proportions, but it certainly felt as if the last 30 minutes could have been compressed to 10 or 15 without any significant loss of info. I just hope that the extended DVD version doesn't add to that particular footage. All in all, a very well made movie, I'm certainly glad someone decided to produce this kind of epic entertainment for us to enjoy, but at the end of the day I guess it's down to personal taste whether you think it's brilliant or just "very good". And I think it was "just" very good.
6.0~Come on now, number 4 film of all time???? hohumdedum2 Sign in Permalink Not to say that LOTR/ROTK isn't a good movie, it certainly is. It is, however, not one of the best of all time! As a trilogy it's one of the greatest next to the original Star Wars, but to single it out as one of the greatest films of all time is simply not warranted. There are many more films that are deserving of this honor, which I won't even name cause we all know, except for the fanatics of course. In my opinion, ROTK is the weakest of the three films. My favorite is the Two Towers. It really bridges the two films, and sets us up for what one hopes to be a great finish, but ROTK lets us down too often. I will give ROTK 6.5 out of 10. I just felt that ROTK should have had much more to say. Unfortunately, piddling around with material that many have heralded as great cinema has proved to be the case here. ROTK was simply flat on the emotional level. I hope Peter Jackson goes back to what he knows best, splatter films. Probably not.
10.0~Astounding tsangaridesi Sign in Permalink The movie was spectacular. The trilogy cannot be described in any word nor any string of words put together to form a phrase or anything else. It was unbelievably impressive. Starting with the movie, once again, the acting was phenomenal. The emotion evoked and the empathy one feels for the characters is truly sincere. It's amazing at how a movie can be four hours long, yet not feel as if it was more than three, or two and a half. The visual effects are incredible. The trilogy as a whole is unbelievable; marvelous; stupendous; phenomenal; you understand what I'm getting at. It is a true tale of friendship and love. It's an adventure all throughout; not only for the protagonists, but the viewers. The effort put into the whole thing is just shocking. Each movie was released one year apart of the other, and they're all over 3 hours long. The script is great and so is the directing, and everything else. There is no way this trilogy can disappoint. Definitely worth the eleven hours you put into watching it.
10.0~Spectacular venkatakaushik-64169 Sign in Permalink Awesome graphics and brilliant performances by everyone. Good story line.
10.0~The conclusion of a masterpiece g0rilla Sign in Permalink This film was beautiful, and it really brings everything from the previous near seven hours of film to a head. There were some small story elements I felt weren't tied up in the end, and some events that happened I wish they'd have elaborated more on. For instance, what becomes of Saruman now locked up in his tower at Isengard? What of the seeing stone Gandalf got from Isengard? What was the reason for certain characters sailing to the undying lands in the end? I feel the movie sort of left these details hanging in speculation, which has not been the pattern in the previous two installments. Regardless, the movie was excellent. All of the performances are top notch, and the cinematography is something to behold especially during the battle at Minas Tirith. There are so many characters on different paths during the meat of the story, and at the end they all manage to be on the same thread, and that is great filmmaking. This is the largest of the trilogy, and it takes its sweet time concluding. It is worth the wait, and worth the hype. Easily one of the years best. Get plenty of popcorn, you won't want to leave for even a minute.
10.0~How Would You Make It Better? rjdugone Sign in Permalink I noticed that the IMDb staffers gave "The Return of the King" a lower rating than almost any other cross-section of voters. That's not surprising, given that most film industry insiders prefer the kind of acting that takes place on a Broadway stage as opposed to the acting necessary in an action film. While a good movie requires good acting, a good action movie is more than smart dialogue and character development. In the case of "The Return of the King," we have an epic tale, a huge cinema canvas, beautiful cinematography, interesting characters, amazing effects, etc. I have asked myself this question: "How would you make this film any better? The answer is that I seriously doubt that anyone could. In my estimation, "The Return of the King" is the best film ever made in this genre, period. If you go to movies to watch an adaptation of a Neil Simon play-then avoid `The Return of the King.' If you go to movies to be swept away by amazing special effects, beauty, tragedy and triumph that takes your breath away-this is a movie for you. It is a long movie and I found myself saddened by the fact that the story had to end. Although no film is perfect, I rated this film 10/10-I need to counter-balance the ignorant people who actually gave this film a 1/10. They are proof that there is life on other planets.
7.0~How can it be #4? divinethunderbolt Sign in Permalink I don't think that without the book, this series could have been this popular. The third and final episode of LoTR is massive, well done and entertains without doubt, but I really don't think it deserves to be dubbed one of the greatest movies of all time, even though it makes a similar effort. For starters, there is no great story involved and the subplots aren't really interesting. The progression of events is the same as in the second part and really not very different. Huge armies clashing with nothing really new involved in the battles, constitutes 60% of the movie. The movie only really gets interesting during the very end but thats something you have to wait over 2 hours for. The progression and storyline themselves are highly predictable and there are no real twists which occur besides the predictable one in the end, which is quickly brushed aside and progression, once again returning to normal. I really wanted to see Sauron as a fighting form in part 3. He simply remained as the eye and made no great appearance, was eventually defeated with no effort. Instead, they just throw in some random general who makes rare appearances, does nothing to intimidate and gets killed easily. That was a huge disappointment. You'd think that some special effects improvements had been made in part-3 but thats only partially achieved. Obviously, they ran into budget constraints and cut back on the CGI budget. While the overall CGI effort was pretty good, it is certainly not the best in the world. Although LoTR was a mammoth effort and I really can't suggest anything to polish it further, it was really just that from the very start and is far from brilliant. The good thing is the experience that the director would gain from this project to go on and direct masterpieces like King Kong.
10.0~The best of the 3, and the most faithful of the 3 DragoonKain Sign in Permalink I've already given the other two movies in this trilogy a 10, and since you can't go any higher, this one deserves at least a 10 as well. The difference being that, originally, I didn't give the other movies a 10, Fellowship got an 8, and Two Towers got a 9. But after seeing the Extended editions of both movies, I had to give them both tens. The Extended versions were such big improvements that they actually fixed every original problem I had with the theatrical versions. But this one gets a 10 right from the start. I can immediately tell you that this was the most faithful adaptation of a Tolkien book. There are many omissions (that I expect to see put back in the Extended edition), and a few minor changes, but on the whole, this is the book brought to screen. And it's breathtakingly good. Everything great about the previous movies gets multiplied by 10 in this one. I don't want to go into too many details because I don't want to spoil anything, but In my opinion, this is the single greatest movie ever made. It had only one flaw, and that was that Saruman was not in the movie. Normally I wouldn't give this a pass, how could Jackson leave such an important plot point dangling? It almost made me want to drop a point from my rating, but the movie was so incredible that I couldn't dare. I'm also comforted to know that doubtless Saruman will be in the Extended Edition, which I expect will be over 4 hours long. I suspect, that after seeing the extended edition, I'm going to have to give this film an 11. These films require that extra umph on the scale. They go up to 11.
9.0~Trilogy a masterwork; however wishes from a Tolkien perspective paul-1175 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy of films by Peter Jackson were a ambitious and memorable stroke of master craftsmanship. I am awed by his ability to weave these complex tales into a coherent, entertaining and moving narrative. Several portrayals exceeded any expectation a Tolkien fan could have had. Viggo Mortensen is Aragorn in spirit and in bearing. John Rhys-Davies personifies both the character of Gimli and dwarf-kind with precision and Ian McKellen brings to life the essence and person of Gandalf with perfection. However, there are certain liberties Mr. Jackson took with the tales that unfortunately detract from the storyline. Understandably, it would be impossible to recreate each vignette from a 1200 page work, and Mr. Jackson's editorial choices were mostly benign. There were several characterizations, however, that vastly skew impressions from the original work. First, the character Faramir was far more noble than Mr. Jackson's portrayal. The film version of Faramir casts him as a weaker brother to the brave Boramir and film watchers must have been bewildered as to why Faramir would have released Frodo, et. al. when he did. Tolkien's Faramir was the alter-ego of Boramir; whereas Boramir was strong and brash, Faramir was thoughtful and mystical. Second, Elrond was portrayed by Mr. Jackson as a controlling parent who begrudgingly allows Arwen her mortality. Tolkien's Elrond would never have been so base. He was a high-elf beyond reproach or petty emotions. And most of all he would have understood the choices that half-elven made for themselves personally. He and his brother were half-elvenkind and his brother chose the path of mortality and Elrond chose to elvish immortality. Neither path was preferred. Third, Theoden was cast as a coward in the Two Towers where Tolkien's Theoden was a declining monarch who had yet to reveal his heroism and sought to be worthy of his forebears. Also, the enmity portrayed between Rohan and Gondor in Mr. Jackson's version added unnecessary intrigue that muddles the coming together of forces in Return of the King. Notwithstanding these criticisms, the films are extraordinary works in their own right. But I would implore fans of the films to read the original works in the following order. The Hobbit, although it is written for a younger audience it is a captivating tale and is required reading for background. Then the trilogy; despite their length and occasional complexity they read fluidly and all too quickly. But don't stop there. The capstone of the Tolkien work is the collection called The Silmarillion which begins at the beginning of his world and provides the stage for the remainder of his works. The Simarillion is much more challenging to read since it recounts innumerable tales but any fan of the trilogy will be well rewarded for his efforts.
10.0~One of the best Movies ever made! jonthegreat72 Sign in Permalink This film had everything; good acting, a fantastic screenplay, amazing battle scenes and brilliant direction. Peter Jackson's epic final part to Tolkien's Trilogy adapted for the big screen is just as incredible as the last. His directing skills are top class and his screenplay based on the book is sublime. As the broken Fellowship continue their quest to save Middle Earth, Frodo and Sam plod on through marshes and over muntains to their final destination, Mordor and Mount Doom. Unsure of the whereabouts of their companions, Gimmly, Legolas and Aragorn look for Merry and Pippin, captured by a party of vicious Orcs. As their quest continues and comes to its inevitable conclusion, fantastic battle scenes and incredible footage coupled with first class performances from the actors involved, it is an absolute feast for the eyes. Unmissable!
6.0~Great Filmaking, but not a masterpiece. rgv_russia Sign in Permalink First, what was great about the film. Peter Jackson has created a lush, realistic world for moviegoers. One can not help being caught up in his creation. The cinematography, effects, costumes, score landscaping, etc... all of it was great, brilliant. A true example of what a good director with a huge budget and great staff can do with a movie. Now what was wrong. I know I am going to catch flak from the Ringies outthere. I have not read the books, and, try as I might,I couldn't help but feel like someone on the outside looking in while watching this film. Most of my the fans I talked to made this abundantly clear-- unless you knew and loved the books, you couldn't possibly appreciate the brilliance of Jackson's's adaptation of Tolkien, and the greatest books EVER written. I understand that, I really do, BUT.... in order for a film to be a masterpiece, it needs to stand on it's own. If it can't be appreciated fully except by the already initiated, then it has problems. For instance, I haven't read Puzo's Godfather books, but I am still captivated by the film. I don't feel like I can't understand it fully just because I have not read the books. Also, pure fantasy, in my mind, just doesn't have the ability to get too much beyond escapism. For instance, in Mystic River, viewers can really identify with the characters. Although fiction, the film is still all to real, touches too close to home. At the end of the day, though, the LOTR stuff is still all make believe, like unicorns and dragons. That is why science-fiction or fantasy writers are never mentioned in the same breath as authors who write about real world characters and problems. All things considered, the ROTK, and other LOTR films, are great escapism, and nothing more. They are like the LOTR books-- masterfully written/ directed, engaging, interesting, fun . . . . but still just pretend, and are unable to connect on a meaningful level because of it. That's why IO give ROTK six stars.
10.0~Great Movie Ever... thandana Sign in Permalink I watch this movie since 2009. But, still I remember all of movie plots.
5.0~Nah.... hrothgar19 Sign in Permalink There's just too much material in the LOTR books to fit into even three long films, and Peter Jackson has done some severe pruning here, losing the rather bloodthirsty "Scouring of the Shire" and the downfall of Saruman. In fact, about a third of this movies is taken up with stuff that should have been in "The Two Towers" but presumably didn't fit. The major problem is that (as in TTT) Jackson has inserted yet more of his own Aragorn-Arwen scenes to try and keep some romantic plot going, and presumably maintain the interest of female viewers dragged to the cinema by their boyfriends and husbands. It's a waste of screen time which should have been better used. Visually - as with the other films - it's almost impeccable (a few obviously painted backgrounds here and there such as the Grey Havens), and the acting is first class, although I do find Legolas' stunts increasingly ridiculous. One day someone might make the definitive LOTR films, but Jackson has ensured it won't be for a long time yet.

10.0~The Best Movie Ever Made Planet-man77 Sign in Permalink This is quite simply, the best movie ever made. Accept it. Everything about this movie is perfect. Everything. This is the only movie I've ever seen that I can truly say that about. If you haven't seen this movie, your missing out on the experience of a lifetime. Don't believe me? Will the the fact that it's tied for Most Oscar's Ever convince you? What about the fact that it's the fastest movie ever to gross 1 billion dollars? Sean Astin, Sir Ian McKellan, and EVERYONE else in this movie gives an absolutely phenomenal performance. The special effects are flawless, and even the moments of comic relief are impeccable. If you only see one movie this LIFETIME, make it this one. For the love of all that is good, make it this one.
10.0~All Hail the "King" dieu_de_la_guerr Sign in Permalink Flawless? No. Mindblowing? No. A delightful blend of both? YES! I cannot begin to express my apprecation for this movie. It is a masterpiece, an amazing conclusion to a brilliant work of fantasy and imagination. While the startup is a little slow for this installment, once the movie hits its stride, it steamrolled me, leaving me emotionally and physically drained after each viewing. I find it too hard to discuss this movie in continuum, so i will resort to lists: THE GOOD: Shelob's Lair: Perfectly crafted as the last place ANY sane person would want to be, the lair builds up the suspense very nicely, aided by Gollum's creepy voice echoing through the caves. Surprisingly, Shelob wasn't that creepy at first glance. Yet, as she was stalking Frodo later on, the freakiness factor ratcheted up about 100 notches. Denethor's Madness: Too underdeveloped, but still good. Seeing Gandalf beat the Sh*t out of Denethor was awfully rewarding, and the character provided some interesting moments. Unfortunately, we never really know WHY he goes insane (unless you read the books), and this detracts something from the film. The GREAT: Ride of the Rohirrim: Both its beginning and end were STUNNING. Seeing them ride out of camp was visually amazing, and the buildup to the charge at the fields of Pellenor was spine-tingling. Also gives the second best line in the film, a la Theoden: Ride now! Ride now! Ride for ruin, and the World's ending! The Beacons: This scene kicked the movie into high gear, and it never looked back. For such a simple scene, the effect was extraordinary. Combined with Howard Shore's masterful scoring, this scene flat out rocked. The Paths of the Dead: A scene that could have been so corny...at yet wasn't. The dead were eerily realistic, and yet they managed to retain the fear factor of being the souls of traitors and murderers. The Last Stand: This scene is kept out of the next catergory for only one reason: Aragorn's speech. The pacing was slightly off, just enough so that it made his speech sound a little top rushed. But beyond that, every other part of this scene was spot on. Faramir's Charge: This scene blew me away. Seeing a son give his life on a father's whim while the father sits behind stone walls and stuffs his face was so powerful, and yet very disturbing at the same time. Having Pippin singing just made the scene that much more powerful and meaningful. THE GRADE A, KICK A$$, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING STUFF: The Battle of Pellenor Fields: Perfect. That is the only word that comes to mind here. Frim the charge of the Rohirrim to the appearance of the Haradrim cavalry to the slaying of the Witch King, everything was spot on. And, better still, there were far fewer breaks than there were for Helm's Deep. Frodo and Sam: All the way through, this was the best. More specifically, the two climbing Mt. Doom was heartbreaking, beautiful, and so many other things all at once. Here the best line in any film is uttered, as Sam tells Frodo that can't carry the ring for him, but he can carry Frodo. This brought tears to my eyes; the only to have ever done so. The final scenes in Mt. Doom were amazing, especially when Frodo claims the ring. Brilliant. The Ending: Peter Jackson, I love you. For keeping the ending the way you did, you deserve an oscar. Some say it dragged. I say that it really showed that there are no happy endings. Plus, having Sam say "I'm Back" was just unbelievable. I was so happy that they kept that in. THE MILDLY IRKSOME: The Palatiri: A little too fake, a little too corny for my tastes. It got the job done, but I think there was a better way to do it. Showing what Pippin saw in the Palantiri as it happened, not after the fact, for example. The Dead: Having them show up at Pellenor seemed a wee bit too much like a cop out for my tastes. No Saruman: I know all the reasons....I still don't like it. It needed to be resolved for those people who HAVEN'T read the books. Arwen/Aragorn: What was up with this?! Arwen's life had nothing to do with the fate of the ring, and suggesting such an idea did nothing to advance the plot or build dramatic tension. On the plus side, Aragorn does get Anduril. No Gandalf/WitchKing Confrontation: Don't hype what you aren't going to show. But beyond all that, there is an amazing movie. The best work of cinema I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Seeing what was done here just makes me more anxious for the Extended Cut of the film, since that should fix most of my gripes with the current cut of the film. Thank you, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and the rest of the cast and crew. You friggin rock.
10.0~Incredible, flawless epic bdsmith94 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson, in his artistic, is able to created the single greatest masterpiece of a movie that I have ever witnessed.Everything about this movie staggered my imagination. The actors (McKellen, Mortenson, WOod, Aston, etc.) are able to portray their respective characters that Tolkein described to perfection. Furthermore, the directing, sound, costumes, and effects all combined with each other to create an unprecedented masterpiece. Only two movies (Shawshank Redemption and Forrest Gump), in my mind, compete with the genius of The Return of King. What separates LOTR from other films, though, is its success in converting a fantasy into, not only a mainstream smash, but an eleven Oscar-winning film. For these reasons, I immensely enjoyed this truly unique epic.
8.0~Visually Stunning; Emotional Enthralling imladolen1 Sign in Permalink Yesterday I spent over 12 hours in a movie theatre, but with good reason... I was priveleged to have tickets to the "one time only" Trilogy Tuesday showing of all 3 Lord of the Rings movies (the first two in Extended Edition form). Considering the incredible success this even was, I predict there will be a similiar event next year with the three Exteneded Editions. I was in awe during all three films (most especially during the Extended Ed. scenes from Two Towers which I had yet to see), and stayed that way until even now (after sleeping for a good 8 hours!). Jackson's skill as a director (and of course the amazing talent of the actors) shines more in the last 30 minutes or so of tRotK than in the entire rest of the film. He manages, with minimal dialogue, to take the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster. One moment my eyes are tearing up, and the next I'm laughing and cheering, only to find myself fighting back the tears minutes later. As a lifelong fan of the books I was totally thrilled at many of the ways the 3rd film played out. The opening Proluge scene with Andy Sirkis' real face shown as the Hobbit-like Smeagol (with his cousin Deagol) lit my face up with a smile that didn't leave for quite some time. I can now also forgive PJ for some of the various story changes from the book (Faramir's poor, almost bad-guy, representation in the theatrical version of TT makes more sense after seeing the Ex.Ed. version's scene with his father and brother), but one particular stands out: the lack of The Scouring of the Shire. They totally neglected what I perceive as the penultimate character developement of Merry and Pippin. After the end of Return of the King those who haven't read the books will not feel the depth of how much the two younger hobbits have grown into the bad-motha-effers fans of the books know they are. All the other changes Jackson made I can deal with. From the lack of Tom Bombadil-- which I think was absolutley necessary for a film adaptation-- to the elves appearing at Helm's Deep and the change Jackson made in Frodo's actions at the Cracks of Doom, the changes all made sense and even in some ways made the movies better than if they were page for page transcriptions to film.
10.0~Wow!!! Skeptic459 Sign in Permalink What a film! There was a time when I read fantasy novels avidly. This was about when I was 11 or 12. Peter Jackson has reminded why I found them so enjoyable. Roger Ebert comments that this film is not great. I disagree, I think this movie taps the spirit of the books excellently. Like the books, which were a great literary achievement, the films will last forever as a great cinematic achievement. Compare this to the other popular movie trilogies. The Star Wars prequels are awful. The Matrix lost its way. ROTK doesn't drop the ball. Instead like the cinematic equivalent of a Jonah Lomu it stomps down the opposition and scores a try. Now that we know the characters, Jackson builds on them and gives them a little more depth. Thats what I thought hurt the last film. The characters were too much like cardboard cut outs. The problems are still there but they are replaced with some fantastic performances. The acting was universally good. My favourite was Sam, Sean Astin is excellent as this character. Its funny because when I read the books, I did not really like the character and thought he was a bit lame. Astin is awesome as Sam and shows the character to be one of the most important characters of the story. The scene where Sam picks up Frodo is my favorite in the film. I don't know the actor from anything else but I really hope his career goes places. Likewise, Andy Serkis as the Gollum is also excellent and really nails the Gollum who seems to suffer from multiple personality disorder. Both actors should be up for an oscar. The film is exhausting but in a good way. I mean you have dragons, giant elephants, an army of the dead, eagles, a giant spider. All are excellently done. My favorite monster was Shelob. She was disgusting and really made me want to buy some fly spray. There is just so much going on that it is mind boggling. It is just a huge, huge film! What a ride! It made me feel like a little kid again. To me, I think this is the next Star Wars series. The next films that just grabs everyones attention. Jackson has set the bar for film making on a colossal scale. How many fantasy films work? Remember 'Dungeons and Dragons?' It would be cool if somewhere along the line, Jackson made 'The Hobbit.' I think Jackson immerses you in this world so well that people will be able to understand why their kids get so into this genre. The other aspect that stuck out to me was the camera work. Very well done, the camera swoops around giving the viewer dizzying glances of battles in middle earth. In fact their are shots that show such a detailed world that it rivals the Star Wars films set design. The shot of the dragons attacking the city is amazing. What is so great about this film is that 'the Two Towers' pretty much sidelined the Hobbits. Jackson puts the focus on the Hobbits and the Gollum. This really brings out what the novels are all about. That the smallest of things can fight and win against ultimate evil. Some complained the ending went on for far too long and I would have to agree a little bit. However it lets you know what happens to these characters that we have been seeing every Christmas. I noticed many differences from the original books but it does not bother me. I mean, if you want 100 percent faithful adaption of the books, read them. I just thank god that Jackson got rid of Tom Bombadil. I thought that character was so lame! The problem is that I really cannot see this film getting any oscars because it is a fantasy film. These kinds of films only get oscars for special effects. Plus with Clint Eastwood's Mystic River and Peter Weir's Master and Commander, I think these films will pick up the oscars. Especially Mystic River because it is a 'serious' dramatic work. A great adaption of a rollicking good story! See this film! It will bring out your inner child. ALL HAIL PETER JACKSON!!!
10.0~An epic masterpiece made even better in its extended form williampsamuel Sign in Permalink In 2003, Lord of the Rings- Return of the King won top honors at nearly every major Award ceremony, and set a new record for box-office receipts, one that would stand for six years. It blew audiences away with its epic storytelling and scale, surpassing even the previous two entries in the trilogy. It was a truly great film. And now with the extended version, it's even better than before. The reason why Return of the King, is so great is threefold. First, it's based on one of the twentieth century's greatest works of literature. Secondly, director Peter Jackson has remained true to source material, leaving as much as possible intact. And lastly, this project saw a near unprecedented infusion of talent and money. From the director, to the extremely large cast, to the effects wizards at WETA, everyone knew what they were doing and gave it their very best. Nothing was held back, no expense spared, and no detail overlooked, and the result is pure awesomeness. One of Tolkien's greatest talents as a writer was his ability to fill his worlds with a host of distinct, interesting characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and struggles. Jackson has included nearly all, and through them explores myriad themes. In Aragorn (Vigo Mortenson) we see a man who overcome his self-doubt and accept the mantle of greatness that he was meant to wear. He's also the embodiment of true courage, being brave or perhaps crazy enough to pick up the seeing stone and tell Sauron, "Here I am, come and get me." In Frodo (Elijah Wood) the story explores how even the most ordinary of people can accomplish great things, but also how even the purest can be tempted by power and corrupted by evil. One figure who cannot be corrupted however is Samwise Gamgee, who represents perhaps the ultimate example of friendship and loyalty, sharing every hardship, remaining ever vigilant against Gollum's treachery and the ring's corruption, and braving a giant spider and a fortress of orcs to rescue his friend, even after he had turned on him. Even the relatively minor Characters are well drawn and add to the story. Take Pippin and Merry. They're just a couple of goof-offs, the friends who are just along for the ride. But before the story is done, both will play important roles in the greatest battle of the age. Aeowen for her part embodies both duty to one's people and the the pain of unrequited love. And Legalos and Gimli, though largely relegated to sidekick duty, still show how friendship can transcend racial boundaries and old grudges. But the most interesting character of all must surely be Gollum. Twisted physically and mentally, and with a severe case of split personality, he hates his very existence, and he hates the Ring for what it's done to him, but he desires to possess it even more. He's like a schizoid drug addict- a violent yet often hilarious schizoid drug addict. It's amazing how quickly he can go from playful and comical to pure venom. And no-one does a more unsettling conversation with himself. He's murderous, he's repulsive, he's pitiful, and he's one of the most interesting characters in twentieth century literature. Of course this isn't all internal struggles and character development; it's an epic in the class of The Ten Commandments or Gone with the Wind, but with lots more fighting. And what fighting it is! The combat scenes capture the full intensity and brutality of medieval warfare, of pounding clubs and maces, bodies impaled with spears and arrows, or crushed beneath catapult stones (Within the bounds of PG-13). Yet there's also is the precision, even beauty, of Aragorn's swordsmanship, and Legelos's skill with the bow, their ability to fell an enemy with every swing of the sword or release of an arrow. And then there's the sheer scale of it all. The climactic battle of Pelenor Fields is the largest ever filmed, with dozens of siege engines, more than two-hundred thousand orcs, and a charge by six thousand horsemen. There are few sights that can surpass six thousand armored cavalrymen at full charge, but a counter charge by a line of mumukhiel is surely one of them. Add the piercing shrieks of fell beasts and an army of vengeful dead and you have perhaps the greatest spectacle ever to grace the screen. This may seem hyperbole, or even heretical, but Cecil B. Demile has nothing on Peter Jackson. I'm also highly impressed with the effects and technical aspects of this movie. The set pieces are among the largest and grandest I've seen, and the models have a nearly unprecedented attention to detail. And there are thousands of weapons, orc masks, and suits of armor, all beautifully – or gruesomely- done. Few projects can equal this one in the costume and make-up departments. New Zealand's Weta Workshop might just be the new Industrial Light and Magic. Now obviously all this was already present in the original version. So you may ask if this new version is worth paying to see, especially if you already have the original. My answer: absolutely. There's more humor, exemplified by a side-splitting drinking contest, and more character development, especially with Faramir and Denathor. And there's lots more action, including Gandalf's encounter with the Witch King, a longer fight scene with Gollum, and far more material with the dead men of Dun-Harrow. Jackson has also included important vignettes from the book like the House of Healing scene and negotiations with the Mouth of Sauron. And I particularly enjoyed Christopher Lee's death scene near the beginning. Bottom line, Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is one of the grandest, most exciting, and most inspiring movies you'll ever witness. Try as I might, I can find no fault with it. You owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially in its new and improved state.
10.0~WOW alr88 Sign in Permalink The only words I can use to describe this film is "WOW". Although I loved the first two films, ROTK has taken the trilogy to a whole new level. I dont believe I will ever go to the cinema again and watch a film whith such awe at what I was seeing an screen. My only complaint about the film is that all the other films I will see in future will probibly feel a bit crap after watching ROTK.
1.0~it will put you asleep because of how slow it moves gianbo911 Sign in Permalink it will put you asleep because of how slow it moves. Now its not that i don not like 3 hours+ long movies i mean my favorite movie is Once Upon a Time in America it's just that lord of the ring the return of the king breaks the record for slowest moving movie. Half of the movie is just Frodo and his "friend" Sam trying to find some type of volcano to throw the ring and destroy it before gollum can get a hand on it. The other half is just this big huge battle being fought. Now you expect a battle to give be action packed and give you an adrenaline rush but this movie does the complete opposite because of how slow it moves and how lame the few battles that are fought end. It is a complete waist of time and you should only watch this movie if you have trouble sleeping at night because it will put you to sleep after the first few scenes. I am still ashamed of the academy for giving this movie 11 Oscars and i am still wondering how it did not win any razzie awards.
10.0~I knew it was going to be good, but never expected to be better than first two! paulpersic Sign in Permalink This movie was totally magnificent. Peter Jackson really shown 3 things, he has created a saga as good maybe even better than star wars, it has shown that it is way superior than the books, and he has shown one of the best movies of all time. This movie won everything it was nominated for (eleven) and really deserved it. This movie was the only fantasy to ever win best picture, and the third to win 11 Oscars. This movie has brilliant effects, acting, and anything else you can want from a film. The hobbits acted way better than the second one, this did have and ending, and it was the best of the saga. It is all i can say, and let me rephrase it, I am a strict critic, and this movie has shown one of the best achievements ever. It is totally over-the-top recommended.
10.0~If you ask me, unreachable Ziya90 Sign in Permalink Yes, some movies are overrated, some of them are very overrated, some of them are in IMDb Top 250, some of them are not, but I try to say that people give The Lord of the Rings low ratings or don't agree that it is the greatest fantasy epic of all time, or at least one of them, so that they believe that it is overrated. The movies in the list are discussed above only is it overrated or not, does it deserve its rating, or it does not? If the movie had not been in the list, I am sure that they would not hated it like that. No fantasy movie can surpass The Lord of the Rings, if you ask me, this is the fact, not just I believe. I have learned that some people hated Elijah Wood's performance, but to me, his acting was outstanding. By the way, Hugo Weaving played in two of the most popular and phenomenal trilogies, The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings. There are some scenes that are enough to make the film a modern classic. The scene that Gandalf and Pippin go to Minas Tirith. I would not get bored, even if I watched this scene one hundred times. I don't know why, but I see this scene as a sharp response to the people who hate The Lord of the Rings and who hate fantasy movies. It is not showy, but spectacular. The scene which the beacons are lighted, the astonishing spider scene which the spider turns Frodo into a cocoon, the scene King Theoden and his thousands of warriors leave the forest. Jackson shoots such kind of scenes including battle scenes by panoramic angles that makes the movie more spectacular. There are a lot of dazzling images throughout the movie. The Lord of the Rings's battle scenes are may be the greatest. As you know, the longest and the grandest battle sequences are in The LOTR movies, one of them is in the second movie and the other one is in this movie. As said, especially camera angles are dazzling, but on all counts, it is extremely entertaining and spectacular, despite sometimes it is pretty exaggerating. The scene which Denethor looks down and sees the army is the beginning. Later, we see almost the whole army and I just love that. In an interview, for Jackson's battle scenes, Viggo Mortensen was saying that Jackson likes crowded battle scenes, more crowded battle scenes are, better for Jackson it is. That sounds great. The scene which King Theoden and his warriors come is one of the most dazzling parts in the battle. I don't know how many times I watch these battle scenes. There is also an image which we see the half of Sauron's army and Theoden's army while they ride horse to them, every time, I wish I framed that image and hanged on my wall. Not finished. Mammoths. The scenes they appear are great too, CGI is almost perfect. For the first time, I had disappointed with the warriors on the mammoths, because it was seeming that they are not belong to there, that world, but then liked it very much when watched it on DVD months after. It is exotic. By the way, the scene which they throw a marble piece to the commander who recalls The Elephant Man was not the same in DVD. In DVD, he spits on it which is ridiculous, but at theater, he said ''you have missed.'' which is great. I don't know why Jackson changed it. By the way, the movie is problematic, or should I say exaggerating about battle between people and animals. He did this in King Kong either. I mean that for example, the battle between Sam and creature, the battle between Eowyn and the mammoth (she overcomes it by four sword blows, it crouches by four sword blows!! How absurd it is, it is like what is the point then, if a female human being who did not fight before can overcome a mammoth and in an impossible (so unrealistic) way?) and the battle between her and the dragon. Gollum gives us a lesson. Bad people may seem aggrieved, downtrodden, pitiful, briefly innocent, we should not believe them blindly. Unbelievably, there is one more big battle and Jackson does not pass it quickly or makes it scratchy by saying I already showed them the longest battle of all time. Again, we see dazzling images, In terms of content and style both, the volcano scenes are powerful. A guy left the theater ten minutes to finish. I just can't do such a thing and was it boring? You watch it for three hours and cannot wait 10 minutes more? A critic also did it, he said on TV. By the way, I would wonder the extended edition, probably it is better than even this.

10.0~best film ever fowleymead Sign in Permalink This film is the best film ever made. This is because it concludes an epic story which is full of complex characters and amazing scenes.each has a different quest and most get tied up at the end of the film. In addition this film have various epic moments which hold the pure essence of film making and great story telling and this film is full of emotion which will attach to the viewer while they watch it. lastly this film has no points which get boring or uninteresting. Therefore every second of this film is epic due to its detailed battle scenes and complex character relations like Frodo and Sam which give warm emotion and courage to the film.
9.0~The epic ends in a Grand Manner enigmaticmaniac Sign in Permalink The final installment and the journey comes to an end. I can't believe that they were able to keep the theme up tight for the whole trilogy. This one is very long if you're watching an extended version and some scenes might seem stretching but nonetheless this one is again amazing. Seriously hats off to Peter Jackson for delivering such an extra ordinary series. All the cast members did a terrific job again and likewise everything seemed great. The battle was grand and the CG compositing with visual effects also is stunning as ever. It feels odd as it comes to the end and you'll find yourself wanting for more. Inferior to the previous installment slightly but still a marvelous piece. The series truly is an epic and exceptional. Highly recommended to all.
7.0~Good end, but not great bluryd Sign in Permalink I've just seen this movie and I feel a bit disappointed that I'm not that much excited that I want to be. The beginning of the movie is very good with the review of Gollum. It makes you understand more why he has become what he is. The battle of Gondor is the highlight of the movie but it gets destroyed of an army of undead immortal troops that I can't remember from the book. All the excitement is gone when the good side suddenly have an army you can't kill. The spiderscene never gives you the scaring feeling you want. It was done much better in Harry Potter actually. Some mediocre acting skills mixed with some goods ones. Sean Austin was very good while Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen have more to prove. The ending feels a bit too long and leaves some things out. For example the faith of Gimli and Legolas. 7/10
10.0~Hard to describe with word! Thaer88 Sign in Permalink As the summary says. This movie was so great that it's hard to describe it. When I saw the battle at Gondor and the battle in Middle Earth I felt that my body was freezing. It was so very cool and I got endorfin in my body! Wow, a GREAT feeling! Nothing was bad with this movie, everything were perfekt! It is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
10.0~Masterpiece for Ages to Come BaronBl00d Sign in Permalink The final installment of the trilogy has been put in place, and Peter Jackson and company have given us a set of films that will be required viewing to new generations. The third film - The Return of the King - is as good as the first two films. It ties up most of the loose strings very nicely and puts an end finally to the epic battle of good and evil that has beset Middle Earth. Although these films are separate, they really are to me one long film with much needed rest breaks. I can already envision sitting down year after year spending a day watching the whole film from the opening scene of The Fellowship of the Ring(extended DVD version of course) to the final closing scene of The Return of the King(Boy, I cannot wait till that extended version comes out!). Jackson's masterful direction and ability to tell a story with suspense and grandeur are not to be under-estimated. I hope that the members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences realize their duty and award him the Best Director Oscar and this film the Best Picture Oscar. Both are very deserved. Besides the rich story, the eye-popping cinematography, the compelling special effects, the haunting music, The Return of the King has some very solid performances by the entire cast. Elijah Wood gets little credit but his Frodo is well-conceived. Sean Astin is very strong as Samwise. Sir Ian McKellan should have won the Academy Award for his turn as Gandalf in the first film. Still good, he has little screen time comparatively in this film. Mortensom, Bloom, and in particular Bernard Hill all shine again. John Rhys Davies as Gimli sparkles with the little screen time he has. I was very disappointed to see Mr. Christopher Lee's scenes cut, but anxiously await them in the extended version. His contributions to the first two films are indeed very strong. Bottom Line: three movies had never been made at the same time in the history of film. These three were and they are cinematic gems! They have dazzled Tolkien fans the world over, but more importantly, they have turned thousands into viewers and even readers of fantasy. That is the positive power of film!
10.0~Last one! muhinst Sign in Permalink One of the best films I've seen. Music, scene details, things that make the film worthy of the actors.
8.0~For rest of scene see extended edition marysia Sign in Permalink Did I cry? Not really, actually. I thought I would cry a lot but I didn't. I got tearful three times, but not all out crying. Those times were when Merry and Pippin are seperated, the look on their faces is heartbreaking. When Pippin sings over the Osgiliath scene. When the Rohan fight the Mumakil. Did I like it? Yes. And then again no. It wasn't the experience that Fellowship was for me and I don't think it ever could have been. I'm too tainted by behind the scenes footage and technical effects explanations and knowledge of the actors to see the movies the way I saw Fellowship. When I see them I still tend to think Dominic before Merry and Orlando before Legolas etc. I know too much. OTOH I think this will be similar to the way TTT was for me, I will settle into the DVD much more easily than I did to the movie in the peace of my own couch in the dark with a cup of tea and no pressure. I am inclined to say that Peter Jackson has one main weakness, an occasional lack of subtlety. This manifests itself sometimes as excess schmaltz (especially present toward the end of the movie) and sometimes as inappropriate humour (see Gimli) and sometimes in his over-enjoyment of gross-out gore (less of an issue but a few scenes are a bit more ridiculous than they should be). Major props to Bernard Hill who impressed me hugely in this and Two Towers, I never failed to be amazed by how well he hit his character. I loved every second of Pippin and Merry and crave more of them, one of my favourite scenes was their first one at Isengard. And yes, Shelob was very cool and I did unexpectedly rather enjoy Legolas downing the Oliphaunt. I can't quite get the hang of Hugo Weaving, he always seems to be slightly on the outside of a movie looking in. At least he was in the Matrix, especially the last one, but I felt it in this too. Eg. Scene - Rohirrim Camp - a tent Elrond: I can't believe how much better than the Matrix this movie is! And check out this rad costume! Aragorn: Huh? Elrond: Oh right, sword, plot, thingy... Aragorn: *brandishes sword in manly fashion* The focus remains solidly on Sam and Frodo, but their story was actually the least interesting, it felt a bit like the same thing over and over again. A little bit of plot and then a break to see Sam and Frodo trudge some more and Gollum talk to himself. The editing was choppy especially towards the end, I suspect the extended version will flow better as no matter what they say about the film version being the real version in this case I really don't think it is.
10.0~Coolest trilogy ever lordzedd-3 Sign in Permalink I got to admit that I am impressed with THE RETURN OF THE KING. The final installment of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. The story, the characters and the acting are true to the novel. No major changes that I can tell either. The best picture of the year and for once in the history of the Oscars, I agree whole heartily. The emotion, the monsters, the effects were all just perfect. Not thrilled with the design of the Nazgul, I liked the TV animated movie much better. The floating glowing eyes thing. Anyway, I do feel that this is a perfect movie and I would hate to think that anyone on this planet would hate or even dislike this movie, I think everyone should see it and I give it a perfect 10 STARS.
10.0~Virtually a perfect movie mystikmike Sign in Permalink Wow. Translating books to movies is never easy. This series isn't perfect either, but Peter Jackson and his team have done a wonderful job providing their own, loving interpretation of the series. ROTK isn't just the icing on the cake - it's the cake sublime. This movie triptych is now complete with Return of the King. Looking back on the first two movies, it becomes more apparent what the Jackson team was doing with lighting, the color palette of the movies, the tone of the action. It was all foreplay for ROTK. Building the tension, and then resolving it in a crescendo worth of the best classical composers (think Holst's Planets). Return of the King was a perfect mix of action, romance, and a little over the top humor (Legolas "skateboarding" off the oliphaunt's tusk after completing his one man wrecking crew job a prime example. This is a series I will watch again and again. Like a fine wine, I'm sure new elements will appear with each taste. Very nicely done!
10.0~Triumph and Regret TennisW61-1 Sign in Permalink There were reservations about "Return of the King," the last installment of the `Lord of the Rings' series. The disappointing endings of other renowned trilogies, such as "The Godfather" or "Matrix," factors into our prospects about "King." Could Peter Jackson really triumph over expectation, and over one of the most hyped-up films in history? As one reviewer, I say to lay your concerns aside; I aver that this is the best trilogy to hit screens and one of the best, if not the best, films of the year. Why best film of the year? `Best pictures' exhibit a collaboration of all mediums, a synthesis of the various components that make a film possible. In this case, the direction, writing, production design, photography, music score, and acting weave a prodigious and exquisite tapestry: a visual and emotional delight. I can't remember a cinematic experience where I was continuously moved expressively scene after scene - and it began with Gandalf's entry into Minas Tirith. As Gandalf rides on Shadowfax, up the many tiers that compose Minas Tirith, Jackon meticulously blends real-time shots, miniature shots, and digital effects to construct a city so genuine and tangible, you'd believe it has to exist somewhere on this earth. Each scene in `King' showcases the talent wrangled into producing these films, especially the acting. I was foremost disappointed with the lack of character development in `Two Towers,' the second film in the trilogy; the acting was by far average in `Two Towers' with no one really exhibiting that spark like Ian Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen or Sean Bean demonstrated in `Fellowship.' In `King' though, the stars shine. Merry and Pippen, the two other hobbits in this story, have barely realized their potential for emotional impact in the first two installments. In `King,' the hobbits come full circle, and Jackson bestows upon them maturity and good dialogue, which gives Billy Boyd (Pippen) and Dominic Monaghan (Merry) their chance to truly shimmer. Early in `King' Merry and Pippen are separated, and after experiencing such peril together in the first two installments, they must learn to acclimatize to new circumstances. Alone, the hobbits find a fighting spirit, find courage, and find a new place in our hearts. The relationships between characters are expertly utilized. Gandalf and Pippen have a rapport almost unmatched in `King.' In one scene, as the army of Mordor is breaking into Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Pippen exchange poignant lines. Pippen remarks how this is not the way he thought things would end. Gandalf, being the wizard and father figure, says that death is not the end, just another path we take. The wizard speaks of an afterlife and the rolling of gray and white shores, which calm Pippen. It is a moment of serenity in despair. Ian Mckellen displays the brilliance he exhibited in `Fellowship' again; his tone, nuances, subtle stares, and authority of the character almost outshines all others. Merry and Eowyn, shield maiden of Rohan, also compose another dynamic pair: two characters who have been written off as unhelpful and burdensome by the men of Rohan: one because of gender, and one because of stature. But there comes a time to show `valor without renown,' and in battle, this pair embodies this Tolkien quote. But of course, the relationship that everyone has come to know and admire is that of Samwise Gamgee and Frodo Baggins. Their rapport in `King' is of a deeper breadth. Sean Astin (Sam) and Elijah Wood (Frodo) get their opportunity to truly show the quality of their acting. I was somewhat hesitant to give props to Elijah Wood for his portrayal of Frodo in the previous two films: I felt that his acting was moderate and at times, forced. I know Wood is a good actor though, after having seen previous films like `North' and `The War.' I was waiting for that moment in which he could really take Frodo to another level; he does in `King.' Astin and Wood no longer force their characterizations in `King,' but envelop and enhance the traits of Frodo and Sam as if their own. I was surprised by the high quality of acting exhibited in `King.' McKellen or Astin may have Oscar contention; as for Elijah, it is just a `fool's hope' for a nomination. Of course, Andy Serkis's loan of body and voice for the CG character of Gollum (aka Smeagol) is again estimable. The color palate has been shifted in `King.' Jackson chose brighter hues, more colorful than the last two films. `Fellowship' was bathed in an eerie golden and brown glow, `Two Towers' in gray and stone. `King' is full of rich color. It renders the picture more tangible and touchable, emotionally and mentally. The visual effects are again immense and audacious - but the special effects only augment or enhance the story, not overrun it. This is one of the best qualities demonstrated by Jackson throughout the trilogy. In addition, Howard Shore shows his maturity as a composer in `King.' He invites three new players to the soundtrack: Sir James Galway, renowned flutist; Renée Fleming, whose voice is of a mournful and melancholy tone; and Annie Lennox, who lends the perfect voice to end the trilogy: she exemplifies triumph over adversity, the regret of parting friends, but the sweetness of knowing that the world is at peace - for a little while. `Return of the King' is a brilliant end to the trilogy. It is amazing how a trilogy of pop films can be embraced by all ages and cultures. It has meaning and message for everyone. Maybe we can learn from the basic themes of Tolkien: finding strength in the face of certain doom, love and protection of the environment and physical world around us, and the meaning of fellowship: all our fates are interconnected. Peace cannot be achieved without the participation of all those who reside on earth.
10.0~It Doesn't get any better than this nanschmidt2000 Sign in Permalink Great job on all of the movies in the Trilogy. I read the books back in the sixties and fell in love with them and read them over and over again. Yes at times the movies have differences from the books but I don't think anyone could have done a better job.
9.0~Classic! dfranzen70 Sign in Permalink To say that this is an epic movie might be an understatement, especially in a time when movies such as Armageddon, Independence Day, and The Hulk are considered to be "epic" movies. True epic movies, you see, have not only bombast and pomp but also portend Great Importance. An epic movie is one that establishes a tone of deep meaning, not harmless fluff. And so it is with all three of the Lord of the Rings movies. In The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), we learn of a bad of nine travelers with the task of returning the One Ring to the fires of Mount Doom, from which the adornment was made. In The Two Towers (2002), we follow their travails as some of the members split up, with returning the ring still the ultimate goal. Now, with The Return of the King, we see their tales told in full. Will Frodo and Sam make it to Mount Doom, past the gigantic army of orcs, without the Lidless Eye spotting them? Will Aragorn (the King of the title) be able to rally enough troops to forestall the orc attacks? Will any of the original Fellowship fall along the way, to be forgotten except in hobbit songs evermore? The story thread picks up right where The Two Towers left off. Frodo (bearing the ring) and Sam are now separated from the rest of their crew and are on a singular mission to return the ring to its foundry. With them is Gollum, a former hobbit whose long possession of the One Ring has driven him completely mad and has transformed his appearance into that of some underground netherworld creature, rather than a jolly hobbit. Meanwhile, Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, and Leglolas arrive at Orthanc, the tower formerly held by Saruman (the evil wizard). Saruman's been deposed by the Ents, a race of sentient trees headed by Treebeard. With Treebeard are two more of the original Fellowship: the hobbits Merry and Pippin. Doom is approaching. Sauron's minions are assembling massive orc armies to overrun the entire area, hoping to bring about the end of the Age of Man. It's up to Aragorn and the gang to save the day. Each of the three movies has been an absolute joy to watch. Even if one has never read one word of J.R.R. Tolkien, one is very quickly drawn into the story, into the world of Middle-Earth. Even if one cannot tell an orc from a Balrog, one can follow the sometimes complicated storylines. This is because director Peter Jackson does an incredible job of explaining things without getting bogged down in the myriad details that Tolkien's epic book (or books) provided. As with most epic movies, this one grabs you in two distinct places: the heart and the mind. The audience is properly mesmerized as the soldiers of Gondar race to the aid of those of Rohan, as the orc legions attack the castle at Minas Trith. All of the scenes, from the quiet, underplayed exchanges between Sam and Frodo to the wild, chaotic war, were suitably jam-packed with emotion. You'd have to be quite the zombie not to fall completely under the spell of these movies, especially these characters. While Jackson took a few liberties with the plot (as he did in The Two Towers), none of the changes detracted from the movie itself. Because Tolkien's fantasy epic was so chock full of nuance, it was inherently necessary to chop some of them from the movie. Film as a medium is more conducive to images than to facts and other details. This was not a movie that one could simply watch and cheer the good guys on lustily. This movie drew one in so deeply that you lived and breathed as the characters lived and breathed. When Frodo is attacked by the spider Shelob, you jump with him. You feel it when he's injected with her poison. When the orcs are attacking the castle with their war machines and their oliphaunts (think mastadons), you cringe with the denizens of the city of kings. As an audience, you never feel detached from the action. But in addition to all the mesmerizing, eye-popping action, there were a great many tearful scenes. I mean scenes so powerful that only the most robotic among us could look away without shedding a tear. There were plenty of sniffles and tears in our theater the other day. Fantastic evocative performances by everyone in the cast, especially Sean Astin as Sam, Billy Boyd as Pippin, David Wenham as Faramir, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and Miranda Otto as Eowyn. Oh, and definitely the great Ian McKellen as Gandalf. Not a dry eye in the place. The sweet, gentle ending was as poignant an ending as I've ever seen in a movie. The ending, by the way, ties everything up nicely - but not too nicely. And, it's important to note, it ends just as the book does. The movie is as close to perfection as possible, with the two tales of Frodo and Sam and the orc attacks neatly dovetailing, then culminating at the same time. And the editing is never jarring, even though quite a bit had to be cut in order for the film to be released - and it's still nearly 3.5 hours long! The Return of the King is a beautiful masterpiece, a pinnacle of moviemaking. It will certainly be up for a few Oscars come March, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were listed in the National Film Registry some year as one of the greatest American films of all time.
4.0~Big disappointment hamilton-3 Sign in Permalink I had heard that this was the best of the three. I thought the first one was very good, and the second one almost as good. So, why was I nodding off during the final episode? For one thing, the story isn't all that interesting. Characters abound but there is little depth to most of them, despite the extravagant amount of time available for character development. And really, yet another orc siege on a human stronghold, with a flimsy subplot about a father attempting to burn his not-quite-dead son. Nothing really new or interesting to add to the previous two episodes. I don't know which are more boring, the elves or the ghost army. And don't get me started about the extended epilogue. Pointless. I apologize to the many true believers, but this movie is a bloated, boring, anticlimactic conclusion to the series. The three films as a whole provide a decent adaptation of trilogy. Unfortunately, the concluding episode only detracts from those that came before.
10.0~Lord of the Rings a masterpiece scotchcowboy Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy is, in my humble opinion, the most aesthetic and amazing examples of film ever created. Maybe a hyperbole, but it is incredible. It has the scope and splendor of a vast historical epic, the depth and intimacy of a small production, and better special effects than any big blockbuster. The fact that it is a romantic fantasy does not in any way detract from its ability to move. Peter Jackson is one of the greatest directors, simply because of his achievement here. He has adapted one of the greatest books ever written into a realistic and believable experience. These stories are not some simplistic children's story: they are elaborate and dark, haunting and uplifting, sweeping and deep. I kind of run out of words to say. To me, they are perfect movies. Unfortunately, they are sometimes looked down upon because they are, indeed, fantasy. But they do not feel that way. They are not corny or cheesy or presented with a 'wink'. You are meant to believe and to feel and to be drawn in. I was. Maybe I am weird, but I would love to journey through Middle-earth for awhile. When things get rough here and I feel trapped and cut off, I wouldn't mind hiking with Aragorn and Gandalf and the others of the Fellowship for a time. It's a way to escape for a little bit. It shows our world through different glasses. And it is beautiful and disturbing at the same time. Congratulations to all who worked on this movies. They are moved me and many others, and while so many of its fans are regarded as nerds and geeks, The Lord of the Rings is indisputably a masterpiece.
10.0~Absolutely Outstanding rchrdshelt Sign in Permalink PERFECTION has to be the best word to describe this terrific movie. It has everything you could ever want including a great story, characters, direction, editing, sound music, effects, acting, funny lines, settings. I could go on forever with praise talking about how outstanding this movie is and how emotional it was. It has to be the greatest movie ever made. FOTR and TTT were both terrific as well but this one has to be the best of all three by far. Once I walked out that cinema theatre I was just blown away and knew it was and if you haven't seen it yet then let me tell you now. This movie will take your breath away. Enjoy now and for many milleniums to come! Outstanding! 1000000000000/10
8.0~nice movie dinumanakkal Sign in Permalink Nice movie....very good story line...I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring. My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.
7.0~Good, but less enjoyable than its predecessors jerrywilson Sign in Permalink First, let me say that I did like "Return of the King." It's a special effects masterpiece that is destined to become a classic, along with the first two installments in the "Lord of the Rings" saga. But, to me, it was far less enjoyable than the first two films, the second of which was the best of the three. "King" was far too long for what it had to say. And the ending (or should I say endings) really disappointed me. I kept waiting for the film to end, but it just kept going on and on. There were at least four times that I thought the film was over, but then the next scene would fade in. It would have been a much better ending if the film had finished with the resolution of the final battle, and then showed the denouement as a montage next to the closing credits. It would have removed about 20 minutes from the overly-lengthy film and would have made the ending less of a "cut-and-paste" style. So I'll give it a solid 7. But to me, it has been seriously over-rated by both fans and critics. I'm surprised that more of the critics, at least, haven't picked up on the weak ending.
10.0~Somewhat like the old Buddhist monk... nohj94 Sign in Permalink They say there once lived an old Buddhist monk, who spent his entire life searching for the truth, until one day the truth knocked on his door, and he said to it, "Go away! I'm looking for the truth!" What does this have to do with Return of the King? Absolutely nothing...but this movie is incredible, the best of the year, probably the best ever made. I can't express the passion in this film. Go see it for yourself.
10.0~3 Hours long... still I want more! kss33 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King begins a little slowly and though some may complain this is important for a little side story and character development. Dont Worry no spoilers herein. But soon you will realize that the slow start is just the calm before the storm for one of the most magical and elegant moments in cinema, the Final Battle for middle Earth. Once the movie goes into the second hour I was sitting up straight for the rest of it. (I was kinda lying flat in my seat). It is an amazing journey. Since I haven't read the book (I own it but never got down to going past the first few chapters.) i was making no comparisons with what was cut or missing and everything was making sense. Peter Jackson has omitted parts he found made no real dent on the storyline. Acting is superb as always. The cinematography is definitely Oscar worthy. One of the best movies I have seen. The Return of the King is an even better experience than the first two movies. I will definitely see the whole trilogy marathon when it is screened.
10.0~the greatest movie of all times mariner7777 Sign in Permalink i think this particular movie is fantastic because of the great end it has been for the trilogy and clearly this is the best way to end a trilogy or whatever.this is also the best film of the trilogy. particularly the start. i think a great start with an exceptional music score makes an impression at the very beginning which is very important. i think all the characters are perfect. ---spoiler warning--- the concept of the movie that anyone who sees the ring will want to keep it is amazing. also the final battle sequences is just superb. there is something in the movie that is so inspirational.i don't know what but it is highly inspiring.
10.0~A Masterpiece newkidontheblock Sign in Permalink This was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I think that this was the best of the 3 movies. No question that so far, this is the movie of 2003-2004 season. I don't think that it could be be better. it was a favorite among nerds and non-nerds alike. and when you make a movie like that. you've truly made something for the ages
10.0~It takes a couple o' days to get it down and done nemo21i Sign in Permalink The story is now complete. The last scene faded to black and the theatre roared and clapped as if the actors were right behind the screen, waiting to be called for a ceremonial bow of acknowledgement and gratitude. I've rarely seen such a phenomenon, "... and that say quite alot". "LOTR: The Return of the King" is the best your money can get you in this age. It is a well rounded story, approved by millions. It's a well sharpened script, featured by an excellent cast and tamed and tempered into a steel-hard-core entertainment, by a briliant director. They all did great - there is no other way to express this. I'm looking forward to check out the extended edition. The extended "Twin Towers" and "Fellowship of the Ring" boosted the film even further. That was hard to imagine. The last episode equal's the already extended versions, so it's enlengthed version must be what I've fantasized in my readings of the trilogy. Some words of resentment - the beginning is somewhat slower. Contrarey to the outburst at the beginning of the second movie, I was hoping for some of the same at the beginning of the third. Also, hasting to reach a certain point in the beginning of the movie made it feel as if the editor used crude seams to patch up holes in the screenplay. We got used to the little misses, we later get back in the extended versions anyway, so text-wise it is of little consequence. But what almost convinced me ranking it 9 rather than 10 (sinful thoughts, I know) was the lack of the technical smooth silken flow of later scenes, right from the start. I actually went to a special "Day of LOTR" event that included the first two parts (Fellowship and Two Towers) right before the world-wide premier of the third (At least world-wide in my time zone... damn liars :) ). Point being, I could see the entire story in tight ten hours, and I must say that it was not easy seeing them all. These can't be taken lightly - I felt exhausted, both mentaly and physically. But it's an experience I would never regret nor forget. The only thing that saddens me is that other fantasy and sci-fi movies rarely recieves such a kingly treatment. We need more of this and that done so. Right so.
10.0~Great Trilogy, Peter Jackson is brilliant! Patman7 Sign in Permalink Return of the King is an unbelievable film. It is very true to the book and has awesome special effects and action sequences. I have always felt that the story is truly one book with three parts and that is how I see the movies. The ending is sappy as to be expected, but I can live with it. Lots of the people in the theater saw it as "gay", but I saw it more as emotional. It is a shame that people think because something looks "gay" that it has to be so. Return of the King is a movie that one can see multiple times in the theater and notice something new each time. I know I will enjoy it more each time I see it and I cannot wait until the 4 hour plus extended version comes out. Great job Peter Jackson and company. May the Academy see the light and realize this trilogy is one of the best films ever created.
10.0~A Great piece of film making (SPOILERS!) rioksane Sign in Permalink All has been said before but here goes: ROTK is an excellent end to the trilogy. It had several heart-lifting moments, and I found myself holding back tears. Magnificent performances (especially Bernard Hill, Sir Ian, Viggo), perfect and well-blended special effects and true (enough) to the books screenplay. My favorite parts: -Aragorn challenging the dead people: he truly showed his kingly nature there. -King Theoden's speech to his riders just before they attack and the way he rides before them and touches their spears with his sword. Yet another king! -Gandalf's and Pippin's conversation about death. Overall Merry and Pippin were great. -Amazing ahots of Nazgul flying and attacking people and horses. -Sam and Frodo -Every time Aragorn or Gandalf pronounce "Mordor" or "Minas Tirith" - they pronounce it almost as it would be pronounced in Finnish. Minor gripes: -Some timing issues: Pippin runs up and down Minas Tirith to reach Gandalf or to serve Denethor. The city is quite high for doing this fast! -Sam and Frodo are far from the Mount Doom when Aragorn and the remaining soldiers arrive to the Gates of Mordor. -The mumakil-fight: though cool, it still was an unnecessary addition to the story. And it never looks real enough when someone is standing on a large, running cgi-beast. -The endings... Though I understand and appreciate the effort to close the story properly, I found myself waiting the movie to finally end. But to sum things up: Absolutely a fantastic movie of a fantastic book. My second favorite of the trilogy, FOTR (EE) being the best (as it was the best book also). Waiting for the extended edition! Rating 10/10 Thank you PJ and every one else participating the process!
10.0~The greatest finale to the greatest trilogy of films! RapdudeX3 Sign in Permalink Once again Peter Jackson manages to blow the competition out of the water and take cinematography to the next level. Every sweeping action shot, every camera pan is executed flawlessly, making this entire film a joy to watch from start to finish every time. Ian Mckellen is the star performer as Gandalf, as his command of the men of Gondor easily makes up for the fact that he's not actually much of a wizard. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin pull out all the stops to give a fantastic performance for the ending to a fantastic set of films. Hats off too to Andy Serkis as Gollum, with near perfect voice acting. The battle scenes have been copied many a time since, but the original is still the best. Peter Jackson proves that artistic license can be good, as the changes made are mostly for the better. Overall this is the pinnacle of film-making, with Jackson creating what Tolkien himself described as the "unfilmable" book. I strongly recommend this film anyone, even those who don't like fantasy, as you will not regret it.
10.0~The Return of the Epic EvilTommy Sign in Permalink Where to begin? I first read Tolkien's trilogy about 30 years ago and I've been waiting patiently for this incredible odyssey to come to the screen ever since. This final installment was the icing on the cake. I can't heap enough praise on Peter Jackson's vision, and the ensemble of outstanding artists who helped him bring it to the screen for our viewing pleasure. I beheld each scene as I remembered reading them unfold in the pages of Tolkien's written word, and I truly felt that I was once again experiencing a vision of genius that has again found a special place in my heart. Many of you will know what I mean as the journey comes to a climax in this masterpiece. I felt such a terrible emptiness as well, as I saw the familiar tale winding down to it's inevitable ending, and realized with unexpected sorrow, that this was it. No more to come. I can only hope that some enlightened soul will give Peter Jackson & Company an opportunity to bring The Hobbit to the cinema some time in the near future.
10.0~Favourite movie alinaadam-65803 Sign in Permalink The middle earth movies are my absolute favourite movies. Perfect storyline, great actors and amazing production!
10.0~Fantastic Finale hoy_man Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's epic ends in grand fashion. Without a doubt the largest and best fight scene I have seen in a movie. Great mixture of adventure, epic battles and comedy. Me, my wife and daughter were all awaiting the movie and were not disappointed. Hopefully Mr. Jackson will finally be awarded the Oscar for Best Director and LOTRs will be given it's due for best picture. Sean Astin is also much deserving for a Best Supporting Actor nod as well. It leaves only one question....what the heck am I gonna want to see so bad next Christmas!!! Congrats Peter!!
10.0~one of the best fantasy movie ever jacobjohntaylor1 Sign in Permalink The hobbit movies are better. But it is still all the middle earth movies are good. This movie as a great story line. It is one of the scariest movie made before 2012. It has great acting. Great special effects. Great visual effects. Great movie See it. It has a lot of action. It is long but so fast past that you will not notes. You could watch the first 2 movies first and you still wont notes the time going by. This is a great movie. One of the beast fantasy movie ever made. It is so cool. See all the middle earth movies they are awesome. Great movie great movie great movie great movie. See it see it see it see it see it see it see it. Some of scariest movie monsters are in this film.
9.0~As good as the first and better than the second charles11771 Sign in Permalink I have not read any of these books so I began this movie saga with some knowlege of the stories. In the first one I met the charicters and was drawn in to their lives and couldn't wait to see what came next. I was disapointed with the second and had reservations about the third thinking all the punch of these movies may of been thrown in the first round. The mistakes made during the second were learned from and were no were to be found in this film. Some of the plot twists that dragged my attention away from the movie in the second one were in this movie but done with much more skill and hidden under a story that kept me guessing. The action was fantastic and held my "just enjoy the moivie" gene not letting my mind stray on things that didn't seem right. Yes this saga began with a flury was paced with jabs in the middle and delivers a knockout in the end.
4.0~The end was a nightmare mmlill Sign in Permalink At the slow and lingering end of this epic I was not sure anymore, whether it's the "Lord of the rings" or a Naked-gun styled parody of this movie itself. Shame on You, Hollywood! Before that, though, it was as good as the earlier parts. So the first two thirds I would vote as 8 or 9, but the last third as 1. Taken into account, that it was the very end of the whole epic, I felt REALLY disappointed. I don't know, do You have to be enormous Tolkien fan, in order to forget any sense of good taste at the end of this movie. I am big Tolkien fan, but maybe not that big. And for me that movie and the books by Tolkien still remain two very separate things.
10.0~Awesome! Theonering4 Sign in Permalink This is movie is probably my all time favorite. It keeps your on the edge of your seat the whole time and never lets you down at the climaxes. It is filled with grief,love,friendship,heartbreak, and all around challenge. This movie is exciting and will change the world of movies.Although there are some weird creatures the movie is filled with characters from elves,man,dwarfs,hobbits,wizards,orcs,trolls,and goblins. This whole movie continuously surrounds the concept of love. Either it is friends ship, or a relationship. An example would be Aragorn and Arawen, Sam and Frodo, Merry and Pippen, Saron and the ring of power.
8.0~The elves were returning to their island-homeland - Valinor. urusankyu Sign in Permalink With the War of the Ring over, it signified the beginning of the Age of Men. So all elves who chose to stay in Middle-Earth would wane in power (that was why Elrond was so insistent that Arwen leave Aragorn). Gandalf is also from Valinor. He used to be a Maiar until he was sent to Middle-Earth along with 4 other wizards to aid in stopping Sauron. Bilbo and Frodo were given the privilege to live in Valinor for their part in the War as ring bearers. In the books, Sam Gamgee would be given the same privilege because he was a ring bearer too for a short amount of time. Great movie, really. You could tell that this was all from a book, but still, the effects were amazing and the characters were all very interesting. Although, it made you crave more. It's why this movie had all the perfect qualities that you can find in a great fantasy movie, but it lacked the ending. It makes you want to see the next movie in the series.
10.0~best film of the decade runescapepass Sign in Permalink as you see in the title, you can see it was a great film. i have only had the DVD for 2 weeks and i got a 2 disc DVD for £2.99. wow you might think. well back to the film, and this is a film whose without its amazing and stunning fights/wars, would be a OK film but wouldn't be a classic. when the battles begin, you can't stop watching- even if your mum asks you to tidy up. the scenes with the horses and their warriors galloping is breath taking and makes you want to re enact it as i'm a 13 year old boy, this was a film which you want to re enact and talk about. it fills you with thrill which is a very special thing to do. when people saw this, people were like, "wow what an amazing film!" and "it's so good, i want to see it again and again!" i think this film was done by the right people and acted by the right people you couldn't image anyone for the roles. Such as aragon's character, Viggo Mortensen matchs that style and his emotions were amazing. his fighting style and knowledge makes him a great character and Viggo Mortensen should of good a dozen awards. before this film, i never heard of Viggo Mortensen and now after his role, i regard him as a brilliant actor. another character who was amazing was gandalf and without him, this film would feel empty. sir ian meleken (sorry for the spelling mistake), his acting was so believable and amazing. but his secret to this as revealed in a episode of extras, his that he thought of what it would be like to be a wizard and well, that give us the great gandalf we know today! i think this film is the best film i have seen in years and it deserved every award. out of ten, i would give this a MASSIVE TEN! thank you!
10.0~Speechless! alloba Sign in Permalink Yes.... I have to admit.... the movie has left me speechless. This trilogy is a real masterpiece. I thought I had died and gone to heaven in that scene near the end where Aragorn faces the hobbits and says "You bow to noone", followed by everyone bowing to them. SUPREMO!!!!! 10/10 from me!!!!!!!
9.0~Story of Epic Proportions El_General Sign in Permalink What a way to end such a marvelous display of storytelling and grandeur! The final chapter of The Lord of the Rings trilogy does not disappoint, whether it be dialogue or depth of character or plain CGI animation. There were instances in The Return of the King that made me feel deep down inside that I was witnessing greatness unsurpassed by any before it and greatness that may never be surpassed. The one characteristic of this series that has continued to make it watchable again and again regardless of time is the believability of the characters, the fact that all characters (especially Merry and Pippin) seem so real that one could swear they know someone of the same personality type. Each actor gives each of their respective characters humanity, showing their ability to make the audience feel for them. Whether it be Frodo and Sam heading towards Mount Doom, Gandalf the White defending the race of man, or Aragorn and Arwen's love story, the audience can believe this is happening, making the movie more realistic fiction that fantasy. That's the greatness of Peter Jackson. Through a story about Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves, and Men, Jackson can make you tear up at the end of it all. However, the star of the show is none of other than Rudy himself, Sean Astin, who in the role of Samwise Gamgee, shows so much inner strength and blind faith that it makes you feel good just watching his every movement and listening to his every word. Having not read the books before seeing the movie, I experienced for the first time Sam's love and caring for not only Frodo, but for all the decent beings in the world, whether hobbits or men or elves. Message to the Academy: give Astin a nomination for anything. This is his story, his epic, and since the Academy seems hellbent on wanting to reward the entire trilogy, they need to reward Astin.
10.0~Best Picture of the Year ags28 Sign in Permalink The Academy will be doing themselves a great disservice if they do not give this film the Best Picture Oscar (especially after they snubbed the first two). "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" ranks up there with the greatest epics of cinema, and rightfully so. Movies like this are far too few. What can I say. The visuals are stunning, the acting is moving, the music is top-notch. This movie has it all...and then some! The plot is handled beautifully. Peter Jackson has finally mastered the art of balancing multiple story-lines. Members of the audience are left on the edge of their seats as Frodo and Sam, wounded and starving, literally crawl towards Mount Doom. Meanwhile, the greatest battles ever seen on the movie screen are fought in Gondor and at the Black Gates of Mordor. Timeless themes of bravery, courage, loyalty, friendship, and hope against all odds are explored and exhibited flawlessly. Some have complained about the ending of the film. I won't spoil it, but I will say this. The ending is taken directly from the books, and is executed beautifully. In my opinion, it is a fitting end to this massive epic since it completes the character-arcs of our heroes, and brings many full-circle...a necessary closure for the audience. The Lord of the Rings trilogy will never be forgotten in cinematic history. Peter Jackson has done what some had declared to be impossible. He has brought Middle Earth to life, so fully and completely, that all we can do is stare in awe and wonder...and give this film the accolades it rightfully deserves. 10/10
10.0~nice plesbool Sign in Permalink Look so good and very handsome, i think this film a make me angry anda style cool
10.0~He saved the best till last fifi-trixabelle Sign in Permalink I have just returned from my first viewing of Return of the King, and I am left feeling so many emotions you are wrenched between doubt and victory, hope and loss but the overriding emotion I feel now I am out of the theatre is one is sadness. Minor Spoilers for those that have not read the book. Sadness because it is all over, that three consecutive Christmas' of great films are gone, but what a way to end it. The epic battle on the Pelennor Fields against the personal struggle of Frodo and Sam and the treachery of Gollum. Despite being an epic film you feel for the characters, go with them every last step, believe. A lot of the book is missing if you are going to be analytical but when you see what you do you will be blown away. This is as good if not better than the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers. There has been a lot said about cuts but it is as long as it is and it is a great film, if you want more wait for the extended edition DVD. I confess I am a fan of the book and radioplay and have been since I was a wee small child so maybe I am bias but what a film. I am now planning when to see it again. May it live long in the hearts of fans, one of the greatest movie trilogies ever made. Frodo Lives.
9.0~Very good, but not the best. General Comment Sign in Permalink It's all been said, so I'll be brief. This film was very, very good. but after seeing the first two films of the trilogy, I feel that this was not quite so good, primarily because it seemed to go off track. Having read the books, I was aware of significant changes that the director made which seemed to me to diminish the story. These changes seemed designed to me to "hollywoodise" the story, so that greater emphasis was placed on the all conquering Aragorn. i actually though he was going to fight Sauron himself at the end! other characters were portrayed unnecessarily badly, such as Denethor. Gollum was treated without pity, he simply became a villainous ghoul. And i shuddered at the bit where Gandalf assaulted an unarmed man with his staff. That was quite simply not Gandalf! But despite these little disappointments, the movie still rates a still a nine.
10.0~Breathtaking KWSN67 Sign in Permalink OK, first off, Tolkienites will always have misgivings about whatever is turned out in film form to interpret the book, as will any die-hard fans of any book. But one must take this movie for what it is worth, an on-screen ADAPTATION of a FANTASY novel. There is no definite way that a Fantasy can be interpreted because fantasies are left in interpretation much up the the reader. Therefore, there will never be one PERFECT interpretation of a Fantasy because everyone has their own images in their own mind. That being said, this is an incredible film. As in the other two of the trilogy, it is visually stunning from the first frame to the last, something that has come to be expected in the series. Perhaps it is a bit overlong, but if the film is then the book is as well. A very impressive point is that there are really no truly dull moments in the film. It is not a film to take a bathroom break during, at any point. There is no fluff, all is vital to the story. There are no truly boring parts, all the heroes' quests are equally interesting. The battle scenes are magnificent, as usual, but at an even greater level in this edition. The acting is fantastic; there are no poorly-executed lines throughout the entire thing. The comic relief, when applicable, is great (Gimli's comment to Legolas after he slays the gigantic elephant is classic). This film is a certain must-see, and is destined to go down as the classic best part of one of the greatest cinematic trilogies of our time, if not ever.
10.0~The best film of my generation! Kyntara_Thelarus Sign in Permalink When I saw this film, I was utterly floored! I had never seen a film that ensnared every human emotion seamlessly like "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King". I have never really prided myself on being a "Tolkien Purist", so for me to see what these characters would eventually look like in the cinematic sense, it was like visually being transported to Middle-Earth. I have been a Tolkien fan ever since I was a small child and now at the ripe age of twenty-one, I feel that this film is a crown jewel in every sense of the word. I am in awe of the performance of Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol, I believe that his performance was deserving of some kind of an award. Also of note, the friendship of Samwise Gamgee and Frodo Baggins is the stuff of legend. The friendship of Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took is one that was quite amazing as well. The coronation of Aragorn, the destruction of Barad-dur, the defeat of Sauron's forces at the Black Gate, and the reunion of the fellowship(sans Boromir of course) at the end was brilliant! Through these films, I can honestly say to you, I feel as if I had physically been to Minas Tirith, to Hobbiton, Edoras, Fangorn Forest, and even the dreaded Mordor. To have that kind of impact on a viewer, it takes a work of sheer and utter mad-genius! I salute Peter Jackson, WETA Digital, and the ENTIRE cast of the Trilogy, you all have made my fantasy a reality!
10.0~Everything you've hoped for Captain-America Sign in Permalink I just got out of the theatre and my head is still spinning. If there was any doubt that ROTK wouldn't live up to its predecessors - fear not! It's beautiful, impressive, moving, awe-inspiring. Go and see it, it's SO worth it!
10.0~I lived to see them all! Hitchcoc Sign in Permalink I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied "The Lord of the Rings" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive. I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of.
10.0~An epic and spectacular climax to the greatest film trilogy ever created... just pure genius... pere-25366 Sign in Permalink What a breathtaking end to an epic saga that will go down in cinematic history as the best trilogy that was ever created (if it hasn't already). The culmination of 10 years' work and the final chapter of Peter Jackson fantasy adventure film series, The Return of The King fires on all cylinders, as we follow our favorite middle earth characters in a larger- than-life journey that will lead to the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Whereas in FOTR and The Two Towers when we were still learning about our characters and their surroundings, everything about the ring's importance and power is unleashed in this third installment and to great effect. With the exception of maybe only The Godfather Trilogy, the LOTR film series is indisputably the greatest in film history (it was only the second sequel to nab a Best Picture Oscar, the only other being -you guessed it- The Godfather Part II). And what more can actually be said? The breathtaking visuals, the outstanding character development, the epic musical score, gorgeous set designs, the plethora of visually striking creatures - there's never been anything quite like this on screen before. And there never will be again! Never has a film balanced electrifying action and substantial character development so deftly while also staying true to the original source material. It will never cease to amaze me how this was all brought to life. Through this trilogy, Jackson presents us with an unprecedented odyssey of friendship, loyalty, bravery, self-realization and so many other things. In the beginning, we are introduced to a fellowship of 9 individuals who are given the seemingly impossible task of taking the one ring to the blood-curdling world of Mordor with the goal of destroying it and saving middle earth in the process. Over the course of 3 films, our characters learn so much about themselves, about what it means to fight for what you believe in and for something bigger than then yourselves. These themes, and the scale they're presented on, completely transcend the idea of a movie and almost operate on a more biblical and spiritual fashion. And perhaps no film franchise has given us so many memorable characters as LOTR: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimil, Boromir, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Arwen, Eowyn and countless more. And that's JUST the good guys. We are also given such memorable villains as Gollum, Sauron and Saruman, in addition to the plethora of evil Orcs, Goblins, Demons, Dragons and other horrifying beings. If you think this sounds like a lot, nothing can prepare you for the sheer scope and vast vision of Jackson and his team. The franchise also has some of the most powerful cinematic moments I can recall from the last 40 years (Gandalf yelling "You Shall Not Pass!", The Battle of Helms Deep, Sam carrying Frodo up Mount Doom). Iconic doesn't do this franchise justice; it's legendary and it's immortal. It's Lord of the F****** Rings! Above all, Jackson stays true to the major themes and philosophies from the original source material while showcasing his extraordinary cinematic talent and vision. ROTK defines what a "fantasy" epic should be and becomes so much more in the process; it's a resonant coming-of-age story and a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking. There just aren't enough superlatives for this film. And for this trilogy. And when you do finish it all for the first time, you'll be left sitting there with a feeling of emptiness for having left this magical world but a satisfaction in realizing you just witnessed one of the all-time greatest films and trilogies ever put to celluloid. What a crowning achievement by every single person involved.
8.0~Flawed finale to the trilogy msquared Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is certainly the least successful of the three Lord of the Rings movies. It's beset by the flaws that often mar the last parts of trilogies (cf. Return of the Jedi; Back to the Future III), namely that the director tries to do more of the same things he has done previously, but BIGGER! While this gives fans what they crave, it tends to leave others cold - because by doing everything bigger, the bad points are bigger and more obvious too. The Return of the King is bedevilled by excrutiating slo-mo sequences that were often used in the previous two movies. Here, though, every other scene seems to be played out in half speed. Likewise, the scattergun narrative style of the previous film reaches new extremes here - Jackson is so keen to include as much authentic Tolkien as possible that the overall thrust of the story is lost. The most important part of the journey - Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring (against which the great wars are merely incidental) - is smothered under endless technically impressive but frequently soulless battle scenes. Ultimately, we have a very bitty film that jumps from scene to scene without any ready explanations (suddenly, and apparently on a whim, Arwen's fate becomes tied to that of the Ring; Aragorn finds a deus ex machina army lurking in the mountains, and - most criminally - the main villain of the first two movies, Saruman, is written out with a single, off-hand comment from Gandalf). The destruction of the Ring and Sauron is also anticlimactic - this happens halfway through The Return of the King book, with the real emotional climax being the Scouring of the Shire and Saruman's final fall. For reasons of time, this was dropped from the script - but there's nothing to really replace it. Perhaps if Jackson had opted for something radical like having Sauron manifest himself - becoming more than just a remote villain whom is endlessly talked up but never seems to do much except sit and stare - this would have been a better climax. That said, The Return of the King contains many great moments. Shelob is genuinely horrible, the arrival of the army of Rohan is a real air-punching moment, and the pyre of Denethor is a marvellous piece of over-the-top Gothic melodrama. Aside from the above-mentioned surfeit of slo-mo sequences, Jackson's directorial flair is readily apparent, and the film is never less than entertaining, and many of the issues that I've pointed out (Saruman's no-show, the lack of ready explanations) will surely be corrected in the Special Extended Edition. Having said at the outset that this is the lesser film of the trilogy, that's actually not much of a criticism - because Jackson's Lord of the Rings is sure to become the definitive interpretation of Tolkien's novel for many years to come.
10.0~The great film achievement of our time Marvel9280 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings has already established itself as the definitive epic film of the past 20 years. However, with The Return of the King, it's safe to say that Lord of the Rings may be the pinnacle of film in the past 50 years, if not all time. Everything about the film is a shining beacon, from the effects to the acting, to the sheer craftsmanship, love, and care put into every frame. The only word to accurately describe seeing it is breathtaking. The Lord of the Rings as a whole, and Return of the King in general, get my highest possible reccomendation
10.0~The Story Began With a Quest, It Ended With Victory Tyler_R_Weston Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is literally the greatest film of all time. No film can replace Return of the King. If I were to give this film a score, the score would be the last number in the number system. Over a googolplex. From the characters to the settings, no film can ever match with this one. I treasure the entire trilogy. I had hopes for The Fellowship of the Ring, I adored The Two Towers, now, I honor Return of the King. I thank J.R.R. Tolkien for bringing this fantasy to this world, and I thank Peter Jackson for bringing Tolkien's fantasy to life. This film is true Oscar material. This film will make all the way to the top of the 250 Top Movies List. No words existing can describe my feelings toward this film nor the trilogy itself. The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and Return of the King will astound you like no other movie has ever done. I thank all those who have worked on this trilogy. But most importantly, I thank the man who started this in the first place, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien. I thank you Tolkien, very much. Yours truly, Juan Carlos Urbina, a true Lord of the Rings worshipper
10.0~I Laughed, I cried, I was scared, I felt ALIVE!!! Trinity_Flame Sign in Permalink This is the best movie I have ever seen. I left the theater on a adrenaline high, not knowing what emotion I should feel.I couldn't keep track of how many times my emotions went from sky high to the bottom of the bucket or visa versa in a matter of moments. Not a movie for kids, but not one for any adult to miss. One piece of advice, though; use the restroom first-there's no point in the movie that's slow enough to miss!!!
10.0~A timeless work of art edgarallenpahl Sign in Permalink How can anyone in their right mind rate the Godfather movies higher than ROTK? I have seen both and there is no comparison. The Godfather movies are so dry and slow-paced that members of my family and I had a hard time keeping awake after the first few minutes. I watch a movie to be entertained more than any other reason, and the pointless themes of the lawless Godfather family were not entertaining, in fact they disgusted me. How can any movie that glorifies evil be so popular? I prefer stories with good versus evil with good winning despite great odds against it. This is exactly what "Lord of the Rings" is! All three of the Lord of the Rings movies are the epitome of entertainment in my mind. It is true that I have read the trilogy 25 times and can claim to be a "LOTR Junkie", I never in my wildest dreams thought the visual and audio representation of this great literary work would come close to equaling the impact of reading the books. Consider what happened to one of the finest science fiction books of the last century when brought to cinema: "Battlefield Earth", how it was butchered into one of the worst movies ever made. Therefore it was with great anxiety I viewed the first movie of the trilogy, TFOTR. From the first scenes of "Fellowship of the Ring" showing the war 3000 years before, I knew this was something never before accomplished. Each frame of video is a true work of art. The detail, scenery, costumes, makeup, sets, all are magnificent beyond belief and far surpassed any expectations or mental images I had. The performances were superb, and the mere fact that one actor did not stand out against some other so-so actors, is the reason why none were given an Academy Award. I expected Peter Jackson to place all his energy and perfection into the first movie and like nearly all sequels, have a serious let down in quality. It did not happen. The Two Towers was even better. How beautiful and marvelously detailed the sets at Edoras! The battle scene at Helm's Deep went beyond anything in cinematic history in scale and scope, and still retained the artistic quality of beauty in each frame. Needless to say, I was blown away! "Return of the King" is my favorite book of the series because of it's intensity and pure genius such as the tactical decision to attack the Black Gate, allowing Sauron to think Aragorn has the ring, giving Frodo and Sam a chance to reach Mount Doom. The movie did not fail, it triumphed far more than I could have ever believed. It is not only a feast for the eyes and ears, it will wrench every emotion from you no movie has before. From hate for Denethor as he condemns Farimir to certain death, to everlasting love which Arwen displays when she realizes that she and Aragorn will have a son and changes her mind about sailing to the West, every emotion I could imagine is brought to the surface and exploded a thousanfold in this movie. What shear bravery against overwhelming odds when the Rohirrim attack and how magnificently it is portrayed! How humble the hobbits are when all the great lords and ladies of Gondor bow to them! What great loyalty after suffering a nearly disastrous defeat, Theoden accepts the call from Gondor for aid! You can feel the vengeance in Eowyn while she confronts the Witch King seemingly alone and unafraid! The impact of hundreds of thousands of enemies at the gates of the city brought a feeling of such hopelessness! What an emotional roller coaster! For me, emotions are enhanced with breathtaking beauty. Such is the beauty of every scene in ROTK. Where I live, we are proud of our gorgeous mountains, but the lighting of the fires to call Rohan was breathtaking in the extreme, such beauty I though was only in the Canadian Rockies. The incredible detail of the city of Minas Tirith astounded me. How could this have been filmed without a real full-size city? Details such as the statues of the ancient kings of old down to the embroidery on the uniforms of the soldiers of Gondor were not overlooked and were tastefull and eye-catching! Why did this movie not win the Oscar for cinematography when Fellowship did? Was the camera work any less than Fellowship? I think not, but even more deserving of the Oscar. I could ramble on for hours of the beauty and majesty of ROTK but I am limited in time and space so I will not. Is it the finest movie ever made? Definitely!! Are there flaws in the movie? Yes, but if you try to find them, you are picky, picky, picky. Try applying the same standards to another movie such as "The Godfather" or "Titanic" and see what happens! I did not think any movie could replace "Star Wars" as my personal favorite, but "Return of the King" has done it and set a new standard that will be tough to match.
10.0~Breath-taking from beginning to end! michael-lawton Sign in Permalink If this movie is not a 10 out of 10 (excellent) then I don't know what you have to do to get one? Peter Jackson has produced a final piece to this trilogy that is every bit as good as the first two movies and then some. All the major plots and stories from the book are included and the cgi is simply breath-taking. I loved it. if you like the book you'll love this movie! Thank you Mr Jackson, now dust off your suit and go and pick up those Oscars.
10.0~Amazing Epic frito-03792 Sign in Permalink The main characters in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King are Frodo played by Elijah Wood, Samwise played by Sean Astin, Aaragorn played by Viggo Mortensen, Legolas played by Orlando Bloom, and Gimli played by John Rhys-Davies. The story focuses on the final leg of Frodo and Sam's journey carrying the ring of power to Mordor while the evil forces of Sauron invade the kingdom of Gondor with the hope conquering Middle Earth. Frodo and Sam battle the corrupting power of the ring which happens to contain the life force of Sauron. They inevitable throw the ring into Mount Doom effectively destroying Sauron and saving Middle Earth. The theme of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, especially The Return of the King, is the triumph of good over evil. Throughout the series and the final film the power of evil continually grows and collects power. The theme of the movie directs viewers to the idea that this evil is not necessarily some opposing force that was going to be created and need confronted regardless of circumstance. Instead, the film shows viewers that the evil throughout Middle Earth grows strong through the inaction of those strong enough to oppose it. Repeatedly throughout The Return of the King good characters are forced to make choices to either oppose the evil force or give up and allow evil to continue along its path. Theodin the king of Rohan has already defeated the forces of Saulron in his land yet still rides out to aid the kingdom of Gondor. Elrond, a king of elves comes to the aid of the humans despite his people leaving the land and having no more involvement with middle earth. Frodo and Sam are faced with a seemingly impossible task of resisting the evil power of the ring and casting it into Mount Doom. These characters and many others choose to directly oppose evil at great personal risk, and without the action of any one of them the entire group would likely have failed. The journey undertaken by Sam and Frodo is an illustration of internal struggles faced when confronting evil. Geographically speaking, the closer they get to Mount Doom the more obstacles and evil they face. The creature Gollum that they discover along the way is both an aide and a hindrance that they must deal with repeatedly in their journey. The geography of the land is used as a motif and becomes visibly more tainted the closer they get to Mount Doom, showing the corrupting power of evil. Additionally the ring of power is used as a motif showing the power of evil. The ring can, and often is, used to do good and save good people. However, the greater purpose of the ring is always to do evil and corrupt anyone that attempts to use it. Frodo and Sam's fight to transport the ring without actually using it can be seen as a symbol of how people attempt to fight evil without actually committing evil acts in the process.
10.0~A triumph for all who see it. sithvol Sign in Permalink NO SPOILERS WILL BE GIVEN HERE. I have just seen the Return of the King, WOW! That seems woefully inadequate. Any adjective my brain could conjure, would fall short of conveying what I saw last night. Every single thing that has been seen to this point in the series, culminates in what played out before me last night. Know this; Peter Jackson deserves the Oscar. Period. I have seen many movies in my 32 years, none stand up to this. The movie may be the most beautiful piece of film making I've ever seen. But before I get ahead of myself, lets break it down. The acting, as it has been throughout the series, is top notch. The best performances being turned in by Sean Astin (NOMINATE HIM FOR SUPPORTING ACTOR...PLEASE!), Bernard Hill as King Theodin (just masterful), and Billy Boyd (yes....Pippin will make you laugh and cry). Direction: What more must Peter Jackson do? He has proved to everyone else in the world, sans the MPAAS, that he is a first rate director in every sense of the word. Give him what he deserves and has deserved for three years. Pacing and Editing: This movie is long....longer than the first two, but flows seamlessly from scene to scene. Action: Good God! What more can I say except this; The battle at Pellenor Field makes Helms Deep look like nothing special. Kudos to you Mr. Jackson. I felt like I had been beaten up after the movie, I was exhausted. In conclusion I will say this: You will laugh. You will cry. You will cheer, and in the end, you will be sorry it has all come to an end. Bravo Peter Jackson, you have created a trilogy that will stand through the ages as the best peice of cinema to ever be. It is unlikely we shall see its like again. I am so glad that I got to see this in my lifetime. Thank you Peter Jackson, for showing us all what true adventure storytelling is supposed to be.
10.0~The saga comes to the end! Emerenciano Sign in Permalink After a long journey full of adventure and dangerous situations, the story is over. I don`t know if this third part of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy should be in such high position in the Top 250 rank (#3), but it`s a really good movie. In my opinion, better than the two first parts. Actually, the trilogy got better as they release each film. Great isn't it? Again we get astonished as we see the visual effects and the fights movements. They're so well done! It's not crazy to say it's hard to find such a good movie in this genre. In "The Return of the King" we can find more than just fights and violence. OK, this is not a drama plot, but we have some moments without blood spilling. The end, of course I will not describe it here, fits the whole saga. "Lord of the Rings" is good from the very beginning to last second. It's really worth watching. My Rate 10/10
8.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) MartinTeller Sign in Permalink I am a little bummed that this series doesn't thrill me like it used to, especially since it was once one of the few blockbusters of the past 20 years that I truly loved. The level of spectacle in the third installment is impressive indeed... although the Blu-Ray does highlight how dated some of the effects are already (just about any scene where hobbits are composited with full-size humans leaps out at you). And I don't even mind the lengthy coda, and am frankly grateful that the entire "Scouring of the Shire" episode was excised. It's a great part of the book, but in the film it would have been absurdly anticlimactic, and would have extended an already bloated ending. And this film contains some of the best emotional moments in the series -- even the "you bow to no one" scene, which could have been painfully corny, works well in context. But one does get a bit weary of watching battle after battle after battle, CGI armies clashing in constant frenzies of murder and dismemberment (speaking of which, I could go into a lengthy tirade here about the insanity of the MPAA ratings board, but I suppose I shouldn't go down that road). Sometimes too much spectacle just makes your eyes gloss over after a while. Oh, and Gimli's one-liners are still a source of annoyance, although thankfully he gets fewer chances to utter them. I'm ranking this as the second best of trilogy... more engaging than FELLOWSHIP, but not as tight as TWO TOWERS. I wonder how I'll feel about these movies in another 10 years.
10.0~Fantasy masterpiece Kubris Sign in Permalink IMDb Top 250: 12 The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is an incredible conclusion to the trilogy, a masterpiece of its genre, and a fantastic film. It wraps up everything, and has the biggest, most grand, epic battle ever. If you've seen the first two films and just haven't found time for the third, go make time and reward yourself four 3 and a half hours. The opening scene came completely out of left field, and left me thinking. It shows how Smeagol came to acquire the Ring, and the power it instantly had over him. We also see what the mad creature looked like before he was, well, Gollum. It's a great flashback, like a Lost flashback, and lets us learn about of the most interesting characters in the mythology. Then, like a good conclusion, there is buildup. The characters reunite, and realize that this is it, the final battle. At the same time, Frodo and Sam begin to near the end of their journey, and their scenes actually serve a purpose. We see the Black Gate, and the emergence of Sauron's army with the too-cool Witch King. We watch the seaside town by Gondor fall easily, and later a grisly part involving catapults and heads that seemed just a tad too mature, but reminds the viewer the ferocity and primitive nature of the Orcs. In a grand montage, the beacons are lit, signalling Rohan to aid. During this, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli go to find aid from elsewhere. The stage is set for a huge battle. And what a battle it is. Other than the Mines, this is easily the single greatest scene in the trilogy. It takes up a good chunk of the film. The scale and visual realization is unrivalled. The elephants complete the scene, as well as the Witch King's fate. It's spellbinding. The Ring, finally taking a toll on Frodo, nears Mount Doom. While the giant war is a massive battle, the Ring quest is a small battle. Frodo tragically has degenerated, with Sam having to push him to the end. The scene inside the volcano is amazing, as well as Frodo's line. These two plots are interwoven and create the most remarkable fantasy ever on screen. After all is said and done, we are treated to a bittersweet epilogue showing what happens to the characters, giving good closure. Return of the King is a stunning film, worthy of its Oscar glory and critical praise. I'll let the number speak for itself. 9.6/10
10.0~The best of three RooiJan Sign in Permalink Appart from the fact the end feels a bit rushed this has to be the best of the three. Loose ends, and obviously cut scenes (Frodo and Sam walking in orc gear. The movie holds it all together.... now we wait for Peter Jacksson to do DUNE
5.0~Worst of the three 1bilbo Sign in Permalink As with the other two films in the series I wonder if the director actually read the book or just had a secretary read bits of it to him. The scenes are drawn out to ridiculously tedious lengths and bits of the plot are missed out whilst other bits are invented. And of course to appeal to the "ER" watching mentality a romance was invented for the film. Then to add further insult they all burst into song at the end. I don't know if these films were made chronologically but the actors do seem a bit fed up of the characters by the end. Also, our Shelob was so obviously a computer animation it made the pseudo scary build up a complete anticlimax. Tedious.
8.0~All Good Things come to an END followruhulamin Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" is the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien's famous fantasy novels. Once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes, sets, scenery, models, CGI effects and Howard Shore's epic score to create a convincing depiction of Middle Earth. I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring. The action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time is over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets, models and cgi brings middle earth to life. All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy.
9.0~Fantastic - shame about the last 20 minutes tompakenham Sign in Permalink Brilliant and gripping. Gollum follows on from The Two Towers by outdoing all other cast members. Gandalf improved again. Was surprised by Jackson's homo-erotic interpretation of a) smeagull + the guy he murders and b) hobbits in general...hadn't picked up on that in the book myself. Fabulous battle sequences, perhaps focussing too much on the Riders of Rohan and not enough on the gradual defence and loss of Minas Tirith; I suppose there just wasn't time. Only problem is that the film is overly faithful to the book in winding things up - i.e. spends too long portraying the end of the fellowship and return to normality. Some of it is truly cringeworthy and sadly out of context. Luckily though, it doesn't detract that much from what is an exceptional ending to an exceptional trilogy.
10.0~An awesome conclusion to a masterful trilogy adrian-58 Sign in Permalink Return of the King had such a tough act to follow, especially with its task of drawing such an epic tale to a satisfying conclusion, and it did not disappoint. Potentially, the final part where Jackson ties up a few loose ends was a little protracted but let's not nit pick here. This was a film with absolutely everything. Take away the benchmark raising special effects, especially at the battle for Minas Tirith and you are still left with a story that captures the heart and soul of Tolkien. The character and story development intersperses beautifully with the action and the tension as Frodo and Sam drive on towards the Crack of Doom is electrifying. The ultimate destruction of the ring and the crumbling of Sauron's Tower and realm will remain fixed in my mind forever. There is even unashamed outpourings of emotions with reunions and partings at the end. Peter Jackson has thrown down a very heavy gauntlet indeed with this film. If anyone succeeds in picking it up, then they will be as worthy of the title of King as Aragorn himself.
10.0~The Best Movie Ever! penneyn Sign in Permalink As a Tolkien fan since the age of 15, I have seen many attempts to bring his vision to life in a movie, and in my own humble opinion, all have them have failed miserably. Peter Jackson has pulled off a coup with his Ring trilogy, and Return of the King is the masterpiece of the three. It deserved each and every Oscar it won, and the unprecedented honor of being the first movie in film history to sweep every category for which it was nominated. There were things in all of three of the movies that I missed from the books (Tom Bombadil and Goldberry, for instance), but I realize that Peter had time constraints to consider. However, I imagine that any true Tolkien fan would have sat through them had they been FOUR hours long. I would have. Heck, in my opinion, they were all too short by about three hours! Best movie I've ever seen!
10.0~An Epic Masterpiece mljohns Sign in Permalink I saw LOTR:ROTK last night at the midnight show and I can honestly say that it was the best 3+ hours I've spent in a movie theatre in recent memory. From the opening scene to the closing credits, the movie flowed well and kept the viewer's attention throughout. I went in fully expecting to fall asleep at least once(not usually being one to sit for 3+ hours) but I was emersed in this film. The storytelling of Peter Jackson is on display here in all it's glory. I can't recommend this film enough!! I don't want to spoil the story for those who haven't seen it yet,everyone should experience this one on their own. One last thing...Samwise Gamgee is DA MAN...um...er...HOBBITT!!! 10/10
10.0~Don't like it bog off jidleybop Sign in Permalink the LOTR's trilogy is one of the best films ever created. Since i was born i have always thought that the star wars trilogy was absolutely stupendous. unbeatable. but i believe that the LOTR's comes close i would like to thank Peter Jackson for all his efforts and hard work he put into this movie. i would not be surprised if you created another three films to tell how the ring was actually made, and how Sauron devastated middle earth. I think another three films would be great. I'm sure these 3 films will be remembered right through time. thanks for creating a brilliant set of films. My best regards. Johan
10.0~Simply Stunning visceron23 Sign in Permalink There are no words to describe how truly magnificent this film is as a film itself and as a conclusion to this masterwork of a trilogy. I defy anyone to not feel sad at its end amongst the joy of its brilliance. It even stands up to the harsh criticism of me as a lover of the books. Bravo Peter Jackson and New Line!
6.0~A disappointing ending jason-elsworth Sign in Permalink After producing what seemed to me something of a masterpiece (FOTR) and a very, very, good film (TTT), containing what I consider one of cinema's great moments in the battle for Helms Deep, the trilogy seems to me to finish with merely a good film. I consider ROTK weaker than the previous two in almost every aspect, with the main problems: patchy special effects, which go from absolutely brilliant to laughable, constant intercutting between story lines that destroys any sense of momentum and engagement (though it would have been difficult to do it any other way given the nature of the book), a poor score (in stark contrast to the others) and the curse of the sequel "you've seen it all before". All this being said it is still an enjoyable, if rather long film, and the overall trilogy is an incredible achievement for Jackson and his team.
10.0~A whole theatre clapping, screaming, laughing and crying! 7rym Sign in Permalink I had high expectations when I entered the LotR triathlon spanning 11.5 hours of the best movies ever made. Warming up with Fellowship and Two Towers really set the mood for the perfect ending of the trilogy. The theatre was boiling when the last movie hit the screen. The movie moves you in every way and you have to be very cold not to be emotionally thrown in every direction. The cast is totally confident in their roles and the actors deliver an overwhelming performance, and Sean Astin shows a wide spectre of talents giving the role of Sam the true heroic feeling. While some of the fighting scenes in Two Towers were a bit chaotic, RotK tops it with the most gigantic battles with over humongous amounts of warriors of all kinds slashing out after each other, but still not forgetting close-ups that strengthen the impression of what these soldiers actually did and went through. I can't remember being in a theatre watching a movie that affected the audience in the same scale ever! Usually people don't hold back on laughing and clapping if the setting calls for it. But RotK gave us absolutely every emotion full strength and experiencing hundreds of adults crying of joy, and later sadness, touched me deeply. I was surrounded by a gang of role-players in their forties who wept like babies! This is the first time the IMDB rating scale made it difficult for me to choose. I gave it a perfect 10, but a 11 would be more appropriate seeing back on my earlier votes... ;-)
10.0~Best Lord of the Rings movie ronronsantos Sign in Permalink In my opinion, this is the best Lord of the Rings movie. The effects at that time is enough to impress everyone. I don't know how they created those special effects where they show hundreds of thousands of soldiers at war and still manage to capture the fight scenes in perfection without confusing the viewers. The story is also unique and there are a lot of characters that are very interesting. Superb acting from the cast. Very realistic portrayal for a fictional story. They managed to breathe life to the characters on the book. I will never get bored watching this movie all over and over again and I will recommend this to my future children and grandchildren.
9.0~Awesome movie, inadequate ending... Murph-14 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has done an admirable job of depicting this epic trilogy on screen. This movie, while boasting a 3:30 run time (3:15 if you don't count the previews), does a good job at finishing the story. As a Tolkien fan, I am disappointed in the material that was left out of this film. I realize that, if all the storylines were included and given a just amount of time, this movie would run near 5 hours. I hope that in the extended edition (which will hopefully be released BEFORE next November) they will add back in a significant amount of storyline. My only complaint about this movie was the ending. Yes, they left out a lot of the story, but the worst part for me was the extended emotional endings and the pointless fades that only served to extend the movie 20 minutes beyond what was necessary. Sam does way too much crying for my liking. I'm guessing that these scenes were added for emotional appeal for those that require high emotional content to their movies. So, if you are one of these people, then you will love this movie. Not only does it have non-stop action and story, but the ending will be up to your emotional standards as well.
10.0~Caution- eye leakage may occur when watching this film iwerewolf_werewolf Sign in Permalink This is the most intense, moving and spectacular in the trilogy. Finally, a film to rival star wars. Peter Jackson concludes Tolkiens story in a fantastic battle between good and evil. However, i do have a few beefs with this film. For the fans of Tolkien, many were disappointed at not finding out what happened to sauruman or however you spell it. I was shocked that christopher lees scenes were cut but i wasn't bothered until i saw the extended version and realised how much i had missed! However, if jackson had kept these scenes in, I'm afraid wed probably all die of bum rot. every time i watch this film, i cry about a dozen times. its such a personal and moving film, we have followed these characters and you cant help but fall in love with every one of them. Jackson has been criticised for having a million endings, but he wanted to keep the story as tolkien intended. and I'm glad he did. its a beautiful heart warming story that you must watch, and see what all the fuss is about.
9.0~A crowning end for a great trilogy Cheese-18 Sign in Permalink It is true that this movie delivers. However - I liked part one and two better. But mind you, 'Return of the King' is still better than any not-Lord-of-the-Rings-movie I've ever seen. First there is the problem of the sadness. When you're watching this movie, there's this little voice in your head going 'this is the last one. Next Christmas there won't be a part four you can look forward to. This will be it. That's it.' But I'm sure if I watch RotK a few dozen times more, this little voice in my head will fade away. And then there's always the rumors about 'The Hobbit'. But secondly, and that's more important: most of the characters come to a standstill. There's not much evolving there. Only Aragorn has to grow to become a leader of men, and good ol' trustworthy Sam will rise to become the real hero of the War of the Ring. But most of the other characters in RotK just have to buy time for Frodo and Sam, so they will have a chance to complete their mission. But then again: so it was written, and so it was done. Furthermore I thought I was always aware of some missing scenes here and there. So I can't wait to lay my fingers on the Special Edition-DVD. Only then will I be able to appreciate the full glory of RotK. After my experience with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers' I know that the Special Editions are far superior to the cinematic versions (which seems almost impossible anyway, doesn't it). But don't listen to my babbling - go see the movie! It is good fun to watch and will blow you away. I'm an arachnophobe, naturally Shelob scared me out of my socks! There are some wonderful Gollum-scenes (thanks, Andy), the ending in Mount Doom is breathtaking, the battles are boombastic, the art department and especially the conceptual artists have outdone themselves, and everything is created and executed with so much love and care for detail. Peter Jackson has rightfully earned his seat in the eternal Olymp of the greatest film directors of all time. Thanks, Peter!
10.0~best film ever gregdunn18 Sign in Permalink first film i ever seen where i felt like never watching another film again because ya cant get any better! And i had the worst seats in the house and horrible seats as far as sound yet i still thought it was the best! 10/10
9.0~Oh My God majorgeneralpatton Sign in Permalink Just when you thought Peter Jackson had staked out new movie making territory with Fellowship and Towers, King tops them all. This is hands down the single best movie I have ever seen in my life. Everything that I hoped for has come true. They left in everything that was important, they only changed minor things to make it a better film and the special effects and acting was top notch. The sheer scale of King is mind blowing. To actually see Sauron's army sprawled across the Pelennor Fields is awe inspiring. The heroic acts of the heroes fighting an unstoppable army of orcs is incredible, especially Legolas's little stunt with the Oliphant. All in all this is truly a crowning achievement in film and with hopes will sweet the awards and rake in more money than titanic...one can hope.
10.0~Perfection hans_moleman_31 Sign in Permalink The greatest movie of our time. Where to start? The story is perfectly realised through Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens' script, which is perfectly attuned to what Middle- Earth would be like. All moments, from epic battle scene, the best ever put to film, to the most human moments that can be. Theodens' death is handled with such care, Jacksn never allows sentimentality. Well maybe a little in the end where we are saying goodbye to everyone that we've spent 3 years with. Howard Shore's score crescendos at all the right times, and never overbears the visual feast that is being presented. All the performances are perfect, well deserved of the SAG Awards. Even Liv Tyler is good! But the whole movie would not work unless we believe in this place of mythical creatures and epic scenes of grandeur. And Jackson makes us. Instead of approaching this as a fantasy film, as any other director would have, he approached this as a human story with a fantastical backdrop. And this works only in its' favour. THank Peter Jackson. Thank you.
10.0~My eyes hurt CptPtnia Sign in Permalink My eyes hurt. I don't think I blinked for about two hours. I am a notoriously tough grade when I vote on movies here, only about 15 movies have I ever given a 10 ranking to. The first two LOTRs only ranked as 9's. This received a 10.
8.0~Can He Conclude It? joehemmings68 Sign in Permalink To me this is easily the worst Lord of the Rings film, primarily because it simply does not know how to end. We have a total of four false finishes before this gargantuan trilogy finally leaves us in peace. In fairness, this is the story's fault, not the film maker's. That Jackson was able to adapt these books is a stunning achievement. The practical effects are absolutely stunning, as is the cinematography. This is one of the finest looking films ever. One need only compare this to the Hobbit films, to get an impression of the amazing scale of the LOTR achievement. My main issue with Lord of the Rings is the lack of truly compelling characters. To me, Gollum is the only truly great character. Characters like Gimli and Legolas are paper thin, and everyone in between is basic. Again this isn't really the film makers fault in my opinion. For me this is the best that could possibly have been done in adapting these stories to cinema. They're the kind of stories that really are more suited to the pages of a book. Perhaps Jackson could have trimmed a little more fat than he did, and it would have made a more concise and impactful film, certainly the extended cut is vastly worse. So for me this is a fantastic spectacle, brilliantly acted by most of the cast. I feel that the story is limited, especially on screen, and that means the film is bashing it's head on a glass ceiling. Eight out of Ten.
9.0~Great Movie, and some thoughts... ritzl Sign in Permalink I cannot echo strongly enough the overwhelming praise for this film. Many here have seen its worth and I would concur. I would like to add some thoughts to the discussion. On Gimli: I have read for two years now the criticism of Gimli's humor. I would just say that ALL the people I have known, that have known battle and death (and I am not one), have stated, unrelated to this film, that there is always someone that addresses imminent death with humor. Gimli's realization by PJ is absolutely on the mark, and frankly welcome to me as a moviegoer as being real. Some just have a lust and courage for the better side of life, in the face the alternative, and whatever the outcome. On PJ: He has never shown himself to be able to bridge the gap between being an actor's director in small films (Heavenly Creatures) and a horror/special effects director (Frighteners, Evil Dead). The first two movies in this trilogy reaffirmed my belief. HOWEVER, in this film, PJ has, as his characters have, grown to become equal to the task at hand. This film captures the spectacle of battle macro, as motivated by the frailties and trancendencies of the micro of those involved. Kudos... On Length: Unlike the first two, the time flew by. No lulls. Only VERY minor plot holes (again, unlike the first two). On the Books: I am a purist, but/and what PJ, FW, and PB, did with the script in this installment is totally understandable and warranted. On Acting: The Henry V, St. Crispin's Day speeches given by Theoden (Pt. I), and Aragorn (Pt. II) were as moving as Shakespeare wrote them, and Olivier's and Branagh's deliveries. Probably as relevant today as they were in Olivier's time. On Relevance: In a mythical sense and all that allows from the artistically derived poignancy, this movie is what "Saving Private Ryan" was. Stepping back and allowing imagination to take hold, every theme (IMHO) that Tolkein wrote about was represented in this movie (need I say, a cause worth fighting/loving for, sacrifice, winning but not without loss, fellowship, destiny, and resignation to that destiny), and is as relevant today as it was 80, 50, 40, 30, and 3 years ago. On The Ending: Going to miss them all!! Thanks for the farewell... And (Finally!!) On the Oscars: This trilogy IS one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking. For the vision, for the risk, for the epic, for the technical achievements, but mostly, for the Gift. If few or no awards are forthcoming, that is the problem of the Academy, not PJ or New Line. --- Bring on Smaug!!
5.0~Bleh (SPOILERS) counterrevolutionary Sign in Permalink After being disappointed with the first film, then enjoying the second enough that I actually bought both extended DVDs, I find myself back to disappointment with number 3, for several reasons. 1) ROTK suffers from the same thing as FOTR: trying to cram too much story into too little time (can you believe Jackson originally wanted to do LOTR in *two* movies)? 2) The CGI effects, which were never as impressive as they were cracked up to be, are now just boring. 3) Jackson has finally given in to his previously (mostly) incipient I-know-better-than-Tolkien-itis. The Paths of the Dead sequence now plays like a bad horror movie (think Stephen Sommers), and the Cirith Ungol-Shelob's Lair sequence has both Frodo and Sam behaving entirely out of character. Worst of all is the Cracks of Doom scene, where Jackson for some reason feels it necessary to gild the lily by adding a (literal) cliffhanger. Also, the Scouring of the Shire is *not* (unlike Tom Bombadil or the parley with the Mouth of Sauron) dispensable. Dropping it alters the whole character of the ending. 4) What was the point of having Denethor go over the cliff in flames? 5) Gandalf explains to Pippin what happens after death? Tolkien must be turning in his grave. And the explanation isn't even interesting. 6) But worst of all, I reread the novel between TTT and ROTK. This was a grievous error; it merely pointed up the inferiority of the films. So, anybody want to buy a couple of extended DVDs, cheap? ROTK 5/10; full series, 6/10.
10.0~Magnificent ZFilmMakerr Sign in Permalink Magnificent achievement it is; an epic tale of friendship, love and heroism, a film that set the benchmark for all fantasy films to come. Tolkien's descriptive narrative beautifully depicts Middle-earth and the journey that the Fellowship undertakes will remain with them for the rest of their lives. It is hard to put into words the happiness that can be felt when watching a fantasy film as good as this and anybody who has never watched it should set aside some time to do so. Is it the best fantasy film of all time? In my opinion, yes. There's no salvation for a fantasy fan who hasn't watched the gospel of the genre. The influence of The Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another. Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, The Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in The Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic.
10.0~The best of three? cubefan Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, I think it's "The return of the Quality". It's the best of the three pictures. It won all the Academy Awards that was nominated. Some people says that it is the best trilogy of all-times, even better than The Godfather or Star Wars trilogy. The Return of the King seriously recovers all the quality and thriller of the first movie. The trilogy fell with the second movie. I think IMDb must put this movie in the place of the Godfather. It deserves that 1st place in the Top 250 movies. Of course, I'm not complaining about the quality of the Godfather, for all who are The Godfather's fans.
5.0~Trash of the worst sort(*spoilers) prayn4food Sign in Permalink First off, J.R.R. Tolkien was the greatest story teller (except possibly Shakespeare) England has ever known. So why does Peter Jackson think he can tell Tolkien's stories better by butchering the plot and the characters? Adaptation arguments aside, the movie itself felt like a cross between Jackson's earlier "Frighteners" and the monotonously long "Meet Joe Black". What little flair for action Jackson showed in "Two Towers" is quickly lost in the constant use of slow motion in this film. Slow pans take up nearly every moment, including battles, goodbye scenes, and reunions. I wanted to scream at the movie screen "Get to the damn story!!!" In addition, Jackson resorts to the campy feel of Evil Dead movies. It is hard not to burst out laughing when triumphant music plays while the tower falls (in slow motion) and the eye is searching around with a look of befuddlement. The king of the dead and his legions are directly taken from "The Frighteners" and the close-ups of Denethor eating chicken ruin what could be the film's only touching moment (Pippin singing while troops rush to almost certain death). Peter Jackson, you should be collecting garbage instead of producing it.
9.0~The best of the 3 sbrockwa Sign in Permalink This movie was definitely the best of the 3. Some have said better than StarWars, which I can't agree with, but can definitely see why the comparison is being made. The movie brought the trilogy to its climax. Visually astounding. My favorite was the spider scene. The battle scenes were truly amazing and must have taken months in post production. You definitely feel the length of the movie though. I think the movie could have ended right after frodo woke up and saw Gandalf though. Everything after that seemed a little hohum.
10.0~It ROCKS!!!!!! gmcaldwell Sign in Permalink I LOVED this MOVIE!!!!! Infact I liked all three movies, the music the actors WOW absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!! It is a wonderfully adapted version of the tolkien books!!!!!!!!! I especially like the way the cities and beautiful landscape was captcured on film!!!!!!!!!! They also chose a wonderful cast for this picture; Frodo and Samwise were especially wonderfully captured by Elijah and Sean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so incredibly happy about the movie getting so many oscars I think it was truelly fantastic It is my all time favorite movie I was amazed. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole movie. I give it a 10 no doubt about it. I recemend this movie to any one any day It's a Great MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10.0~Excellent film, worth the wait! Allyson55 Sign in Permalink This film will knock your socks off! From beginning to end you will be thoroughly entertained,if not enthralled. I have read the book, several times, and I still watched, openmouthed, as scene after scene unfolded. I cheered, cried and gasped at each turn of events and, even though I knew the outcome, I murmurred encouragement and advice throughout. I was totally involved with the proceedings and loved every moment. I can't separate the three films. I view them as one gloriously long and involving movie, which I think was Peter Jackson's original intent. In my opinion, this trilogy will remain unsurpassed for a very long time. I can't wait to see ROTK again, bum numbing three hours and ten minutes not withstanding.
10.0~An Awesome Movie!!! ErictheRed-1 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Anyone who loved the first two, or is a hardcore action fan should see it. It's so good that it stands well on it's own ( though it will take people who haven't seen the first two a while to get into the story). It's definitely a satisfying ending to a good trilogy. Spoiler Warning! The Battle of Pellenor Fields is the most mind blowing battle scene in Movie history! The elephant fight was definitely something you don't see very often. You're always wondering how the good guys are going to beat that. Though it isn't really what happens in the book, it's very exciting and awesome nonetheless. An awesome movie!!!!
10.0~Very rich kkaluhio Sign in Permalink This film is the climax of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It is a masterpiece. The dialogue is very rich. The cast is perfect. The effects are great, even over a decade later. Peter Jackson did a great job of capturing Tolkien's spiritual work. What makes this film, and trilogy, so perfect is the score. The music gets the viewers so involved emotionally. Best movie I've seen so far.
10.0~A wait worth waiting TheodenKing Sign in Permalink At last it's been released. The most awaited and most hyped movie in recent cinematic history has finally hit the screens. And it lives up to every bit of it's expectations. Mr Jackson managed to excel himself again. The visual beauty and the emotions of this movie are epic. The actors seemed to hold out their best interpretations for this movie. Sean Astin is incredible. And it is certainly one of the better movies of Elijah Wood. His critics have definitely been silenced. The visual beauty of the movie and the special effects are breath-taking. This time the action has been timed and directed to perfection. Did you see that spider? And how the Ringwraiths grow on you? And the Paths of the Dead? As always WETA have done an excellent job in costumes armoury and other props. Well done Peter Jackson
4.0~SPOILERS Episodic, too long, loosely stitched together aidangill Sign in Permalink OK I know I am in a very small minority of people who aren't fans of the LOTR trilogy (book and film), but hey for what it's worth... Thinking of this as a film in its own right (imagine never having read the book or having seen the first two films), ROTK is a real mess. The first 1.5 hours or so are spent plodding along, introducing very confusing plot sidelines and small details that do nothing to further the story. You'd be hard pressed to name anyone whose acting actually made an impact - though the notable exception for me, at least, was Sean Astin who really is very convincing as what I would describe as a'young man far from home, having to grow up far too quickly, but keeping to his own straightforward ideals'. His is the one character I really believed in, that drew me in and tugged my emotions. The film taken as a whole shows up the way it was filmed - this feels like a load of bits of scenic and studio film, with a director with far too much material to play with, cutting and splicing bits here and there, in a loose and sometimes bizarre manner. (Imagine having never read the book. Then explain for me, if you will, why exactly Arwen is well, then has dreams, then chooses mortality over elf life, then mysteriously gets sick and doesn't put in any appearances till near the end ... far too sketchy!). Once again Gollum the animated character leaves me totally cold - I just don't get it! To me he is a cartoon character and no matter how brilliantly Andy Serkis portrays the voice, I cannot be convinced. I don't sense evil or split personality at all, except in the dialogue. Frodo - to me, Elijah Wood is just not a good actor. It's all wan face and big eyes. However, he does have the best bit of the movie - the encounter with Shelob, the great spider. Finally a piece of animation that really convinces, and terrifies if you're in the mood to be frightened! So much better and more intimate than the rapid-angle-change battle scenes that litter this film, and were such a drag in Two Towers. And finally, the ending(s) - all 6 or more of them! I thought that the scene where Aragorn is crowned would be the end, a fitting climax. But no, we just keep getting more endings! By the end instead of crying at the sadness I was chuckling, it was like hearing a symphony where the composer can't work out how to make the ending really satisfying, so keeps putting in more and louder chords in a transparent effort to heighten the drama. I, for one, am not sorry to see the end of this series of films. A phenomenon, yes, but not a classic trilogy at all. An even more disappointing final instalment than to the Matrix (but before you accuse me of wholesale negativity - I thought Matrix 1 and 2 were fantastic).
6.0~This is why there are fast forward buttons Bigbert Sign in Permalink So, this is the end and what an anti-climax it is. The Two Towers showed some promise, although half of it bored my pants off. Here again only half the movie is interesting. The Frodo and Sam part is so boring and repetitive I just needed to use my Fast Forward button to get through it. This is what happens in this part: Sam screams at Gollum, Frodo defends Gollum, Gollum speaks to himself, Frodo is in mortal danger and Sam saves him. They've been doing the very same thing over and over again since the beginning of The Two Towers. Then the other part: also a replay of The Two Towers, I'm afraid. Orcs attack a human stronghold and the humans barely survive. The battle is even the same: everything is almost lost and then re-enforcements arrive saving the day. It's also quite obvious that Viggo Mortenssen was a very bad choice for a pivotal part in this movie. His acting is wooden and his courageous speech before the battle is so powerless, mainly because of his wimpy voice and his foreign accent doesn't help either. The ending starts about half an hour before the credits and just keeps going on and on. Aragon is crowned king and that should have been it. But no, they need to sugar coat everyone's exit till it almost made me throw up. Ok, the source material does dictate how it ends (although the ending of the book was better), but it could've been made better by just ending after the coronation. So 3 out 3 movies that were only half interesting. So, maybe time for a new cut with only the interesting parts (about three hours for the whole lot would do).
9.0~Best of the Trilogy brettlu Sign in Permalink I have to try and condition myself to think of the movies separately from the books, because the books carry such a strong sense of nostalgia for me and because the movies are an entirely separate interpretation of the books than my imagination was. I think Return of the King is definitely my favorite of the three movies. It's first and foremost a visually amazing movie. It's also extremely entertaining. I mean, how many movies get made about a medieval/fantasy/d&d type setting (a setting which I find very interesting), and how many of those movies are actually really good? Aside from the Lord of the Rings movies, not many. Thinking about Return of the King objectively, it's definitely not the best movie I've ever seen, not even remotely close. But was it entertaining, was it visually stimulating, was it original and creative, did it bring back fond memories of reading the books? For me, yes it did, and that definitely counts for something. Overall I give it **** out of four stars.
10.0~A satisfying conclusion to one of the greats doc-ahmad-almaiman Sign in Permalink This is one of the greatest fantasy films in cinematic history. The fact that it reached new heights in visual effects and was able to win the academy award for Best Picture including all the categories it was nominated for shows a great deal to filmmakers. It is perfect in every sense of glory, majestic outlook, breathtaking feel, vibratory and thrilling new sights. Peter Jackson is a filmmaker that is very keen on looking at an image and acknowledging how beautiful it is. There is no sense of doubt or false pleasure or even pessimistic ideals towards this piece of craft. It is a satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest film series in Hollywood history and is certainly a victorious accomplishment.
9.0~The Ultimate fantasy movie... armamitor Sign in Permalink Not sure if there will be enough words to describe this epic story. The first time that i watched Lord of the Rings, was back when it was released to much fanfare. To be honest, i found my self most disappointed, primarily because i could not understand the head or tail of what was happening in the movie. I gave up on the trilogy and did not think about it until this year. With my amazon kindle, i thought of a new strategy. I read the first book and then watched the first part, and believe me, it was an out of the world experience. Then i did the same with the other 2 parts. I watched the movie only after having read the entire book, and it was absolute pleasure. The only way to do true justice to this movie trilogy is to read the books first and it totally changes the experience of watching the movie. Finally i have to say that this is one of the best movie adaptations of a book that i have ever seen. The ultimate story of courage, honor, friendship, loyalty, and hundreds of other adjectives. A must watch...
10.0~Masterpiece rezaw Sign in Permalink I've never seen a series like this. A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible? This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. They do not make films like these anymore. This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!) The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result. All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10
10.0~"You owe me awe!" (has a spoiler or two) sushi_fairy Sign in Permalink That line echoed in my ahead after watching movie. Maybe that was why I kept my friends awake trying to remember which movie that line came from (a couple of hours later, I remembered! It was uttered by Ralph Fiennes character in the movie Red Dragon during the scene with the tabloid reporter). Awe is definitely what we owe the movie, Mr. Jackson and the cast. Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King deserves nothing less. It deserves the title "Best Movie Ever Made" and being an avid movie watcher myself, this title does not come lightly. Now I know I have a ready and right answer every time somebody asks me "What is your favorite movie?" I haven't watched a movie that evoked every emotion from me and were my emotions ever evoked! I laughed, I cried, I screamed in fright. The whole movie deserves tons of awards. I wish there would be a category for "Best CGI Performance". Shelob and Gollum deserves such an award. They really did good work on the spider and Gollum...Gollum just leaves me speechless. When Sam said, "Let it go, Mr. Frodo," in the movie's climax, I can't help but relate to the incident. Not only does it involve certain aspects of my life, but I knew I had to let go of the movie as well. Three years is a bloody long time to watch a movie but we've learned to love Middle Earth and all that it encompasses. For three years, we celebrated Christmases with visions of magnificent battle scenes, well-executed shots and heart-wrenching cinematography dancing above our heads. For the past three years, we had something to look forward to during Christmas which made me think what would next Christmas bring? I cried when the movie ended because I knew it was time to let go. Good bye, Middle Earth. Hope to see you once again. (but then, there's always the books!).
10.0~The last of the great trilogy iamsam103 Sign in Permalink So this film came out in December, and I went to see it with excitement and in a way sadness. Excitement because I wanted to see how the film ended (although I had already read the book) and of course just to sit back and be blown away. Sad because it was the last of the trilogy and after this film that means no more surprises. That is unless Peter Jackson does decide to make The HObbit. Anyways, back to ROTK. Once again everyone is here for the exception of Christpher Lee as the menacing Saruman The White. Gollum is far better in ths film as is evil and scheming side comes out. The special effects are far more superior in this film but of course effects are nothing without good acting...which this trilogy is blessed with. The star of this film is Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn who must lead the army of men against the Orcs of Mordor. At the same time he must decide whether to take to the thrown of Gondor. Sean Astin also delivers in this film as Samwise Gamgee turns into a Holywood hero at the end, killing three orcs at a time and carryin "mr. Frodo" up the steeping slopes of mount doom. The spider shelob is just as gruesome as she is scary but I find it quite funny how such a huge spider can be taken out within minutes by an overweight hobbit. If i have to fault this film then it is down to it being over long. Although its hard to see exactly how Peter Jackson could make it shorter...for the last 20 minutes or so my bum was painfully numb. Another fault is that the special effects did seem to overwhelm the film a bit. Oh yeh, and what the hell was Peter Jackson thinking when he decided to make Legolad take out a bloody great big elephant like that. Not only was that stupid but it ruined the excitement and fury of the battle of the Pelennor fields. No Peter, just no! But those things put aside this film is outstanding. The Lord Of The Rings trilogy is not to be sniggered at as some people do. It is as much about friendship, loyalty, greed and hope as it is about kicking orc-ass. If you want to waste approximately three and a half hours...sit down and watch this when it comes out on DVD. Or wait a couple more months for the extended DVD....where it is said to be five hours long. These films have landed them a spot in the list of the greatest films of all history. And we owe it all to J.R.R Tolkein and Peter Jackson...as well as the cast and crew.
7.0~How to draw out a movie? iwatcheverything Sign in Permalink I saw this movie the other night very late. This was a good ending to a great great trilogy and will probably go down in history as such. This film was a little more serious than the last two and was not as "fun". This is the way this film had to be. I like the fact that over the three movies you get to see the characters grow and develop through each passing moment. I believe the acting was great in all three films. I do not really believe this film should win Best Picture this year though. It has one slight problem and that is the ending. I will not tell you anything about it just know that it is very long and very drawn out and every time you think it's over it starts up again. How long does he want me to sit having to go to the bathroom? Very long. So I suggest you go at the start of the movie and right about half an hour before the true end b/c you won't miss anything. Enjoy!
10.0~They could make one a year ad infinitum LBytes Sign in Permalink I had trouble with ROTK in the theatrical release, and once again the DVD Extended Edition soothes my irritation with additional footage. In this case about 50 minutes of added footage, so you're looking at 250 minute commitment of time just for the movie, and if you want to see significant chunks of the extras, you'd better call in sick or forget the ball game, and order pizza. Its worth it, and if you pay attention you'll see Peter Jackson take an arrow from Legolas. It may play longer but a smoother flowing movie seems like a faster movie. Just don't pay attention to the clock. The EE doesn't fix the problem with the big battle at Pelennor Fields aka Siege of Gondor. As soon as the ghost army arrives everyone else may as well take up making mayonnaise, because the ghosts spank the bad guys' collective ass. They should've figured out something else to keep the battle edgy. Up to that point it was exciting to see the Riders of Rohan charge and a realistically terrified Eowyn stick it to the Witch King. The Frodo/Sam/Gollum segment is the strongest half of ROTK. If Frodo had any Spidey Sense it would've been tingling around about Chapter 38, but he was not himself anymore. Lugging The One Ring around has taken its toll. Sam is the hero and Middle Earth's Last Best Hope is saved by a gardener, which is better odds than being saved by a politician. Sam would've dived into a dragon's throat to rescue Frodo, and he does something just as hard and much ickier. The film doesn't quite get it across that Shelob is sentient, but it scores high on making her big, smelly and icky, although I was slightly disappointed that she didn't bleed very much green or yellow goo. There's also a lot of finality in the 2 extra discs from the ROTK extended edition. End of Principle Photography, End of Pickup shooting, Last Oscar party, etc... They finished the movies almost 4 years ago and did some touchup pickup shots for it in the summer of 2003. There's more CGI in ROTK than in the previous 2 films combined. The WETA workshop must've wound up with a helluva server farm for all that rendering. It was nice that some of the actors bought the horses they rode on in the films, and there were some other touching 'end of' things happening. This is the best group of movies ever made IMHO. If they never do anything else, the cast and crew have already done enough. Years from now, when they're old or gone, The Lord of the Rings will remain on the short list of serious movie fans, a point of reference to what great movies are. I've imagined lots of stories they could tell with the remaining Hobbits, and Legolas and Gimli were supposedly inseparable so they could've gone on to more adventures, like leading a bunch of dwarfs into Moria. One movie a year would be good.
10.0~Utterly Brilliant cat4556 Sign in Permalink ~!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!~ I must admit that I was a tad nervous when I was waiting in line to see this movie. These are, after all, my favorite books of all time, and I wanted a certain amount of justice to be given to them. I loved FOTR very much, however TTT, while very good, was somewhat altered from the original story line of the book. Having now watched the film, I am stunned and amazed at the work that Peter Jackson has done with this film. True, there were a couple of alterations, but nothing serious that I could not overlook. Elijah Wood did, IMO, a tremendous job portraying Frodo, and I could really get the sense of the burden that he was bearing. I especially like the way that it appeared, towards the end of the film, that Frodo's neck was bleeding from the weight of the ring. Very nice touch, PJ. Sean Astin's performance, as Frodo's devoted Sam deserves an oscar nod, and I cried like a baby when Sam began to carry Frodo up the slopes of Mount Doom. The rest of the characters, were all perfect, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Battle scenes were amazing, and I was literally shaking because of how nervous I got for all the characters that I had loved for so long. That just goes to show how well Peter Jackson did. I read the books, knew there would be a happy ending, and yet my eyes still grew as wide as saucers when the camera pans from Eowyn and Merry over to the Pelennor fields that is swarming with orcs, and I really thought that they might not make it. Eowyn was truly breath taking and I let out a round of applause with the rest of the audience when she had slain the With-King of Angmar. If I could, I would commend each and every actor in these films, but I'm afraid I havn't enough space. Final score: 5 *'s out of 5.
9.0~A Lord of movies!! ladocnora Sign in Permalink This movie is brilliant!!! See the battles are great! so much action, so many warriors, the effects are amazing! It´s long (3and a half hr) but it keeps you in the edge most of the time. I also saw the audience laugh, almost cry, move, it was fantastic. Peter Jackson did spectacular job, that budget and time were a good investment with him. The characters got better. It shows the value of honor, courage and above all friendship. Still I think a little less hobbit friendship would have been better and also adding the death of Saruman(too bad they only included it in the DVD for money ambition), more Ewin and less black screens to change scene. How ever I totally recommend it and my guess is it will be a lord of oscars
10.0~Simply breath-taking!! careax Sign in Permalink What can one say about this stunning finale to the trilogy? There are no words in any tongue (be it in the real world or in the fantasy realm of Middle Earth) that can do justice to this incredible creation. The acting is exceptional, the costumes and sets are perfect, the camera work is excellent, the direction and production are inspired, the action sequences are pulse-racing, the battles are mind-boggling, and the cinematography is awesome. I loved the first two films with a passion, but Return Of The King is, in my eyes (and in many others from what I hear), the best of the three. Be warned: this is a long movie! But if you're a fan of fine motion pictures you honestly won't notice the time go by. Because of the nature of the story in the third book (the meeting of certain characters who had been separated), the film doesn't have that slightly fragmented feel of The Two Towers - which in some subtle ways suffers from the all-to-common middle movie disjointed syndrome. While there are still multiple threads in Return Of The King, it somehow seems more settled and flows more easily. There are a few ommissions from the storyline, but they don't detract from the movie at all. And if the previous two movies are anything to go by, these scenes and threads will probably appear in the Extended Edition later next year. Most importantly, it really was necessary to leave them out of the theatrical release, otherwise the plot would have dragged. I don't want to say what they are and spoil the experience for others, but if you've read the book you'll easily spot them. The thing that was most pleasing about this movie was its ending. It really does give a sense of closure to the trilogy. Some might say it drags on too long, but in my opinion it is like good food or fine wine - it is something to be savored and enjoyed. I wouldn't be surprised if Return Of The King doesn't win the Best Picture award at the Oscars. Not because of the movie but rather because the Oscars have nothing to do with awarding the best in the industry. Sadly they have simply become a back-slapping exercise for Hollywood insiders. And like many of the time-honored classics, the Lord Of The Rings trilogy was made by outsiders with genuine passion and fresh ideas. But the opinions of the movie goers and the box office sales cannot deny it: this is and will remain the best movie of the year. And the trilogy will grow in stature as time goes by.
10.0~Amazing, Exacting, Touching, The Best one out of the 3 nitz_angel Sign in Permalink For me The Lord of the Rings Always has been a cinematic experience that is above all other movies, I always thought that better than what I saw so far cannot be made. I was wrong. The Return of The King is the best LOTR movie, amazing acting and directing, best war scene I have ever seen. In a word: amazing! It's better than you could ever imagine.
10.0~We come to it at last... NRGWasp Sign in Permalink Indeed, we come to the end of an epic filmic quest... THE epic filmic quest. Where does one start when reviewing such a movie? It's absolutely wonderful. The minor cracks are easily overlooked for the sheer beauty and awesome power of The Return of the King. New Line Cinema is quite lucky to have taken such a gamble, as the studio stands to benefit excessively because of it. A small time indie director working out of New Zealand takes $300million and molds it into an epic trilogy for the ages. Worthy of standing with such timeless classics as The Godfather, the Original Star Wars trilogy, and Indiana Jones. Despite having already read the books (and thus basically knowing what happens next), I couldn't help but be surprised and excited and saddened and thrilled by RotK. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields is gigantic in scope and incredibly exciting. Indeed it does make Helm's Deep look like a minor skirmish. Shelob's Lair and Shelob herself are truly terrifying. I love the attention to the book here, because it was one of my favorite parts, where Sam takes up the ring and vows to continue on. I saw Frodo staggering towards the tower of Cirith Ungol and thought "drat, they went and changed it." But lo and behold, Shelob crept up and mummified him in her webbing. It was breathtaking, eliciting quite a reaction from the midnight crowd. The death of Theoden King is very sad. I pride myself on being able to hold back the emotion at the theater, but this was one of several scenes where I got all choked up and misty eyed. The final struggle up Mt. Doom and the confrontation inside were truly suspenseful. Nitpickers looking for the Failure of the Ringbearer will be pleased to see it here. Frodo reaches the brink, only to finally succumb to the ring before being attacked by Gollum. The CGI was once again top-notch. How will anyone ever do better? I have no idea. Gollum, the Oliphaunts, the Dead Men of Dunharrow all look spectacular and utterly believable... Really outstanding work by Weta Workshop. Acting was excellent all around, yet again. However, one performance did stand out. Despite being a short Hobbit, Sean Astin's performance as Samwise Gamgee stands head and shoulders above the rest. He's my pick for a Supporting Actor Oscar. But enough of that, eh? Let's get to the dirt. If anyone has been paying attention to my FotR and TT reviews (and I doubt they have), they'd know I'm not a stickler for word-for-word adaptation. There are some troubling changes... particularly Pippin finding the Palantir in the flooded courtyard of Isengard rather than inside Orthanc. Why they changed it, or why they omitted how the Palantir got there, I'm not sure. More troubling omissions are the Houses of Healing, the romance between Eowyn and Faramir (save for but a glimpse at the end), Faramir being retained as Steward of Gondor, and Eomer becoming King of Rohan. Also absent is the Scouring of the Shire, of which I'm sure you're all aware. Truth be told, I wasn't a big fan of the Scouring... and I think it's appropriate that it -- and Tom Bombadil from FotR -- be omitted. But like I said before, these cracks are easily overlooked, because they do not detract from the movie (which is what you paid to see, you didn't pay to read the book). Besides, I'm sure they'll appear on the Extended DVD!! Yes! One last wait to endure!
10.0~I Love the Book, I'll Always LOVE the Movie Frodo the Bold Sign in Permalink If this doesn't recieve an Oscar, Nothing should. PERIOD.... I loved every moment of it and would have sat still for the Parts they failed to include. These must have been left out because the theater owners think they need to run as many showings in a night as possible. They already "way" overcharge us for every little thing we buy. I would go to see this if the price was doubled... BUT please, go see it. And PLEASE... READ the Book...
10.0~Inspired and forgetful good end to the trilogy. daelomin Sign in Permalink Despite the major disappearances in that script compared to the subtleties of the books that any fan will regret, this is still a great last chapter. Many trilogies never lived up to the first chapter that enticed crowds so much, the Matrix being the worst recent example! Here, all that really matters is present but I wish to raise one point: the real philosophy behind Tolkien's book gets twisted by the absence of Tom Bombadil and the scourging of the Shire. The power corrupts all and those two examples were fundamental, yet missing in Jackson's script. Tolkien's love for Nature and hate of rampant industrialisation was really one of the final notes of the book. It's missing here but it's still a great film. 9/10
10.0~Absolutely Stunning!! Ripley-40 Sign in Permalink The final installment of the LOTR trilogy is jackson's crowning achievement. Not only is it a great film in itself but it binds the other movies together into a perfected, epic, cinematic experience. Beginners and Tolkien fans alike will not be disappointed with the incredible battles, creatures, scenery, character development, and emotion in the grand finale of LOTR. If this does not sweep at the Oscars this year, id say hollywood has lost all self respect and ability to know a masterpiece of film when they see it!
10.0~A book made into a film, and back again. zoda12321 Sign in Permalink I have a really huge problem with picking favorites, but this movie would have to be one of them. Flawless conclusion to the trilogy. Nothing is wrong with this movie. the acting, the dialog, the plot, the narrative, the cinematography, the costumes, the visual effects, the sound effects. My favorite thing about these movies is that they are science fiction, but nothing about them is difficult to believe. It would be hard to come up with a solid genre for Return of the King because it is a drama, it is an action movie, it is a thriller, it is a romance, it even has it's moments of comedy. It goes, here, there, everywhere, and as Bilbo Baggins would say "back again."
5.0~An Overrated Epic hanzy_boy Sign in Permalink The Oscar big pay off was, I thought, nothing but a pity courtesy hand clap, while they left the way-better deserving Mystic River in the dust. It's hard to deny the great panorama the movie generated, the 1000 minute-long battle scene, the over sized elephants. but the cliché, flat dialogs that should be the spine of the movie, turned out to be an arthritis, that made me, as an audience, gasped and itched like I just saw one of those lifetime-channel original movie. There was no real great dramatic acting, all actors seem weary and only put on one emotion, and unlike the excellent first part of LOTR, where they have frodo, an average-joe hobbit turned into the ultimate ring bearer, puzzled and over bared by this new-found strenuous job he now has, the drama is alive by other characters struggle to convince frodo and themselves to defeat their own fear to fight for humanity. I like to see more of that than the battle scenes, and this I thought was a huge loss. And lest us not forget the gazillion endings return of the king has.
10.0~This movie reaches the destination that all movies of past generations have been trying to achieve. boonie45 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is the stunning finale to the trilogy of Tolkien classics that have been translated by Peter Jackson. The movie, following the book, is the most satisfying of the trilogy. Not only are all issues resolved, but unlike other book-to-film creations, all items that were meant to be left unsaid, were left unsaid. It is very rare that a cast will come together in the first movie, and still be together through the end. However, because of Jackson's method of filming all three movies simultaneously, the cast was able to stay close throughout the trilogy. One fear concerning a movie of this caliber is quality of acting. This is one area that does not affect this cast. Not only is this a cast of current and future acting giants, but this is also a cast of people who love their craft and are willing to work as hard as possible to create a project that will cross all borders. The performances by newer, younger actors such as Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, and Billy Boyd are so fluid that they are able to successfully equal the performances of the veterans such as Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, and Viggo Mortensen. It was obvious throughout that the experience learned between the two groups will benefit all involved. The special effects used in the movie will hold up against any rivals for many years to come. The texture and fluid movements of the animals in this movie represent what Lucas has been unsuccessfully trying to achieve with the recent Star Wars trilogy. The only movie that has successfully used all of the tools available to movie makers would have to be The Matrix: Revolutions. However, due to the fact that these two movies, although argued to be so, are NOT in the same genre, nor are they similar in any other field beyond the level of effects, they cannot be reviewed together or compared in any way. In summary, The Return of the King represents the first successful combination of solid storytelling and incredible effects in its genre. A feat that will most likely not be re-created for some time.
10.0~A Triumph! Epic Film-making at its Pinnacle! carltabet Sign in Permalink I cannot believe we are so lucky to have witnessed one of the best trilogies ever created! This magnificent last installment is beyond belief, it is gloriously sweeping, it is... perfect! What we have here is outstanding writing, near-perfect casting and miraculous special effects. I have felt nothing remotely close to boredom towards the end as some unwise tongues have complained. I think that allowing each character of the Fellowship to have his own ending and closure was not only wonderful but a necessary step to end such a large and unforgettable story. It is so painful to leave these characters at last especially if you're a big fan of the series, and I wasn't one until I first heard about The Lord of the Rings back in 2000. I didn't have any idea who Tolkien was and what he had written! I hope that Peter Jackson will be dutifully rewarded for his unbelievable work once and for all and not only for The Return of the King, but for the whole trilogy as well. Come on members of the Academy, give this living God what he deserves and hand out the Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture without further delay! I will go mad if this monumental film does not receive these 2 major awards, and it will seriously affect the credibility of the Academy, as far as I'm concerned. Many scenes in this movie are so epic in scale that you get tears in your eyes and feel shivers running down your spine! For 11 Academy Award nominations, I would very much like to see ROTK win all of them because such a cinematic achievement does not come around often, perhaps once every 20 years. Everyone working on that trilogy has done the impossible, shattering cinematic barriers and setting new benchmarks for epic movie-making. Stunning, superb and unforgettable!
10.0~Awesome pamnewt2 Sign in Permalink Over three hours of incredible detail and emotion. Expectations fully met. While the ending was nothing like I expected, it was in no way a disappointment. There's so much to take in. Can't wait to see it again...and again...and again... Still praying for The Hobbit!
10.0~The best trilogy ever, spoilers What92691 Sign in Permalink I entered the film of the theatre expecting a tremendous film. My friend whispered in my ear "Ready for almost the best 3 hours, and 20 minutes of your life," I exited the theatre feeling just that. It was the best 3 hours and 20 minutes i've spent in a movie theatre, the best film I've ever seen. It's epic entertained, how great it was. The acting was spectacular, and it some of the best scenes ever composed in there, the scene where Golem falls down with the ring is one of the best scenes in movie history. The Lord Of The Rings should be remembered as the best epic of all time. Plus, what some other films don't do, it stays true to the book, instead of cutting out a lot of scenes. Finally it's done. 3 hours and 20 minutes may seem long to you, but every minute you'll be loving it, you'll lose track of time, it'll go so fast. Just make sure not to drink to much water. 10/10, you can't make a better fantasy/ epic film.
10.0~One of the best I've seen varnerm Sign in Permalink This has to be one of THE greatest movies... and by far the greatest sequel. It is full of action and adventure along with emotion. Its a great all around package. It also stays pretty close to the books, which was a must if you ask me. Definitely a must see!
10.0~HOLY CRAP mazdaspdz Sign in Permalink I rarely give movies perfects but this movie had a full gamut of emotions at my disposal. The only complaint I had was the long ending. This movie will be known from years to come as a cinematic achievement. Lastly I wished they had Eowyn/Faramir relationship but I understood why Peter Jackson decided not to put this in. Bravo to the whole Lord of the RIngs team and come oscar time I expect them to sweep
10.0~Best of the best! ersanglurack Sign in Permalink I cannot count the number of times I have watched the whole trilogy! The Return of the King is more than a fitting end to what is to me the best movie series of all time. The Return of the King can be said to be primarily based on the final great battle of Middle Earth - the battle of Minas Tirith. The movie starts with a small piece on how Smeagol/Gollum got hold of the ring in the first place, which should answer a lot of questions for those who haven't read the book. From there, it picks up quickly as it takes us to Middle Earth. The movie is packed with so many epic moments and shots - the lighting of the beacons, the march of the Rohirrim, the scene where Faramir and a few Gondor knights march towards Osgiliath with Minas Tirith in the background, the arrival of Grond, the arrival of the Rohirrim (DEAAAAATTHH!!), the arrival of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli with the Undead Army, just to name a few. All in all, a fitting to an absolutely enthralling trilogy and a heck of an adventure.
10.0~Stunning Cinematic Masterpiece Snowflake93 Sign in Permalink I remember going to the cinema to see The Fellowship of the Ring in December 2001, having just turned eight years old. At that age, I'd never read the book, but was accompanied by my dad, who had loved and respected them since his own childhood. Little did I know that over the next couple of years, I would be waiting and waiting in anticipation for the next to come out. The Return of the King is the final chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Without giving too much away in the story, it follows Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) to their great climax, at Mount Doom, where the Ring must be destroyed in order to save middle Earth. The relationship between these two characters in particular remains increasingly gripping and suspenseful, particularly whilst accompanied by the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), the former owner and slave to the Ring, who will do anything he can in order to win his 'Precious' back. The tone and rate at which we see Frodo weakening to the power of the Ring is perfect, and creates a hugely haunting yet sympathetic feeling towards him. His friendship with Sam, although affected at times by the power of the Ring and Gollum's manipulative nature, in contrast provides a great sense of camaraderie and support, with the right amount of sentiment and emotion. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) are reunited with the two hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) in Isengard after the last march of the Ents, and alongside King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and the Riders of Rohan, led by Eomer, face the great battle for middle Earth before the walls of Minas Tirith. Here we are also introduced to Denathor, steward of Gondor, driven into insanity over a course of many years due to his dangerous use of a Palantir and contact with the Dark Lord Sauron. Meanwhile, behind the gates of Mordor, Sauron has created his greatest army, consisting of Orcs, wicked men and Nazgul, to destroy the race of men for good. The scenes featuring these creatures set a much stronger tone of darkness and evil than, I believe, the first two films, as you get a real sense of the enormous climax this is all leading towards, and it is truly seeing evil in its deepest, darkest form. The contrast and variation, when good meets evil, is so beautifully done December 2003, and aged 10, I saw The Return of the King at last, and not only did it reach my expectations, as a little girl with a vast imagination and love of fantasy, but it surpassed them by miles. The exquisite sets, beautiful scenery and faultless performances make the final chapter in this extraordinary trilogy a more than memorable one. One of my personal favourite aspects of these films were the relationships between the characters. Whether its laughter between Merry and Pippin, ongoing support between Frodo and Sam, friendly rivalry between Legolas and Gimli or the love between Aragorn and Arwen, the sense of fellowship and love, clichéd as that may sound, is so powerful and so evident, you feel all the emotions they are feeling, as though you are right there, on the journey with them, something which I have never really felt in a film before. This is aided by a masterpiece of a score from Howard Shore; memorable, daunting and gorgeous pieces of music, all perfectly paced and fitting for every scene. For those of who complain that Lord of the Rings is "boring" or "too long"; firstly, use your imagination. This story is so brilliantly brought to life, it feels like you're watching a piece of history. Secondly; too long? Enough of the book as it is had to be left out of the film to make it a suitable cinematic length; any shorter and too much would have to have been left out. The truth is, the way Peter Jackson and the rest of the crew made this film, was so that anyone who had NOT read the books would be able to follow and get completely immersed in the story. They did a fabulous job of this, as they made this incredibly rich, complex world an accessible one to me as an 8 year old, and to others whom I know, whilst still satisfying the needs of the books' fans. I remember, not so long ago, watching a documentary of The Return of the King, on the special extended DVD, in which a quote from Viggo Mortensen sticks clearly in my memory. It went something like this - "Many years from now the special effects may seem dated, but the feeling the emotion will always be there." That sums it all up perfectly - the emotion is wonderful. But so are the special effects, and yes, they may seem old some time for now, but they will still feel incredible and very special to me, because those special effects brought JRR Tolkien's novel (which I went on to read after Return of the King) to life in a way that thrilled even his most loyal fans, who thought it could never happen. Peter Jackson has simply created a masterpiece. I don't think I could ever consider this trilogy NOT to be my favourite set of films, and even all these words can't quite sum up how I feel about them... since I was first introduced to that world, at the age of 8 years, I was mesmerised. Now, at 15 going on 16, I am mesmerised. And I know that's how I always will be. Outstanding.
8.0~Whole New World saurabhsharma-10931 Sign in Permalink This movie is totally a fiction movie based on some book.. but really what a movie hats off to the LOTR team.. they created whole new world and the even the visual effects are awesome according to that time. only one thing i don't like that movie is very lengthy otherwise its a masterpiece.
10.0~A near perfect end to the greatest trilogy of all time. knkwhitaker Sign in Permalink The third installment of Tolkein's masterful trilogy explodes to life on screen in ROTK. From the intro flashback scene to our final farewells I was literally on the edge of my seat. This film is like a rollercoaster ride at mach 1. My only small complaint is that I could have gone for an extra 10 or 15 minutes worth of Legolas and Gimli, they felt slightly underused. All in all one of my favorite movies of all time!!!
10.0~Wonderful Conclusion to the Trilogy ezmo87 Sign in Permalink There is no argument that this was the best movie of 2003. It got 11 academy awards which is what it definitely deserved. I saw this movie opening day with a couple friends and we were all very happy with it. It is a great conclusion to the trilogy and the visuals and special effects are better than in fellowship and the two towers. The battle of minas tirith is probably the most awesome battle I've ever seen in a movie before. The story was wonderful and picks up right where the two towers left off and does it great job of actually moving the story along with really good pacing. The plot is great just like the first two. The acting is really good as well. Frodo starts going down hill since the ring is taking him over and he does a great job of acting in the evil kind of way. Andy Serkis as gollum is wonderful just like in the two towers. The movie is probably the most dramatic out of the three movies and it's not melodrama or corny drama, it's actually good and very well done in the conclusion of the movie. The movie runs for 3 hours and 20 minutes. The only minor complaint I have toward this movie in the ending. It was dragged on for a little bit too long and I also thought mordor could have looked a little better when Frodo and Sam finally reached it. It should have looked like how it looked in the first two movies with it's scorching red sky and a dark dark land of mountains with thunder and lightning that looks crazily good. In return of the king, mordor looked more like a night time on a cloudy day. Maybe it's a sign of Sauron loosing power. Who knows. These are just minor complaints that don't take away any of my likings for this movie. Most people would say this was the best out of the trilogy. I personally like them all three of them the same though. These are my favorite movies of all time and it's probably not about to change.
10.0~Completely inspired. enessavay Sign in Permalink I can't remember the last time a movie forced tears to my eyes within the first 15 minutes. As a film student, we're always taught to pick apart cinema - find faults and criticize - but there is nothing I can say about this film to deny it its honorable place in cinema history as one of the most inspired epic films of our time. It is visually spectacular and possibly the most sincere representation of Tolkein's vision anyone could hope for. The Return of the King provides a finish to the trilogy that simply cannot disappoint, particularly if, like me, you're a bit tired of the same old business of one hero that saves the day with the help of his underlings. TRotK reminds us of the importance of friendship, courage, and faith in ourselves and each other. There is no single hero. As in Tolkein's Middle Earth, these times we live in can often feel like the end of the world is at the door and I think this movie is a fantastically well-timed reminder that everyone, no matter how small, can change the course of the future. Kudos to Peter Jackson, the writers, and every actor/extra/stuntman that breathed life into what was already a work of art. It is a beautiful film. GO SEE IT!
10.0~Perfect kc0bus Sign in Permalink I just finished watching this trilogy for the second time and was just as moved as the first time I saw it. Cinema with sound has been around now for nearly 80 years and this is the very first TRUE masterpiece. It took THAT long. Sure, other movies have been branded "masterpiece", but Peter Jackson has redefined what a masterpiece really is. After seeing this trilogy, I will never look upon movies in the same way again. There's no reason why every movie can't be of this quality. It just goes to show that some of the most creative minds in the world don't necessarily hail from out of the Hollwood movie making machine. Peter Jackson not only isn't an American, he never even went to movie making school. If someone who's never set foot in a movie making school (let alone barely set foot in the United States) can make a movie of this caliber, than that ought to say something about these "schools" and the Hollwood movie making machine. Let this be a lesson to all who have even a passing interest in movies. I look forward to Peters next project with great enthusiasm. Thank God for Peter Jackson.
10.0~Amazing end to the greatest trilogy!! Shot007 Sign in Permalink I thought this version of the Lord of the Rings to be the best of the three. It is above The Two Towers and even eclipses Fellowship Of The Rings. From the beginning to the end it is an emotional ride to the destruction of the one ring. I think this is a film that is going to be remembered for years to come, and in the future people would appreciate it more and place it on the pedestal alongside grand masterpieces such as Ben-Hur and The Godfather. Return of the king shows how an epic should truly be done, in a time when Special effects is highly relied upon. The team manages to not only take advantage of these SFX, but also shows that it doesn't take only effects to move a film, but instead it takes a very good story, one that is capable of holding up to all the effects. Return of the King doesn't disappoint here, the story never lets down and in fact gets better as it goes on. That being said I two minor problems about the film, first of all the battle of Minas Tirith was in the day light (unlike the night battle of Helms Deep), so this made the weaknesses of the Special Effects to become more apparent, secondly if someone is not a huge fan of the series the ending may lead them to become a bit restless because it goes on for a while. However being a fan, I thought it was great that Jackson did this because, Personally I did not want the movie to end. Peter Jackson deserves many awards for this film, and it is only up to the Academy's biases as to whether or not he will in fact win these awards, but I think Best Picture and Best Director, is deserved. I was so happy to see the acting of the major characters in this film, every one pulled their stuff together, and Frodo, Sam and Ofcourse Gollum were magical, as they continued towards Mordor. Amazing acting all around and everyone should be commented. The Score should also be commented, Howard Shore put together another amazing score, though it is not as engrossing as FOTR, I found the overall music was very engrossing and suiting to the atmosphere of the film as a whole. Personally I think this film was the crowning achievement for everyone involved in this movie, amazing all around, and I was happy to see this film rewarded justly. This is far and away the best movie I have seen this year, and yes I have seen most of the other 'Oscar contenders', it is one of the best movies I have ever seen, because the director balances technology with a great storyline and received amazing acting from the cast, this is a lesson to be learned for future film makers in this genre. Special Effects should never be the primary driving force of a movie, even in an age digital this story and acting are integral- - Take that Matrix 2-3 and Star Wars Episode 1-2. In Conclusion I am very proud to be a fan of this trilogy of movies that shows just how movies and their sequels/other parts should be done. Return of the King perfectly wraps up Tolkien's trilogy, Jackson does it better than anyone else could. 10/10!
10.0~Fabulous amybabadrinkwater Sign in Permalink Return of the king is the best film you would probably manage to see. The battle scenes are amazing and it was a brilliant way to end a film. Elijah Wood(frodo) and Sean Astin(Sam)did a brilliant job of acting the emotions both characters were going through. Billy Boyd(Pippin) and Dominque Monaghan(Merry) also did a fanastic work with there characters. At last we see them fight! Liv Tyler(Arwen) did extremely well showing her affections to Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen) Mentioning Aragorn, his future is finally in place. hes going to become to King of Gondor. Viggo Mortensen's stunt work was fantastic, the best sword master in the whole film. Orlando Bloom(Legolas) did a fanastic job in his stunt work aswell. I couldnt think of a better ending for a film. Aragorn becomes king and he marries the beautiful elf Arwen. Frodo and Sam survive and return home with Merry and Pippin. This film was extremely emotional and you can feel what each character is going through. This gets a solid thumbs up from me 10 out of 10!
9.0~All that and a bag of chips aurovon Sign in Permalink When I stepped in the movies I was scared that the last lord of the rings movies might not live upto its words. I was absolutely wrong. It was just simply wonderful. This was definately the best out of all 3, I clearly state with no hesitaion Lord of the Rings is the best sequel ever! GO WATCH IT!
10.0~I've had nightmares in which Seabiscuit wins The Academy Award for best Picture... SrCAPnCDLvl99 Sign in Permalink Wow! Where to begin? This is by far the best film I have ever seen. There are few words that can describe why tears kept falling from my eyes as the film unraveled upon the screen. I cannot remember the last time I felt so strongly for the characters of a film. Having now seen it twice, with tickets booked, I find myself wanting to buy every single little replica of the rings, the knives and the brooches worn in the films. Get it while you can! They're making history here. Some friends made a comment about it being to long and that they'd thought the film to be over several times during the last third of the film. I find that genuinely surprising as I think it's way to short. Another friend made the comment that they could have cut out 30+ minutes out of the film to make it better. What 30 minutes would that have been I replied. ...No answer. You simply cannot cut even a second out of this film. Every moment from the opening scenes with Smeagol/Deagol to Sam's farewell at the end oozes of atmosphere and talent. It is hard to believe that they actually managed to pull it off. Peter Jackson and company actually made films out of The Lord of The Rings! And not only did they do that; they made some of the best films ever made. The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King is a masterpiece, and I seriously doubt that anyone will ever be able to top this. No, noone will ever be able to do a better film than this! The fact that the Academy might not even nominate Sean Astin for an Oscar scares the hell out of me! I've had nightmares in which Seabiscuit wins the Best Picture Award and where The Cat in The Hat takes home the Visual Effects. Members of the Academy: Please spare us from this tragedy coming true. Show us that you are among the millions, billions of people that will see this film before it leaves theaters for good, and please throw Andy Serkis a bone as well.
10.0~Unmatched MACabrera14 Sign in Permalink Clearly, the best movie saga. I doubted if the end could be at the height of the books and the others films and close exceptionally. The costumes, the soundtrack, actors, the photography, everything are excellent. In this third and final part, Frodo and Sam will try to arrive Mount Doom to destroy de ring. They will be accompanied by Gollum on their way. On the other hand, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and others will battle for the middle earth and to give more time for Frodo and Sam. There are impressive battles, epic moments, magnificent duels. If you haven't been the movie, i don't't know what are you waiting for. Thanks Sr. Peter Jackson.
10.0~ROTK was too good for words!!!! leahjackie Sign in Permalink This movie was a masterpiece, Peter Jackson did a brilliant job! It was very touching... I knew the end and I still cried! The way he portrayed the characters and events was fantastic... The movie is definitely the best one of the year!
10.0~No words could give this movie(s) the justice it deserves... boobie_tassels Sign in Permalink It's hard for me to say that ROTK is the best, because I prefer to view LOTR as each movie is so different. FOTR is the character and plot introduction, TT being the drive of the story, and ROTK being the closure. But as a whole, Lord of the Rings is by far THE best movie ever. Never has a movie been such an emotional ride for me. I became extremely attached to the characters, and was truly effected by the paths of their lives. The movie is perfectly cast, and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these characters. They are so true to the way Tolkien described them (Faramir excluded, but it was great for the movie!). The CGI is top notch, the story heart wrenching, the acting superb and the musical score is breathtaking and practically a character itself because it adds so much to the story. It is such an exciting, intense, melancholy yet joyous experience that I never imagined could be delivered from a movie.
1.0~Disappointing! MrProtein Sign in Permalink I don't know if you have seen the same movie I've seen but this movie was awful. I really, really liked the first movie, an obvious 10, the second was a little bit worse, yet still a 7, but this one was really bad. I mean, what is the reason for a happy, happy, happy, happy end which is 30 minutes too long. The characters are flat and no one cares if anyone of the main characters dies or not(like the king) because you can't feel connected to them. Gollum should be dead two times before he is falling into the fire. It is just boring after the second part if hords of orks are fighting against man. And the worst thing was Legolas after sliding down this elephant like animal and posing. So bad animated and so silly. Unfortunately, this movie was so disappointing like Matrix 3.
9.0~A beautiful finale Korrgan Sign in Permalink In every way, this movie is magical. A purely beautiful movie. It tops Fellowship, and it tops Two Towers. Over, and over does it top them. From the first few seconds to the climatic ending, this movie never lets go. And you don't want it to. I wasn't a huge fan of the first two movies, and I've never read the books, and I don't plan to. The first two movies were great movies, I enjoyed them a lot, but I just wasn't a LoTRholic. Return of the King made me one though. I had the chance to get a ticket to the showing of it Tuesday, I also saw the first two movies in their extended cuts, before seeing RoTK. It was a truly magical experience I'll never forget. You must see this movie, its completely necessary in order to keep on living. The LoTR trilogy is the best movie trilogy to ever exist. In hundreds of years, it will be a classic, it will never be forgotten. And long live it. I love this movie, and you know what... I'm going to see it again... and again... and again. I'm sure I'll be just as excited every time I see it. Its that kind of movie, one that deserves your full attention, and all of your respect.
8.0~The ending was long, but necessary ebase131 Sign in Permalink The people i saw the movie with didnt like it only because of the last 10 to 15 minutes...I think this is a stupid reason not to like a brilliant movie. Also, although I admit it was sort of long, if I was the maker of this film, i would realize that it is necessary, in order to conclude it properly, to show where all the players paths went from there. So dont hate because you get bored easily...and vote 10 for RETURN OF THE KING!
10.0~Awe-evoking. Pavel-8 Sign in Permalink **Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!!** Sequels are inherently difficult to make and review review, because on top of the usual expectations for a film, everyone has to deal with expectations created by the previous films. Return of the King faced expectations equal to those of any other film, and like the protagonists at Helm's Deep, fended them off and crushed them. ROTK begins where "The Two Towers" concluded. As Gandalf said at the end of TTT, "The battle for Helm's Deep is over; the battle for Middle Earth has begun." Frodo & Sam are still moving toward Mordor; Merry & Pippin are hanging out w/ the Ents at Isengard; and the rest of the fellowship has defeated the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep. With Saruman defeated, the focus now shifts east, where man must make a final stand against Sauron, while Frodo & Sam attempt to destroy the One Ring. As opposed to the breakneck opening scenes of TTT, ROTK starts slowly, but the early character development in lieu of action sequences is equally enjoyable and enlightening. Thank goodness for the deliberate beginning though, because if the intensity of the latter two-thirds of the film lasted for the full running time, paramedics would have been required on site to assist with heart failures and burst blood vessels, inevitable side effects of the remarkable tension that director Peter Jackson creates. Speaking of Jackson, let's hear it for him and his crew (pause for standing ovation). That crew has once again created a mythical world without a trace of fictitiousness. Through the jaw-dropping visualization of massive battles, fortresses, monsters, and more, the cinematography and effects uphold and improve the standard set by the predecessors. Gollum now has more to work with as an "actor", and the digital whiz kids step up to the challenge, blending him into the shots perfectly, particularly in a brilliant reflection scene. More sweeping battle scenes and more gorgeous landscapes are among the stellar shots lensed by Andrew Lesnie. The first shot of Minas Tirith stands to be my movie moment of the year; it will absolutely take your breath away. But the beauty lies in the fact that you scarcely know the difference between beautiful reality and equally natural effects. Outside of a couple apparent blue-screen shots, I never once doubted the veracity of the world of Middle Earth. Considering the enormity of that task, those at WETA Workshop who dazzled us with their talent deserve every award they get over the next couple months. On the musical front, Howard Shore is back as composer, and his work shines as never before. He provides grand and booming orchestral sounds when battles require them, yet still manages to evoke emotion without lapsing into melodrama during poignant scenes. Mixing and tweaking familiar themes with new melodies, Shore literally hits all the right notes. For the audience, picking out recognizable themes, such that of Rohan or the Fellowship, and hearing how Shore has kicked them into a minor key or altered those last two notes is a thrill. His score is a joy to listen to, both as it seamlessly meshes with the film and on its own. Perhaps there can be no higher compliment. Also of note is the use of vocal music voiced by the actors themselves, a technique that is new to the theatrical releases of LOTR. Of the two songs, I must mention the first one, which is utilized to stunning maximum effect. In a remarkable scene reminiscent of The Godfather, the song is sung over a scene that cuts between a character who made a decision and the grim consequences of that choice. The music, pictures, and variations in film speed combine for one of the best scenes of the year. None of the acting work stood out to me, and by that I mean no individual was head-and-shoulders above the rest. I could still make a legitimate Oscar case for at least four cast members (Astin, McKellen, Mortensen, Wood), which is a tribute to the overall strength of the ensemble cast. Everyone fits into and builds upon their roles so very well, and the camaraderie that I've seen glimpses of behind the scenes carries over wonderfully. The acting serves as a means rather than an end. A la "Band of Brothers", the combined ten hours of film allow time for the characters to be developed and known, an advantage fully used in ROTK, which has more fulfilling scenes packed with emotion where we see decisions being made. Those scenes are what elevate this film to another level. On top of the nonpareil action sequences that shame other "epics", it has a human soul, one that comes to the fore in final act, when the friendships that have been established take center stage. To me, friendship is the core theme of LOTR, and thanks to the fabulous acting of all participants, that theme is displayed in all its glory in ROTK. WARNING! THE NEXT PARAGRAPH DISCUSSES THE CLOSING SCENES!! In an unusual but welcome departure from the cinematic norm, the denouement of ROTK lasts a good twenty minutes after the climax. Too many movies, like "Matrix Revolutions", wrap too quickly, leaving fates either unresolved or resolved, but sloppily and unsatisfactorily. Others, such as "Pirates of the Caribbean", do have an extended ending but don't require one and thus fill it with fluff. Here we find a perfect mean. Considering that Jackson and company have over ten hours of film and numerous character arcs to wrap up, twenty minutes is probably the minimum required to let the audience absorb all that has happened. After three or four possible end points, each of which concludes various stories, Sam returns to the Shire and enters his home, closing the door on both the camera and the trilogy. While the finish may seem odd, I consider it perfect. Sam has just come to the end of a fantastic adventure, a journey mirrored by that of the audience. The ending leaves each party back where they began, in a satisfying yet admittedly bittersweet manner. Like it or not, "I'm back." END OF MAJOR SPOILERS. Is this film perfect? Probably not. Sure, certain characters like Denehor could have been developed more. But while that knowledge would have been helpful, the time it would have taken to expound on those people likely would not have been worth the knowledge gained. There are a handful of other cardinal sins, such as scarcely showing the ultimate villain and Arwen's near random appearances. But most of those trace back to the original books, not to errors by Peter Jackson. The fact that the entire series works so well without fully disclosing many details speaks to the phenomenal power of Tolkien's books and superb work in Jackson's films. The bottom line is that nobody cares about the flaws because they're entranced by the literary and cinematic magic on display. Bottom Line: ROTK, the greatest final film in a trilogy of all time (go ahead...name a better one) culminates the best overall film trilogy ever, ten hours of film that transcend the medium. As I told my brother as we reluctantly but contentedly departed the theater, we will never experience anything like this again. EVER. 10/10.
10.0~The Return of the Epic peterson_charlie Sign in Permalink The critique that Saruman was noticeably absent is accurate. The critique that the ending went on a bit too long is accurate. The critique that the score was unoriginal is accurate (however it does provide continuity with the previous movies-as it should). HOWEVER - those critiques are in the deep shadows of this brilliant final film. Overwhelming is perhaps the best adjective for this. Jackson demonstrates not only great direction, but incredible vision, and huge cajones. It will be a long time (maybe never) before anyone tries anything as ambitious as this and not only pulls it off but does so spectacularly. If they ever run all three movies together, I'll buy a seat cushion and be first in line.
8.0~Still great, but not superb oecumenix Sign in Permalink Ok, so RotK was still wicked but it felt a bit flat. Here's why: (spoilers ahead!) They didn't build up the Witch King enough. Him vs Eowyn could have been stupendous, but they didn't give him enough PR beforehand (hello?! I'm f*****g unkillable over here! oh.. now I'm dead). Aragorn suddenly appeared in Gondorian armour without actually meeting any men from Gondor. Everyone forgot about Faramir, Eowyn and Merry after Pelennor Fields. I'm not saying they should have actually filmed the Houses of Healing scene (which is quite frankly awful), but a little closure would have been nice. In fact, the entire film left some massive holes, in favour of some expendable hobbit scenes at the end: no Saruman (major mistake); no Faramir and Eowyn love-in (sorely missed since they're two of the few characters who get enough sympathy to care about them - much more than Aragorn and Arwen!); what happened to the Orcs that didn't fall into the pit?; what the hell happened to Legolas and Gimli at the end of the film?!; no funeral for Theoden, who deserved one. The battles seemed a lot more like set-pieces than in TTT, with way less emotional involvement.. there was nothing near the TTT charge of the Rohirrim, and the only thing that came close was the.. well.. the charge of the Rohirrim. Theoden was very well done, till he got squashed without a fight. Too many CGI Oliphaunts, not enough hand-to-hand from the Gondorians. Not enough build-up to the arrival of the Haradrim ships. Shelob was a big anticlimax. Did I get everything? probably not. Frodo/Sam/Gollum was done pretty awesomely (I liked the changes they made, although I question the need for a 10 minute Smeagol flashback) and they improved the Mt Doom scene a lot from the book. The battle scenes could have been awesome too(making the rest of the film more awesome), but I think they just needed a bit more emotional oomph behind them. Having said all that, I felt a bit disappointed after seeing Two Towers, too, but it grew on me a lot. So I suppose I'll have to watch it a couple more times. Plus, the extended version has a lot more scope for improving the film than with TTT. So there is hope, even if it is just a fool's hope. Oscar chances: middling. A lot of other people (probably less fan-ish) have thought it was excellent, so it might get a big following. Sean Astin could be worthy of Supporting Actor; Elijah Wood would probably deserve a nomination for Best Actor, but I still don't like Viggo Mortensen and he'd probably get nominated for it too. Gollum was much more one-dimensional in this one so no hope for Andy Serkiss. Sir Ian was good but didn't really have to stretch himself in such a hammy role. Miranda Otto could have got a nomination for Supporting Actress on the back of TTT, but she didn't get enough screen time here. If Tyler or Blanchett get something and she doesn't, I'm gonna burn things. I think the film (and the trilogy as a whole) was very well-shot and well-written, but sadly I didn't think RotK was actually that well directed or cut (see above rant for examples) so if Peter Jackson gets Best Director I think it'll be out of respect for what he's done rather than his actual directing talent. Oh and the soundtracks have got progressively worse since the first film. Final grade (after one viewing): wicked, on a scale from pathetic to absolutely awesome . In Arabic numerals, this may equate to 8/10 (where TTT and FotR were 9)
10.0~I'm obsessed ulara Sign in Permalink I first read The Lord of the Rings back in the 70's. I didn't expect much when I went to see the first movie but left the theater in amazement and couldn't imagine having to wait a year for the 2nd one....and so on. I can't possibly improve upon the excellent reviews I have read here so won't even try. After the first movie I re-read the second and third books, and after The Return of the King I re-read all of them. The movies have made the reading of the books a much fuller experience; before, it was hard to visualize much of the rich detail written in the books. Now I've become fascinated with the history and am reading the Silmarillion. I have to keep reminding myself it's just fantasy!
8.0~The End is near ... kosmasp Sign in Permalink Like with the first two LotR movies, I hadn't (and still haven't I have to admit) read the books. So if your're looking for any comparison between the book and the movie, you have to look for other comments (and there are plenty of them here). The only thing I know, is that a small part of the end of book two (Two Towers) is implemented in Return of the King. Unfortunately for me, a review I read about the movie, did spoil that fact for me. In case you aren't aware of the book, I won't spoil anything that happens in this movie. But I'm going to assume that you have watched the previous installments ("Two Towers" and "Fellowship"). Our group has split up in 3 different smaller groups, each of which has it's own journey to go through. While Frodo and Sam have found themselves a companion in Gollum, the end of part two has hinted something dark that might happen here. That's one of the best things of the movies: The interaction and sometimes even seamless transitions between characters feelings for each other (Legolas vs. Gimli to name but one). Most of the time it's done in a subtle manner and even if it's played theatrically (here in this movie, a relationship between a father and his sons), it's impossible to defy the magic this movie brings onto your screen. The action is great (although a villain we can hang ourselves onto, like the leader of the Uruk-Hai in the first movie, is still missing) and the landscape phenomenal as in every movie of the series. While it was clear, that the actors wouldn't be considered Oscar material, they all bring their A-game and especially Viggo Mortensen is a revelation (makes you still wonder, what would've happened if the original actor that was cast for that role, went through with it). The main problem I see here (and many others have stated that also), lies at the end ... well "endings". The movie doesn't seem to know, when to stop. So while you think all is over, you get another set-piece ... and another one ... and another one. While this might seem like nit-picking to some, some others were bothered very much by that fact. Still this is the best Fantasy Franchise that has hit our screens and makes other efforts seem pretty dull (Dungeons & Dragons anyone?). Now let's see if I can manage to read "The Hobbit" before they make a movie out of it ... (I've already read a few pages)
10.0~Wraps everything up Nicely! (No Spoilers) rocky_76 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie today, and I felt sad leaving the cinema, sad because the journey was over. For the 3rd Christmas in a row I have spent over 3 hours of my life in a Cinema hall to see if the Movies could live up to the books, the films have certainly bought the spirit of JRR Tolkiens story to the screen successfully. I won't go into how good an adaptation this movie was, instead I would like to talk about it as a Movie in it's own right - and it was great. I don't think I have thought 'Wow' or 'F***ing hell' to myself so many times during a movie as i did today during ROTK. There were some jaw-dropping scenes; shot beautifully, but importantly complimented by some very good acting and some really touching ones too. I really need to watch it again to take everything in, so much is said and done in this movie (at times it felt quite rushed despite it's length). 9/10 - I expect the extended edition to improve this!
10.0~11 out of 10 drjnfever Sign in Permalink Well worth the two-year wait. I have to admit I was a little scared that it wouldn't live up to the hype. But I'm glad to say that it did...and more. Peter Jackson and the entire crew deserve a big congratulations. I'm not an edge-of-my-seat kind of moviegoer, but Frodo, Sam and Gollum had me shaking, sweating and very distressed. No movie has had that effect on me before. I'm tired of hearing complaining "purists." I understand their loyalty to Tolkien, but how many times does it have to be said? You cannot transfer a book directly to screen. Especially one as unique and intricate as The Lord Of The Rings. An exciting book won't necessarily become an exciting movie. The flow of action is completely different and the story must be adapted accordingly. I am an avid fan of the book, and I am also an avid fan of the movies. Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh did a top-notch job in adapting the story in the spirit of Tolkien's vision. The changes are understandable, necessary and a marvelous example of genius screenwriting. Those that say different are just narrow-minded. Many of these "purists" who have nothing positive to say are using Tolkien negatively to put others down in an attempt to validate their own lack of understanding. Yes, the movies are different from the book. But the spirit is the same. The LOTR series is a welcome change to the high-budget, high-special effects, low-content garbage Hollywood has been churning out. The series was made with love and it shows. ROTK is by far the best movie I've ever seen.
8.0~Fantastic, though ending is a bit long! pkotsonis Sign in Permalink This was a fantastic film!!! Epic scenes, fantastic cinematography, and great acting. There were a few drawbacks, but overall I thought the movie was awesome. I wished I could have seen more of Legolas, but alas I may have to wait for the extended edition DVD. Throw in a few too many slow-motion shots of the actors, and a super drawn out ending, and that's about it for my gripes. Sean Austin gets my nod for a fantastic portrayal of Sam in this film. He has a passion for his character that only Viggo can come close to. Overall an 8. The weight of this film is just AWESOME. Epic scenes and visual storytelling, but a bit too dragged out in the end. I just felt it was lacking something...not sure what, but I think I'll see what I was missing when the extended edition DVD comes out. :) Peter Jackson for best director, or I'll never watch the Oscars again.
9.0~Minor flaws aside, LOTR proves itself one of the most successful trilogies in modern film Quinoa1984 Sign in Permalink In Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though heard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the past two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's grand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end. The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment. Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron. There is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on not just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga of the Lord of the Rings as a whole. Though the film does carry quite a load to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the three in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the details of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this version, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there are plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on the visual effects as a whole that don't let up. In all, ROTK is on the level with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole. This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to, that one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that preceded it. It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would be very difficult to sit through it in one place. Grade: A (both as a picture in and of itself, and overall on the three epics combined)
6.0~Conceited boring Films FabioPirovano Sign in Permalink Finally the end a a trilogy,three conceited boring films(call videogames maybe is better) where I never feel grip. Any boring steps are expand and other summarized..a movie son of marketing that have no soul and In the name of marketing will be overrated! Fan of good cinema Keep Away,it doesn't deserve all that kind of attention...
10.0~And We Come to Journey's End dramaqueen-20 Sign in Permalink We as an audience have followed hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee out of the Shire and joined the Fellowship of the Ring. We have sat at the edge of our seats in anticipation, saying, "Don't do it Frodo!" or "Be strong Aragorn! Don't give up!" We have faithfully watched the destruction of towns, the bravery of the fellowship, and cried many tears when someone we love dies. We have become tenth members of the fellowship that set out from Rivendell to destroy a powerful ring. After the Two Towers came out in December 2002, we have waited patiently (some of the time) for the final part of this epic trilogy to be released. We have joined fan sites, counted the days off on our calendars, and said in our nightly prayers, "And please help the Return of the King to come early." And our patience has been rewarded. In the final action packed film of an epic saga, we watch as our heroes complete the final stretch of their journey. We cheer, we cry, and we wish that it wasn't over. We are the fans of Lord of the Rings. And I, as one of the loyalist of them all, tell you that if you haven't seen it yet, you had better, because this is a classic that will be cherished by people old and young alike.
9.0~an great, emotional finale jord-95347 Sign in Permalink An amazing final chapter to one of cinemas greatest trilogies. action packed, emotional finale, a must watch. visuals are impressive and the cast are great to.
10.0~Great Battle Scenes rileyfreer Sign in Permalink I liked this movie alot, It had great battle scenes that made sitting through the whole movie bearable. It was a story that could have easily been told in half the time but they HAD to make it 3 hours long, so there are alot of drawn out scenes tht start to wear on you towards the end.
10.0~OMG this movie Rocked!!!!! chucky3456 Sign in Permalink This is the best movie i have ever seen. I mean I dont even think I can describe this in 1000 words. Lets see, there was Shelob, Pelenor Feilds, and Mount Doom. Those should describe it all. I went into the theater expecting a great movie, and 3 1/2hr later, I couldnt get up cuz my mind was numb from all the things I had just witnessed. How could so much happen in just 3 1/2 hours???? It is a movie that I will definately go and see several times, just to catch everything!
10.0~The end tomimt Sign in Permalink The Return of The king begins with a flashback of Gollum, when he recalls how he got the ring and how it turned him into what he is now. I really didn't expect a beginning like that. After that the movie continues from where we were left in The Two Towers. There is, in my opinion, no need to mention any other, as I have praised their work in my comments of previous movies, actors besides John Noble, who does without any doubt excellent job as Denethor, mad steward of Gondor, who in his grief for his oldest son Boromir (Sean Bean) cannot see the love of his youngest son Faramir (David Fenham). Isengard has fallen, but the dark lord Sauron still remains in his strong hold, behind the walls of Mordor. He is soon launching a full-scale attack towards Gondor. And if he were to win, that would mean fall of the human race. I was very exited to see TROTK and I was, I admit it, little bit scared, as the book is a massive story, with multiple story lines. Could Jackson tie them all together again? Over three hours later I was convinced: he could. But I still was little disappointed: there were scenes missing, like what happened to Saruman (Christopher Lee)? Where was his final confrontation whit Gandalf (Ian McKellen)? But I knew the EE was coming and I was confident, that everything would be in there. But still I was certain of one thing: I had seen one of the most stunning cinematic displays of my life. And my confidence was rewarded: more about pathway of the dead, Sarumans last stand in Isengard, meeting with Mouth of Sauron. It all was in there. Some scenes were just to add some lighthearted fun in the story some were more serious. Some, I admit, I could have lived without, but then again they did made me laugh out loud. After I had all the EE versions of the films, me and my friend spent a day watching those all films in a row. The trilogy was complete, all my fears were gone and last thing for me to do is lay back and enjoy.
10.0~Simply put, the best! connor_applegate Sign in Permalink I still remember the first time that I watched this movie. I expected going into watching the LOTR trilogy for some kind of nerd fest full of terrible acting and cringe inducing action scenes. Instead what I got was probably my favorite film trilogy of all time. Everything truly spoke to me. Every part of these movies I have loved and always love. The final movie in the trilogy the Return of the King is my personal favorite out of the three. The awe inspiring action scenes, wonderful effects, and the touching themes that can be found in this classic tale. This is definitely a film worth watching again and again and again. It is one of those great movies that will stand the test of time and will never get too old to watch.
10.0~Better than the first or second! alexz-4 Sign in Permalink I was one of the few fortunate souls who's company does business with New Line Cinema, and we were treated to a sneak peak at Return of the King five days before its release. I'm a huge fan of both the first and second movies. And I think the third outdoes them both. Visually, I sat for three hours twenty stunned. The third movie remained as faithful to the book as I could possibly imagine. The only complaint I can think of, ***SPOILER ALERT*** is that I didn't like Legolas sliding down the trunk of the Oliphant. (Much like I didn't like him riding a shield down the stairs in The Two Towers.) But that is so minor that it wouldn't even scratch the perfect 10 that I give this movie. I could already see the parts that were left out for the extended version and I can't wait to see that. All that's left to say is, thank you to Peter Jackson and everyone else involved in this movie for giving us everything we could possibly imagine. One last note: Make sure the theater you see it at plays this movie LOUD. When we watched the walls shook. And the screams of the Nazgul made our eyes water and skin run cold. :)
5.0~Four Hobbits of Highly Destructive Nonsense majikstl Sign in Permalink The beauty of a fable is that it is short, poetic, insightful and morally to the point. I guess THE LORD OF THE RINGS saga doesn't count as a fable, since it is none of those things. It does have the simplest (or flimsiest) of premises. The protagonist, Frodo, a Hobbit, a small creature in a big world, has to destroy a golden ring which -- for reason that are unclear -- possesses a great deal of evil. This involves a journey through Middle Earth, which includes an interminable number of obstacles, not the least of which are a ridiculous number of subplots and extraneous secondary characters. Peter Jackson's three-part, 10 hour-plus spectacle is either a masterwork of modern technology or a sample of how CGI has become a curse on the medium. I vote for the latter. As long as Jackson keeps focused on the Hobbits -- Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin -- and their more normal sized companion/protectors, the trio of films is fairly intriguing. But the basic storyline is upstaged repeatedly for giant battle scenes that subvert and belittle the moral battle at the heart of the film. And large armies of computer generated soldiers killing other large armies of computer generated soldiers is neither very much fun, nor very interesting. Just busy, noisy and confusing. Jackson certainly has a gift for cluttering up the screen with chaos. Despite the assumption that this is a family film based on material from a perennial young readers' favorite, this is one of the most violent films that I have ever seen. The brutality, while remarkably and unbelievably bloodless, is nonetheless unrelenting. I have to admit the scope of the film is impressive, as was undertaking the massive project in the first place. But, seeing as how this is likely to be the mythological/cinematic touchstone for a generation of filmgoers, I really wish these films had more substance. This is filmmaking for the video game generation: mindless action, mindless violence, mindless noise. Somewhere inside all his hubbub and malarkey is a rousing adventure, best found with one's finger on the fast forward button.
10.0~Simply put, the best movie of all time jay632 Sign in Permalink wow, wow, wow, wow, that is how good this movie was, everything was put together like a masterpiece and that was a recipe for a awesome movie. The storyline, even though it came from a book, was awesome, sure, Peter Jackson had to rework some things, but I was so impressed by the whole movie. I knew he would leave some scenes from the book out, but it didn't bother me at all. The music was awesome, Howard Shore is a genius. I never really appreciated music in films, but every time it was time for music, he seems to know exactly the right one to put in. Couple of scenes when the music started, gave me goosebumps cause it was so awesome. The cast was awesome, usually in films, you could point out one or two guys that didn't belong in the film, but this was not that type of film, all the actors were awesome in this film. I felt the characters that played Gandolf, Sam, Frodo did especially well, made you feel the emotions of the characters. The effects were awesome, from the lighting of the torches to the battle of Pleanor fields. There is absolutely no doubt that this is the best battle scene you will ever see in film. It was awesomely choreographed and looked so real. Everything and all the minor details of costumes and computer graphics put into this film was done to perfection. Bottom line is, for many years, this will probably be the film to beat. But in my opinion, the bar is set high now to show how films are suppose to be done.
6.0~OH MY GOD!!!!! (slow motion sucks) deacondisaster Sign in Permalink What on earth are all you people praising this movie as the perfect ending and better than the first three talking about? For the record, I really liked the first two so I am not just a hater. I won't even complain about elements left out of the movie that were in the book. The main problem with this film is that apparently director Peter Jackson has grown an enormous ego with the success of the first two films. Apparently he felt the need to make this finale even more epic than the first two films (the although the story is already quite epic enough). He decides to do this in an enormous number of ways. Let's see.....he uses slow motion, and then um....yeah he uses slow motion, and oh wait....he also uses slow motion. My god!!! I have never seen such unimaginative directing. The movie could have easily been only 2 hours had all these slow-mo scenes been played in real time. Slow motion at certain points in the story can be effective. Overuse is clearly detrimental to the flow of the story. My other main issue with the third installment was the infusion of simply awful one-liners throughout. "I am no woman!" and almost anything Sam said from what I can remember (which is probably less than I should as I had to start tuning out the stupid things half the people were saying). Now to be fair the movie wasnt awful. I mostly liked it. But these problems took away from what was largely a successful ending. Again, I attribute it to the director trying to be epic with the repeated use of childish editing techniques when the story itself was epic enough. Definitely a bad ending. SLOW MOTION SUCKS
10.0~Outstanding tjpmkp Sign in Permalink Forget these "gentle, little films" like Lost in Translation or Station Agent -- this is what I call a REAL movie. It is outstanding in every way. While I felt the first two LOTR films dragged and I couldn't get into them, this final chapter kept my interest from the opening scene. Truly spectacular!
5.0~Two Words: Overkill & Excessive ccthemovieman-1 Sign in Permalink First of all, let me just say how impressed I was with the first two movies in this trilogy. They were outstanding films and deserving of all the awards they received. Perhaps that is one reason I was so disappointed in this movie; it wasn't nearly as interesting as the first two. The main reason can be summed up in one word: OVERKILL. Director Peter Jackson made the same mistake he made in the film he did right after this one: "King Kong," where the action was way too much, too the point of ludicrousness and an insult to viewers' intelligence. So was this film, the third in the LOTR series. It was too much action, so much that after halfway through this 3 hour, 20-minute movie I was numb by then and could care less what happened from that point. I stuck with it, but it just got worse and worse with more ridiculous action scenes going on one after the other with absolutely no credibility to any of them. Examples of what I mean regarding "credibility" are scenes in which humongous monsters and machines 100 times the size and strength of the "good guys" would always lose. Even females and little Hobbitts disposed of these-supposedly indestructible creatures, time after time. It was so Rambo-like, so stupidly juvenile it was insulting to watch. After awhile, it wasn't even entertaining....the worst sin of them all for fantasy-adventure movie. To use another descriptive word, this film - like Jackson's subsequent King Kong - was EXCESSIVE. By overdoing the action, the awesome-looking creatures and the wonderful special-effects that captured the LOTR audiences for the first two movies, ended this trilogy on a sour note. Too much violence translates into "boring." I also got tired of seeing a 99-percent dead "Frodo" somehow still managing to go on and on with these never-ending agonizing looks on his face and his little tearful buddies crying their eyes out constantly. Enough already! Finish the story! This was overkill of the worst magnitude and an almost needless last three hours of a great story.
10.0~The Best Movie ever made kaihui Sign in Permalink Never, never has one movie touched me so much that I cried hard after I got up this morning just thinking about it. Yes, this movie is this good. What set this movie aside from any other movies in the human history is not just the stunning storytelling, the simply extraordinary CG work, the breathtaking cinematography, the overwhelming music, the great, great acting, it's the fact that this movie combines them all and have so much, so much heart and soul! The theme of this movie is courage, love and friendship. What touches me most is the incredible courage the characters have shown. When terribly out-numbered horsemen charging down the hill to the sea of Orcas, the courage is in their hearts; when Frodo drags his wounded body, crawling on the evil land of mordor with determination, the courage is in his eyes; when Eowyn standing in front of the most feared creature in middle-earth with her fearless eyes, the courage is in her sword... So many times they face the impossible, every time they carried on believing, "There is something in this world that is worth fighting for", and they did it when everything seems hopeless, they did it with their blood and tears. I realize why the battles scenes are so good. Yes of course they are the biggest battles scenes you will ever seen in the movie history, but never has a battle seems so human. You feel for them, you can feel their pain, their fear, their despair, yet they fight on. They are so human, the best kind of human. You may say, why do you get this excited, it's just a movie. Let me tell you my friend, this is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't say this lightly, since over the years, I have seen many good movies. But this movie is not just a movie, it's journey to the land of good and evil, hope and despair, it's journey that you feel that you are one of the soldiers fighting, and you are right there standing with Frodo and Sam by the mountain of doom, you shed the tears and blood right there in the middle earth with them. This a journey 3 and 1/2 hours too short.
10.0~Incredibly Well Made follow_the_sun1 Sign in Permalink This, and the first two in the trilogy were all incredibly well made. Peter Jackson's vision did as much justice as can possibly be done to one of the greatest stories ever on the big screen. The emotion and acting done by the ensemble gives this and the first two some of the greatest ensemble work ever. The visual effects are also second to none. Gollum cannot be disputed as one of the greatest CGI characters of all time and I think it'll be a while before new technology will sufficiently surpass the effects used in this movie. Of course no book-to-movie translation is perfect, but the Lord of the Rings trilogy, especially Return of the King, displays the heart and passion that Tolkien put into his stories. For as long as they are, I can re-watch them over and over again. One of my favorite movies.
9.0~Power and Beauty angust63 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson filled my eyes with so much to see that I came away not sure if I had stepped out of a dream. He mastered the delivery of images of both power and beauty. He juxtaposed these images to weave a tapestry so grand yet also one that appears it could unravel in a heartbeat. All the while he propels the story with a skill Tolkien himself should be proud of. This is a fitting movie to end the trilogy. If completes the series and left me completely fulfilled.
10.0~Best movie of all time (except for maybe the RoTK EE) a237916 Sign in Permalink This movies was visually and emotionally stimulating. A fitting end to a great adventure. As a reader of the books, I will reserve my final remarks for the extended edition, but even so, will still afford it a 10/10. Aside from a few minor 'holes' that will probably be filled in later, here are my favorite moments: * Seeing Serkis FINALLY getting SOME non-virtual airtime....really liked seeing Serkis himself onscreen. (still can't watch all of the tranformation though...ewww.) * one word: FIGWIT * Arwen's vision. Beautifully done * Pippin's "Steward of Gondor" evoked my first tears of the movie...and I will probably cry every time I watch it as well. * Shelob was done very well * Paths of the dead, though WAY too short, was cool * Lighting of the beacons was surprisingly moving. Who would have thought the lighting of some fires could evoke THAT kind of emotion. Beautiful cinematography, too. Kept wondering if it was real or CGI. * EVERYTHING Eowen/Merry - from "My Lady!" to "I am no man!" YES, YES, YES! These were among my favorite moments of the entire movie. Every primal warcry touches my heart...again...BEAUTIFUL * Crawling, hand over hand up Mt. Doom. Can't believe that Tolkien's words could be so adeptly brought to life. Can't believe I'm saying this (as Sam has really gotten on my nerves before this) but Astin kicks some serious tail here. * Legolas/Oliphaunt/Gimli - so WHAT it wasn't in the book...it was cool! And so WHAT that Gimli is different from the book and is funny here...this movie needs levity SOMEWHERE...and Gimli never had much to do in the books anyway. * Hobbit Homage at the court of Gondor - This gets my vote for the most emotional point in the trilogy. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. Go Hobbits! * Grayhavens - for a 11+ hour movie, a 10-15 minute ending is appropriate. If you don't like it...turn it off. I loved it, it was beautiful and very appropriate. Could have used 10 MORE minutes in my opinion. Peter Jackson and company...here's to you! I never thought it could be done. Shows what I know. Best movie of all time.
4.0~B-list material disguised as an "A" movie dr_foreman Sign in Permalink It's the movie event of the century...and I am completely unmoved! I didn't like the first two entries in the series, and I don't like this one. Right around the middle of the film, when I saw the tenth shot of a CGI soldier falling off of battlements and screaming, I realized that I was watching a farce - a big overblown video game more concerned with mindless action than telling a proper story. The character development is thin and far too sentimental, and even some of the effects are strangely flat - I didn't think Sauron really worked as an enormous spotlight, and Gollum should've been played by an actor in make-up (impressive as he is, he still looks unreal). The battle sequence is practically a re-hash of the fight from "Two Towers," and the Liv Tyler scenes are distinctly repetitive, too. Any of the dialogue that wasn't from the books stuck out like a sore thumb - the wince-inducing Gimli jokes, for example. Suffice to say, I'm looking forward to the day when the special effects in these films are surpassed, and everyone has to look deeper at their dramatic content - which is sadly lacking.
10.0~The Best film of all time snellster Sign in Permalink I saw this film on day of release, and it was simply breathtaking, I did not realise of long this film was until I looked at my watch when i left the cinema. Fantastic The start was a little slow, but it needed to be, to build you up for the rest of the film. Shelob was huge and scary, Gollum was at his nastiest, the only problem was, the ending was not the same as in the book
10.0~A Masterpiece! Elswet Sign in Permalink This movie brought together everything the first two laid out, tied them into nice, neat little bundles, and concluded the whole trilogy just as it should. It does not conclude as you wish it to, but rather as Tolkien intended. The battle scenes were simply awesome this time around. With Helm's Deep, we were amazed, but Pelennor fields and Minas Tirith will leave you absolutely stunned; truly in awe of the mastery involved. "Mastery." That is a good word, and very aptly describes this production; Masterful. The sets and props were again pure perfection. The performances were of the very best, most deliberate and heart-wrenching, uplifting realistic performances on film to date. The changes made in the story were small changes and not even note-worthy; the direction staff did a marvelous job rewriting this beloved classic with all the creativity, care and love they had to offer. LotR is now my favorite movie series to date. Star Wars held that position in my heart since its release, followed by the subsequent two installments, but this, the "Return of the King," is the most imaginatively creative work I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. I simply cannot wait to own the third Extended Edition Gift Set featuring this masterpiece. I will not give away the details, as many here have (and without SPOILER warnings, I might add). I will leave that for someone else. EDIT: This was literally the very best movie I've ever seen! I cannot recommend the 4-disk Extended Collector's Edition Gift Set ENOUGH! Wow! There is SO much more movie here than there was in the theatrical version! As did the first two installments, this movie rates a full 10/10 from the Fiend. Would that I could, it would receive 5 extra bonus points for pure creativity. the Fiend :.
10.0~One Movie to Rule Them All atarimania1976 Sign in Permalink On december 12, just like the previous 2 years, I was invited to attend the dutch premiere of Lord of the Rings. What an event it was... From the stunning opening scene (simple yet effective) Peter Jackson plays out all his cards in this final chapter. The epic wars are bigger, meaner, and longer (Helms Deep will now look like a fun afternoon in at playground), and then there's "that" climax. Jackson always said that the 3rd part was his favorite and everyone will agree. He puts the most difficult scenes together with nothing but flair & skill, sometimes he goes a bit "over the top" which adds some humour and a modern touch. At the actor front, one is in top-form: Bernard Hill. This great actor plays the part of his life. A supporting actor Oscar should be his reward. As said before in other reviews, the music is first rate, as are all the other things: cinematography, art-direction, costumes, editing, CGI-FX.....etcetera. My verdict is clear: for 20 years, since I saw Return of the Jedi aged 7, movies are my life. I've been known to be very critic, so when I say that this movie is the best I've ever seen; I'm not exaggerating. The other 2 parts have been at the top of my all time favorites (along with the StarWars saga), but this one tops them all. I'm glad that as a fan of the book since 1991, I've been able to experience this. A movie to cherish, for the rest of your life.
10.0~One of the most unnoticed parts of this series zerophysics Sign in Permalink The one thing Jackson did here that was a HUGE move away from the norm ... notice that none of these DVD's have any trailers for other movies in the beginning of the DVD or any other BS that you have to go through before getting to the actual menu - these three are the only ones out of 200+ DVD's that I own that I can just put in the DVD player and actually be able to watch them without a 5 minute BS runaround of having to try to fast forward through all of the ads and trailers - most of the DVD's out won't even let you access the menu until you watch these forced advertisements ..... I am sure Jackson lost a TON of money by boycotting these things that everyone hates - it is just another example of how he made these excellent movies not for himself or a production company, but for the people that love watching them ... it is very unlikely, but it sure would be nice if others would take a few lessons on philosophy from Pete Jackson - bravo for looking after the people that pay the bills instead of the ones that make all the money from them
10.0~Beautifully Epic DANNON5 Sign in Permalink Let me start off by saying this trilogy holds perhaps the best cinematography, score, visual effects, and art direction I have ever seen/heard in my lifetime. It almost seems like Peter Jackson has made these movies just for me. The epic shots in this particular movie, are completely and utterly mind-blowing (this word is overused, I mean it in the most literal sense). I always love terrific small scenes. This movie has countless beautiful scenes. To be specific, (believe me it is very hard to do this) I loved the shot of Gandalf riding out to save Faramir and his soldiers from the fell beasts, on the retreat from Osgiliath. What beautiful lyricy and cinematography. Another: Frodo being carried away by the Eagles from Odurin. It almost seems like opera is being played in the background of this wonderfully slowed down shot. And Frodo's tired, yet content face is awesome. The retaking of the ring and Gollum's descent into the fires of Mount Doom is absolutely stunning. The look of Minas Morgul is absolutely, hellishly haunting. The Stand at the Black Gate is epic and emotional. It almost seems like these movies were all once just paintings and Peter Jackson and his terrific crew brought them all to life, whilst keeping the beauty of the picture within the shot. I had never read the books, but if they are half as good as the fantastical films, they most likely will become some of my most treasured pieces of literary craft ever, as I will obviously read them.... Now for some of the emotional impacts. I loved the opening of the movie, with Smeagol's fall to the ring, and the utterly haunting struggle with his brother for the only thing that matters to him. Sean Astin's performance as Sam was the heart of the movie for me. But I do not believe in any way that he overshadows Elijah Wood's amazing job as representing Frodo. Viggo Mortenson IS the King of Gondor. John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, Bernard Hill, the amazing Andy Serkis all give stellar performances. I also think that Ian McKellen is the ultimate veteran, perfect actor. Let me say I thought the ending to this trilogy was fabulous. No loose ends, did not drag on at all, absolutely perfect. Especially the Coronation for Aragorn. That was when you really new the Fellowship's journey was over, and you felt a real sense of accomplishment.... The sailing to Valinor is purely emotional and the most saddening scene I've ever witnessed. Of course there are always gripes, but I feel they are looked at too often and taken too seriously. Plus in this movie, they are microscopic. What a spectacular adventure. These films can really be beyond words at times. I'm still not sure if Peter Jackson made these films just for me or what's going on. Bravo, Jackson and Co. Oh yes and I do believe the Academy Awards are quite a joke, no matter what anyone says. Great performances and technical achievements should be choices left to the people. Are films made for directors, actors, and hollywood people? Or are they made for the real people? Well whatever the answer, I know the people have made their decision as to which movie is the greatest of the year.
10.0~Amazing mdaf_2 Sign in Permalink I could wright 1000 words saying how good it was, that the 3 hours were over within 10 minutes, that the visuals were stunning, the actors performed great, etc ... even then i will miss a lot of it. Watching ROTK was like feeling in general, can i describe it accuratly? No. Just these two words: best ever... Will it win the important the Oscar's? Not likely, will they give the price 2 best movie to a New Zealand director who shot it all in his native country?? No way ...
10.0~The best movie almadaaj Sign in Permalink The best movie in world The best fight and the soundtrack and the graphics
2.0~A great disappointment - but no surprise jkongels Sign in Permalink Very few trilogies manage to keep an even level of quality throughout. The classic example of course being "The Godfather"-trilogy, who, although the first two 'chapters' were brilliant, floundered in the end. The very same phenomenon exists in the world of literature as well, to name an example; the "Gormenghast"-trilogy. Why is this? It is probably not possible to arrive at a complete answer, but one possible solution is obvious. Firstly, Jackson must have been exhausted from making the two previous movies. Making cinema at the highest level is very hard work, and especially so for a director so closely interwoven with all aspects of the production. I believe he simply lost his concentration. A few of the obvious weak points of the movie should have been rooted out on an early stage. The fact that they weren't indicate a lack of the control Jackson exercised over LOTR I and II, in particular over the script. The story in the most complicated part of LOTR, near the very end, is so appallingly bad that many in the audience felt embarrassed for their interest int the trilogy as a whole. Now, Mr. Jackson isn't solely to blame for it all. Everyone who has read LOTR know that Tolkien also very much messed up the story at the end. Being a no more than mediocre writer he simply lacked the experience to round off the story in a fashion that suited the mammoth amount of verbiage leading up to the final battle. The predominant problem is that neither Jackson, who could have rewritten the end, or Tolkien offer anything new or remotely exciting. Instead they rehash the battle at Helm's deep. And, after many hours of careful storytelling, Jackson's heroes stumbles, out of nowhere, upon the "Deus I'm machina", an animated phosphorous-green army of semi-transparent ghouls. These specters, horribly reminiscent of "the Judge" from Jackson's flop "The Frighteners" save the day. The importance of these undead crusaders is inexplicably exaggerated by Walsh and Jackson. In addition, the digital effect used to create the army reminds one of a commercial for soap, a green blob magically swooping away the dirt. Visually, Jackson tendency to rely too much on digital effects was his downfall. It really isn't necessary to add that the final scenes was rather pathetic, a reminder that Tolkien dodged complex emotions for a very good reason. The supposedly bitter-sweet goodbye at the dock is drenched in golden light, no doubt added digitally, and adds the last touch of defeat to this great disappointment. I rate this movie: 2/10
7.0~Is Frodo a tragic character? tckatt202020 Sign in Permalink I believe that Frodo's voyage with the elves at the end of this film is undeniably apparent as a visual metaphor for his death. Yet, Frodo does not exhibit the classic characteristics of a tragic hero. He has no discernible fault, (except for his susceptibility to the ring which can't be considered distinguishable given that it is shown to influence any who come near it) yet he suffers worse than Shakespeare's best charity case. Given that we can't link his weakness and the nature of his demise together, is Frodo truly tragic? He is a virgin Martyr, worthy of the finest cheese that Hollywood knows how to produce. It is not the saint but the sinner that requires talent to spark our interest. Frodo is like a midget Mother Theresa who is pure selflessness and no fault. Of course we like him as a character, what isn't there to like? I simply don't see a link between myself and this character (except for the daydreaming hero in all of us) on a level that relates to the way I exist as person of the world. What do you think is believable about Frodo?
10.0~I'm happy and sad joe_parente Sign in Permalink Yeah, I'm happy. I first read the trilogy in 1970, at 14. I've read it at least 20 times since then, the last being in 2000 when the excitement was starting. I have to say I expected to be severely disappointed, as I am by almost every movie made from a book that I like. PJ did the best job that today's technology could render and viewer's butt's could stand. I can't tell you how many times I thought "That's exactly how I pictured it!" during this movie and the first two. I had moments of displeasure with changes and omissions but they were two few to mention based on the sheer quantity of storyline and character development in the novels that Jackson faithfully followed. A grand achievement overall, and ROTK is the crowning gem in the three movies. But I gush... I'm sad too. I'm sad it's over, and can't wait for The Hobbit, if the proposed project comes to fruition. I was sad after finishing the trilogy too, every time I've read it. To me that means it's a damn good book or film. All I can say is, if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?
9.0~A worthy end to a great saga! Boris020 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is without a doubt a great film and a unique experience. I had the luck to see it one day before the official premiere (which is today). My girlfriend got us tickets and I am, of course, very grateful for that. The opening sequence of the film is awesome. I don't want to spoil anyones experience but it has something to do with the creature Gollem, you'll see. The story continues where we left of and it is a whirlwind of fantastic images, stories and characters. The battle of Minas Tirth is very impressive, elephaunts, orks and trolls are joining forces. Many new creatures will come to pass and you'll be stunned by the special effects. There are also a lot of dwarf/elf jokes (always hilarious) plus a tablespoon of romance. I think Peter Jackson has outdone himself once more and he has made a worthy end to a great saga score 9 out of 10
10.0~Nothing to look forward to anymore m_trinity_m Sign in Permalink @@@@@@@@MANY SPOILERS@@@@@@@@ The Return of the King is a truly amazing movie. It has everything: action, drama, love, even some humorous parts, good acting (yes, it does have good acting), awesome sounds and music, plus incredible visual effects. I have to say, I walked into the theater expecting a great work of art, and by Buckelberry Ferry (:D), I got a masterpiece. Peter Jackson knew exactly what to put on the screen and what to leave out. The action of the movie follows, with some exceptions, the main plot of the book. It is Tolkien's "fault" that it began slower, only to carry me at the climax, leaving me breathless, and then to bring me to the inevitable end, sinking my eyes in tears. At the very end, I almost stood up and begged: "Sam, do not close that door!". But, everything has an end. The movie can be considered one of the best dramas. It highlights the struggle in every character, with Gollum stealing the award. His sick speeches are even better in ROTK, and Jackson recreated perfectly the Mount Doom scene. It is unbelievable that a CGI character can express so many feelings. The look on his face when he was falling in the lava with his precious stunned me completely. I would give an Oscar for Gollum, but I know it is impossible. And hats off especially for Andy Serkis, both the scene with Deagol and the voice of Gollum are truly his merit, he made them perfect. I could go on forever with the dramatic part of the movie: of course we have Frodo's experience, he will never be the same again, Sam's journey (countless thumbs up for Sean Astin), Aragorn, Denethor's death (what a scene, wow), Eowyn and Merry, the death of Theoden, Faramir's suffering (Denethor's cruelty is simply sick), Elrond's fears as a father and on and on... The love stories are also a strong part of the movie. Arwen's choice to let go of the grace of her kin for a mortal man is an important theme in the book. Aragorn and Arwen's marriage give the reader the hint that Gondor and the dominion of Men will not fade, even with the elves gone. Faramir and Eowyn's love is only suggested in the movie. And Sam's family simply melted my heart. Perfect ending, the exact line as in the book. I laughed watching the Lord of the Rings, but it was my laugh, not a mechanical laugh awaken by the stupid gags of a new comedy. I was carried in the Middle-Earth, I lived the story along with the characters, for 3 blessed hours,I escaped my reality. Perhaps people will disagree, but ROTK delivered good acting. I have to mention Andy Serkis again for his performance as Gollum. But I also applaud the performances of Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Sir Ian McKellen, Miranda Otto and Billy Boyd. Of course, the others must not be forgotten, but these five actors are worthy of any award. Miranda Otto has a bright future as an actress. I was not disappointed with the music, even though I thought they put the best in the first two parts. I was wrong. ROTK has awesome music, not to mention the sound, a perfect editing. I don't think anyone could argue: if you want to be blown away by perfect visual effects, The Return of the King gives you this and more. Just to select some extraordinary scenes: lighting the beacons, Denethor's passing, Legolas killing the oliphant (Gimli: "this one counts as one :)))), the army of the dead, the whole siege of Minas Tirith, Gollum's speeches, sleeping on the stairs of Cirith Ungol, the fight at the Black Gate, the arriving of Rohan, the destruction of the Witch King and last but definitely not least, the whole Mordor scene, the way that Sam carries Frodo, and finally the whole scene in The Cracks of Doom, Frodo's face, the fight between him and Gollum, the fall of the Ring. Amazing. Not enough words available. I think it takes a brilliant writer, Tolkien, and a brilliant director, Jackson, to bring us such a masterpiece. Many will say, "So what, what's the big deal?". But those who long for an escape, will make the most out of this trilogy. It is by far the best Trilogy ever made. It totally contradicts the typical pattern, with the first movie being great and the sequels nothing but a mere attempt(no titles nominated). The only thing I feel sorry for: I will not have anything to look forward to next Christmas. The last two years were enriched by this adventure, but now the journey is over . In a magnificent way, but over. Well, "I'm back".
10.0~Truly an imagination that surpasses all! swtdznygirl Sign in Permalink J.R. Tolkien is an amazing writer and what better than to have an amazing director like Peter Jackson to make this epic complete. What makes this movie a must see, is that it has all that makes a movie a Best Picture. Romance, comedy, adventure and action. Yes, it never fails when it comes to entertaining its audience. With its wonderful detailing to make an extraordinary Middle Earth. In all, you'll either wish you lived as a Hobbit or grasp the sword as a mighty warrior or perhaps you are the such, that seeks the wisdom of the Great Gandalf. Definitely a Must see film that will leave you wanting more!
10.0~Beyond all expectations! Gospelle Sign in Permalink As a regular on IMDB, I have rated hundreds of movies. This is only the second time I've ever given a film a perfect 10. Visually, this movie is beyond description. The CG in this film is a quantum leap above both previous films, and not at the expense of the story. The movie has some intensely emotional moments which were very unexpected, and masterfully done. If Peter Jackson doesn't get an Oscar this time around, expect riots in the streets. It's just that good. I feel like I did after seeing Star Wars in the theater the first time. I just can't wait to go see it again, and again, and again.
10.0~Nearly Perfect End to a Nearly Perfect Trilogy Malletman2 Sign in Permalink *THIS COMMENTARY CONTAINS SPOILERS! THIS IS YOUR FIRST WARNING!* Loved it. Great movie, great cinematics. Jackson will be glorified for his interpretation of Tolkien's great epic (and rightfully so). No other director could have pulled it off so skillfully. *FINAL SPOILER WARNING!* I must say, as a Tolkien fan, I do have a few disappointments. I did miss the Scouring, but I understand why he cut it. It's just one of those parts that works masterfully in literature but translates to crap on film. It would be the ultimate anticlimax were it rendered in cinematic version (but I still miss it nonetheless). The ultimate disposal of the One Ring was a bit of a disappointment to me, as well. When I read the book, I was actually cheering when I envisioned Gollum in his victory dance teetering over the edge. The film changed it around a bit and Frodo desperately attacks Gollum once more to try to retake the ring... and the irony of situation is lost. No longer is it Gollum's desire for the ring that is his undoing, but rather the combination of hi s and Frodo's desire. Legolas and Gimli's characterization was (again) played down. That was expected from seeing the previous films, though. Frodo and Sam's bond is slightly skewed in the films. Sam becomes a blindly following blubberer (but still lovable, loyal, and always my favorite character), so I had to hold on to the mental version of the Tolkien Samwise Gamgee to get through some of the scenes. I also recall Sam bearing the ring being much more played up in the novel... here, it's given passing mention. However, these are just the flaws. For each flaw, there are innumerable great moments to account for them. Take for example the overly predictable yet still satisfying "I am no man" line. Or the lighting of the beacons, the one scene that truly displays how epic this story is. Or even Faramir's conversation with his father before he rides off to the river in a suicide mission (this scene, as odd as it may seem, was the one that brought me closest to tears... much closer than the following battle scene, in fact). *END SPOILERS* If you're going to see the movie and expecting perfection, don't, especially if you've read the novels. Give Peter Jackson a chance and you'll see why he made most of his changes. It's not perfect, but it's about as close as any movie has ever gotten. Expect The Lord of the Rings to surpass Star Wars as the great epic trilogy in the future. It's earned the spot quite well. Final Score: 10/10
9.0~Is it worth your Dinero? cubirop Sign in Permalink Is the final installment of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy worth your money? It's worth triple your money. Everyone, young and old, rich and poor, Tolkien-fanatic and just movie-goers, alike should be in a theatre watching this movie or have already watched it. Not only is this one of the most exciting movies of the year, it is also the FINAL movie of the greatest trilogy of ALL-TIME. MAJOR!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS From the opening sequence with Deagol and Smeagol to the final words of Samwise "Well, I'm back"; The Return of the King encompasses all aspects of an AWESOME movie. The acting (although subpar for a few members of the cast) is astounding, most notably, David Wenham's, Miranda Otto's and Billy Boyd's; all three brought me to tears, the latter the most. I have but one criticism of the movie (but this is one coming from a die-hard Tolkien Fan): The trek to Mount Doom after Sam and Frodo escape Shelob's Lair and the Orc Tower, is extremely truncated. I was very disappointed in the lack of emotional turmoil that I could see in the ring-bearer's face. Otherwise, the battles were EPIC and amazing. The stunts were equally COOL! Especially Legolas' Mumakil stunt and Pippin and Merry WILL see the Shire again. END SPOILERS Warning to those who have not read the books: you will not appreciate the length of time the endings take up. But for you die-hard fans, YOU'LL LOVE IT! The Return of the King was the perfect ending to the greatest Motion Picture Trilogy in Cinema's History. It would be a great loss to anyone who does not see this movie.
10.0~The greatest story ever told, turned into one of the greatest films ever cdukovan Sign in Permalink The return of the king made you connect with characters on a whole new level especially ofter fellowship of the ring, and two towers.At the end, this movie gave me shivers. I loved how they made me feel about middle earth. They made me feel like this was once a real place. And what they did and fought for really had meaning. The special effects were great no doubt but, that is not what made me love this movie. The acting was great as well but not what made me love this movie. As was the directing, the writing and everything else just made this movie all the better. The icing on the cake if you will, but it was the way the film moved me, how it made me want to stand up for something just. At the end I always get shivers when all the dramatic music stops and it gets quiet then very quietly Aragorn says "for Frodo". Peter Jackson made the trilogy of a generation. It matches the Star wars trilogy and the godfather trilogy. I give it a 10, my favorite movie ever.

10.0~simply breathtaking jonathan.cane Sign in Permalink There is nothing to comment on this film that hasn't already been said, which is simply due credit to the producers and directors of this masterpiece: this is one of the greatest films of all time, and a perfect end to what has been an unprecedented journey of filmmaking.
10.0~Eisenstein for our time rsillima Sign in Permalink The real competition for Lord of the Rings is not, say, Harry Potter or even Titanic or Gone with the Wind, but the great epic films of the likes of Kurosawa or Eisenstein. It is in fact Eisenstein who I keep coming back to in trying to think of someone who so completely envisioned the epic on such a grand scale that had never been seen before. This is, by far, the best of the three Ring movies and it lets you know just how much better it is going to be in its very first scenes as Smeagol first encounters the ring in his own hobbit past. There will no doubt be all the award nominations for best film, best direction & everything technical under the sun, but the two actors who really deserve nominations for this film are Sean Astin & Andy Serkis.
10.0~No film has ever kept my attention all the way through. Until today!. jeza1 Sign in Permalink This film grabbed my attention like no other. I do not think any film will again. For three hours and twenty minutes I was transfixed. Quite simply the best film ever made. And then some. Everything else pales into insignificance
10.0~Fantastic, superb ending for an unforgettable Trilogy dany_arceo Sign in Permalink How explain the complete pleasure of a fan- freak viewing his most desire fulfilled? No words can contain my feelings. This work has come up against a lot of difficulties and put them aside. Jackson and crew took our pounding hearts and our reluctant beliefs and put them to the highest degree. Just pointing that no other movie can make me break and cry for a complete hour makes me realise of what this work has come to be. The more emotive movie for me and the majority of my friends. I can only be uncomfortable with my English expressions, shall them be not clear enough or not gramatically correct, but you can bet on this: The best movie I've seen for years since The Empire Strikes Back. Chapeau, LotR Trilogy cast & crew. CHAPEAU, SUPERB AND IMPRESIONANTE!!
6.0~national geographic wannabe muskokovic Sign in Permalink If you liked this call your cable or satellite provider and subscribe to the National Geographic channel. Not a bad movie i just don't see what the hype is about. i understand that the effects were great and everything but most of it was just a few guys walking up and down the mountains of new Zealand and over stretched dramatic scenes. (i really don't think that we need every scene with the least bit of drama to go into slow-mo)The battle scenes were good though. There are much better movies that you can see and you will not lose sense in your posterior. The movie is just too hyped up CGI and landscape shots do not make a movie great. Rather it is the acting and plot which really define a movie with special effects just enhancing the experience rather than being the experience its self. if you did like the cgi and think this is a #1 movie i suggest that you invest in a X-box or PS2 instead of going to blockbuster for you will find it a much more rewarding way to spend your money.
9.0~almost destroyed 9 hours in one minute daPeda Sign in Permalink The way the scenes between Frodos and Sams rescue and the end of the crowning ceremony were done (everyone laughing, kissing and hopping around when they should be expected to be just exhausted and overwhelmed) almost destroyed the whole artwork. Thank god this was not the end of the movie. 9/10
9.0~A worthy conclusion robotpals Sign in Permalink While Fellowship of the Ring remains the best FILM of the trilogy, there's very little to complain about with the final installment. While Fellowship used innovative camera angles and fully-realized environments and sets, King tends toward the static camera, except in effects shots which exist mostly in the digital realm. However, my only real complaint is that it feels a tad rushed toward the end, and for a 3 hour 15 minute film, that's really saying something. I'm looking forward to the inevitable Extended Edition, which is sure to include more character-development and depth that may have been set aside to bring the conclusion of the plot under the wire. Some random thoughts: Though neatly avoided plot-wise, Saruman's final scene is sorely missed. Bilbo's makeup at the end of the film is horrible and baffling. What was wrong with the "old Bilbo" in Fellowship of the Ring? He looks more like Benjamin Franklin in this movie than Ian Holm. In an entire trilogy of excellent makeup and real-looking monsters, bad "old" makeup is almost fatal. Sean Astin deserves an Oscar. Peter Jackson deserves an Oscar. Fellowship of the Ring deserved an Oscar. If Return of the King wins an Oscar to make up for the old snub, well and good.
9.0~A Masterpiece!! PresearchBlack Sign in Permalink This is THE most amazing film I've ever seen. This is an epic story packed with great suspense-filled battles, excellent music, great acting, with a glimmer of hope shining like a light in the darkness even when all seems lost-it is clear to me that there is simply no film that can bring the viewer so close to an experience of epicness and emotion like this one. Everything is weaved together so skillfully and beautifully, and those who love a great story filled with heroism, fantasy, (and even a little romance) with light triumphing over darkness in the end will be more than satisfied. This film deserved every single one of those eleven Academy Awards it won, and more!
10.0~Sublime On Every Level...With a Smidgeon of Forgiveable Excess jimkamm-3 Sign in Permalink What a spectacular conclusion to a trilogy that is at the same time groundbreaking, jawdropping, heartstopping, audience-winning and heartwarming. If you were blown away by the first two films, you ain't seen nothing yet. Yes, it's long at three and a half hours, but it delivers so copiously in both action and emotion that you let it wind down at the end. Because after so much battle and drama you'll need it. At the conclusion of "Schindler's List," we let Spielberg show the families in the long flower dedication, and we'll likewise allow director Peter Jackson a long denoument that is a fitting bow for an extraordinary adventure -- both off-screen and on. Can't wait for next year's DVD, so I can see the hour and a half that they actually cut!
9.0~Perfect end to a perfect series morganstephens512 Sign in Permalink What I liked 1. The acting was top notch 2. The effects hold up amazing today 3. The length really was not that bad despite 200 minutes 4. The book still matters in this movie which is very nice to know 5. The action is amazing too What I didn't like 1. The ending was a little bit dragged out Overall despite the one annoying flaw of the ending feeling like twenty years, this movie was a great send off to a great trilogy that I am very proud to say I am a fan of and while the Hobbit movies are not the best, this holds up and will always hold up
10.0~A breathtaking masterpiece. mbrennen Sign in Permalink The epic film that wowed the world and took over our imaginations in 2001, 2002 and now in 2003 has finally drawn to a close. Will the world ever be the same again? The action scenes are epic, yet the main focus is still on the relationships of the characters, a trait that is little seen in the special effects driven films of recent. The end will have tears in your eyes, but leaves you satisfied and upbeat. A totally astounding film, Peter Jackson and the cast and crew deserves a big thanks from the world for treating a much loved book with the kindness and affection it deserves and for bringing it to life in such a beautiful and amazing way. Is it the best film ever? Of course.
10.0~Perfect Film hoops92 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson created a masterpiece with this iconic piece cinema. Acting is superbly done especially Ian mckellan. Will always be the best film of all time.
10.0~Lord of the Rings trilogy brought to a brilliant close! general-melchett Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a huge financial success, and this one was easily the best. The battle sequences were better done than the ones in the previous two films, the characters were shown to have changed a lot since their first appearances in the Fellowship of the Ring, and it was generally a flawless film. Though it might take up half your day just watching it, I still recommend to people who haven't seen it that they watch this epic, record-breaking, breathtaking close to the Lord of the Rings trilogy! This film deserves all the Oscars it won, its place and rating on the IMDb and all the respect that it won its makers. A film to see before you die. 10/10
10.0~Absolutely Fantastic mwendel Sign in Permalink By far in my opinion the most accurate and true to the book movie of the three. While Stephen Jackson seemed to take a lot more liberty with the set-up for the climax in the first two book to film adaptations, the third played out marvelously. I was thrilled to see events unfold almost exactly how they played out in the book. I am sure that if someone was to over examine the final book, they might not be so thrilled. Either way, I loved this movie, more so than the first two. (I'm still saddened by the omission of Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wright scene.) I think when it comes to the look and feel of middle earth, its creatures, its peoples and landscape this film will be hard to ever approach if anyone in the next 100 years decided to do a re-make. A fantastic movie that everyone should go so, Lord of the Rings fan or not.
10.0~Great, breathtaking end for the trilogy. samili Sign in Permalink This was absolutely great ending for the story (as like I didn't know how it ends). I agree with local critics that even as lasting almost three and a half hours this movie is not complete. I really look forward to see the extended edition that will fulfill this movie experience :)
6.0~Great effects wasted by length of movie ashrkfn Sign in Permalink This would have gone down as one of the best movies ever in my book were it not for the fact that the editor forgot what it meant to "edit" a movie. I would like to see what actually made it to the cutting room floor. The scenes with Sam, Frodo, and Smeagol climbing the mountain seemed like they would never end. This should have been a 150-160 minute film.
10.0~The best aspect of `Return of the King' would be its emotion. ilovedolby Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's completed `Lord of the Rings Trilogy' is by far one of the finest trilogies in cinematic history. Moreover, its final film `The Return of the King' is possibly the best of the three. Why? We are so taken by the film's intensity from its epic battle scenes to the struggle of Frodo and Sam in their quest to rid the world of the ring. What plays out on the screen moves us and rouses us in ways that drive us to tears and applause during the final act. But the most saddening part for the moviegoer is that it is over. The film begins with the history of Gollum finding the ring and killing his friend Deagol for it. Then the films picks up where `The Two Towers' left off; a return to Rohan and the decision to help defend the last stronghold of men, Minas Tirith, from the dark lord Sauron. But the peril of the ring bearer deepens. Frodo and Sam move closer to Mount Doom every day with their guide Gollum. To be expected, Gollum still wants the ring for himself. He does this by pitting Frodo and Sam against each other because he knows that Sam does not trust him. As such, the journey grows darker for Frodo and Sam as mistrust develops, and the weight of the ring grows on Frodo. Between the last battle for Middle Earth at Minas Tirith, and struggle for Frodo to destroy the ring, `The Return of the King' guides the characters into challenges that were unheard of in its previous stories. What's more-an unforgettable ending. Naturally, one would expect the highest level of visual effects-we certainly get them. The battle at Minas Tirith is one of the grandest battle sequences ever put on celluloid, although it is only a visual effect. Armies of thousands upon thousands of orcs storm the city, while a group of riders on horses storm the army. The scene is amazing as we watch the men on horseback ride hard into battle. Their speed is amazing, as are their efforts at destroying the army. Furthermore, the design of Minas Tirith is exquisite. The creation of the city was two fold-partly built in a large quarry where the scene for Helms Deep was made for `The Two Towers.' Also, some of the shots were made out of a small model combined with computer generated visual effects. The end result gives such grand detail, that we can even see the weathering of the city's stone. The best aspect of `Return of the King' would be its emotion. The possibility of the death of Frodo or Sam will drive even the strongest person to tears. For me, the most memorable and heart wrenching scene is where Frodo has collapsed in Sam's arms as they climb up the side of Mount Doom. Sam tries to remind Frodo of memories of the Shire in spring, but Frodo's response is `I can't recall the taste of food, the sound of water, or the touch of grass.' It becomes ever clearer what Frodo is trying to save, home. Furthermore, it shows how fragile the things that we take for granted in life really are-warm days filled with sunlight, times with friends, and the beauty of nature. Although for some it may be difficult after such a long time sitting through the movie, stay through the end credits and listen to the beautiful song, `Into the West' performed by Annie Lennox. It is remarkably moving, as is the score by composer Howard Shore. ****
10.0~The culmination of the greatest triple movie endeavor of all time. davdwd Sign in Permalink By capturing the spirit of Tolkien's sweeping epic, previously considered "unfilmable", Peter Jackson produced a masterpiece beyond the powers of any other living director. This finale of the Lord of the Rings, especially in its extended DVD edition, interprets the book with astonishing detail, devotion, and delicacy. It fully deserves its clean-sweep of 11 Oscars. The production culture at Jackson's "Wellywood" studios represented something new for Hollywood. By empowering lovers of the film's source material, Jackson accepted the contributions of artists, sculptors, set designers, technicians, and actors who helped develop an organic approach to the film-making process. Jackson, although clear in his vision of the movie, proved himself the ultimate collaborator. By drawing together hundreds of talented individuals, he secured a quality of production previously unseen in regular studio settings where movie executives usually police the creative process. New Line are to be congratulated for taking a huge gamble that has given the world such a priceless legacy. Jackson is a genius and the love invested in Tolkien's work shines throughout the movie trilogy.
10.0~ROTK at times is so good that it is surreal rpersad Sign in Permalink Just now got back from seeing the entire LOTR TRILOGY in one amazing day. At times I felt like Frodo, wondering if I would ever make it to the end. But I always kept hope alive by reminding myself that the viewing of the third film was just hours away. That third film was the one they call The Return of the King, and by the end of it I had forgotten about the other two. My expectations were extremely high given how much I loved the first two films, and somehow ROTK managed to go beyond it all. What a beautiful movie from start to the end. It truley is as good as the other two films put together. Everything is better in this one: the acting, the music, the special effects. ROTK at times is so good that it is surreal. Its just great camera shot, after great line, after epic battle sequence, after incredible acting, and on and on until you feel like your floating. I can't believe I sat in a theatre for 13 hours. But then again, I spent it watching my all time favorite movie- the LOTR TRILOGY. Years from now, I'll be happily watching this one with my kids, showing them what a real movie in my day was all about. Bring on THE HOBBIT PJ! And THANKYOU for the joy that is LOTR on film.
10.0~Cool movie! sangeetha132001 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings movies made me really excited when I saw them. The best one was the third part. It was so great and everyone acted so well in it. It is a great movie and I recommend that every Lord of the Rings fan, fans of adventure/horror/fantasy movies must see this one. Never miss your opportunity to see this one! I had my eyes glued to the screen until the end of the movie. You can't just miss a single second of this movie and I'm not exaggerating. It really deserved all those 11 Oscar awards. I'm happy that it bagged almost all the awards. On some scenes I was in hysterics. They didn't spoil the story at all. I saw it two times, by the way. I wouldn't mind to see it once more...
10.0~The Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!! zgamer Sign in Permalink When I went to see the first LOTR, I didn't expect to like it. By now the trilogy is my favorite of all time (along with "Star Wars"). I remember going to see the third movie for my friend's birthday. It was packed with people and ready to make history for me. The movie is pretty much flawless. The actors were good, the story and dialogue was interesting and witty, and the visual effects were without a doubt phenomenal. Peter Jackson has provided me the ultimate mix of great story elements and some of the best fight scenes ever filmed. If I have any complaints, it would be that the actors could have done a bit better, especially Ian Mckellen, who earned an Academy nomination for his role. So to sum it up, this movie rules!
8.0~Hail to the King! sme_no_densetsu Sign in Permalink "The Return of the King", the third and final film in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, has two distinct story threads. One centres on Frodo, Sam & Gollum as they trek ever closer to Mount Doom while the other centres on the last stand of the humans of Middle Earth versus Sauron's army. Here the epic story ends in spectacular fashion with one of the most immense battles ever committed to celluloid. The cast is nearly unchanged from the previous film. Once again the actors deliver solid performances, even if no-one in particular is worth singling out. Thankfully, the script shows an improvement over the previous film. There are indeed changes and omissions, made necessary because of time constraints, but here they fit better with the elements of Tolkien's story that were retained. Once again Peter Jackson skillfully assembled an entertaining film, this time clocking in at nearly three and a half hours. It is worth noting that he managed to win a Best Director Oscar for his efforts. The film also won ten other Oscars, including Best Picture. This eleven-Oscar haul is a record shared with "Ben-Hur" & "Titanic", by the way. In the end, though, I still think that the first film in the trilogy is the best. In fact, I suspect that part of this film's Oscar success was due to the first film's unwarranted lack of recognition a couple of years earlier. However, it cannot be denied that the final installment is indeed a fine film in it's own right and worthy of the coveted Best Picture Oscar.
10.0~The Best of the Best Johnny_Pot_Pie Sign in Permalink I'm sorry to say that i haven't seen "The Godfather" series. But i am happy to say that i have seen all three of the Lord of the Ring movies. And the Return of the King, in my opinion, was the best movie I have ever seen. You see throughout the three movies the 4 Hobbits growing up. Considering the first movie when the were all excited about the adventures they were about to go on. Little did they know what kind of adventure they were in for. -SPOLIERS- My favorite part of the movie was at the end when they were back at the Shire sitting at the table in their local pub. Not talking, just pondering what they had just went through and how they could put their experiences into words. At least thats what i got out of it. Also, when they showed the map of the journey for the hobbits to travel from Gondor to the Shire, and how far away it really was. I honestly believe that the Hobbits from the Shire had no idea that they were so close to being overrun by evil. And i think thats another reason why they didn't say anything at the table. Would any of the other Hobbits believe what they went through? Did they know that we just saved them from sure destruction? How could you talk about it? I don't think you can. And it was all summed up by the look on the the 4 Hobbits faces. END SPOILERS It was fantasy come to life. A perfect film in my mind. Action, sorrow, anguish, pain, hate, love, desire, courage, determination, unconditional love,laughter, everything!! Its hard to put into words the fight scenes at Gondor. Just incredible. Mind blowing. If you haven't seen it, see it with a full house and see all the emotions on screen trickle down to the audience. 11/10. (aww so what.. sue me!)
10.0~Wow elfprincess08 Sign in Permalink Spoiler Anyone who believes they have seen a better movie is mad. This is the best book ever written and the way Jackson brought it to the screen made it even better, though at the time I didn't think that was possible. The Fellowship was great. It left out some good parts (Tom Bombadil and the barrow wright) but the special edition made up for the theatrical's shortcomings. If you haven't seen it, buy it. The most developed characters were Gandalf and Boromir(duh, when else would they have built him up?) The Two Towers took a lot of liberties and cut a lot out of the book but still was as long as the first. I loved all the interaction between Gimli and Legolas(ahhh........) Golum wasn't quite what I expected, he was a lot more human and that really freaked my out. I haven't seen the special ed. but I heard it was fabulous. Now, for the big one. The Return of the King surpassed even my highest expectations, and they were sky high. It made me mad that they left out the part with Aragorn finding the tree, the whole Shire incident, and the endi ng (Sam is supposed to get to come later!) but the rest of the movie made up for the cuts. The dead people are scarier than my English teacher. I absolutely hated the first scene though. It was just to weird and didn't flow correctly with the rest. They didn't develop the steward as much as they should have, but we got the impression from all his interactions with Farimir and Pippin. (Billy Boyd can sing!)Every scene that included Aragorn was awesome. He definetely deserves an Oscar. The battle of Pelinor Fields was a tad overdone but it was still wow. I loved Legolas's thing with the Oliphant. The blackouts towards the end of the movie were a bit odd. Overall, holy cow. For those who don't like it, I honestly think the reason is that you don't have any imagination at all, because that's what it takes to enjoy this movie. And those who were worried that the 2nd and 3rd wouldn't be as good because they were sequels-guess what? They aren't sequels! Tolkien wrote all of it as one book. ONE. It was divided for printing, but it is one story. The story of the one ring.
3.0~Mindless Dribble toxiccity Sign in Permalink From beginning to end I can sum this film up in two words, mindless dribble. It took me till the last scene of the film to realize that almost every scene in both The Two Towers and Return Of The King had been tragged on for much longer than it should have done, scenes that should take 2 minutes to watch take 10 minutes, in most scenes it consists of slow motion movement, special effects, and soft meaningless music. I couldn't believe the last 30 minutes of the film, I was actually thinking to myself what am I watching. I believe LOTR trilogy to be no different from the Matrix trilogy, a good start to a story but then in the sequels both films were packed jammed full of special effects, supposedly they thought that if they shoved enough special effects in that in would breath take the audience and maybe they wouldn't think too much about the story. I truly feel embarrassed for the people that have rated this movie in the same league as such real epics as Braveheart, Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. This may bring great controversy and I look forward to hearing your reply's. Feel free to contact me through my email address with your views.
2.0~battle scenes saves this movie for getting 1 out of 10 rwirtz Sign in Permalink This must be the most overrated and overhyped movie of this year. Too long, too boring, too sentimental and just too bad. The battle scenes and Gollem save this movie. The acting, and especially Elijah Wood's (even Keanu Reeves' plastic acting in The Matrix trilogy is better), is so bland and incredibly sub-par this movie indeed sets a new standard for epic films: dread. From the beginning I have told everyone who wanted to know that Frodo is portrayed as a total w***er and cry-baby and that the real hero in this series is Sam. OK, and Aragorn. No, I was glad to have seen it, because the natural sceneries are beautiful, but in my eyes this movie doesn't even deserve a rate higher than that of the other completely overrated movie sequel called T3. Give this one a miss and get the DVD so you can use the FFWD button!
10.0~The Greatest Movie Of All Time-Part 3 jerman13 Sign in Permalink For a 12-hour film, you'd be surprised by how quick it flies by. Exsposition and battles never seem to drag, and scenes where they cover great distances truly hold the weight of the travel. Perfect is probably the best way to describe Howard Shore's magical score to the film. Defining the tone brilliantly, whether it be ancient, dramatic, epic, courageous, horrific, dark, or simply inspiring, he nails it. He also pours much choir into his score, and if you listen carefully you can hear chanting in Tolkien's artificial languages that he created for Middle Earth. But no matter how well made the film is, it all comes down to the heart of the story, and this is where LOTR is truly unforgettable. Just try and not feel effected by such scenes as Frodo's departure, or his decision at the end of the film,, or such lines as: "I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!" or " I'm glad you're with me Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things." But I suppose the true message of the film is conveyed in Frodo's judgment of Gollum and his carefully deciding what he thinks is best. And also in a single conversation between Frodo and Gandalf about Gollum: Frodo mentions it was a pity Bilbo did not kill him when he had the chance. "Pity?" Gandalf says. "It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Don't be so quick to deal out death and judgment." Frodo then regrets the ring coming to him, and Gandalf encourages him. "So do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide, all you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you." So there you have it, interpret it how you will. So it is, that it would'not be a total exaggeration to call LOTR more than just a movie, but it leaps beyond that, to become an experience, a hazy dream that you hate to wake up from, a dark fairy tale with infinite morales to the story that are all yours to understand and interpret how you will. Or maybe it would'not be an overstatement to call LOTR the greatest film of all time. Or maybe it's more than that, maybe it offers a way of life. But thats your judgment to decide. Because of course, in the wise words first dreamed in Tolkien's mind, "All you have to decide, is what to do with the time that is given to you..."

10.0~BEST FILM OF THE YEAR *SPOILER ALERT*!!!!!!!!!!!!!! mnagoda Sign in Permalink So here we are at the end of all things. ROTK is the best of Jackson's LOTR trilogy. It was very very close to the books. Acting is superb. The only problem I had with it was Gandalf beating the snot out of Dethenor. It just seemed so out of character. Other than that, this is the year's best picture. Screw cold mountain and all that other americanized junk. This is the film that deserves best actor for Elijah Wood and Viggo Mortensen. Sean Astin so deserves best supporting actor as does the magnificent Andy Serkis and Ian Mckellen. It deserves best visual effects, best adapted screenplay and of course best director and best picture! IT IS PHENOMINAL. I loved it so much I cried twice. What you say? A man can cry during a film? Oh my god he must be gay! To all you homophobes out there I wanna say please grow up! If you haven't seen this film yet, please GO!!!!!!!!
10.0~Triple Header SoncoChairman Sign in Permalink I was one of the few thousand dorks that was lucky enough to attend the "Trilogy Tuesday" screenings yesterday where they showed the first two in their extended format followed by the national debut of the third. I went into the finale knowing that Return of the King had much to live up to. The first two are cemented pieces of film history. Does the third installment live up to the expectations? I would say for the most yes. There were definitely some issues that I had with it. The post-coronation scenes in the Shire and beyond were too drawn out. I'm not sure if my feelings around that are genuine or just because I had sat through nearly twelve hours of Lord of the Rings, but never the less last night I felt like the ending could have been shortened. My other problem with it was I felt the battle sequences at the end were too broad and left little room for small, detailed character moments minus the women's rights moment of course. As for positives, the part that I loved the most and still gives me chills to this moment was the way Gollum was brought up from being the third wheel to the prominent villain. Absolutely fantastic. Jackson made some great directorial decisions about how to make him such a creep, and just plain nuts. Kudos to him for that. One other thing I noticed was nearing the end I really discovered how much I cared for these characters, some of whom were introduced only in the second movie. I shared every emotion with them and that is not a common event these days when referring to the movies. My final thought is about a statement I heard before this movie came out about who really shined in the three films. I heard that Fellowship was Gandalf's movie, which I agree with. The Two Towers was Gollum's movie which I definitely agree with. The Return of the King was supposed to be Aragorn's movie... I disagree. This was Sam's movie. Out of all of the characters that shined in this movie (and they all did, cameo or not) Sam was the true star, he overcame so many obstacles and personal defeats in the film that it made him one of the true heroes. Overall I think it has elements to be the best in the series, but until I see again with a fresh mind (as opposed to seeing the previous two immediately beforehand) I have to give the trophy to the Two Towers.
5.0~When the initial gush dies down the massive flaws will become clear ... hosr2 Sign in Permalink Sorry folks, but this film is nowhere near as good as some gushing people on IMDB seem to think. I do notice more +ve comments in the US than the UK. OK, so the visual effects are good. So what? Jackson had the technology available to do that. He needs to do much more than employ them effectively to produce a film worthy of greatness. This isn't great, indeed it's barely good. The film is full of flaws. Important plotlines are absent, as noted by a few others here. To name but a few: the palantir cast by Wormtongue out of Orthanc in the book simply appears in the pool. This is absurd. It's the most valuable thing in the tower (as Gandalf tells Pippin in the book). This happens because Jackson has cut Saruman out entirely from film III. This is a terrible mistake. Having made so much of Saruman in I and II it just leaves a hole in III full of the unexplained. Jackson's error occurs because he should have put the full fall of Saruman at the end of II (as in the book). Eowyn's love for Aragorn is much stronger in the films than the book. The problem with this is that she simply stands idly by whilst Aragorn takes the limp character of Arwen to him. There is no development of the love between Eowyn and Faramic which in part answers the aforementioned in the book. Eowyn's slaying of the witch king of Angmar is one of the best moments of the book - a truly wondrous occurrence. In the film it is hacked in two halves whilst we await Aragorn's arrival by boat. Even the tossing of her golden hair is underplayed so much that it's anticlimactic for those of us who know the book well. Faramir's character is completely changed from the book. He now appears less nice than Boromir, which is deeply problematic and raises a major flaw in why he releases the ring from his grasp. Sorry everyone but much as I like Gollum he is little more than a CGI cartoon character. If you like computer games, fine. If you want a bit of realism, not. Am I alone in finding the slaying of the poor oliphaunt by Legolas sad? I felt sorry for the creature. the John Merrick style leader of the Orcs is one of the worst creature-creations I've seen Sam is awful. For those of you who like Sean Austin ... o dear. I think this may be a British / American thing. Some of those around me in the cinema started laughing at his toe-curlingly awful soppiness. Truly dreadful. The plausibly simple gardener of the book is now transformed into a college philosopher, and it's not a pretty spectacle. the moment when the hobbits appear to bounce over Frodo's bed is another soppy Jackson moment. Again, people in the cinema in London laughed at it. Even if Tolkien did intend a slight homosexual underplay to their relationships, I don't think he'd have admired Jackson heavy-handidness here. the scouring of the shire has gone altogether. Maybe that was right, but part of the whole point of this epic tale is that simple folk rise up against the mighty, and then have to confront that evil on their doorstep. the Shire is hideously twee, with not a petal out of place. Argh. If that's paradise give me the Emyn Muil any day! and finally, after more than 10 hours the demise of Sauron is dreadfully anti-climactic. The particularly silly portrayal of Sauron as a 1970's electrical storm-lamp is part of the problem here. Instead of personifying him, we have the demise of a 'thing' for which I felt no satisfaction at all. Dull. we then have to endure another 40 minutes as the movie drifts away into a confused ending, with a terrible prosthetic-Bilbo (looking like Salieri in Amadeus). If this wins an Oscar other than for special effects it will be a scandal. But then, since when has that mattered. Afterall, if Titanic can win them it shows that the appetite for drivel is unassuaged.
5.0~Slightly better than Two Towers, but that's not saying much ebossert Sign in Permalink I've seen this movie before, but remember almost nothing about it. I re-watched it and concluded that it had similar flaws to Two Towers, but here are some notes. --The film opens with two retards named Smeagol and Deagol. No, I'm not making this up. Deagol finds the ring in the river, then Smeagol kills him for it. I can't help but laugh while writing this. This is hokey stuff. --Sarumon inexplicably has no power anymore. Well, that's convenient. I guess that powerful wizard wasn't all that powerful after all. --And speaking of wizards, Gandalf is completely misused. So the scriptwriters (and/or novelist) use a contrived twist to bring him back to life in Two Towers, only to then use him for basic swordsman tasks. Isn't this guy some kind of powerful wizard? Why the hell does he spend almost all of his time riding horses, leading armies, and beating orcs over the head with his staff? Last time I checked, wizards use magic and cast spells. Gandalf is portrayed as a three-trick pony in terms of magic. He can summon eagles, exorcise kings, and make his staff glow. That's about it. If this guy had any real skills, he'd use powerful magic spells during the battles. Apparently, Gandalf is better at using blunt objects. They should have let this guy die in peace during Fellowship. --This film has the same boring filler material that Two Towers had. Again I ask, what do the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie? The humans sit around and prepare for war, which consists of putting on armor and walking or riding around. No battle strategies are discussed whatsoever. Why can't someone write some interesting dialogue for a change? All we get is banal, middling chit chat about honor and the coming fight. It's incredibly tedious stuff. --Okay, let's take a look at Gollum. Many reviewers (even those who dislike the film) think that he's a well-written character. I disagree. It's rather ironic that his "good guy" personality completely disappears early on in the film, which contradicts his persona that was defined in Two Towers. He's just purely evil and manipulative in Return of the King. So I ask, what was the point in giving him a split personality in Two Towers? I'll tell you: it was a cheap gimmick and a lazy way to create a character with fake complexity. Also, at this point I'm frankly getting sick of hearing him say "precious" every other sentence. This guy must be one of the most annoying characters ever created. --Frodo, Sam, and Gollum continue to walk through mostly gray environments, but there is a bit more color in Return of the King when compared to Two Towers. You see, there's a white castle in this one. That's a big step forward for Jackson. Maybe next time he can add a third color to the film's color scheme. --Liv Tyler still can't act. --Some super villain called the Witch-king is introduced. Not surprisingly, he barely gets any screen time. He also dies rather easily for being the most powerful of his kind. --So Aragorn attempts to recruit a ghost army. You'd think that would be difficult, but he waves his special sword around and they immediately follow him. Can't we make this stuff a bit more interesting? Some kind of test, riddle, or obstacle would have made the scene more memorable. --There's no additional character development for any of the characters in this movie. Even the newer douchebag character named Denethor is wafer thin. There's a scriptwriting contrivance where his son is delivered half-dead but Denethor thinks he's completely dead, so he commits suicide. This despite the fact that he heartlessly sent his son on the suicide mission to begin with. It's kinda stupid, actually. --The big battle ensues at Minas Tirith. At first it feels impersonal because it involves a lot of stock characters that no one cares about. Also, it's like a rehash of the Helm's Deep battle where hope is almost lost until reinforcements arrive. However, it gets more engaging as it moves along and there are some cool moments, like the giant elephants. Overall, I think it's a good battle. --We get a memorable moment when Sam fights the giant spider. Definitely one of the best scenes in the film. --One thing I've noticed is that the ring's effect on Frodo is very superficial. It seems to make him tired and physically exhausted, but there's nothing more to it than that. They may as well have had him transport a magical anvil or something instead. Same difference. I would have preferred something more interesting or psychologically deceptive. --The final hour is both predictable and dull. This film takes forever to end. It's simply not worth slugging through 200 minutes for only a small handful of good moments. This film won 11 Academy awards. One can only shake their head in disbelief. At heart this is a brainless action movie with thin melodrama masquerading as dramatic depth. Of the numerous awards, Return of the King won for Best Film Editing, which is hilarious.
6.0~Overkill kerangador Sign in Permalink I loved the first two movies. In fact, I liked Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers so much I watched them five times. Unfortunately, The Return of the King seemed a rather big overkill for me - it seemed too rushed - poorly edited - an overindulgent overkill. The scenes were all pretty epic in the book - but Jackson juiced it up too much. I didn't like the charge of the Riders of Rohan - it just looked so... fake for some reason. The scene when the Eye of Sauron topples over - was so laughable. I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I'm sorry. And to top it off - we get Annie Lennox singing that song at the end - I like Lennox - but I just found her version of this song lackluster. Goodness knows why ROTK scooped up all the Academy Awards. They should have given it all to FOTR instead.
10.0~may be the greatest epic of all time. evan3216 Sign in Permalink I went last night at 12:15 to see the movie (yes and they had tickets for 12:05 but were already sold out!!!) and walking out of the theater I felt as if I was there, in Middle Earth, the whole movie. I can not say enough about Peter Jackson's work on these three movies. If you have read the books then you may be disappointed about some parts of the movie, but overall there isn't much that is wrong with "Return of the King." When you combine the awesome (and extremely realistic) battle scenes with the emotion from Frodo and Sam's journey you get the best epic of my lifetime, and quite possibly these three movies may be the greatest epic of all time. I encourage anyone who enjoyed the first two to see it once, and then again. And even if you havent seen the first two go and see this movie because it will blow you out of your seat.
10.0~BEHOLD!!!! I HAVE SEEN THE RETURN OF THE KING. dark_elf02 Sign in Permalink Well I must say this movie is above anything I could have imagined no matter how high my expectations were. Managing to see a special screening of the most anticipated movie of the year, I realized about 20 min. in that I was in for the time of my life with this most exceptional movie. I just cant give enough praise to Peter Jackson for not making this another matrix revolutions. Which could have happened, but thanks to the dedication of so many people instead I truly see it as the best movie so far this year just ahead of The Last Samurai. What do both movies have in common with each other? Both are epics, both have unbelievable set designs, and both have excellent quality acting, but what makes rings even better is the sometimes happy, sometimes sad, and sometimes gut retchingly awful moments that truly bring tears to your eyes as various people die that you have become so close with during the last couple movies. If this movie does'nt win best picture, and best director along with at least 5 more awards i'll be extremely disappointed. This I believe is the movie that gives hollywood hope for the future!
10.0~Incredible matchutf Sign in Permalink Honestly if you haven't seen this movie yet why are you wasting your time reading reviews go watch it immediately. Granted it's been at least a year since I last watched the LOTR trilogy but I can still say without a doubt this is the best one of the three. In my opinion is was much more satisfying than the hobbit trilogy as well. Also you don't have to be a fan of fantasy or anything (which is unlikely in the age of GoT) to enjoy this movie, I guarantee anyone would enjoy this movie as long as they pay attention. Easily 10/10
10.0~The Return of the King GODDESSSSSSS LIKE VALINOR elwren Sign in Permalink I couden't even believe that there is happening.I watched it and my heart was bursting all the time.I thought that I'm gonna die. Especially when Frodo and Sam were on the screen.I coulden't say anything,I wanted to cry and I did.Poor Frodo when he lost his finger,that was a nightmare and everything was with Sam and Frodo BURSTING HEART.AND WHEN WAS THE END OF SAURON I thought that now came my end,because my FEELINGS were BURSTING OUT. The Battels were amazing,ACTORS were NOBLE,NATURE WAS VALINOR. All the time when I turning on music of RETURN OF THE KING I'm starting to cry and the FEELING OF BURSTING HEART RETURNING. I want to give the score of this movie a 10000000000000000000000000000000000 I DOOOOOOOOON'T have words I'M GONNA LIVE IN TOLKIEN WORLD IN REAL LIFE Tolkien's World Is Real
9.0~Great visual effects don't mean great movies. oskarft Sign in Permalink I has been a several years now since visual effects impressed the audience into marking a movie great. Since the computer generated effects for Jurassic Park in 1994, gradually it has become a standard for all movies. Even comedies now are expected to use respectable visual effects. Of course, now we are used to computer animations. The first Matrix had us drooling on the new 360 degrees visual effect. Now I don't think anyone is impressed by it. I think this is good. Because sometime after the start of this new millennium, big movie studio executives still think special effects will push a movie to the top in the box office. Not anymore. The Lord of the Rings is faithfully based on a master piece of literature. Tolkien dedicated a lifetime in creating this book. It would be great for a writer to continue on his work. To add-on the ages to after the Lord of the Rings. In conclusion, Definitely we have to expect great stories backed by great special effects, not the other way around.
10.0~For all those who don't like Fantasy.... lime_panda13 Sign in Permalink I remember when I used to not like Fantasy movies that much, I thought what most people think. Cheesy/unrealistic/weird/freaky...you get the point. When I saw the 1st film, I changed my mind! I found myslef not only liking it, but I loved it. The characters grow on you and they are oustanding in the last film, (Elijah Wood's performance of Frodo was particularly good.) These movies may seem childish to some people...but if you begin to accept it for all it's magic, battles, and creatures you see something else. This isn't just a bunch of fancy words with wizards and fairy-tale creatures....it's truly a wonderful story that is as real as anything. Do yourself a favor, watch these movies. You'll be glad you did because the last one is truly amazing. I've yet to see a better film, and I don't think I ever will.
5.0~I Feel Guilty for Being So UNIMPRESSED (small spoiler) LctnSct Sign in Permalink First of all, I do not consider myself one of those pompous "I've seen 30,000 films, and I know it all" reviewers, because I haven't, nor I don't. I went into this movie with the expectation of seeing the 4th greatest movie ever made (since that's were it currently ranks on IMDB)... perhaps that was my mistake. Never having read the books, NOR seeing the first two movies in the trilogy, I really don't think it should have been so EASY to guess what was coming up plotwise, as I did in 80% of the movie. I am not a screenwriter, so in a movie as epic as this, I really should not have been able to finish sentences that the characters were about to speak as well. And am I the only one who thought some of these "amazing" special effects were downright cheesy? *********************** SPOILER *************************************** Hobbits lying unconscious, surrounded by lava. Hmmmm. I wonder when their comrades are going to ride the eagles and carry them to safety... oh, there they are. What really made me roll my eyes (which I did A LOT, considering this movie was over 3 hours), is the effect of the eagle picking up the hobbits. This scene reminded me of Dorothy being carried away by winged monkeys. Over 60 years of movie-making later, and this still looked totally fake. *********************************************************************** Perhaps it would have been better if I had seen the previous two movies? No. It wasn't hard to figure out what was going on, which may or may not be a credit towards the movie. 5 out of 10
10.0~Best Book Adaptation bete-3 Sign in Permalink The film is great. I read all three books and Peter Jackson was very fair to the books. The cast was perfect and everything in the movies were perfect! It will be part of my DVD collection for sure. This is the type of movie that you watch over and over again and always find new interesting things in different scenes. Good job Peter and the cast!
8.0~not better than Godfather II teppertaylor Sign in Permalink Come on people, relax. This was a visually stunning movie, which beautifully portrayed middle earth. But please, #3 all time. The acting is average at best. Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood make me shutter every time they open their mouths. The best actor in this movie was Sean Astin, who thus far has gone unrecognized. This is a very good movie, I agree, but not the third best, and certainly not better than godfather II. Lets all take a deep breath, relax, and then rank it where it belongs.
10.0~Infinitely Stunning and Magnificent thndrjames Sign in Permalink ...this is my first review, and what a better way to start than with this film. Now I had read these books long ago, when I was a child, and having been so long, watching this was like a new experience for me. Every moment of the film, spent reliving images I had imagined through reading the books so long ago. Translated from word to film flawlessly, Return of the King is as infinitely stunning as it is magnificent. The characters we've all know so well (in some cases loved, few cases obsessed) perform even more elegantly in this final chapter. And of director Peter Jackson, who has truly created a cinematic masterpiece that will be awed over for generations of filmgoers to come. The highest praise, however, must indeed go to the mind of the late J.R.R Tokien, for whom his vision so long ago, truly did inspire the thousands involved throughout the filming process, and the millions of us who have embraced this epic.
10.0~I loved it! LAxGIRL2008 Sign in Permalink I loved it! I mean it is probably one of the best films i have seen. Okay, i admit that the ending kind of gets boring, but only the last 5 min. of it. I loved the battle scenes and all of the suspense. The thing that scared me the most is Gollum. He is really creepy in this movie. I also liked how it begins and how gollum gets the ring. It is soooo scary, but cool too.
10.0~A great, great conclusion to the trilogy. Cadian Sign in Permalink Having seen all three movies at my local cinema tonight (the last one starting at 00:01 sharp), I can only describe this film as pure eye-candy. It delivers from start to end with stunning battlescenes (a lot more than in the previous two movies), deeply involving characters and beautiful scenery. It takes a very special person to be able to enjoy a 3 1/2 hour movie after just having seen Fellowship... and Two Towers, but this was not a problem here. I have never seen an audience so stunned. 10 out of 10.
10.0~A movie of 10 that I recommend to all JothaHer Sign in Permalink The best film ever made, perfect plot, perfect characters, one of the best soundtracks in history, the wonderful scenery and photography, despite its long duration is not at all heavy, without any doubt, the best movie ever made
10.0~Why is Lord of the Rings the best trilogy of the world? bielborges-52686 Sign in Permalink There are many reasons to Lord of the rings to be the best trilogy, some of them is: It was written by Tolkin: Tolkin was( in my opinion) a genius, he created the most beautiful fantasy world and one of the most detailed (even more than I'd like); The movies are loyal to the books: Most of the trilogy was faithfully constructed of books, of course some details needed to be changed to make a good movie, but nothing too big.
10.0~Words fail me... bizkitprinzess Sign in Permalink I'm normaly an extremly articulate person, but this films brillance- all three of these films as one entity in my mind now, leaves me speachless. Only small imperfections bothered me, the audience bothered me more then anything in the movie could imagine bothering me. Aragorn, wasn't as prominent and proud as he was previously- but he was still a king.
8.0~Epic, Moving, Eye-Popping Conclusion To The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy ShootingShark Sign in Permalink Following on from The Two Towers, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings saga concludes as Frodo, Sam and Gollum near the end of their quest at Mount Doom, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli raise a spirit army and Gandalf and the men of Rohan fight to protect the ancient city of Minas Tirith from Sauron's monstrous orc army. Jackson's epic-to-end-all-epics comes to a breathtaking conclusion, maintaining the incredibly high standards set by the previous two movies in terms of its technical excellence and eye-popping imagery, but also heightening the dramatic intensity of the story and the characters to unprecedented levels. There is so much happening in this movie it is easy to get dumbstruck by the sheer visual excess (at least an hour of running-time is taken up with the Minas Tirith battle-scenes alone) but the movie is also filled with fine acting (particularly Wood, Astin, McKellen and Serkis) and many great heartfelt scenes - Faramir's disillusionment with his father, Theoden's death, Frodo's reunion with Gandalf, the return to Bag End. Like all great epics, the film is an incredibly intimate character study set against the grandest backdrop imaginable. Jackson has achieved a minor miracle; he has filmed an unfilmable book, and not only done it justice in emotional terms, but produced stunning visuals which convert Tolkien's fabulously imaginative and original prose into equally hypnotic and entrancing images. A classic film to end a classic movie trilogy, which will entertain generations to come.
10.0~Just beautiful ! [minor SPOILER] guybrush_threepwood-1 Sign in Permalink I like many movies, but there's only one that I really love. Because it's a so fantastic adventure, with so engaging characters. And I speak for the whole trilogy... But The Return of the King is different, because the journey ends, and there is so much emotion, and epic moments... When I saw it, I cried (a lot), I laughed, I had many thrills, it was just one of the best moments in my life ! For me, The Return of the King is the best movie ever done. I mean, when you see Theoden with 6000 horsemen screaming "DEATH" before the big fight, that beautiful discussion between Gandalf and Pippin in the middle of the battle, Frodon trying to climb mount doom with Howard Shore's fantastic music... you just know that you're watching a masterpiece. So thank you so much, Peter Jackson, J.R.R. Tolkien, and all the people involved in this great journey !!!
10.0~Lord of All Fantasy Movies madshell Sign in Permalink The final 3 hours of this impeccable saga do not let up from the action, the story, nor the message. Here, Peter Jackson lovingly captures all of J. R. R. Tolkein's themes and brilliantly weaves them together for an apocalyptic finish to top of the two most brilliant fantasy features in cinematic history. "Return of the King" is alive not only with the jaw-dropping effects of WETA workshops, but the superb acting skills of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Sean Aston, Elijah Wood, and Andy "Gollum" Serkis. The begining of the film gives Serkis a well-deserved cameo after being behind the animation of Gollum. In a flashback, Serkis is brilliant as the dumb, and greedy river dweller who murders his own brother for the power of the ring; greatly foreshadowing the events to occur in the Crack of Doom. Sean Aston takes the movie as Sam, who goes through all of fire and shadow, pain and passion to help his friend destroy the evil that has latched on to him. Samwise is like a Judas without flaw; we see him agonize over his actions, even as he is not guilty of any cruelty toward Frodo, but a victim of Gollum's madness. John Noble's Denethor, vile Steward of Minas Tirith, and father to Boromir and Faramir, makes one's skin crawl with both disgust and anger. Arrogant and full of judgement and accusations, he seems the most evil without even carrying a ring! Also, watch Miranda Otto's portrayal of Lady Eowyn as she and Merry slay the Nazguul witch-king. Her strength of character and sense of duty to her fallen king are breathtakingly played. All Tolkein's storyline are brilliantly tied up. We see our heroes and heroines return or re-begin their lives. Astonishingly beautiful filmmaking!
9.0~Good but not the best wereuat06-1 Sign in Permalink The long-awaited finale to the biggest movie franchise of the last two decades culminates in yet another excellent installment that more than delivers on its unending critical and commercial hype. "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" starts off right where the second film of the trilogy ("The Two Towers") finished. Two brave hobbits (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are nearing their final destination to destroy the most powerful ring of Middle Earth with the help of a crazed creature (played by Andy Serkis in a computer-generation mode) who continues to be the poster child for cinematic mood swings and psychiatric shortcomings. The ring has of course run Serkis mad and it remains unclear if the deranged beast will help or hinder in the end. Meanwhile the final battles for the vast landscape that is the franchise forms with Viggo Mortensen. Finally taking his rightful place as the king in spite of the fact that steward ruler John Noble has pretty much lost all sense of realism and sanity. He is distraught over the loss of his son (Sean Bean from the first film) and treats his other son (David Wenham) as a second-rate citizen. Of course Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies remain near Mortensen's side as the clock ticks to a possible Armageddon. Meanwhile hobbits Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have also reunited with Mortensen and the other aforementioned players, but once again it appears that their hearts may get in the way of their somewhat limited brain-power. As all this goes on Miranda Otto and uncle Bernard Hill also ready to help their allies in the war. The love story between Mortensen and Liv Tyler gets some key air-time as she chooses to give up her immortality for a chance to be with Mortensen. Tyler gets into a dilemma waiting for Mortensen just as father Hugo Weaving had foreseen. By the close of the film (and ultimately the series) the various story-lines all finally come together and we get to see what happens to each of these near legendary characters. "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" fits in really well with the first two installments, but the only complaint I had (and this is a relatively small shortcoming) was the somewhat difficult ending. Co-writer/director Peter Jackson just did not really seem to know how to end the movie so he used up lots of time (approximately 20 minutes) to carefully give homage and consideration to all his key players. All this neared an interminable state as the production runs a mind-blowing 200 minutes when 175 would have likely been more sufficient. Who can blame Jackson for a little indulgence with J.R.R. Tolkien's landmark novels though? A wonderful three-ring balancing act makes the whole series well worth the time, money and effort for all involved. Still not as good a trilogy as "The Godfather" group of films, but really "The Lord of the Rings" was everything it was supposed to be and so much more. 4.5 out of 5 stars.
3.0~Unbelievable bur_007 Sign in Permalink It had taken me quite a while to see the last part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and I must say I wish I'd never seen it at all. I started watching, thinking I would have myself a nice evening watching a good film. I had this feeling, because I had seen the first two parts several times each and both films had a good impact on me. The Return of the King however vanished those good thoughts of me regarding the first two films rapidly. I will now explain to you people why this film is the worst of the three and, in my opinion, the most overrated film in film history (it is assumed to be the #11 of all time). First of all I would like to point out that it is not the story I dislike. I've read the three books two times and that's quite unique considering the fact I've read about 10 books the last 10 years. And I'm not going to bring up the fact that the film doesn't really match the story told in the books. That doesn't bother me at all. I prefer films over books and I believe there's nothing wrong with bending the storyline a little bit to cut it short or make it possible to get on camera. Now let me get to the film. This has to be one of the most corny, fake and unnecessarily dramatic films ever. The acting was just too much and because of that not real. The music just made me laugh even harder. The way the film was brought to the viewer is another thing the makers shouldn't be too proud about. Almost every shot had that corny white glow over it, that made me just want to press STOP on my remote control. I didn't, because I liked the book so much and I wanted to see what Jackson did to the rest of the book. And last but not least the 'great' special effects and visual delight everybody seems to love. Really, put on some glasses, and if you already have them; buy better ones. Because your overwhelmed by the great story you're not paying attention to the crappy work with the blue screen. This especially comes forward when Frodo comes into play in the film (for example on mount doom). There are however, although very little, some things that I can't complain about. The battles are well made and Ian McKellen put on a good performance (because he didn't have to put on some sentimental scene). That however, is it. I don't think I'll ever watch the first two parts again, since I might be disappointed. And even though this film has a great story(/book) at its foundations, IMDb is a site for films and not books. And for a film, LOTR III did really bad...
10.0~Amazing! All i expected and more...(warning may contain spoilers) kicangel Sign in Permalink This has to be one of the greatest films i have ever seen. I loved it. I cried about seven times through it, laughed many more times, and spent the entire film wide eyed and amazed. The acting was fabulous, and in my opinion moving and captured the essence of the characters perfectly (esp Elijah Wood & Sean Astin). I know that a lot of people have been complaining that Orlando Bloom isn't in this film much, nor is John Rhys-Davis. But the film doesn't really need them, not in the way the other two did. The battles are fabulous and have well outshone Helms Deep. Shelob was scary, (at least i think it was for the arachnophobe who dug her nails into my arm when she was on the screen.) As a huge fan of the book (yeah it won the Big Read)i did notice the changes. In my opinion they were not unsatisfactory. For the film version they were perfect. I mean i wouldn't change one word in the book, but parts such as when both Pippen and Merry go to battle felt right and were very pleasing. I can see what people mean when they talk about the ending, with blacking to other scenes, but for my this only prolonged the suspense and happy ending feeling. It didn't ruin the film for me, but maybe that's because i've read the book. The only fault is a small one, and a personal one, I would have liked to have seen the blooming of love between Faramir and Eowyn - it's not a big thing, and doesn't ruin the film, but unless you've read the book it goes from one set of circumstances for them, to another. Overall i found this the greatest film i have seen, maybe even ever. All i can say is that if what Peter Jackson took out is half as good as what he left in, then i cannot wait for the Extended DVD! Go see it, or miss out on a cinematic masterpiece. (PS - I hear that this has missed out on the a big hunk of hype and nominations to Cold Mountain. Oh i do wonder why so very much!)
10.0~The Supreme Motion Picture of All Time... fearfulofspiders Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is by far the most moving, inspirational and epic of the three parts in Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece. After proving that this trilogy can carry the weight of a truly enormous body of text with The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Jackson has shown that nothing is impossible anymore when being brought to film, and that fantasy can be surreal, but grounded to reality. I saw this film at 8:00 PM, and missed school the following day -- exactly similar to The Two Towers when it was released. After seeing The Return of the King I was speechless. Never before had a film made such an impact on me as this conclusion did, and now with it completed, The Lord of the Rings is truly the best of the best. Jackson has treated this trilogy as one film, following to Tolkien's linear time-line, and not the way the books were written, which makes this a film that flows and never loses track of pacing. The dialogue is emotional, be it the speech between Gandalf and Pippin before the gates of Minas Tirith, or inspirational, such as the rousing deliveries by Theoden and Aragorn. The vast emotion makes this a film for the ages. Following our heroes adventure since film one, we have grown compassion for each and everyone of them. Sam's devotion to Frodo is something that can inspire, and the eu-catastrophe is fully used here once again, because just as it seems that all hope has been lost, it shines through the void and victory is achieved. If one were to fear that the ending would feel like there was no closure, then have none, because The Return of the King has a 20-minute denouement that goes as far as four-years into the future, and the ending on the shores of the Grey Havens brought me to tears. The special effects are nothing short of amazing. The blend of miniatures/bigatures and CGI is believable beyond comprehension, and the addition of New Zealand locales adds something beyond some peoples' wildest dreams. The level of detail on Minas Tirith is something no one has ever seen before, the massive armies sunder speakers as war erupts, and we see the Mumakil and the Fell Beasts in full fruition, as hinted in The Two Towers. What could've seem fatal, as cinematic history has shown before, is the introduction of Shelob the spider. The special effects team has created the most memorable spider in film history. She terrifies and drops jaws at the realism of such a beast. The tension for the siege on Minas Tirith is so highly anticipated, that the filmmakers have completely satisfied every expectation to how epic it could've been. The scope is just extraordinary. The battle of the Pelennor Fields is so huge in the book, yet it has been fully realized in Jackson's film. The final stand at the Black Gate is so emotional involving, it's hard to think that any action could top what was previously seen, but it is done so with vision beyond imagination. Howard Shore's music is also some of the most impressive and beautiful orchestration ever done for film. Besting its predecessors, The Return of the King's score is pure genius. From the new theme for Gondor, to the moving Into the West, Shore's composition sweeps and soars. Now that each of the three films' complete recordings have been released, I strongly urge a fan of the music to buy them, because they really are the best of the best. The acting even surpasses the first two, having the evolution of each character add to the dramatic effect, be it the loss of a life, or the triumph over evil. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is like a Godsend. Sean Astin steals nearly every scene he is in as Sam, making us hope he helps Frodo get rid of the Ring of Power. Once again, Andy Serkis provides a stirring and great performance as Smeagol/Gollum. The full weight of the Ring is realized in this film, and Elijah Wood makes us see his struggle like the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers only hinted upon. Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is remarkable. The battles are amazing, never making the film drag, and always heightening the tension. From the acting to the sound editing, this film delivers in what it promises, and that is the supreme motion picture of our lifetime, and many more years to come.
10.0~Much that is beautiful is passing away (NO spoilers...promise) peterhamm Sign in Permalink I was sure that this movie was not capable of "getting me there" as much as FOTR did that first magical time I went in and saw Middle Earth on the big screen. I mean let's face it. when I went in to the theater for FOTR that opening night, I had been waiting for more than half my life to see realized on screen what I think is one of the greatest 2 or 3 works of fiction ever written, and the "funnest to read", ever. I was wrong. There is a sublime sadness at the end of reading the ROTK book, both in the storyline and in the fact that, as you are reading it, you realize with shock and disbelief that you are running out or pages. (Thank God for Appendices and The Silmarillion - which could be made into several movies, btw...) This sadness creeps into the movie with the same basic characteristics. Much that was noble and beautiful in Middle Earth is passing away with the defeat of Sauron, and much that was beautiful in going to the movies is passing away minute by minute, because there won't be another movie next Christmas. In that regards, Peter Jackson has succeeded so well that whatever they are paying him for these, they oughtta double it. Don't get me wrong. It's not "too short". It's length is perfect. (although I secretly hope they add like 2 or 3 hours to the Extended Edition next November...) We can guess which scenes might be extended next November from time to time, but that's a good thing too. We can almost get one more year out of this sublime magic. Yes, the FX are awesome, the music great, the cinematography and editing and "look" are first rate. But the great news is that the star of this movie is the story, the script, and the characters. Andy Serkis, Sean Astin, and especially Bernard Hill give the performances of a lifetime. Unlike TTT, which although wonderful, was dominated by the character of Gollum (in terms of acting performance) there's plenty of great character development and unforgettable performances to go around. And unlike FOTR, which tried to spread that character development as evenly as possible, Jackson here focuses in on some more than others... in a GREAT way. Some characters, you realize as you watch, are "done" enough that you don't need much more on them. Others, who we want to see grow into the heroes we remember from the book, we watch grow to our delight and astonishment. Delightfully, we get occasional bouts of "book-fan" moments, where a detail that we hoped would make it to the screen jumps out at us, and almost more delightfully (no doubt to the consternation of so-called purists* who are still upset that we haven't seen Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel, and that we haven't heard names of everybody in 3 or 4 different languages - get a clue), Jackson takes the perfect amount of liberties with the story to make the characters interesting for those of us who know it. Let's face it, when we go to the movies, we want to be surprised. We want to approach moments not knowing exactly what is going to happen, even though, from the text's perspective, we do. In short, FOTR was perfect, and TTT, although great, was, as a middle chapter is doomed to be, not quite the same experience (although necessary to get to this point). But if FOTR was perfect, I need a new word to describe this film. Years ago I watched, over four nights, the entire Cycle of "The Ring of the Niebelung" by Richard Wagner. It's a long and ponderous opera (15 or 16 hours!) but when you get to the end, the musical, theatrical, and emotional payoff is HUGE! That cycle basically, in a mythological framework, starts with the beginning of the world, and ends with the end of it. This film is like that. I'm afraid I've been ruined for movies... *By the same token, a "purist" for apples might bet upset that oranges taste... not apple-ish enough. Attention "Purists": A movie and a book are two different things! Go ye and findeth a life!
9.0~Tried Way Too Hard To Be Profound rbueing Sign in Permalink The high rating of this movie baffles me. While it had superb special effects and above average acting, it failed miserably in telling the story. I was extremely disappointed. I adored the first film in the trilogy, understanding that you cannot include everything in a movie that is in a book. The second film was also excellent, although it began to try too hard to be important and profound. This last installment was intensely boring at times as it strived to be profound. This could have been a great movie, as it so often depicted scenes according to my imagination. Unfortunately, while describing the world it lost the essence of the story. The movie seemed to lose its way not only with pace, but with its heart. This marvelous story of extraordinary effort by the gifted and those less so to face head on an evil of incredible proportions went astray at too many crucial points. Granted it hit the mark in places, but it in others it almost seemed to take the credit from the valiant and place it solely on supernatural and circumstance.
10.0~The greatest epic film ever raverdyke Sign in Permalink I didn't think Fellowship of the Ring could live up to the hype. It did. I didn't think Return of the King could be better than the first two. It was. For my money, Return of the King is the greatest epic fantasy film of all time. Fantastic. Amazing. There are not enough superlatives to describe it.
10.0~Wow. (****) Ronin47 Sign in Permalink I really liked "The Fellowship Of The Ring" back in 2001, but was slightly disappointed in "The Two Towers" the following year. I liked it, but compared to the first one it felt a little ho-hum. Not as enthralling an experience. My point is that I'm hardly a "Lord Of The Rings" geek, so I approached this third and final installment expecting it to be pretty good, but not expecting it to blow me out of my chair. Which it did. One of the most thrilling and breathtaking experiences I've ever had in a movie theater, "The Return Of The King" may be the most important film I've ever seen to SEE ON A BIG SCREEN. It is an indescribable feeling to be immersed so thoroughly in director Peter Jackson's vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's richly imagined land of Middle Earth. There are many sights in this film (many involving the fantastical Minas Tirith, City Of Kings) that are truly astounding. Even details like the ever-present mountains and misty, gray clouds in the background are a spectacular sight on that big screen. The story continues. Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), and the tormented, scheming creature Gollum are on their way to Mount Doom to finally destroy the cursed ring. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) must defend Minas Tirith against a final onslaught of hundreds of thousands of Orcs. This time, Astin's heroic Sam and fellow Hobbit benchwarmer character Pippin (Billy Boyd) actually have stuff to contribute to the story, as Sam steps up, surprisingly, to be one of the saga's most admirable heroes. And who knew Sean Astin had such a brilliant performance in him? There is amazing cinematography, a HUGE and beautiful score to go with it, probably the best (certainly the biggest and most breathtakingly visualized) battle sequence ever filmed, a terrifying giant spider, characters dangling by their fingertips from huge heights, resonant themes of love and honor and death... Basically everything you could possibly want in an epic adventure. And then some.
7.0~What's up with this Arwen chick? bert-102 Sign in Permalink First things first, the movie is good. It's nowhere near as good as it should have been, considering the effort that went into making it, but it's still a good movie. --Possible SPOILERS: PJ: "Let's throw in another scene with Arwen. Oh! I know, I know, we'll have her with a quivering lip, and then she'll sigh, and then a tear can roll down her cheek..." Editor: "OK, but we'll have to cut the scene where Gandalf meets the Witch King..." --later-- PJ: "Let's throw in another scene with Arwen. Oh! I know, I know, we'll have her with a quivering lip, and then she'll sigh, and then a tear can roll down her cheek..." Editor: "OK, but Saruman and Wormtongue will end up on the cutting room floor..." --later-- PJ: "Let's throw in another scene with Arwen. Oh! I know, I know, we'll have her with a quivering lip, and then she'll sigh, and then a tear can roll down her cheek..." Editor: "OK, but the Mouth of Sauron will have to go..." --later-- PJ: "Let's throw in another scene with Arwen. Oh! I know, I know, we'll have her with a quivering lip, and then she'll sigh, and then a tear can roll down her cheek..." Editor: "OK, there go the Houses of Healing, snip snip..." PJ: "But you can never have enough Liv Tyler...can you? Would you just look at those *****" Good movie, though, and NO, the Mumakil do NOT look like AT Walkers. George Lucas used the LOTR trilogy well for inspiration.
10.0~LOTR: CLASSIC, CLASSIC, CLASSIC melissa_ramos Sign in Permalink I knew it would be good, but this takes the entire cake. Peter Jackson has absolutely outdone himself with this masterpiece. True, there are a few tiny holes in the plot, but they are easily overlooked. Even if you're not a huge fan of Tolkien, you should really make an attempt to see this movie. I wasn't a fan of the books, but Jackson's movies have inspired me to pick them up and give them all a good read. Can't wait for the DVD. Let's see if Jackson does as good a job with The Hobbit.
10.0~Completes the trilogy in fine style jrarichards Sign in Permalink The fact that this film has over 3000 reviews speaks volumes, and it is hard to know what to add that might not already have been said. Unlike at the time of release, we now have the luxury of lining up the three parts of the film and watching them through. While this is hard to achieve at one sitting, a "watchathon" with some breaks still does the job as it was meant to be done - with the necessary continuity. The first thing to note after that is that this is not our world. While at the very start of "The Hobbit" (the book), JRR Tolkien seems to toy with the suggestion that the people ("men") in his book are like us, while hobbits are small beings that hide away from the likes of us, he clearly drops this concept further on in the same book, let alone in LOTR. So Tolkien's achievement - and the challenge for Peter Jackson - was to put on screen a whole new world in which we are observers, but not in any even remote sense participants. This is of some relevance, given the detachment needed to see the pure evil of Sauron for what it is, to go along with orcs and others being irredeemable cannon-fodder, and to accept the immortality of elves and the lengthy lifespans of the other species on show here (let alone the presence of a host of other beasts more or less supernatural and otherwise implausible). This is precisely what Jackson does achieve, and it is a triumph. And since LOTR is a portrayal of a last stand of "the West", it is somehow fitting and touching that the 3 films are primarily the achievement of a mix of New Zealanders, Australians, Brits and Americans; and it might reasonably be argued that, whatever the cultural future of our world, "the West" (and even perhaps its Anglo-Saxon sub-component) reached some kind of artistic zenith in this simply outstanding epic. Given that LOTR screenings overlapped with those of (the very British if American-funded) Harry Potter, these were rich times indeed for lovers of lengthy literary sagas entirely incapable of being turned into films and yet somehow being turned into films, even with some aplomb. They were also "rich" in the literal sense, given the unparalleled, if deserved, lucrativeness of both of these genres. But LOTR still stands a little above even this high-class fray, and most especially on its design side. The presentations of the civilisations and architecture and art and clothing of the Shire, of Rohan, of Gondor, of the Elves, of the Dwarfs and of Mordor are outstanding and indeed near-miraculous (as literally they need to be). The level of detail is just mind-blowing and at times gulp-making in its audacity, love and care. One sign of the alien-ness of Middle Earth, in the books and now also on film, is the way it defies time-period classification. While The Shire might even look 18th-century, Minas Tirith seems more like Mediaeval times and the Riders of Rohan even somehow late Dark Ages... Again while Hobbiton would seem familiar (to Britons especially) and has a measure of technological development, a rather Star-Warslike twist (though Middle Earth of course came first!!!) has all remaining technology in the hands of the bad guys and compiled together with magic (either that of Saruman or that of Sauron). This effect from the books also makes it through to the screen... Tolkien reflected these differences in having Baggins and co. talk in rather everyday language about things like pocket handkerchiefs, umbrellas, hedge-cutting and dishcloths (and even tobacco), while the speech of Galadriel, Elrond, Denethor and so on is far more lofty and high-register. Again the film deals with this, though to the extent that actors occasionally look a little uncomfortable delivering their lines. Frodo-Sam-Gollum interactions (for Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and an ecstatically-good Andy Serkis) are at their best when tinged with grumpiness or humour (references to "fish and chips" most especially), but they come close to indigestible overdose (as well as perhaps a touch of homoeroticism?) when turning to subjects more wistful. Admittedly, the lack of American accents in both Frodo and Sam is an achievement not equalled in most previous films, though it maybe happens at some cost to the delivery not apparent when native Brit Ian Holm offers his splendid portrayal of the ageing if ring-preserved Uncle Bilbo. Interestingly, Gandalf (here played memorably by Sir Ian McKellen) bridges these two worlds (as in the books), being a bringer of fireworks from The Shire's point of view, while also being a mighty wizard monarch in the story's later stages. He talks appropriately for both of these worlds! Minor issues like the above with the lines matter not to the great (and quite regularly tear-inducing) sweep of the tale; and to the joy of seeing many characters like Elrond, Theoden, Denethor, Aragorn, Arwen and Galadriel made convincing on-screen flesh thanks (respectively) to Hugo Weaving, Bernard Hill, John Noble, Viggo Mortensen (special plaudits to him), Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett. Normally, a galaxy of stars such as this might overwhelm a film, but such is the epic scale of these movies that they represent just tiny parts of a whole presented with such great wisdom against spectacular New Zealand backgrounds. These locations were the choice of genius, and genius makes its presence felt regularly enough here. Of course, that is the genius of Tolkien, but it is also the genius of Jackson and (immense) team, who never pretended they could convey every element of a story running into thousands of pages, but nevertheless surpass themselves in managing to achieve so very much. Those lucky enough to have never seen these films are thus advised to do so, whether or not fantasy is normally their kind of thing.
10.0~When celluloid can make you cry (minor spoilers ahead) r_amerigo_t Sign in Permalink I just got home from watching The Return of the King, and during my way back home I started to think about writing a small comment in this web for my very first time. After all, if this movie didn't make me do it, which one would do? So here I am, and... Wow!!! Just can't think of a way to start. Sometimes a certain film can have the ability of making you cry. Or feel sad. Or smile for pure joy. Or fall in love with the actors/actresses. Well, this one has it all, plus it made me feel fortunate enough for having been able to watch the three installments as they came out each year. The Return of the King has made me a truly believer that The Lord of the Rings is the greatest movie trilogy of all time (far better than Star Wars double trilogy and The Godfather one) because it tells you a story so pure, so fond that reaches the deepest corners of your heart. There is love, fear, happiness... thrills abound (actually they never stop) making the movie a gift to human senses. While The Fellowship of the Ring was so intimist and heart touching (with so many samples of love and friendship in The Shire and beyond) and The Two Towers was filled with wild encounters and war (Helm's Deep, Isengard's trashing by the Ents...), ROTK is a fine mix of both; with the Battle for Minas Tirith being astonishing and some other moments full of fondness, camaraderie and friendship (thanks in large part to Samwise and Eowyn, although everybody contributes). The acting is wonderful. Kudos to Sean Astin, his interpretation of Samwise is sublime. This character is so strong and self determined he almost ends up leading Frodo and the ring to meet its destiny. He is courage personified. Also, Mortensen's Aragorn is so powerful that one tends to think nobody on earth could have done a better job. Wood is great as Frodo, and Merry & Pippin are also portrayed with mastery. By the way McKellen is just Gandalf as we all thought he was while reading the books. Filming is great, photograph incredible, special effects awesome. And I would like to say that the so called "flaw" of having five or six different finals doesn't seem even a flaw to me. There could not be a different ending for such a mastery of an epic that this trilogy is than having six different finals. Plus, they're no different... they just unleash into each other and, oh man, how nice and touching they are! I just hope for two things right now. The first one being to go again to watch this masterpiece as soon as I can. The second one, pray for Peter Jackson to make The Hobbit's big screen version. Thank you PJ for such a gem!! My verdict: 10 out of 10 (**********)
1.0~It makes me angry thinking about this film. leviticusrosemary Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson, who is talented at one thing, and one thing only, SPECTACLE, finishes his hugely successful trilogy. I'm so glad this less-than-mediocre hack was given the job of writing and directing the film adaptations of the some of the best written fantasy literature ever. The innacuracy of the story, shoddy pacing, inconsistent characterization via POORLY written dialogue, and hugely misunderstood character relationships and statuses are the largest sins committed in this film. But the problem goes deeper. This is just another in a long line of films quite nicely summed up by the word blockbuster, and quite nicely critiqued by the TRIO (may it RIP) documentary "The Blockbuster Imperative," in which the course of popular culture is outlined as a quest for and to quench the thirst for EXCITEMENT rather than enrichment. Thank you Peter Jackson for shitting on the world. You are so over-rated it hurts me, and your movies will NEVER stand the test of time.
10.0~'Dedicated' to the haters thanos999 Sign in Permalink Before i wrote this review i was reading the reviews of the so-called ''haters'' and i couldn't stand it any more i wanted to answer to their words immediately.So this is for them.... I understand that nobody likes the same things but i think there is a limit to this rule and this movie is one of the limits.I could easily accept 10-30 very bad reviews but there are more than a hundred for this movie ,yes i'm speaking the truth, i surely do....There are so many people that hate this movie and that's a fact just read their own reviews.But, i am not going to criticize them, because it would be pointless... i am going to set the facts for this movie no... i am not going neither congratulate anybody nor say my opinion ...i just want to be clear... crystal clear. This movie is a mixture of emotions sadness,hope,despair,happiness,pain,sorrow,hatred,love.......and it goes on....like a poem. This movie refers to the reality through fantasy and it is a propaganda against the war just like the books of Tolkien and that is because in this movie you can easily distinguish peace and love from war and pain if you want it. This movie gives people to understand that nobody is perfect but this must not make us give up the 'fight', whatever the fight is.Everybody makes mistakes but after he falls to the ground he must rise up again and continue ...that's what frodo,sam,bilbo and of course boromir did.I am not trying to enlarge the meanings of the movie after all it is just a movie but the kind of movie that pushes ourselves a little more than others. I think that Tolkien would have loved the try that this movie made to express what he did....a masterpiece,if you excuse me, and an inheritance to everyone. Finally, i want to close this message with one more thing that many haters talked about and that is the difference between the characters in the film...........or maybe...yes...better say nothing...just see the movie dear 'haters'.
9.0~very good, but the extended version will be even better pagblonk Sign in Permalink First of all I'd like to tell that I believed for many years that the epic story by Tolkien would be very hard, if not impossible, to be transferred into a movie. Well, I think we can all agree that Peter Jackson has successfully done just that. He owes a lot to his script writer. I was quite stunned by part three. After I had seen part two, I just couldn't believe myself when I heard myself say that part two was better than part one. Well, part three is even better than part two, save the best for last. Still, I did not award this part with 10 points. It is very good, but it is not excellent, that is due to the fact that Jackson has totally changed the ending of the book, the scenes in which Saruman has taken over control in the Shire. This, and the fact that I didn't like Jackson's interpretation of the Arwyn/Aragorn/Eowyn love triangle, made me award this part with 9 out of 10 points. If we look at all other scenes, we have to admit that it is overwhelming, certainly from a camera point of view. The thing I liked best was the city of Minas Tirith and, of course, the battle scenes. And please let's not forget Shelob. She was really convincing. I'd like to conclude with this; I was really upset when I read that the Saruman scene (in which he dies) had been cut out. Well, we'll just have to wait for the extended version, and then enjoy the whole story again, and again and again...
10.0~Words cannot describe... vader-23 Sign in Permalink LOTR:ROTK is without a doubt the BEST movie I have ever seen. It transcends all genre's, before and after, to permanently leave it's timeless mark just as Tolkien's masterpiece has done. From concept to completion this movie takes all the elements of film and places them at the pinnacle of the filmaking mountaintop. From characters to costumes, acting to cinematography, sound to editing, CGI (find a better use of SEAMLESS CGI on the market today) to screenplay, oh and music, it is hard to point to another movie that weaves all this together into a timeless masterpiece! I even cried 3 times and had to hold back about 4 more. Kudos to Mr. Jackson and the entire cast and crew for filling my soul and mind with the visions and feelings that transcend life itself and dig deep to where many films fail to plant their seed...the soul.
10.0~The Best Ever Trilogy adolfww Sign in Permalink Wow Wow Wow The Best Trilogy Ever Maybe by The Genius Peter Jackson. Great Acting Great Directing and This is Goddamn Awesome. Maybe The last Movie Won Every Awards that Nominated
6.0~Better, but... jgarrick Sign in Permalink The conventional wisdom that this is the best of the three is certainly true, but I still can't call this a great movie. Just like the others in the series, there's lots of style but just not much story. And also just like the others, it's a three hour movie that would have made a better two hour movie. The FX are remarkable, but the characters for me are still just not all that interesting. I'm not sure how it was accomplished, but Jackson managed to put over nine hours on film without creating characters I cared about (with the exception of a modest amount of sympathy for the long-suffering Sam). I enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure flicks, but watching this for me was more like an endurance test than a three hour escape into fantasy. I'm sure lots of Tolkien fans out there are going to be deeply offended, but I'm afraid there are some of us that don't find the stories all that gripping.
10.0~Great! vojvoda Sign in Permalink For all those who are trying to diminish the quality and the excellence of the entire LotR trilogy, just because they're stupid or misguided : know that this IS A NEARLY IDEAL WAY of transfering Tolkien's work to a movie. In order to mention all the characters and events, The Silmarillion and The Hobbit need to be filmed, and the entire project needs to last at least 40 hours. So don't just say that it sucks,think about it. The trilogy is one of the best in the history of film making,next to Star Wars,The Godfather & Indiana Jones. So, if there are opposite opinions, please post them, and provide a good explanation why do you think it sucks.
10.0~A Stunning Finale -628 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson was right: this is the best movie of the series - and that is saying something because The Two Towers was superb. The correct genre for the Lord of the Rings series is horror/fantasy and never before has horror or fantasy been attempted on such a grand scale. The scenery is stunning, the action sequences spectacular, the horror superbly done. There is some humour, a perfectly blended music score and, of course, computer imaging without peer. The character of Gollum/Smeagol is one of the great achievements in cinema history and the battle scenes pure genius. Need I say more: this is one of the cinema's true masterpieces, a stunning finale to a superb series.
8.0~Was it just me or where you glad this thing was over? drumsolodub Sign in Permalink Unlike other serial movies this was by far the best IMHO. But I sure was glad that last ring hit the molten lava. Whew, whatever you do don't buy a large soda before sitting down, this is one long adventure. I must be honest I was getting tired of Frodo and his malingering or maybe I was just tired of Elijah Wood. Gollum hung around way too long, like a mosquito at a picnic. And what's with the spider? I know she was in the book but it was sort of "cheesey" in a "Lost in Space" kind of way. "Danger, danger Will Robinson!" You get my drift? BTW, Hugo, Neo called and he wants his sunglasses back! Bravo to Jackson and his wonderful direction. 8/10
4.0~I can't believe that this movie is rated as one of the best movies ever! vonky Sign in Permalink I can't believe that this movie is rated as one of the best movies ever! I have never seen worse actors since Hercules in New York. The first 45 Minutes I was nearly sleeping and so the last half hour. The end, when they started laughing around Frodo was declamatory. Please, don't put that movie in the same drawer with the Godfather, Casablanca, Il buono, il brutto e il cattivo etc. I understand that many love the story behind the movie and that the settings are great, but that should not be all for a great movie. Since I read the book I know there are also some parts missing or different, but thats comprehensible. I rated it with 4 since the battle scenes and the setting are the only valuable thing.
6.0~Not as good as people wants to believe it is thedragsterwave Sign in Permalink Why is this movie so high in the IMDb rating ? Well, I guess, many people did (and still do) not want to see the project of one of the greatest book put on screen going lower than the top 10 spot. However, when you put aside the gigantism of the project, the special effects and the book itself (otherwise said: when you will watch it on a small TV screen 3 years from now) then some of the magic of this movie vanish. Acting is one the main critics we can make. Vigo Mortensen has not enough Charisma to be a "king". He looks most of the time like a dummy fallen from the planet Mars not knowing what to do. Every major movies have one or more strong and Charismatic actors: i.e. Al Pacino (with Robert and Marlon) in the godfather series, Henry Fonda in Once upon a time in the west, Jack Nicholson in one flew over a cuckoo' nest, etc... In the Lord of the ring series, I do not believe there is one actor up to that level of excellence. Sean Austin is badly crying for the all movie. You can see when Peter Jackson told Ian McKellen to smile in front of the camera (ready to smile Ian, aaaand action...1 second, 2 sec., 3 sec. Cuuut. OK thanks Ian Next scene please quick) . That's maybe the reason, Peter Jackson wanted to be so close from the book and had so many things to shoot that he did not leave actors a chance the really enter into their characters. Than let's talk about the end. That part really ruined the movie. I had the impression we were in a Santa Barbara episode. Everything was beautiful and blurry in slow motion and nothing is really happening for a least the last 20 minutes. That was a bad ending for an overall decent and entertaining movie. 7/10 for Peter Jackson who had a lot of courage anyway. But I guess it is the same for every filmmaker. Overall it is a decent movie.
10.0~Return of the Mortensen OrlandoBloomrulz Sign in Permalink This movie i feel is better (much) than 1 and 2 combined (as Elijah says on the Two Towers DVD) And it is so emotional i felt like crying at the end of it!!!! (which i am sure lots of other people did to). My favourite bit is when Legolas kills the mumakil and slides down it's trunk really smoothly making it look easy!!! ("that still only counts as one!!!"- Gimli)But then main part of the movie has got to be at the end at mount doom with Frodo Sam and Gollum (+ Smeagol!!) but the best bits for me have got to be the battles... Pellenor fields makes Helms Deep look like a scuffel down the cabbab shop!!!! ha ha!!!!! i also really love the rousing speech that Aragorn says to rouse his men at the black gate (not to mention the battle aswell!!!)This is the end of my comment i hope you agree with me and i hope you reply "Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers! i see in you eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me!!!! And there may come a day when the courage of men fails.... An hour of wolves before the age of men comes crashing down - but it is not this day.. This day we fight!!!!! I bid you now to take all you hold dear and stand men of the west!!!- Aragorn
8.0~Well, I'm back... jupitergal2 Sign in Permalink (Comment originally posted 18 March 2004) What a wonderful conclusion to the trilogy. It's hard to review just one of these movies without really reviewing the whole set. I think they made a lot of excellent choices on this last one, as far as what was put in, what was left out, and how everyone was portrayed. I do agree that they shouldn't have cut Christopher Lee's scene from the theatrical, though. I was glad they left out the scouring of the shire in this version. The movie is so long, that by the time the characters are heading home, the last thing I wanted to watch was another big, heartwrenching problem for them (I felt the same way about the book). An English friend of mine said that he likes the scouring scene in the book because it shows how Merry and Pippin grow and deal with the problem in the Shire on their own (for the most part) but I think the books and movie had already illustrated that quality in them, through their battles and separation, without this. I do love how they do come home in the movie, and how the scowling hobbit man is there to see them return. And I'm so, so glad that the movie ended quite faithfully to the book, with Sam simply saying to his wife, "Well, I'm back." I'd been waiting in suspense for over three years to see if they'd use that line, possibly my favorite line from the trilogy, and I was so thankful that they did. There were several times in all three movies that I felt silly because I was a grown woman brought to tears by a fantasy tale, but that particular line always gets me. I must admit that I always felt really sad whenever I got to the end of these books, because even though it's supposed to be an uplifting theme, the reminder of the passage of time and how it changes things just really depresses me! The movie sort of makes me feel that way too. It's a bittersweet experience. When I first heard that they were making this trilogy I was wishing they would actually have started with "The Hobbit." But now I think it will be a good thing if Peter Jackson and the studios resolve their financial dispute and Jackson makes "The Hobbit" now, because I've always felt sad at themes dealing with the passing of time, people getting old and dying (or going away forever), and it will be so nice to see a younger, revived Bilbo in a movie version of the book that is much more lighthearted than the trilogy that came after it. I'm really looking forward to what Peter and his crew will do with that one. I think the passage of time may prevent Ian Holm from being able to pick up the role of a younger Bilbo, but I think Billy Boyd would be perfect to switch into this role - he does look the part. : ) Though some might prefer an English accent to a Scottish - personally I think, once the movie got going a bit, no one would give it much thought.
10.0~excellent film - well rounded, intense, fun j_a_kc_1234 Sign in Permalink This is an excellent film, but don't take my word for it; watch it yourself. This movie keeps in character with the first two and does a great job of tying them all together. It is thick with action, suspense, friendship, sacrifice, and emotion. The characters stay true to their friendships such as Sam sticking by Frodo's side through thick and thin. It also has a scene where one of the hobbits saves Gandalf's life. I teared up once and got a lump in my throat several times. It also has an appropriate level of humor with the schizophrenic Gollum/Smeagal character and competition to kill enemies between Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf. It had many small conflicts which enriched the experience such as Gollum conniving to turn Frodo against Sam and the King of Minas Tirith sending his only remaining son on a suicide mission. The movie had many pleasant surprises with Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas going to recruit a much needed mystery army to defend Minas Tirith. The evil forces also had their own share of surprises with extensive use of giant elephants, trolls, bigger seige towers, and a new battering ram. The ending was longer than the first two movies and showed how life went on for each of the characters.
1.0~Good special effects; mediocre story-telling brucetx1 Sign in Permalink and poor characterization. As a technical achievement it's a masterpiece. As a work of drama, it's mediocre to lame. The dialogue scenes were overwrought with drama, much like a soap opera, although instead of sappy Hammond organ music, we had the sappy orchestral score, rising and falling on practically every syllable. Jackson deserves a lot of points for his technical skills but none for his artistry.
10.0~Better than you thought it would be! zlarthon Sign in Permalink in spite of the limits on time and the temerity to dislike some parts of the Canon, Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece that even J. R. R. Tolkien himself would have liked. Remember that the Professor said not to look too closely at Fairie lest the magic fade... I missed some of the parts left out of all three films. But this one didn't feel as long as the second film... And I will be back to see it again and again... Scenery, camera angles, appropriate pauses in the action... beautiful... Well recommended... don't fail to see it on the big screen -- or even IMAX if it's available in your area...
4.0~ok marilynnrainey Sign in Permalink This movie was ok maybe next time.......... good try
10.0~wonderful ginnytn Sign in Permalink This is as good as I imagined it could someday be when I read the books many years ago. Perfect casting, fantastic directing, etc. I want to have a friend like Sam. Loose ends wrapped up, all things as they should be. Quite the achievement and terrific entertainment.
10.0~Out of this World!!! xEowenx Sign in Permalink This trilogy truely has to be one of the all time greats! After seeing the first two, more times than most, I was waiting with anticipation for the third installment! And what I saw was beyond my wildest expectations! An absolute gem, that everyone simply has to see, and as for Peter Jackson, well the Oscars in the bag baby!!!
10.0~like movies best AmirWit1 Sign in Permalink The best movies. very very goog movies im like nice
9.0~Geeky Randy's summary Geeky Randy Sign in Permalink An inarguably satisfying (though maybe a little too ambitious, given its length) conclusion to Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Frodo (Wood) continues the trek to Mount Doom along with Sam (Astin) and Gollum (Serkis), while the remaining fellowship take on new tasks—particularly Gandolf (McKellen) and Pippin (Boyd), who journey to Minas Tirith to seek aid from steward Denethor (Noble), the stern but grieving father of Boromir (Bean) and Faramir (Wenham). Took away 11 Oscars including Best Picture though neglect of the previous two films may have played a part in this. Hill and Otto actually become likable in this installment after some much needed character development, but the corny dialogue that first appeared in TWO TOWERS doesn't lessen. ***½ (out of four)
10.0~Beautiful paulwalkersgirl Sign in Permalink This movie is one of the most beautiful movies yet!! Peter Jackson knows how to draw the audience in and knows how to tug at their heart-strings. Sean Astin was BRILLIANT in these 3 LOTR movies. Love him. Elijah Wood was also excellent... even if he had no dialogue and he had to act with just his eyes... that would be good enough for me. For everyone out there who has not yet seen this movie... I'd highly suggest you have a box of tissues on hand. =) The entire cast was incredible. I think all of them deserved an award for their acting. Can't forget about Cate Blanchett... she was fantastic. One of Australia's best actresses... alongside Nikki Kidman, Naomi Watts, Judy Davis, Rachel Griffiths and Toni Collette.
10.0~Movie of the Year. Movie of the Century. Movie of the Ages... gala0008 Sign in Permalink I waited until i read the book Return of the King before I saw the movie. After watching the movie i read the book again and it made sense. Peter Jackson did a remarkable job in adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's book to film and making it understandable. The cinematography is superior to all other movies, the acting was much better than anyone would have expected, the story was intense, and it has plenty of light hearted moments to make you smile. I feel this film deserved all 11 Academy Awards it got and it even deserved more, such as best lead actor for Elijah Woods and best supporting actor for Sean Astin or Andy Serkis (who wasn't considered because when he played Smeagol he technically wasn't on screen). I'm just surprised that the other Lord of the Rings movies didn't win as much. Jackson went all out for this final installment, managing to convincingly make 300 warriors look like 3000 through the use of computer technology unlike George Lucas (no offense to him, but the battle scenes in the new Star Wars movies look really fake since most of the fighters, especially those in the foreground, are computer generated). WETA especially did a terrific job making every last aspect of this film look real, including the dead elephant in the background of the field battle. I strongly hope that Peter Jackson returns to do The Hobbit. It would perfectly tie up the tale of Middle Earth and the Ring of Sauron. If you haven't seen this movie, see it!!!
10.0~Best movie ive seen in a while.. rsmccain-2 Sign in Permalink Unreal fighting scenes... Great dialouge, etc.. My only complaint if I had one is the last 30 minutes or so could have been shrunk to maybe 10 minutes. Other than that you don't feel like you are in a movie for 3 1/2 hours.. Now I need to watch the first 2 again.. :) 9.5 of 10 stars..
10.0~Great movie, go see it! johnanderson Sign in Permalink Just forget the overblown gasbags who pooh-poohed this movie - This is a very well done fantasy film. Yes there are a few slow sections and a few minor errors, and yes, the story doesn't match the book exactly. If the movie DID match the book storyline it would be hours longer. But the overall effect if this version is just fantastic and very well-worth seeing on the big screen. Recommend seeing at a quality theater with stadium seating and a good sound system for best effect.

9.0~POSSIBLY THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! paul-tuffnell Sign in Permalink I have seen this film twice at the cinemas and it is simply amazing. The whole trilogy is the best of all time, hands down. This is the best film of the 3 and is a must see for everyone! The ending may seem to drag on a bit, especially on a repeated viewing but I dont wanna start picking faults right now :-) I give this film 9/10 GO SEE IT!
10.0~Magnificent ending from a superb trilogy priqx Sign in Permalink After the Battle at Helmsdeep in "LOTR: The Two Towers", we didn't know over wich visual border the director, Peter Jackson, was going to take us now. "LOTR: The Return of the King" was oppose to "The Matrix Revolutions" a stunning piece of film. The battle at the Pelennor Fields is simply overwhelming. Being a great fan from the books of Tolkien, I believe that he made it possible to actually experience the entire saga. The film is so realistic in its portrayal, other phantasy films look like cartoons next to those three.
10.0~Best. Movie. Ever. Period. Outbound_Sith Sign in Permalink As I watched the last minutes of this movie it suddenly struck me, how wrong it seemed that at the end of the credits, I would just get up, leave the theatre and drive home. Both because I didn't want to leave Middle Earth, but also because I couldn't leave Middle Earth. This movie - and its two predecessors - isn't just another blockbuster that you watch, have fun with for 2 hours, and then leave behind. This movie and its two predecessors - they really stay with you. Because of these movies I've made new friends and experienced things I wouldn't otherwise have. I've garnered an interest in and an admiration for every aspect of film making that I didn't have before. Because I knew these movies were coming out I've read a children's book and a 50-year-old 1200+ page book in the original language (just for the heck of it - and for the record I'm Danish) and absolutely loved every minute of it. To make an already long story a little shorter, these movies have been a life changing experience in more ways than just seriously screwing up my Top 10 Favorite Movies List. I'm not one of those people, whose favorite movie changes every time they see the latest box office hit, but Return Of The King shot straight to No. 1 this week, and it was even better the second time I watched it! Sure I had some problems with some of the editing and heavily truncated characters (Denethor seemed particularly one-dimensional), but it stands as a testament to its greatness, that despite this I can still regard this as the best movie ever. The Extended Edition will surely be an out-of-body experience!!! For the last 2 years when people have asked me I've said, that the LOTR movies are amazing, but that the book is better. In some ways, this movie is better than the book. The same way as some things are better conveyed in writing than in images, there are things, you can do in a movie, that works so much better than in book form. The images just stir up emotions a lot more than words might, and although I'm a real softy, when it comes to stuff like big crows scenes in movies, I've never cried or welled up as much watching a movie, as I did with this one. And sometimes in places I didn't even expect. In the second viewing I'd already had 5 or 6 `incidents' before I got to the ending(s) with the first one being Gandalf's ride up through the levels of Minas Tirith, and if I keep this up I'll end up crying my way from New Line logo till the end of the credits. I'd never hear the end of it! I don't really care whether this movie recieves a single Oscar. If it does sweep the floor I'll be happy for sure, but if it doesn't, then it's not because the movie wasn't good enough. It's the Academy, that has something to prove, not PJ or the movie. So after over 2 years and 10+ hours of transcending cinema with more to come in the fall, I guess all that's left is to say thank you: To Peter Jackson for having a crazy vision and running with it. To Bob Shaye for not understanding the concept of just 2 movies. To New Line for dishing out the cash in a sheer leap of faith. To Fran Walsh for making the Nazgûl scream the scariest sound I've ever heard. To Philippa `Queen of the Geeks' Boyens: I'll serve you eternally! To Mark Ordesky for letting PJ crash on his couch. To Barrie Osborne for being the most amazingly involved producer ever. To Richard Taylor and Tania Rodger for revolutionizing their craft. To Alex Funke for grossly understating the beauty and awe of the Minas Tirith bigature. To the two guys, who made rubber chain mail for 3 years at the expense of sunlight and their finger prints and still wouldn't have traded the experience for anything. To the rest of Weta Workshop for never leaving anything half finished. To the guy, who came up with the concept for MASSIVE. There's no end to the possibilities! To Jim Rygiel for suggesting Gollum as a mesh between mo-cap and key frame animation. To the rest of Weta Digital for working their butts of when PJ handed them shots at the last minute. To Elijah Wood for making his own audition tape. To Sean Astin for pouring everything into it in the Mordor scenes. To Viggo Mortensen for taking advice from his son, when he received that phone call. To Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd. May your friendship last forever and bring you much joy. To Bernard Hill, who will no longer just be known as `that guy from 'Titanic'. To Hugo Weaving - Elrond no longer looks like Agent Smith, it's the other way round. To Cate Blanchett for making The Lady of the Galadrim come to life as no other could. To Karl Urban for stealing every scene he's in. To John Noble, who will no doubt be redeemed as a much more complex character come November. To David Wenham for being absolutely heartbreakingly tragic in the scene in the White Tower. To Orlando Bloom for being the biggest bada$$ wood elf in movie history. To Liv Tyler for refusing to be portrayed as XenArwen. To John Rhys-Davies for surviving the horrible days in prosthetic make-up. To Christopher Lee. Don't worry - the Extended Editions will be regarded as the real movies, anyway. To Ian McKellen for simply BEING Gandalf. To the rest of the cast and crew for doing what they did to the absolute best of their abilities! Thank you with every fibre in my body!
10.0~Sure, could be criticized, but there'd be no point. sminty_eclipse Sign in Permalink -**BIG SPOILERS**- only intended for people who have seen ROTK. I actually wasn't as excited for the release of Return of the King as I have been for Lord of the Rings movies past. I'm not sure why. Teenage maturation? Perhaps Lord of the Rings has begun to settle in my mind, eliminating some excitement and freshness of it? I was hesitant to see this movie as it is the end of Lord of the Rings to me, in a way. I first read Lord of the Rings shortly before the release of the films. I have also read the Silmarillion and some of the Histories of Middle-Earth. At any rate, for whatever reason, I wasnt nervously anticipating this one as much as the previous two Lord of the Rings films. But when I sat down I was totally carried away by the emotion and atmosphere of this film. The humanity. The internal conflict. The drama. And now I am sad, sad in the same way I was sad at the end of my first reading of Lord of the Rings. Sad because these characters that have come to life in my heart and mind are gone forever, and there is nothing more to read or see. No more sweet words from their lips. Nothing more to get lost in, no more exploring Middle-Earth with Sam and Frodo. I now wish it were two years ago, at the beginning, on the day Fellowship of the Ring was released. Or better yet, when I first picked up a copy of Lord of the Rings and began to read. I see a lot of critics on here bashing ROTK. I don't know what the deal is. Sure, there were parts of it in which the word 'cheesy' flashed through my mind briefly... for the record here are the things that I wasn't too big on: When Daegol got pulled underwater by the fish looked pretty stupid/fake: when Smeagol was choking Daegol: Gollum looked kinda odd falling in to the crevice in Mt. Doom: Eowyn's feminist line while battling the Witchking: Sauron looks kinda dumb/ inadequate especially when his tower is falling over: the Armies of the Dead: the hobbits jumping on Frodo in his bed: Gollum on Frodo's shoulders while Frodo is invisible in Mt. Doom: Bilbo is kinda idiotic: Gandalf seemingly pushing Denethor into the pyre: Legolas's incredibly unrealistic physical feats in the battles-that's all the dingbats I wasn't too fond of that I can think of right now. Now to get the the meat of this review- Despite these things, I still give this lovely movie a 10/10. Other parts were so beautiful they pulled me in and any criticisms that managed to surface to my mind were subdued and thrown aside. Many other movies don't have any affect on me at all, and therefor for those I don't care enough to even process any criticisms. The emotion on this is magnificent, more emotional than the others in my opinion(although that may just be because I have seen the others so much). The movie never really dragged for me like parts of the previous two have... A lot of stuff happens. The end is long, and I guess you could say it drags, if 'always thinking the end of the scene is the end of the film... until the next scene comes' would be considered dragging- but then the next scene would come and I was thinking, 'hey alright I'm glad it isn't over' heh- Personally I think the Grey havens would have been more effective for the very ending. Anyways, concerning the length of the ending, if you think about it, the Lord of the Rings was written as one book, and the movies were filmed together as one movie, and the 10-or-so hour long movie requires a long ending, to go in ratio to the rest of the film. Also, the ROTK *is* Lord of the Ring's climax (both emotionally and otherwise). But those are but tiny little unimportant things that do not balance the scales weighed against the beauty and power of this film. Pippin's song to Denethor was extremely breathtakingly beautiful and bittersweet (thats the highlight of the movie to me - I'm going to see ROTK again soon, if only to see that wonderful sequence again); the wars in Return of the King are, I think, better than those in Two Towers; The melodramatic suicide of Denethor and the rescue of Faramir; The drama between Faramir and his father over Boromir (including that lovely line delivered by Gandalf, something along the lines of 'Your father does love you. I only hope that he soon remembers it'). FOTR and TTT have been praised as wonderful films... and they are terrific films... but I love ROTK the most at this point because it seems to me it is never just action crammed in there for the sake of empty action (i.e. the Warg Riders in TTT). There is always emotion running BEHIND everything, not just having the camera jumping from one action scene to another. Some changes made from the book I think benefited the movie (I would like to remind you that I did read the Lord of the Rings before the release of the films). Some of the changes I think made the movie more powerful/better flow was the removal of the scouring of the Shire and the death of Saruman (although some conclusion for Saruman, even a mention, would have been nice). I also liked the conflict between Sam and Gollum over Frodo, as it strengthens the emotion of Frodo, struggling and scared in Shelob's tunnel alone, realizing the evil intent of Gollum and his own trust in him. It also strengthens the emotion of Sam coming back to find Mr. Frodo, and his saving him from the tower of the orcs. I know the little gripes I listed in this review are numerous, however, the emotional effect is so intense and the film is so exciting and so engaging that almost anything is entirely forgiven. One of the best movies, if not the best, that I have seen in my brief 14 years of life. And I'm sure the film will grow on me and the little gripes will be nonexistant to me with more viewings. Bottom line: THIS MOVIE IS GORGEOUS BEYOND CRITICISM. 10/10
10.0~A Tremendous Conclusion To A One Of A Kind Trilogy CitizenCaine Sign in Permalink The Return Of The King, winner of 11 Oscars (including Best Picture and Director), is the concluding film in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. It is instantly, quite simply, one of the great films of our time. The trilogy provides this film the added luxury of having dispensed previous knowledge about what it's about and where it's headed via its two previous theatrical releases: The Fellowship Of The Ring and The Two Towers. This provides that audience with the background to fully experience and enjoy what they know is going to be the concluding installment, without needing any introductory exposition. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return Of The King can stand alone as a film any patron can enjoy without having viewed the two previous films, although it has to be much harder to appreciate and understand the full scope of the tale. The story continues where it left off at the conclusion of The Two Towers. Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum are headed toward Mount Doom while becoming more fully realized characters in the process for us. Frodo is increasingly tested by both the ring's power and Gollum's manipulativeness. Samwise is challenged by Frodo's growing aloofness, his loyalty to his master, and Gollum's manipulativeness also. Gollum is revealed as a much more complicated character than perhaps any previous CGI or animated character in film history. Their journey, although slightly tedious to some viewers for sure, traces the interchangeable course of the best and worst traits of humanity within its single quest. Director Peter Jackson and the other writers have successfully distilled Tolkien's core conflicts here. Gandalf and Pippin's trip to Minas Tirith and Eowyn and Merry's stealing away to join the Rohan riders provide us the opportunity to witness their characters' growth, all incredibly heroic and absolutely heartbreaking in feel and in scope. Gandalf and Eowyn become more assertive leaders, and Pippin and Merry contribute smaller, but no less important, decisions involving heroic remonstrance. Some of these scenarios, notably the ones involving Eowyn, Pippin, and Merry, are breathtakingly idealistic, showcasing the joyful best of what mankind can be. Aragorn and Theoden lead the people of Middle Earth against tremendously overwhelming odds to try to defeat the dark forces of Sauron, with Aragorn philosophically enlisting the aid of the dangerous dead. They both have stirring speeches in front of their men that are reminiscent of Shakespeare's Henry V. Redemption is an important theme in the trilogy, specifically more so in this last installment. Legolas and Gimli are less realized, and their characters continue as we remember them from The Two Towers, as skilled fighters and comic relief. The action and special effects, namely the CGI, are enthralling and groundbreaking; the art direction and set decoration are sumptuous; the cinematography once again is breathtaking; the costumes, crafts, make-up, and weaponry are just so richly detailed; the musical score is exciting, rousing, and synonymous with the tradition of the best adventure movies of old Hollywood. The highlights are the battle scenes again, which are absolutely some of the most mind-blowing filmed in recent memory. The trilogy as a whole, and this film in particular, reconciles the best and worst aspects of humanity either directly through the characters or metaphorically in a way that sates even the most cynical viewer. There are a few weak points: the Arwen/Aragorn romance was never deeply felt; Saruman inexplicably disappears in this film, although he'll reappear in the extended DVD version; and, there does seem to be too many climaxes in the last half hour, even though they pretty much follow the book. The film remains an outstanding achievement for Director Peter Jackson, and this film will stand as a magnificent challenge to all future action/fantasy/science fiction films to measure up to its standards for years to come. **** out of 4 stars.
10.0~A masterpiece in filmmaking barbaralm Sign in Permalink The sequel that is better than its predecessor is rare in Hollywood. But from the main titles to the end credits, every frame of "RotK" is perfect. This film is an absolute masterpiece. Jackson's obvious love for Tolkien's work shines through in every frame of this film as well as through "Fellowship" and "Two Towers." Jackson could write a book about the making of this trilogy and it would become required study material in film schools. Of course, the director of any films relies on his actors to convey the emotions and reactions to what is going on around them. Elijah Wood gives a stunning performance; we actually feel his pain as he staggers through Mordor to Mount Doom. But the film's standout performance belongs to Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. Meek and shy in "Fellowship" and protective and brave in "Towers", Sam becomes a man of action in "Return". From his battles with Gollum to taking on Shelob to save Frodo, to taking on Orcs in Mordor, Sam is true to his purpose: to watch over Frodo. Astin's performance is simply perfect. Why the Academy chose to ignore this for the 2004 Oscars is beyond my comprehension. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn ably takes on the task of transforming a wanderer into a King. Lending support are Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Pippin, who face battle for the first time in their lives. In particular, Boyd's palpable fear before the battle of Minas Tirith as well as his heroic efforts to save a dying Faramir prove his mettle as an actor. The battle scenes in this film are beyond description. The ride of the Rohirrim is jaw-dropping, as is the final confrontation at the Black Gate. And never does Jackson allow the multiple SFX and CGI shots to interfere with the story or with the acting. And finally, tribute must be paid to the man who is ultimately responsible for it all: J.R.R. Tolkien. It took him 12 years to create Middle-Earth and to write the "Rings", which is the touchstone of all fantasy novels. The novels and their sequels in themselves represent an achievement in literature and Jackson faithfully adapts them to the screen, resulting in an unparalleled achievement in moviemaking.
10.0~The Best Film Ever? antthemax Sign in Permalink Thre are no words to describe the amazement that came upon when i watched the trilogy but the finally part was more than just tying up the loose ends. Peter Jackson and co rightly won tons of Oscars for this amazing bit of film-making. OK he had a lot to work with, but he had millions of faithful fans of the books that a lot was riding on these films and the pressure was on. I believe this has to be in everyone's top 3 movie's of all time for 3 reasons: 1)Let The movie critics say whatever they want but the acting wasn't wooden. Viggo Mortesen and Sean Austin were my faves. 2)There is a perfect balance between not enough and too much special effects, ROTK is perfect in this way. 3)Any movie that grips and you pulls your emotions about, a movie that has many battle scenes but isn't a war movie is exceptional. For example at Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Pippin are sat on some stairs as the battle approaches and they have an amazing conversation about afterlife. Truly spectaculor and a movie which WILL stand the test of time.
1.0~Dreadful jon-gwynne Sign in Permalink I had such high hopes when I first heard that a Tolkien fan was going to write and direct a live-action+CGI version of Lord of the Rings... ... only to have them cruelly dashed. FOTR was a bit rough but I said to myself "It'll only get better". Boy was I wrong. I suppose the main problem is twofold. First, Jackson is way too young/inexperienced to have taken on this project. He certain has ability but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking before even thinking about tackling such an ambitious project. Second, for alleged lovers of the source material, Jackson and company took WAY too many liberties with the story. Changing them in pointless and even foolish ways. Perhaps this was inexperience, maybe it was just laziness or a lack of understanding of the source material. Goodness knows that LOTR is far from perfect as an example of storytelling but there is a great tale buried in Tolkien's massive tome. Too bad that Jackson and his crew were absolutely unable to bring it to the screen. By the TROTK, Jackson's exhaustion is practically oozing from the screen and he's lost sight of many key elements of the story.
7.0~Power Rangers on a $100M budget Matt-441 Sign in Permalink If the producers of Power Rangers had $100 million to spend on a movie, they would create a trilogy not much different from Lord of the Rings. For a 3.5 hour movie, you would think they could tie up loose-ends, but there was much to be desired in the character development. Why is Gimli nothing more than a comic-relief dwarf reciting one-liners that are so cliche? Why is Arwen just a wet blanket who weeps her way through the trilogy? Why are all the orcs exactly like the power rangers villains? Tolkien must be rolling over in his grave! And what's up with the horrendous computer graphics? Legolas' circus acrobatics was rendered so poorly, it appears 10 year older than the first Matrix movie. The head of the CG department should be fired! And what's up with the spider biting through Frodo's Mithril chain mail of invincibility? He was supposed to be bitten in the arm, not in the chest through the chain mail?! There is so much more to gripe about. But to summarize, computer generated orcs (even 10,000 of them) are not enough to bring this movie back from the grave.
8.0~Grand pop entertainment kintopf432 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson pulls out all the stops in the finale to his 'Lord of the Rings' adaptation, and the result is pretty satisfying. It's hard to say whether this is because of anything uniquely brilliant about this film, or because Jackson simply doesn't drop the ball with this closing chapter, as we've seen happen in many other movie series. By now, these characters have become so familiar to us that the film almost has its emotional effectiveness pre-programmed, built in. Even the score seems like an old friend--Howard Shore's variations on his own themes makes those themes seem better than they actually are. But there's more to it than that, I think; the movie's actually not at all bad on its own. After the effective setup of 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and the rather plodding development of 'The Two Towers,' Jackson directs like a master here, spinning what feels like eight or ten subplots together into a swirling, thrilling, chaotic Armageddon of a picture, truly capturing the apocalyptic character of Tolkien's epic conflict. His hand is sure; his style and good taste rarely falter. For all its overstuffed quality, the film gives us quick flashes of special-effects wizardry--a surging river of horsemen, a black jabberwock thing fleeting overhead, a giant spider pushing its front legs out of its trapdoor--rather than laboring any particular effect. (This is even true with the CGI Gollum, which I was nearly alone in finding embarrassingly overdone in 'The Two Towers.') The cast returns to the uniformly high standard that was so impressive in 'Fellowship'; in fact, some of them (notably Sean Astin, Andy Serkis, and Billy Boyd) improve on their performances in the earlier films, and only Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn begins to show signs of strain. The twinkle is back in Ian McKellen's eye as Gandalf, and Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are thankfully given more to do this time around (even if Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies are not). John Noble contributes a nice low-browed glower to the proceedings as the nutcase Denethor, a truly flawed character who makes a welcome addition to Tolkien's pantheon of mostly pure goodies and baddies. As others have pointed out, it's hard to judge these films individually, and that works both in their favor and against it. Perhaps there's never been a film series in which the forest has been made as much a priority as the trees, as it has here; 'Star Wars' certainly doesn't do it, nor do 'Planet of the Apes' or 'Indiana Jones' or even 'Alien,' not really. In fact probably the only one I know that might come close is 'The Godfather,' which, like this series, covers three films with a blanket style, but which uses each one of those films to a different end, tonally, thematically, and structurally. 'Godfather 3' was a semi-disaster, of course, and 'Return of the King' is not, but the comparison stands, and the two series also have in common the fact that they are ascribed a measure of depth that probably isn't there. More than anything, the 'Lord of the Rings' movies are grand pop entertainments, aesthetic marvels that amaze in terms of technique and style, but that only work on deeper levels if you are one of the devout, or if you are willing to be very, *very* indulgent. There are times when Peter Jackson's unfailingly reverent, unwinking approach to Tolkien's stodgy, creaky, borderline racist adventure story seems a bit silly, especially coming from the creator of the subversive 'Braindead' and 'Bad Taste,' as well as his one genuine masterpiece of psychological depth, 'Heavenly Creatures.' (Those of us who wish Jackson would leave the kids' stuff behind and make another film like the latter may be in the minority, but we are right.) Still, pop entertainment is not without its pleasures, and they can be intense ones. As pop entertainments go, 'The Lord of the Rings' remains strong, and 'The Return of the King' shows off the best the series has to offer. Movie: 8.5 out of 10. Series: 8 out of 10.
9.0~Film Fantasi Terbaik pranowoyugo Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a fantasy epic movie directed by Peter Jackson's novel from J.R.R. Tolkien. Released on December 17, 2003, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King became one of the films that received the most criticism and was the most successful film at the box office of all time. The film earned eleven Academy Awards of eleven nominations, which later became the counterpoint of Titanic and Ben-Hur for most Academy Award winners. The film also won Best Oscar Film, making him the only fantasy film in this award-winning history. The film also became the second best- selling film in the world after Titanic, without taking into account inflation.
10.0~There are two kinds of people in the world: those who like LOTR and those who love it. elmaethor Sign in Permalink Before I begin my comment on the Greatest Movie Of All Time, I would like to express my strong belief that anyone who gave this movie anything below a 7 should be sent to prison for crimes against humanity. Furthermore, anyone who is still confused should e-mail me and I will gladly educate you (or you should watch the first two movies first, moron). As if the books weren't good enough, Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's masterpiece to the silver screen. The story is masterfully told and every single character was cast perfectly. Though Jackson does not follow the books exactly, I believe that J.R.R. would be proud. John Rhys-Davies and Andy Serkis provide just enough comic relief to keep the movie from becoming too serious, and the acting is amazing. And don't get me started on the fight scenes. The greatest movie-making technology ever created combined with Jackson's expertise and Tolkien's genius make for a thrilling adventure. 10 out of 10.
9.0~The quest unfulfilled nerettyksduredro Sign in Permalink My review of the Lord of the Rings trilogy: The Fellowship of the Ring: This is the one and only perfectly sustained masterpiece of the three. I think an important word here is sustained, no matter how many good scenes there are in a film, it will fall apart if it is too boring in-between. The realisation of Middle-Earth is beyond belief, with it's races - men, dwarfs, elves, hobbits, orcs - all credibly portrayed. And the way the film takes hold of you from the first frame, I have never experienced anything like it. Breathtaking scenes like the one going from Frodo holding The One Ring in Bag End to Barad-Dur where Gollums is being tortured and, later, Saruman bringing down the mountain in Caradhras are great. This is one film you can watch over and over again even when you know by heart everything that happens in every scene. The Two Towers: As good as Fellowship, not better, but credibly sets the scene for the final film. There is one overly drawn-out scene that slows down the narrative, the one where Aragorn is dreaming about Arwen. It was a bit like Seinfeld as a straight drama, he looked like Jerry sitting at that bench out on the pier when he had an inner conflict. But the Riders of Rohan were well portrayed, Gollum too, and the first appearance of Treebeard was one of the most brilliant, well, first appearances on film ever. The Return of the King: Unfortunately, the last film of the trilogy became an uneven mess, with lots of scenes shot with a lazy dreaminess, which let down the drama and finally made it uninteresting. Gollum had to repeat everything he communicated at the end of TTT, and there was a lot of time wasted on actors staring at the camera, each other or at nothing. Sometimes the scenes of day-on-the-beach-laziness were relieved by some intense scenes, like the charge of the CGI-Rohirrim - count the number of times the mountains behind them change - and the final stand at the black gate, but the slow scenes took away the power of the interesting ones.
2.0~Please Stop! I'll Talk. calfan Sign in Permalink If we want suspected terrorists to talk, just make them watch this overblown, pompous turkey on a continuous loop - hold the battle scenes which were not too bad. Anybody will break down if forced to watch and listen to this goodie two shoes tripe. Just another wowie zowie special effects monstrosity - gee, did the giant elephants remind you of the fighting machines from Star Wars (The Empire Strikes Back)? How would you like to clean up after those babies? They even left it open for another "episode". I would have rather spent 3 hours and 21 minutes in the dentist chair. Old J.R.R. has to be spinning in his grave at the treatment his work got from these goofs.May the Fa*ts be with you.
10.0~Greatness: Enough said! SeminolePhenom Sign in Permalink The third and final chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy begins with Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), and Gollum (Andy Serkis) making their way to Mordor to destroy the one ring that could be the end of all civilization, in the fiery pits of Mount Doom. As they embark on this journey, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and the others attempt to bring the armies of man together to hold off the vicious orcs sent by Sauron to destroy all of mankind. With such wonderful adaptations from the books in the first two films, it was not hard to predict that such greatness would come from the finale of the greatest trilogy ever put on film. The Return of the King includes the greatest performances from just about every single actor in the film you can think of. The plot thickens, leaving audiences breathless and yearning for more. And the visual effects!they are absolutely incredible. At 3 hours and 30 minutes, The Return of the King is never boring and is always jaw dropping, even after seeing 10 times. Overall, The Return of the King is easily one of the greatest films ever created. I highly recommend this film to anyone.
10.0~See it twice Argive Sign in Permalink Many of the complaints that I have heard regarding this film center on the final 30 minutes or so, which can be considered the epilogue in which all of the loose ends are tied up. Needless to say, this does slow the film down considerably the first time one sees it, as roughly 75% of the film is incredible action which surpasses even The Two Towers (the Battle of the Pelennor Fields is easily 5 times bigger than that of Helm's Deep). In any case, I felt that the film dragged at the end the first time I saw it, but it seemed to work much better the second time. Believe me when I say that there is far more that the filmmakers could have put in but did not. If you see the film twice, you will gain an appreciation for the structure of the film that you can't get upon your first viewing (it's just too long, with too much to absorb). That said, this is a fantastic film. The battle scenes are fabulous, the acting is great, the music is once again superb. The trilogy ends with a terrific bang, not a whimper. Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece of fantasy/war in this trilogy, and I hope that all three films will be remembered for years to come.
7.0~Overrated Andy C-2 Sign in Permalink Ok just to clear something up. Despite the amazing amount of hype and numerous people saying these film were the best ever, I tried when I watched this and 1st film to watch them with an open mind neither being swayed to thinking there great because everyone else said this or the opposite. But come on, people. I have to say they appear just whizzy special effects lead extreme good versus dark (as in surroundings) ugly evil people (basically Star Wars). The storyline is tame and straighforward and the characters uninteresting. Star Wars is better and there massively overrated as well (if they removed those annoying 2 robots all together). Its basically a good film for kids with all this simplicity and straight good v evil, and I fail to see why so many adults like it so much. None of the three films deserve to be in the top100 if your like and competition of thoughtful, intelligent, well acted, important, sharply written films there. Maybe everyone just likes a straight forward situation of immense good vs terrible evil, so they know who there supporting, rather than the immensely complicated debatable thought provoking events of real life. I guess thats why the genre is called fantasy.
10.0~Best ending EVER! eurynome420 Sign in Permalink The movie was the best way to end the trilogy. Thanks to the books and everything! Wow. This movie is a must see! I've seen it every day since it has come out in theaters. I hope This movie hits Number one! :-) EVERYONE TAKE EVERYONE IN YOUR FAMILY TO SO SEE IT!
10.0~What a masterpiece zvonem1989 Sign in Permalink What to say?? This trilogy sets up a totally new standard of filming and if anyone wants to compete with this piece of art surely have a big job to do. Cant tell you how much I enjoy watching these movies. Totally a new world, visually very impressive, acting at very high level to, action keeps you entertained during the whole movie and watching these three movies makes you sad because they least "only" 11 hours . Cant have enough of these movies. Its been 11 years since I watched for the first time and I still feel hungry for them. I think that many years will pass until someone will make a better movie than LOTR and in my opinion for 50 years this trilogy will keep very high place on IMDb list because these movies are timeless.
10.0~This is what cinema was invented for ..... tmkremer Sign in Permalink I remember when I was a little boy and my father took me to the cinema seeing "Empire strikes back".... I thought I would never experience these feelings in my life again. But here and today it happened and I still can´t believe it. Peter Jackson has done the unbelievable and brought images and emotions on the screen far beyond expectations. "Return of the King" is THE epic masterpiece of our time, maybe of every time.
3.0~This SHOULD have been the greatest movie ever... themowg Sign in Permalink I went to see this movie at midnight the day it opened in the cinemas, just as I did for the first two LOTR films. The first two movies were both excellent. This was going to be IT--finally, a good film version of the greatest story ever told--Tolkien's lovely tale, perfectly written over the course of more than a decade of writing and revisions, excellent actors cast perfectly for their roles. All the film needed to do was stay the course--stick to the story, let the actors keep up their good work--and it would have been the single best movie of all time. BUT NO, for some reason, Peter Jackson could not stand to do this. I'm not one to whine about a few mundane details altered by the transition from book to film--I expect and sometimes enjoy such differences. However, I could not help but be disgusted when I saw Jackson's Saturday-morning cartoonish depiction of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. For those of you who did not read the book, just believe me when I tell you that battle contained the most pivotal moment in the entire trilogy, and Peter Jackson decided to make a joke of it.HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?? In the real version, the onslaught of the Riders of Rohan slows down after the attack of the giant elephants, and things begin to turn against the good guys. Just when things seem like they can't get any worse (the Lord of Gondor is insane, Theoden is dead, Aragorn & co. are nowhere to be found, the sky is dark, etc.), they do. The long feared fleet of black ships floats up the river, and the strong south wind that the good guys first blessed now bears their final curse. Just as Eomer prepares his people to die in their last battle before the end of the world, Aragorn's flag, that of the line of the kings of Men, unfurls from the Corsair flagship, and thus came Aragorn to Gondor, the rightful king. This IS the Return of the King. The entire book is named after this moment, and it is glorious to read, and would have been glorious on film as well. Instead, we have some evil-looking black ships float up to the orc-dock. the ugly harbor-master complains about them being late, and then 3 guys jump out of the ship looking ready for a fight. The orcs get the joke, and begin to attack, BUT WAIT! an undead army is hiding in the ships! How clever and funny! GIVE ME A BREAK! HOW much more lame can it get? I know! instead of including some other very valuable scenes (Gandalf v. Lord of the Nazgul, a decent portrayal of Denethor's more complex character, the parting of Arwen and Elrond, etc.), we can add 5 extraneous ending scenes! Disappointment after disappointment followed the tasteless portrayal of the Pelennor battle. I was heartbroken to see this film, as would be anyone who knows and appreciates the masterpiece that Tolkien conceived.
10.0~THE GREATEST TRILOGY EVER!!!!!! kickbackrebel454 Sign in Permalink Definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever. Return of the king is one of the greatest movies ever made. The LOTR Trilogy is the arguably the greatest trilogy of all time and i hate to say it because im a star wars fan. But I have never seen a Trilogy so beautifully made in my life time. Long live the KING!
10.0~Remarkable sun_jot Sign in Permalink I have never made any comments in English or posted any here. But I really hope to see the movie get higher rating and I really feel need to write down how I love the movie. As a child,I was nowhere living in any surrounding of western tales. I had no idea where the story of LOR would go when I had the first sight on the 1st episode TFOR.I didnt even understand the most fundamental questions: why need Frodo go to destroy the ring, why it's him not others, and why frodo could resist the power while others cant. The story was totally 'exotic' for me. But still, I was so attracted by the scenes and braveness, united spirit, loveness showing by the picture. Now comes the third one and the best movie ever may I say. It is even much better than all I can imagine. I watched the movie in a theatre late night with only 2 other movie viewers sitting far behind. It was quiet and no one would have seen me shedding tears along the movie going. Yes, I choked and was so moved. The only other movie which did the same thing to me was Shawshank's redemption, which was once in the no.1 place of my favorite movie list. Now it's taken by LOR3. Lor2 was considered as one movie with less compassion and moving moments. For lor3, there are so many touching scenes that any few of them would be enough to gain my full respect for the filming groups. No one can complain being given too much, right? The picture is describing an ideal world. but why not? We are living in a busy and wearing world, what is the chance for us to be a warrior or some small man who can gain the highest respect from others, like hobbits. The original story must be good. But I am still sure I would enjoy the movie much more than reading the novel itself. Thank the filming groups and the ones who performed the film. It was and will be a memorable 3-hour-time in my life. The character I liked the best is Sam(performed by Sean Astin).Sean played the role vividly and delivered so well the deep meaning of friendship and loyalty. No doubt, he deserves an Oscar for best supporter role. The story ends and I feel sad at the same time coz there is no lor4 for the next December. I will watch the movie again and again, along with the other two. Life becomes meaningful. Thank movies.
9.0~One movie to rule them all Ihad Sign in Permalink ROTK is in so many words the best epic fantasy movie I have seen in my entire life, with Fellowship of the Ring as close second. I did not like TTT as much as the other 2 but still found it good enough to earn a solid 8 (TTT extended DVD gets a 9 esp. for the Faramir scenes). Now, ROTK... When I go watch movies I can get irritatingly picky when it comes to details and the general flow of the movie. That flow can be disturbed by just one word from a line of a character. The flow of ROTK was first disrupted for me when I heard Smeagol call Deagol "My love" and secondly in the schizo-dialogue of Gollum/Smeagol this time as water-reflection - also a bad idea to copy yourself I thought instantly when I saw the scene, esp. since the schizo-dialogue scene in TTT was ultimately more powerful. Anyway, these are very small things one can easily forgive. However, I winced everytime Arwen was on screen and for me it was once again just confirmation that Liv Tyler is a total miscast and one can only be thankful that her screentime has been cut to the very minimum in ROTK. Esp. the schoolgirl giggling at the crowning ceremony made me moan. Oh well, I endured her. I am sure there are lots of people who think she was well cast (there's always one) but eventually even PJ must have realized what poo poo he got himself into by casting her (cut cut cut). Apart from weak Smeagol/Deagol dialogue and the Arwen scenes there is just one more significant criticism: "Saruman" or lack of thereof. I read all about why and how it came to the cutting of those 7 minutes at the beginning of the movie. Now, having seen the movie I can to some extent understand why it is detrimental to (re)introduce a character for just 7 minutes, kill him off and then start with the actual topic of the movie. Still, since we are treated with an Isengard scene (palantir) it is highly unsettling NOT to have the voice duel scene in there and it is also highly unsatisfactory to blank cut from Isengard directly to the Halls of Rohan. How the hell did they get there so fast? Ok, they all rode on Shadowfax... But even this is forgiven, with the comforting assuredness of an Extended DVD Version offering all that is "missing". For a "cinematic" version it "failed" in that respect that it was too long. Some of the scene could be trimmed a little more and the movie could be a good 20 minutes shorter without any "non fan" noticing any difference. Since PJ redefined the term "cinematic release" I thought we would be treated with a specially cut short version this time. It was not so and I for one am glad for it. Professional Critics might differ and call it a failure with too many endings, but we not listening... we says go away and never come back! ;) In closing my "review" I must speak of the "epic" character of this picture. The "epic" scenes are so powerful that they make you "feel" the sheer power, the might, the desperation, fatality, sadness and beauty. They touch your soul, they move you in a way not many movies succeed to do, esp. not in this genre. The grace of Gandalf riding to the rescue of Faramir, the charging of the Rohirim into certain death, the kingly end of a father in the arms of his daughter... "Eowyn". So many moments that have you on the edge of your seat, make you gnaw your nails, make you feel exhausted, overrun and leave you totally empty, it is not the End of a Quest you simply happen to watch, it is *your* Quest, the quest of the audience as well and it too comes to an end this christmas... only until Nov 2004 when ROTK EE will enchant us once more. My recommendation: This movie is best seen twice to gain its full impact. 9/10 DVD EE +1 = 10/10
9.0~Along Came a Spider wes-connors Sign in Permalink "The final battle for Middle-earth begins as Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of Mount Doom in order to destroy the 'One Ring'. Aragorn struggles to fulfill his legacy as he leads his outnumbered followers against the growing power of the Dark Lord Sauron, so that the Ring-bearer may complete his quest," according to the DVD sleeve description, this final installment was the "Winner of 11 'Academy Awards'." The conclusion of writer/director Peter Jackson's majestic realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's good versus evil epic adventure "The Lord of the Rings" continues to inspire awe; "The Return of the King" is another state-of-the-art motion picture, with the expected mind-blowing special effects and battle scenes. As you'll see (or not), this chapter falters somewhat, after the more tightly-constructed "Two Towers". But, at this point, criticism is pointless. In conclusion: ******** The Fellowship of the Ring (12/10/01) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom ********** The Two Towers (12/5/02) Peter Jackson ~ Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis ********* The Return of the King (12/1/03) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd ********* The Lord of the Rings (12/10/01-12/1/03) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen
10.0~Best Movie ever nickhouse5 Sign in Permalink All three movies, are in essence one whole movie, and that one movie is the greatest movie ever made, brilliant casting, and executed perfectly. Kudos to all involved, it has set new standards on film making, the greatest trilogy/movie ever made.
9.0~Tolkien's Vision Realised bqse06987 Sign in Permalink The bones of Tolkien's vision made flesh! When I first read this wonderful tale over 30 years ago my vivid imagination could not have bettered this depiction in film! To say that this movie is 'true to the book' is indeed a complement..and it is! Well done!
10.0~best movie ever david_beckham_mhtb Sign in Permalink well the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... I recommend it to every person its a CLASSIC that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyes!!finally I have seen a movie that is so much better than Titanic!!well the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... I recommend it to every person its a CLASSIC that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyes!!
8.0~Too bad it's the last part... I've enjoyed it! pimpost Sign in Permalink The film was great! Amazing battles and fantastic filmed.... The only thing is the ending... it's a bit long... Instead of one happy ending it had seven. But everything else was great. I'm looking forward to see the extended version! Still one of the best films ever!
10.0~a fantastic film elizabeth-145 Sign in Permalink I absolutely adore this movie, it is my favourite film of all time. The acting on all parts is superb, flawless and acted with so much emotion on all parts, when required. My favourite race of middle earth are the hobbits, played by ian holm, billy boyd, sean astin, dominic monaghan and elijah wood. Excellent choices for the roles. I prefer the movies to the books as you can relate more to them and understand where Tolkien was coming from in his writing. Roll on "The Hobbit" hopefully directed by Peter Jackson, just have to wait and see..
10.0~Wow, this is the greatest movie in history! Warning: spoilers! jag_avgudar_barca Sign in Permalink I just want to say WOW. The end of the journey comes in this movie as a brilliant ending. Not only for the fantastic effects in this movie; also for the perfect story. Peter Jackson has showed everybody that he can do the Lord Of The Rings from book to movie. I will also give some credits to the best writer ever: JRR Tolkien. He was in the beginning a ordinary teacher until he write a little sentence: "Once upon a time there was a hobbit who lived in the Shire." This little hobbit was Bilbo Bagger. But back to the movie, this is the best movie ever been made. Viggo Mortensen is fantastic as the role Aragorn. But don't he have more beard in the end of the film than in the beginning. But the actor that I think is the greatest in The Lord Of The Rings company is Sean Astin alias Samwise Gamgi. He make his performance so fantastic. The emotions is really coming forward here. I love the scene when Sam takes Frodo on his back to carry him the last steps in to the fires of mount doom: "I can't carry it for you (the ring),... But I can carry you!" So finally I just wan't to say: "This is the greatest movie in the modern history..."
10.0~best of the trilogy!!! phishpanic2001 Sign in Permalink This is by far the best in the trilogy. All three films are outstanding but this by far is the best. The only thing I didn't like in the film, I thought the ending went on 20 minutes longer than it should have. But what a great way to end probably the best series in movie history. This movie is a Best Picture contender hands down!! If you haven't seen this film yet, I highly recommend that you do.
6.0~IMDb's Number FIVE? jzappa Sign in Permalink Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest. But now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the "final" scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs! I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again.
10.0~A Breathtaking Epic for the Ages john_murdoch2002 Sign in Permalink With this one film, Peter Jackson solidifies himself as being one of the best filmmakers working today. His visionary work is put on masterful display here with the final chapter of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. What makes this installment so invigorating is how in depth Peter Jackson has made the audience aware of the characters. For as exciting as the previous two films were, they appear to only have been in service of this film, to lay the groundwork so the audience can understand the levity of each of their decisions, the torment their characters go through. And the technicality of this film sets the standards for all other films. The effects work is so well crafted here, seemlessly blending models with computer generation with image control capture. The production design, costume design, and cinematography blend seemlessly together to create an epic mythical feel. Perhaps the greatest effect of this movie is one that has eluded mainstream Hollywood for so long, making the effects in service of the story and characters. For as flawless as the effects are in this film, they only reflect what the actors convey to the audience. We believe that Gandalf is reacting to the hoard of Sauron's army, when we know there is nothing there. We feel a depth of grandure that is Minis Tirith, but only through Jackson's wonderfully tricky angles and the character's inhabiting the Middle Earth created around them. And above all, themes of courage, friendship, loyalty, the corruption of power to name a just a few of the important themes that arise in this film. Peter Jackson has truly created one of the finest series of films ever made and they will go down in history along side other noteworthy epics like Lawrence of Arabia, Gone With the Wind, and Ben-Hur. The only down side of this film is walking away with the knowledge that we can't look forward to another one next year.
4.0~Just OK. Nothing new here. FireflyWithMe Sign in Permalink I am in that boat of people who must have seen a different movie. This is just a louder, bigger version of Two Towers (Which was OK good and easily the best of the three). Well, there's another war on and we still don't have enough soldiers, so we're in for certain defeat. But then suddenly more support shows up from an unexpected quarter. But we still don't have enough, so we find even more unlikely help and a huge, CGI battle ensues. Then there is a ton of action, fun to watch I guess, though the graphics get *very* dodgy in places. Meanwhile the parts with Gollum drag ON and ON (!!) and are exactly the same as in Two Towers. Well, he's leading the hobbits along for another hour and a half, and we don't know if we can trust him, and he has about 40 conversations with his "Evil Self" about how he's going to betray them. (Or NOT?! The suspense is dreadfully boring!) There is something *really* wrong when the only character that gets dialogue is the one constantly ranting about the "Precious." Whose movie is this, anyway? Who is the main character, again?? Aragorn still feels conflicted about the same girl from the second one, and we get more weird flashbacks to Arwen and the supposed relationship that he has with her but that we've never seen and don't understand why he's so attached to her. Worse, while Part Two reduced Gimli to a scarce and bumbling punchline, Legolas is a ghost here with no lines who spends most of his screen time as a poorly-rendered CGI version of himself. That's very sad, since we all know that people are only there to see Orlando Bloom. Well, he and Frodo are the only interesting characters. We all know it. This is why all those elves showed up randomly at Helm's Deep in Part 2. The audience loves Legolas and adores his cute little species and wants to take them all home and snuggle them. But the whole Aragorn/Arwen thing is just confusing and insubstantial and no one wants to take them home. (In all fairness, Aragorn hasn't showered in the 6 years we've been waiting for this epic to end.) The pacing in this film is horrible. As with Two Towers, some scenes are way too long, and there is plenty more that you wish they would take the time to explain. Giant eagles show up out of nowhere. A new villain appears and he is supposedly a most feared and notorious character, but no one has heard of him and we never find out who he is or where he came from. And the evil wizard (Sauron?) just vanishes from the film at about the 3/4 mark. I guess he walked off the project and they forgot to write an ending for him? A lot of the characterization is just repetitive, like Sam who has no role except to encourage Frodo and keep him going, and a lot of it is just inexplicable, like the continued absence of black riders and ringwraiths. I guess they went extinct or something at the end of Part 1? Maybe they went on break and just never came back. The story also jumps around between so many different characters that you have to be well-versed in the lore to be able to follow it. You're probably used to that already since Part Two had us careening between epic battle sequences, boring Gollum leading Frodo, and that giant Tree walking along carrying the other hobbits for an hour. The scene leaps here are even more jarring since even more characters get screen time in flashbacks and lots of those "Meanwhile, back at Headquarters..." moments. I also did not really "get" the ending (When you go on that boat with Gandalf, does that mean you die, or..?) and it dragged on in a lot of sappiness and goodbyes. It was also a big jolt right after the battle scene to have everything so happy and wonderful, and suddenly Aragorn is king and has even less personality than before, if that's possible. It was all so joyous but at the same time so bland and weird and not fun. And Sam getting married: Who cares? (It was made official several years ago: No one cares about Sam. I guess Pete Jackson didn't get the memo.) There is some genuinely scary stuff in this movie (the huge spider and the ghost soldiers), and it held my attention OK and didn't *feel* long, but it was unsatisfying on the grandest scale. It always is when you spend this much time with characters but don't get to know them. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a very expensive One-Trick Pony. People say this one is the best, but I think that just because it's all finally over and we can get back to our lives instead of spending years analyzing how so many people can love a movie like this when it is so obviously not very good. I agree, too. The obscenely expensive FX already look dated and will be embarrassing pretty soon.
7.0~Disappointed MillenniumFilmBuff Sign in Permalink I might be the only one brave enough to admit it but this movie was truly disappointing. I thought to myself, where is Christopher Lee? I was looking forward to seeing him in the film but he wasn't here. The entire film was somewhat disappointing. However, one cannot fault the special effects. They were whizmical. No, its certainly not an awful film, quite the opposite. All I'd say is that its not quite up there with the first two. Perhaps if Christopher Lee was in it, I would have given it a better review. This is one plot hole that was seriously mishandled. Rob
8.0~I thought they didn't make 'em like this anymore...I was wrong jessvisser Sign in Permalink Without giving away spoilers, I was astounded at the literary and film quality of this series. The lighting, the wardrobe, everything was just perfect for the setting of each scene. No special-effects nonsense needed. Character development and background is bar-none. The trilogy is put together in such a well-blended way. Everything complements everything else. Overall? Pure quality.
10.0~Brilliant Conclusion benz0325 Sign in Permalink All you have to decide is what to do with the time given to you...(Gandalf) If after 10 plus hours of watching the entire trilogy and all you can do is moan about what is missing, then go see Harry Potter instead. If you decided to take in this epic undertaking of "adapting" this literary classic to the big screen, and truly experienced it for what it is, then you know how to live life. Peter Jackson gave eight years of his life to create the SPIRIT of Tokien's LOTR Trilogy. I loved the books (have read it every few years since 1977), so I know what is missing. I got over it real fast because Peter Jackson's LOTR Trilogy is PJ's vision. It just so happened that a lot of people like his vision, and if anyone else has the talent and courage to spend eight years of your life making a version you like, then good for you. ROTK was a brilliant conclusion to the LOTR Trilogy. The characters the third time around were like old friends that you cared about. The visual effects were even better this time around. The Shelob was incredible. Anyway, I hope that if anyone gives this movie a "1" will at least have the courtesy to watch the movie before doing so. Cheers.
10.0~It all starts with the writing lord2480 Sign in Permalink When Phillipa boyens and peter jackson and fran walsh sat down to write that first few words of the return of the king, they were beginning to write a epic classic. The emotional structure of this movie kicks ass and the battle scenes come clean. But it is the moral of the story, friendship, loyalty, courage, death, bravery, heroism, etc... that make this piece of entertainment worthwhile. From start to finish, the movie excels with it's writing style and characters. It gives us many heartfelt moments and by the end of the movie were all crying and weeping about Frodo leaving the shire and going to the grey havens. What a finish. This deserved 11 academy awards, no doubt.
8.0~Lost Tolkien's vision brianbush Sign in Permalink Probably the best put together of the three, and certainly the most interesting, visually. The important plot points are all there, and I can't fault the script writers for any omissions, but just as with The Two Towers, I take strong objection to some of the changes. Tolkien seems to have been strongly influenced by his experiences in World War I, the realities of trench warfare, tanks and machine guns on the battlefield, and planes overhead. His books carry a strong underlying current about the changes in society due to industrialization, and obviously not just in warfare, but the changes it brought to life in cities as well. This background gives nearly as much to his books as the exceedingly rich fantasy world he created around the books and the richness of his writing. How then can the movie makers completely trivialize these points? How can the Ents, shepherds of the forest and oldest creatures in Middle Earth be completely ignorant of their flock and lacking in wisdom? Were the scriptwriters so lacking in the confidence in their ability to weave in subtle references to Tolkien's metaphor and Peter's ability to communicate that on screen that they had to reduce all mention to trite preaching? Or do they feel their audience wasn't intelligent enough to make the connection and felt they should beat us over the head with it? If I didn't admire the stories and the monumental lengths everyone made towards getting these movies made well in nearly all other aspects, then these niggling bits wouldn't bother me, but as it stands, I'm sorely disappointed.
10.0~The Most Overrated Film Of All Time. dprokop-1 Sign in Permalink Why do people get so obsessed with this movie? I can't believe it' #4 on the top 250 list. I have trouble believing that it is even on the top 250 list. I mean, there are so many better movies out there. First of all, in all three movies thay take way to long to get to where they want to get. 3 hours is way too long, at some parts I got really bored. This movie is for people who define movies as "sweet" or "kick-a**". The people who put this #4 on the top 250 list do not know what kind of other movie there are out there, and were probably high while voting. I mean, if you want to see great battle scenes then go see Braveheart or The Gladiator (they both are great movies) which actually got worse than LOTR 3. Well, i've said everything I wanted To. Overall it was just an okay movie. 5.2/10.
10.0~The Journey Ended a Wonderful Christmas! chenisselao Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was an amazing third part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It was good to show the prologue on how Smeagol/Gollum got the Ring. So it was shown that he murdered his own cousin Deagol. Through this, we can all understand on how Gollum exactly got the Ring. If it hadn't for the prologue, we could have just thought that Gollum got it by himself. But no, what happened was Deagol got it first and stolen by Smeagol by killing Deagol. The effects made in The Three Hunters' visit to the Dimholt road where the ghosts who will answer to the King of Gondor is found is wonderful. It was never seen clearly as digitally edited but more life-like. In the Battle of Pelennor Fields, it was an amazing scene where thousands of orcs were made through Massive, a software intended to create multiples of characters. The ROHAN scenery was great! Theoden s screenplay during that time was most impressively appropriate for their situation. Eowyn also even as a woman acted great by Miranda Otto in taking down the Oliphaunt. I really loved her style. In the part where Legolas was told by Aragorn to take down the Oliphaunt. I love how Legolas acted by Orlando Bloom in that scene. I do not know whether it was digitally edited of his jumping or it was his own stunt. But however it was done, it was amazing and stylish! In the front of the Black Gate scene, I have seen the extended edition of ROTK and the Mouth of Sauron was exclusively shown. I could have wanted it to be part of the movie but I understand that the movie is rate PG-13 and is needed not to show to much brutality. The part where Sam was going to help Frodo out, I understood that the Ring was still tempting Frodo. Have any of you realized that the Ring didn't break out easily? It was because it wanted Frodo to come after it and save it. But Frodo realized to climb up with the help of Sam, and that was the time that the Ring broke because it knew that it will be destroyed once Frodo turns his back on it. I love how they interpreted the Ring's desire into the movie though some may not see it that way. The part where Frodo was going to leave for Valinor, I was sad that part. I even thought to myself "Why would Frodo go?" but when he said to Sam "We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved but not for me." So I realized that Frodo as a hero, did it not for himself but for his beloved home. The movie was incredibly, awesomely, greatly, amazingly, wonderfully, beautifully made! The crew and cast really made Tolkien's work come to life! GO LOTR: ROTK!!!
10.0~Exquisite hatchkathleen Sign in Permalink Perfect wrap up to a wonderful trilogy. This movie, though set in another world, sheds light on the power of hope we so desperately cling to in our own reality. A wonderful blend of superb acting and brilliant script-writing. It is very relatable, however fantastical it may seem, no human wants to be vulnerable and this movie shows that truth.
9.0~Triumph kevin142 Sign in Permalink The mankind finally won the war against the dark lord Sauron. Without co-operation, the victory could not be achieved. Especially Sam played a key role. When Frodo fell in the way to the volcano, he said that I cannot carry the burden for you, but I can carry you. What an encouraging moment. In fact Gollum was the victim of the ring. He was sympathizing and disgusting. His perishing with the ring was the best ending for him. When the four Hobbits bowed to Aragorn, Aragorn said to them that you do not need bowing to us, we should bow to you. Then the rest of people bowed to them. What a touching scene. No doubt the four little man deserved it. There are many elements in the TLOTR trilogy. Good and evil, bright and dark, sacrifice, devotion, friendship, love, betray, they were well embodied in the trilogy. Although a large number of computer-generated effects made the scenes amazing, that was not the point. Of cause the wonderful music cannot be overlooked. I think that TLOTR trilogy represents the highest level of present movie. As to the acting, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen were unforgettable. In all, the acting was satisfying. I think that the Oscar committee should have given the cast an ensemble award. It was said that the trilogy took seven years to shoot. Their effort did not wasted. They will be written into the history of movie. Seventeen Oscar awards proved it. It is the final film of the trilogy. I would like to take the trilogy as one movie because they are inseparable. They are not series like Rocky, Aliens, Jaws, etc. They are a full story. Watching them respectively is meaningless. The trilogy is an all time masterpiece. 9/10
7.0~7/10 - Good, but not that good. Great battles!!!!! mdlarumbe Sign in Permalink This movie is by far the best of the three. Its entertaining, and powerful, it has drama, great acting (although frodo and sam look too much like boyfriends and not close friends. They look very sissy) and amazing battle scenes (probably the best I´ve seen) and altogether, its a great movie, but not the best i´ve seen. I don´t think its going to age that well. for me, a movie to be ranked 10 is the one you can see over and over again. I don´t think this one is that kind of movie. Anyway, the battle scenes were amazing, all I was expecting. like i said, 7 out of 10
10.0~The best movie I've ever seen seehorse72 Sign in Permalink I cannot say enough about this movie. I just sat through it, and despite some leg cramps, it is well worth it. I was completely mesmerized every moment of it. It is intense and beautiful and funny and flows effortlessly from scene to scene. And the end ties everything together so you are not left wondering about anything. The cast was amazing. They all played their parts to perfection. I highly recommend this movie. I really do believe it is the best movie I've ever seen.
10.0~The Best Of The Best? t_king1 Sign in Permalink Well the battle for middle earth is over, and it was worth the wait. LOTR: Return of the King, is the best movie of the series. Everything that made the first one great, and the second one great, was incorporated into one epic event. The story telling of the first one combined with some the sickest battles ever, combine to make one of the best movies of our generation.
10.0~Oh dear... Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear RalphJas Sign in Permalink This film rocks. Big time. Oh, yeah, sure there are some editing problems (where stuff was cut away to keep the running time of the theatrical release somewhat under control) but 99% of the film just plainly delivers. In spades. Come on guys, if you don't like this one, you probably don't like the movies.
10.0~Cinematic Perfection davidwalts Sign in Permalink Probably the most daunting cinematic achievement of all time, the trilogy represents the quintessential battle between good and evil. I can think of no other movie saga that captures the essence of adventure, drama, and storytelling that Lord Of The Rings accomplished. The brilliance in acting, cinematography, musical score, and dialogue yielded an amalgamation of art, that I have yet seen an equal. Truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word, and a Christmas gift for three straight years. I only hope that the studios bring to fruition The Hobbit, which would naturally complete the story. Amazing!
10.0~Awesome movie skillsharereview Sign in Permalink Oh my god, this movie is so great and thriller. I like it so much. This movie is full of new adventures and magic stuff. I love it to watch it again and again.
1.0~Not too positive! mcdonkan Sign in Permalink Actually I was hoping for a grand finale! Since the first installment was a glorious epic tale, and the second was a piece of rubbish, I was thinking that this moive would at least save the triology's face. All starts good, with a nice version of "the becoming of Gollum". But to my dissapointment, once again, the story is told with the use of too much action scenes and some bland conversations. And a gruesome amount of corny one-liners! The feel of an epic dissappears the moment the first flashback comes and the undeniably bad actress Liv Taylor makes an appearance. Yuck! Adn what's the deal with Eowen? She was alright in "The Two Towers" but now she suddenly becomes this "girl power" icon. "I'm not a man!", she says and slays a Nazgul... So what you say? Well, it's not the fact that she isn't a man that kills the Witchmaster, but the fact that it's a Elven blade that strikes him. And if I recall it correctly it's Merry who deals that strike. If the movie only would of stayed true to the book! WHY DOESN'T IT? This was a once in an eternity opportunity... and that dork Peter Jackson blew it! As a movie-fan I'm appaled and as a Tolkien fan I'm angry! RAPE!!!
10.0~No Shire sacking is almost forgivable ;-) Rick_Terminal Sign in Permalink I don't normally fall for hype, but I felt ROTK was an amazing end to an amazing trilogy of films. I'm not interested in what the book purists have to say, all I see is a beautiful crafted film(s) that catch the imagination of the most bland of people! The only comment I have is that it was far too mushy for my liking at the end - I would have liked to see all that nonsence out and the original sacking replaced... At one point I thought Sam and Frodo were going to have a snog.. Scary thought! Ah well, at least sam was a less camp sort of gay... Unlike the previous efforts to represent him... Enjoy!
1.0~Dull, uninvolving, forgettable uncharismatic characters. Craiiiigdavid Sign in Permalink This was the dullest film of the 65 films I have seen all year. It took an age to get going. After 90 minutes many people in the theater simply got up and walked out, the rest were asleep. I personally demanded and got my money back. If people develop DVT through sitting through this then Peter Jackson should watch out. What happened in the Gollum effects department between Two Towers and this entry? For the first few minutes that he appeared he looked like he was made of clay or silly putty. Dreadful effects. I also find the actors in these Lord of the Rings movies to be totally unengaging and uncharismatic. In the end I was willing Frodo to die because I got fed up of his constant whining. Peter Jackson made a BIG mistake dropping Christopher Lee from these films as he was the only one to bring any level of class to them, and was sorely missed. Lord of the Rings will never be remembered as fondly as the original Star Wars Trilogy, simply because it is unremarkable and unmemorable.
10.0~one fabulous film split in three great parts ninnotchka Sign in Permalink I must disagree with the previous comment... I think the key to enjoy the film is never forget it's ONE story made into three parts which are only and exclusively meaningful as a part of a whole, therefore judging them separately seems to me a little pointless as well. Of course character development was way better in The Fellowship of the Ring, because it was the "calm" introduction to the whole ongoing net of conflicts and allegiance, races and people... The Two Towers was devoted to development of action and this one to solving all the pending problems. Classic book structure really. In any case, Tolkien wasn't known for coherent structure and rhythm so adapting such a complex, "untidy" story can't be easy for anyone and certainly it would be nearly impossible not to make the same narrative mistakes the original author did. It has to be said that, for me, The Two Towers would stand out as to how deep (regardless of commercial dictatorship) it takes the story, especially with the addition of scenes in the DVD extended version. I think The Return of the King and the whole trilogy are a brave, spectacular and generally inspired rendition of Tolkien's idea. Maybe ROTK relies too much on special effects, and this is a good idea today that it's all so new for us but how about 20 years from now, when it will all look obsolete and kitsch? The battle scenes are magnificent, in full daylight et al (battles in the rainy dark -Two Towers- looked gloomier and much more dramatic, but must be also easier for technicians to "ornate" digitally), and nearly 3 hours and a half go by incredibly fast considering the slow pace and density of the movie... I NEVER got bored. I sincerely doubt LOTR could have been made any better. I will miss a fourth part.
10.0~Very strong alihpg Sign in Permalink Very strong movie and i Nominates it to all family
7.0~I really liked it, but disappointed with all the hype... Carlwhodoesntlikebenaffleck Sign in Permalink Although I give this movie a 7/10, I actually enjoyed it a lot less than it may seem. With everyone I knew hailing it as the best film ever, I was overly disappointed in this LOTR installment...yet again. I'm not sure if I enjoyed it better than The Two Towers, but I didn't really enjoy any of them that much. However, the art direction, acting, and special effects were classy, and it deserves a 7/10 as a whole.

10.0~The Best Movie Ever Made AragornTheWise Sign in Permalink I am a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and i believe the first two were equally amazing. I had no idea the third movie in the trilogy could proceed the first two. This movie contains everything a classic movie has. Non-stop action, drama, heart-warming and heart-wrenching moments that make you cry. This movie is a rare film in which you can watch over a thousand times and still feel the same rush of action and touching moments as the first time you ever saw it. This film won 11 academy awards and deserved every single one of them because of the amazing special effects and camera shots of the beautiful country of New Zealand. This is my favorite movie of all time and before this trilogy was made I had no idea what Lord of the Rings was. Now that I have watched this trilogy and especially Return of the King, I have become an astronomical fan of the books and movies. You have not lived until you have seen this movie.
7.0~Sweet emotion maupertus Sign in Permalink Peter Jacksons epic Lord of the Rings saga comes to an end with this third and final part and it seems he has the unique gift to make each part better, even if I still really enjoyed The Fellowship. The Return of the King brings in fact exactly the things the book did in comparison to the other books. Everybody will be happy to know that the siege of Minas Tirith is as grand and extraordinary as your imagination could make it. Even in this mass of milling orks and trolls there's still astonishing detail that has time to blossom and catch your attention. The film is darker then the last two, with the Steward of Gondor losing his mind, Frodo getting more under the spell of the ring and a struggle to unite the allies against an all powerful enemy. Indeed, even if most people would have read the books and knew the full story, I'm sure everybody can feel the despair of the hero's. Each Journey, be it that of the ring bearer or that of the king shows us beautiful sights and sounds, from terrifying Nazghul to the magnificent white gates of Minas Tirith. There are but few flaws, one obviously being the fact that it doesn't precisely follow the book. This is however not an argument that makes a film a bad movie, it just isn't the book, but the reasons why the film deviates make for better viewing, as you will be exausted at the emotions unleashed at you for 3 hours. My only real critique could be that certain battles are to rich, taking precious film time from character development, in particular the characters that are introduced for the first time, and ofcourse Sam and Frodo's quest. A great film, maybe not the best of all time (as only time will tell) but it just keeps giving, the best yardstick perhaps the fact that in 201 minutes, I have not once looked upon my watch.
10.0~Excellent FKR-Sanjuro Sign in Permalink The best of the three... I went to the midnight show last night and was blown away. It was a little slow here and there but all in all, it was everything I had hoped for. Thank you Peter Jackson. The finest epic battle sequence ever put to film. Shelob(The Giant Spider) was amazing, freaked me out. The special effects seemed better than the first two. I would have ended the movie at the coronation of the King. A little drawn out at the end.
10.0~Salted Pork: An Analysis adamroulston Sign in Permalink "Salted Pork!" Never was a greater line spoken in movie history.
8.0~One Tolkien Fan's Observations joeebay3 Sign in Permalink To quote from my Two Towers review: "TLOTR is the greatest work of fiction of the twentieth century and ranks highly among the greatest literary works of all time. PJ's movies, however, are not the greatest films of all time. As movies, they're very good, but not excellent. They can't be excellent because they're based on a thousand-page book with too many characters and events to allow for much time to be spent developing any single character or plotline onscreen. The real worth of the films, is that they serve to disseminate Tolkien's message (albeit in abridged form) to many, and hopefully inspire some significant number of people to read the book for themselves." ROTK, like TTT, is very good, but not excellent. Peter Jackson did a commendable job with ROTK and indeed with the entire trilogy, staying largely true to Tolkien's themes, and providing me with a visual treat that I will remember for a long time. PJ did a good job with the relationship between Faramir and his father, Denethor. The emotions come through pretty clearly and evoked a sympathetic response from the non-Tolkien fans in the audience. We don't quite get closure on Faramir, though; after Denethor dies, we don't see much of him again. I loved the visuals during the siege of Minas Tirith. Great action all the way through, from catapults, to cavalry charges, to orc morale breaking. Great scene with Theoden marshaling his riders for his last charge. Forth Eorlingas! (I was waiting for that line.) But as good as the visuals of the siege were, I think PJ should have focused a bit more on emotions, determination, and the will to endure during the siege, as that's the real conflict vs. Sauron. In that light, the Nazgul could have been portrayed as sapping the will to fight, not as air support, giving Gandalf a natural opportunity to develop his character by restoring morale, instead of whacking orcs on the head with his staff. The long time spent on the siege means there isn't much time for Frodo and Sam's journey into Morder. PJ chose to develop Gollum with the early Smeagol sequence, which is fine, but I think it would have been more time-efficient to do it as flashbacks illustrating how Gollum is torn between good and evil. The fight against Shelob shows the same pattern as the siege. Great action, but too much of it, and not enough focus on character. The battle against Shelob should be fought and won as a battle of wills. The spirit of the hobbits, small but indomitable, amplified by the phial of Galadriel, defeats Shelob - not their swordplay. Having spent so much time on action sequences, there's not enough left for the journey to Mordor. Frodo and Sam appear to make the dash to Mount Doom in just a day, while Sauron's lighthouse-style Eye is turned to the North. There should have been plenty of time for Sam's trial by the ring, and a lengthy journey to Mt. Doom over several days, showing Frodo increasingly tormented and at the end of his strength. This would have provided fertile ground for character development and for Sam's "But I can carry you, Mr Frodo" scene, which was well done despite the pacing problem. The Arwen-Aragorn-Eowyn triangle is not resolved, and we don't get emotional closure. After the significant time spent developing the Aragorn-Eowyn relationship in TTT, this feels jarring. The ending suffers from trying to show too many things, none of which are fully developed. PJ should have focused on just one epilogue, and done that properly. In my view, the key one is Frodo's - Good has triumphed but at a great cost, and Frodo is wounded in body as well is in spirit. We don't need to see the hobbits in the Green Dragon, we don't need to see Sam & Rosie. What we need to see is how the ring has hurt Frodo - he doesn't fit in, he's morose, he doesn't get to enjoy the fruits of his labors, eventually departing - with Biblo - at the Grey Havens, a suitable backdrop for a philosophical musing by Gandalf to sum up the entire trilogy. Hopefully the extended edition will fill in some of the holes. Nevertheless, a worthy and difficult achievement by Peter Jackson, a very good film, and a fine introduction to Tolkien's works. I hear PJ might be doing "The Hobbit". I eagerly await that, as long as none of the dwarves call anyone "Laddie". :-)
10.0~A moving and satisfying conclusion. louwburger-42312 Sign in Permalink Visually breathtaking and emotionally powerful, The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is a moving and satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy.
9.0~But for the last half hour, I would give it a ten... snikrepkire Sign in Permalink The last 30 or 40 minutes of this film were abominable. Jackson had made so many alterations to the story throughout the trilogy that were unnecessary, that I can't believe he didn't make the necessary alteration of editing out the last two chapters of the novel. That's a bit extreme, but as a film the logical post-climax conclusion of the movie would have been the coronation of Aragorn. From here he could have had a brief montage of Shire events, then a nice visually stunning ending of Elven ships sailing away at the very end. 5 minutes, not 30. If he was going to cut something it should have been the painfully boring ending, and NOT TOM BOMBADIL !!!! -Other than that, best movie of the year, best trilogy ever, best fantasy film ever, best story to film adaptation ever, best use of CGI yet, great performances, etc. etc. etc.
10.0~A masterpiece in cinema history jackman_fan Sign in Permalink This movie does not deserve me to comment it. I loved the whole trilogy, but this is the BEST of all the three. It has everything you want in a movie. It has lots of action and adventure, has bits of comedy here and there, there is romance but most of all drama. The Lord of the Rings teaches us so many lessons. It shows us love, friendship, hope, loyalty, strength and faith. The movie is breath taking yet, very real. The actors, of course, are superb. This is probably one of the best ensemble cast in cinema history. The direction, production, everything has never been seen before, and they did it. The special effects did not overshadow the script. That is probably one hard thing to do, especially for this kind of movie, but it worked. Every single thing, every tiny detail contributes to this digital masterpiece. When you watch this you feel like you're there, in the war in Gondor to the drama of Faramir and king Denethor, to Frodo and Sam's adventure in Mordor. Few movies make me cry, but this defied that. This is truly one of the most wonderful movies ever created. It truly deserved those 11 academy awards, and it should have gotten more like for Best Supporting Actor= Viggo Mortensen , Best Actor= Elijah Wood. I rate this movie 10/10.
10.0~WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hawkeye4077th Sign in Permalink This was the best movie I've ever seen. No joke. Best of the three movies. It gave you every emotion you can think of it was that good. The battles were terrific and the story of Frodo and Sam was amazing. Luckily, the movie was 3 hours and 30 minutes, so you have a long while to enjoy it. I wish I could go back.
10.0~10/10 a movie you'll have to watch again, and again aidar24 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's "The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy is a Legendary Masterpiece. It's one of best Epic Fantasy of our time. Many actors and actresses made this movie possible, possibly only Elijah Wood could play "Frodo Baggins". The Return Of The King begins with Gollum's past, shows how Gollum endured with the ring. Then goes to the present of the Frodo and Sam on their Journey to the fires of Mount Doom. The main plot of the movie was that Suaron is determined to wipe-out the human-race, But only the King of Gondor can stop him. There is no point of telling more, if you haven't seen 3rd Movie, then your just missing out on the greatest movies of our time.
10.0~A Masterpiece. cresmix Sign in Permalink Finally. The concept "a greatest achievement in cinematic history" has found its name. And it's "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King". It is next to impossible to gift that movie with an epithet of appropriate glory and magnificence. It would be next to impossible to create a movie that could beat the "King" for a status of the "most superb film of alltime". For this movie jumped over all possible laths and bounds. It is a masterpiece. Leaving aside the tech perfection of the film and the creativity of all those artists whose immense efforts made the "King" the most accomplished and mind-blowing adaptation in present history, I'd like to say only two words: Peter Jackson. Yes, folks, this is the Man for whom all of us, movie and Tolkien fans, must pray everyday. My dear Mr PJ - bless you! You've made so many people purely happy. Back to the movie, I'd like to say one main thing to its characterization: it is a movie with a Soul. A Soul that is undying, immortal, mighty and limitless... It is a visual fantasy, it is an emotional outburst, it is a Labour of so many talents, whose incredibly believable performances and marvellous work we'll be cherishing for many many years. 3 hours are nothing when every scene is received with a bated breath. And there were so many: the first glimpse of Minas Tirith, the lighting of the beacons, the Pelennor Fields (*something totally beyond my cognition and perception*), Shelob (no comments), Sam carrying Frodo, the Coronation and the Grey Havens - a whole ocean of others. My only tiny resent was caused by the absence of the Faramir/Eowyn romance, though I see perfectly well why it had to be cut out, and now I'm laying my hopes on PJ to include it into the EE b/c as a devoted book fan I love it so much. All in all: an exquisite, glorious, terrific end to a great story. Which, speaking the obvious, surpassed its prequels. FOTR and TTT were fantastic but ROTK is everything they could be. It is a movie which essence no award is able to acclaim. A flawless finale and a triumph in its pure sense.
10.0~A Brilliant Conclusion eiratan Sign in Permalink As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street. We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise. That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created. The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words. If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out). As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.
10.0~Jared's Review bix171 Sign in Permalink This movie was a spectacular movie. Definitely, the hardest role to play had to either be Sam played by Sean Astin, or Frodo played by Elijah Wood. There is the most action in this movie than the other two. Aragorn played by Viggo Mortensen, who is starting in a whole new movie called Hidalgo, is an awesome actor but isn't in the movie a whole lot. The special affects are amazing, especially the dead people and the King of the dead played by Paul Norell. Also, when Legolas (Orlando Bloom) shoots down an elephant, it happens so fast. Arwen (Liv Tyler) has to make a decision between a mortal life or an elven life. There are some funny comments by Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) in the movie. But an absolutely great job by Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf, he also makes many funny comments in the 3 hours 20 minutes of the movie. Merry played by Dominic Monaghan has a big surprise for the fans. Miranda Otto who plays Eowyn has a huge role in this movie. Billy Boyd taken to the safest place on middle-earth, Minis Tirith, makes a big mistake. I say that these three movies make up the best trilogy. But I'll leave you to do the work and see what happens if Arwen makes the big decision, or what happens with Merry and Pippin, or what Eowyn does. And lastly, will Frodo throw the one ring that rules them all into the fires of Mount Doom?
10.0~Shell-shocked Dante8 Sign in Permalink Forgive my unpolished thoughts here, but I wanted to counter some of the negative comments about the movie. I have to say that I saw this movie a week ago and I still am in a variable state of awe and sadness. The movie, by far, exceeded my expectations. This comes from someone who hasn't read the books (although I will now), and I watched the previous 2 at least 4 times each to finally feel like I totally understood where the characters were coming from. (And, I thought that the first half of Fellowship was a little slow but I loved Two Towers). The only negative things that I concur with are the dizzying effects and the volume of the war sequences. I have heard multiple people getting sick if they were at the front of the theater because of the effects. But, I thought it was appropriate in the same way that the intro scene from "Saving Private Ryan" made me sick (and both of these were better use of camera effects than the cutting I found in "Seven" which made me more nauseated). Battle scenes like this are meant to be disorienting. I felt more "into" the movie as a result of it. Also, the length is annoying if you are in uncomfortable seats, but I thought that an intermission would have drawn you out of the movie. Although my neck hurt after the movie was over, I was so enthralled that I couldn't care much about what was going on in the real world. Some feel that the spider sequence was too hyped. I guess I didn't follow the news groups as thoroughly because I didn't think that the whole movie would peak at that scene. But, I thought that the upwards looking shot with the spider over Frodo was one of the best shots in recent film (IMHO). As for the ending, I thought that the resolution was appropriate given the trilogy. I would have felt short-changed if we did not find out what became of the characters given that we have become such a part of their quest. (And, since I didn't read the books yet, I didn't know). I would have liked a little more about the humans and elves, but I still loved the ending. Many of my friends are much more avid fans than I - some read the books EVERY year. Most saw it at midnight on opening night. Most have already seen it multiple times. I consider myself a moderate fan at most, and I am still am both teary-eyed and orgasmic a week later. I thought it was a roller-coster of emotions at the end, and I am impressed by the intricacies of the plot and how integral each character is at the end. Does it deserve the academy awards? Absolutely - Peter Jackson and Best Picture for sure. I think Sean A. also did a spectacular job. And, it probably deserves Best Score and best screenplay too.
3.0~A Fool's Hope info-239 Sign in Permalink *SPOILER ALERT* The latest hoopla for the last and weakest film of the trilogy from Jackson came to myself and friends as quite a shock. I have always been a huge fan of the books, but I must say that I was rather disappointed. Why? 1) Weak performances from the cast-- most notably, the characters of Denethor, Aragorn and Frodo. These performances did nothing to make me feel anything for them or what would happen to them in the story. Such a hammy portrayal of Denethor (what's up with him stuffing his face during the entire song of Pippin?) 2) Absolute terrible film scoring by Howard Shore (as usual) 3) Poor compositing for the effects, in most of the crucial scenes--most notably: Mt. Doom. Frodo's feet float above the ground. 4) A Porky Pig orc captain that ruins any sense of danger at the Pelennor Fields Battle. 5) Jackson's intermittent disrespect for the characters. Most notably--Gandalf striking down Denethor . . . twice! The Dead King looking like he came out of Army of Darkness with a swiss cheese face. 6) The biggest abuse of slow-motion in cinematic history (even beyond that of John Woo) Jackson shamelessly pimps out elements of the story for audience cheers and laughs. Whether it's Gandalf hitting someone, the Palantir turning into a ball of fire, or Smeagol & Frodo battling for the ring after Smeagol has already won it from him. Even the Lord of the Nazgul scene--which is already set up to be a crowd-pleaser. The Nazgul waits long enough for Eowyn to deliver her line, remove her helmet, tossle her hair and stab him. Why? Only to give time for a bigger cheer from the audience. After all, isn't that what it's all about? Like Legolas surfing on an orc shield or a Mumakil trunk? And why show Denethor as an evil man trying to burn Pippin and then jump off the cliff of Minas Tirith? Doesn't this trivialize the Father/Son conflict of the story? Sentiment was often transformed to cheese for "dramatic effect". Utterly disappointing. However: The Oliphaunts and Shelob are very impressive. There are also many battle shots that came through spectacularly--particularly the Nazgul fell beasts. Unfortunately, in the more sensitive scenes with hobbits, whenever we see them from afar they are obviously a dwarf double or some poorly composited green screen effect. Sean Astin did a poignant performance as Samwise. Ian was fantastic once again as Gandalf--even dispite his character continuity problems. Miranda was also wonderful and very touching. I can't wait to see more films with her. Merry and Pippin, even though simplified, added a touch of innocent naive enthusiasm. Pippin's loyalty to his position as guard of Minas Tirith and Merry's puppy love for Eowyn were great. I realize that this will be a hopelessly negative review to a film that has already made over 30 million before the end of it's first weekend. There are obviously people that LOVE this film. I've written this review primarily for those who are LOTR book fans like myself that are looking for a more critical take on the film before seeing it or those that actually have seen it and are feeling just as confused as I am as to why everyone else seems to love it as much as we wish we could. In fact, I would have been much better off in the theatre if a reviewer had warned me ahead of time about a few things--and I'm not talking about the omission of Saruman or The Scouring of the Shire. This will be the version of Tolkien's masterpiece remembered for generations and years to come. It is a pity that it wasn't treated with the subtlety and care it truly deserved. But then again it was only "a fool's hope" that it could be made in the first place. Hats off to Jackson for trying, even if he didn't fully succeed. We'll always have the books.
10.0~Stunning. zapdude Sign in Permalink I'm not sure I can add much to what many of the comments here are saying. This is part three of a three part epic, and in my opinion the complete package is the best single movie ever made. Just as in the books, almost every loose end is wrapped up. We all knew that good would eventually triumph over evil, but watching it evoked strong emotions. I still have the uncanny sense that Peter Jackson somehow managed to take cameras TO MIDDLE EARTH and film the actual events as they unfolded. And, more than this, I pity those few who don't "get" these movies. In Fellowship, I had tears in my eyes at the loss of Gandalf. Sure, he comes back, but the characters don't know that! (possible spoiler, next paragraph only) In Return of the King, I had tears in my eyes at a couple of moments. My favorite single moment was when Aragorn said "My friends, You bow to no one", followed by the entire host of men bowing to the hobbits. The scene where the Eagles pull Sam and Frodo to safety almost had me bawling, it was so beautifully crafted, and SO reminiscent of the original art in the Tolkien books. I believed that Minas Tirith existed, that somehow they managed to build the entire city as the world's largest movie set. Stunning. Unfortunately, the movies are not perfect, but what is RIGHT so outweighs what isn't perfect that I won't even bother trying to detail everything. One day, CG will be better. The transitions into and out of computer animation are seamless, but the CG characters flop around unrealistically. They also have sticky feet that allow them to stand on moving monsters without effort. Niggles, and it doesn't detract from the story. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more at Cirith Ungol, more about the end of Saruman, and the Scouring of the Shire. But hey, the Extended DVD will have this, and I can wait. Barely. I must have been one of the luckiest moviegoers this week. I managed to see this movie in a packed theater, with absolutely NO sound problems, no picture problems, and complete (actually spooky) silence from the audience at the silent parts. Nobody laughed at an inappropriate moment, nothing. I'm assuming that the majority of people who would go through the effort of standing in line for 45 minutes to get a ticket, another hour in line to get into the theater, and enduring the 26 minutes of ads prior to the actual movie would be serious fans of the series.
10.0~Masterpiece Trilogy nineXtwelve Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy takes its place -- alongside the symphonies of Beethoven, the pyramids of Egypt, and the original books by J.R.R. Tolkien -- on the list of the greatest creative achievements in human history.
10.0~The Greatest movie not only of 2003 but of all time(possible spoilers) Dark_gollum713 Sign in Permalink Wow! What is their to say about such a deeply layered and inspiring movie. The action is intense. The dialog feels completely real. The movie is made in such a way that even though there is absolutely no way it could be real, you feel sucked right into it. If I'm going to review this movie I'm going to have to start with the acting which in my opinion completely makes this movie great and will be the component that holds it together as a masterpiece far into the future. Sean Astin is the highlight of the film as Samwise Gamgee(A trustworthy hobbit who protects Frodo.) His acting is brilliant. He makes you care so much for the character that you are actually rooting for him and against Frodo for a part of this film. When Frodo tells Sam to go home you feel betrayed right along with Sam. You want to share his tears. Next in the acting lineup is Andy Serkis' amazing portrayal of Gollum. I do not understand why people find this character annoying. To me he is the best skitzophrenic ever put on film. Although his part is slightly smaller in this movie then the Two Towers, the acting and achievement of Gollum are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Although Elijah Wood's Frodo plays a supporting role to Sean Astin's Sam he is still breath-takingly real in his performance of Frodo. You can literally feel the weight on his shoulders as he edges towards Mordor. I have only begun to name the tremendous performances in this film. Ian Mckellan's Gandalf will probably go down as one of the legendary film characters and that is not due to the actions of the character, but the subtle expressions that come over Gandalf's face in the middle of intense conflict. There is a scene played with Gandalf and Billy Boyd's Pippen right before a gate is going to come crashing down because of the Dark Lord Sauron's army. The writing in this scene and the performances exploring life after death are nothing if not perfect. John Noble plays the very messed up Denthor to near perfection. All of the performances in my opinion were Oscar-worthy and the only reason they did not get nominated was that there were too many great performances to pick from. Among the best of the performances however is Miranda Otto's portrait of Eowyn, where she displays strength, grace, beauty, intelligence, and a desire for something more then she has with awesome depth. Now I have finished talking about the acting which highlights the film. Unlike most Hollywood blockbusters the effects are not the story but just a part of it. The effects are nothing if not extraordinary. The Battle of Pellenor Fields is the greatest battle ever put to film. Peter Jackson obviously had a passion for the books and it shows. What I'm trying to basically say is that the Lord of the Rings the Return of the King deserved its 11 Oscars very much and it is in my opinion the greatest film of all time.
10.0~It is a masterpiece acommodus Sign in Permalink It is difficult to talk about such a brilliant excellent film. The film never before has combined courage, bravery, grief, desperation and honor like RoTK. I could not understand how time passed so fast. This is the best film in the movie history. LOTR is a legend. and the legend of the film is another legend.
10.0~Best of the three! pa-reporters Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has done us proud by bringing in this fantastic trilogy with a brilliant, heart-warming and faithful third film. I had a few worries, especially after hearing that Christopher Lee's scenes had been cut, but for me this was definitely the best of all the films. The bits that had to be cut seemed logical, and I don't think there was anything really important missed out. My only concern is that people who haven't read the book won't really understand why the Denethor (Steward of Gondor and Boromir and Faramir's father) character is the way he is, but I'm sure that will be cleared up in the extended DVD version next Christmas. Having been slightly disappointed by the way the Matrix panned out, more because the long wait built up anticipation which it really couldn't deliver on, I'm really pleased that LOTR has been consistently good. The only problem is though - what do moviegoers have to look forward to now? Lisa
8.0~The final battle for the salvation giannisholoudis Sign in Permalink The final battle for the salvation of Middle Earth begins ... The Frodo and Sam, led by the demon Gollum, continue their dangerous journey to hell of Mordor in their attempt to reach Mount Doom and destroy the Ring! But their paths will then divide by subversive encounters with mysterious beings that appear on their way. And while the dark of Mordor stretches menacingly Middle Earth, revealed that Aragorn is the lost king of Gondor. The Aragorn, therefore, decides to travel to Minas Tirith with those who have left the Fellowship, to defend the ancient and holy city at any price. The armies lined up and the countdown to the battle of Good against Evil begins
10.0~MY experience of this film... thea-in-nz Sign in Permalink I was on of the thousands of avid fans to queue up at an ungodly hour of this morning (the 17th December - a GREAT day!) to watch the final installment of LOTR! With my dad and several dozens of other fans we waited for the cinema shutters to be pulled up and we ducked under them in a backwards Indiana Jones style move to be at the front of the queue at the bottom of the escalators to go up to the screen!!! Despite the fact that we were all desperate to be first in the cinema there was a certain amount of comradely joy shared by us with this mob excitement climaxing with a whoop of joy as the screen showing the category certificate came on screen stating those beautiful words: The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King... This whoop from an excitable fellow in the back row was followed by an hysterically excited laugh from the rest of the audience who remained wonderfully and respectfully quite through the film other than the occasional uncontrollable whoop or sob or cheer!! (I personally found it hard to contain my sobs of both joy and utter despair during...many stages of the film! The first being...ooh...about 4 minutes in!!) I don't want to spend this comment telling you what happens in this film (as I'm sure you will see it at which I don't want to spoil it for you OR (more likely) you have seen it and don't need to be told!!!) I want to just mention the profound effect that this film had on me, even after applauding the closing credits and going to have a moment to calm down I was still crying when I left the cinema! Not sure whether it was because of the content of the film or whether it was just the uncontrollable near hysteria that I felt as I wondered round Manchester in a COMPLETE daze banging into irate Christmas shoppers and soap stars (from Corrie!!) I came out of the cinema 6 hours ago but still can't put into words how I felt about this film...I've just spent the last few hours alternately smiling and crying!!! (Yes, I am THAT sad!!!) I just want to finish by saying to any fans out there who are sad that it's all over, that its not! By a long way! I personally am going to see it twice in the next two days with various friends and then I get to enjoy talking and reading and watching it for months and years and decades to come...that's the great thing about these films - they'll be around forever and they'll be loved for longer than that!! :) (If that doesn't help then just think about the DVDs and special showings and box sets that you've got to look forward to! Trust me...these films aren't going anywhere...)
10.0~Cinematically one of the greatest films ever captured! mperez314159278945 Sign in Permalink Peter Jacksons Best work so far! The depth in the relationship of the fellowship continues to fall apart as Frodo and Sam Reach their destination; I liked the sense of compassion between each of the characters although they weren't always with each other. Although the book is more Intriguing the way the screenplay was composed worked perfectly! This excellent work of art lives up to its reputation with its amazing 11 academy award winning Oscars! With more pain, suffering, and loss throughout the story, the actors deliver a powerful sense of their characters with their talents. In my opinion this is my favorite out of the three part trilogy!!!
10.0~brilliant amanda-daniel-142-653834 Sign in Permalink I've never seen a series like this. A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible? I have always loved the original "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. They do not make films like these anymore. As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where "Two Towers" ends, so brush up before seeing it. I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective. I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done "right". And when it happened, it was. I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.
10.0~Best trilogy! mehmet_okudan_07 Sign in Permalink When while your watching, Make sure you're having one of the most precious moments of your life.
10.0~One of the Best! heathypower Sign in Permalink When I first saw The Return of The King, I watched it at home with my mom and dad. I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy so much! The Return of the King comes 2nd on my LOTR list, the first being The Fellowship of the Ring. Andy Serkis does such a fantastic job as gollum and Orlando Bloom steals my heart away as Legolas. My favorite character must be Aragorn, because I love dark damaged characters. The scene I found most entertaining was when Samwise battled Shelob to save Frodo, and when Sam was killing the orcs, also while trying to save Frodo. Anyway, the visuals were great, the actors were fantastic, and I wouldn't have changed a thing.
10.0~If you are literate, you'll love it hasantha Sign in Permalink In my experience the most significant factor in determining how people respond to this, and all three movies, is whether they have read the books. Of my friends the ones who have read the books and were mesmerised by the new world, complete with its culture, new languages, history and art, were equally mesmerised by Jackson's magnificent portrayal. Watching the movies was like re-living one's mental images while reading the books. Of my friends who had not read the books, they enjoyed the epic scenery, some liked the spunky characters (Legolas, Aragorn and Arwen) and the humour and most thought they were great movies. However they didn't think they were spectacular, like the rest of us. The reason is there is so much that is not said, and not shown. If you thought the ending was long it actually omits huge sections of the book! Middle-Earth tragics, like myself, had to be drawn to the ending gently. There are also the nuances of the dwarf-elf antagonism, the religious overtones and romantic liasons which are barely touched upon, but readers will see and appreciate the subtle references. As I have read the books, and watched the films with friends who were also fans, the entire experience was magnificent, and for us the third (but hopefully not final) film was given an unanimous verdict: The greatest films ever made.
10.0~I couldn't believe it. Roger_Sterling Sign in Permalink I could not believe what I had seen when I walked out of the theater about 2 years ago. This is probably the greatest movie I've ever seen. About a year ago I saw the extended version, and I can only say that the 50 minutes only add to the experience. But, as great as this movie is, it has its share of flaws. Gandalf speaking to pippin about a "far green country". The point of that was....? Acting is not terrible, not as bad as some people say. Special effects are amazing. Mt. Doom, the eye of Sauron and Shelob looked great. The battle at the Black Gate was good, but pales compared to the battle of Pelennor Fields. This is EASILY the best of the 3 rings. In my opinion, it is not overrated at all. Is it worth renting? No. This masterpiece is worth owning, especially the extended edition.
10.0~Absolutely Amazing!!! irishlouise15 Sign in Permalink This is an amazing film. Having read the books, I was very interested to see how Peter Jackson would finish off the trilogy....just BRILLIANT! I can't think of any words positive enough about this film. The action sequences are unbelievable and more. The battles are astounding. And, the acting superb. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin portray the relationship between Frodo and Sam brilliantly. This is just an amazing film, that deserves all recognition it gets. Just amazing....
10.0~ The Road Goes Ever On denis888 Sign in Permalink Well, in the LOTR book, the noble elves never had those pinpointed ears, and the death of Saruman was not like a deleted scene in the DVD version, and then there was not the feat of Legolas of killing an elephant so easily, and then Sam never held Frodo hanging on a cliff There are many points of bitter criticism of the film, and many are true. But do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film? No, they will never do. The siege of Minas Tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. The final battle near Mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. The brilliant array of talents of Weaving, Mortensen, Wood, Tyler, Serkis, Urban, Wenham, Astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. The film has stood the test of time, and any time you see the Sauron fall, you feel elation, pride, joy and great triumph. The Good has won again, and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins, it will reign for ever and ever. The final scene of the film, with the parting of Bilbo and Frodo together with the great elves and Gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears, for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us. Many films may be made on the eternal novel of Mr. Tolkien, but this epic will stand in our memory eternally. The road goes ever on.
10.0~The greatest masterpiece of motion picture history. Rybergare Sign in Permalink I did not read the books before watching this, well i read The Fellowship the Ring, the first on before watching just this movie, the third. Because i loved the first two to death. And i am writing this review for all three because i see them as one big movie divided by three. But i think The Return of the King is the best one so that is why i write the review here. I think The Lord of The Rings Trilogy is the best movie/movies in history. Great acting, great environments, great characters, great story, great world, great....i could go on forever. Everything is just perfect. I could not say much more. Just watch it, all three movies, and you will be crushed by movie beauty, crushed under the feet by this undefeated masterpiece. Best movie of all time. Thank Mr. Peter Jackson and JJR Tolkien for this.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings is the best film of all time. dgeer80 Sign in Permalink Minor Spoilers... One word can be used to summarize this movie: Perfect. Well, at least it was perfect for me. Some people complain about an overly long ending, others complain about there being no Saruman, and the list goes on. I, however, basically had no problems with those things and most of the other complaints people have had, which aren't many. Most people loved this film. I am no different. This film deserved every Oscar it won. The movie was simply amazing. Everything from the beautiful battle scenes, the acting, and the story were top notch. I really don't think anyone can ask for a better conclusion to a trilogy and not be insane. I loved how the subject of friendship was used. Sam's willingness to go until death for Frodo was just amazing. I don't know one person who didn't feel incredible emotion when Sam says, "I can't carry it for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you!" Howard Shore's "Into the West" score combined with this already emotional scene just makes one weep. In fact, Shore's score for this entire film was amazing. I also really loved the ending. Why? Wasn't it too long? Absolutely not. I felt that this was a perfect ending to a trilogy. We're not just ending one film here, but three films(or one very long film). There's much more to conclude than just saying, "Ok, the battle's won so let's all go home now. The End." That just wouldn't be good enough. It's imperative that we see Frodo re-unite with the Fellowship. It's imperative that we see the celebration at Minis Tirith. It's imperative that we follow up on Frodo and Sam's lives after all that's happened to them, especially the Grey Havens since the subject of people having to go to the Grey Havens to leave Middle Earth has been referred to throughout all three films. And, for fans of the books, this film could not have ended without Sam saying, "Well, I'm back." The ending was an ending for every main character who was in possession of, tempted by, or involved with the One Ring. It was an ending to the Fellowship. So we must deal with every character in some way, some more than others(like Frodo and Sam). In my opinion it is ONE ending, because it deals with everyone involved with the ONE Ring. That, and every scene in the ending was just absolutely beautiful. And I think once people watch it on DVD, a medium in which one can take breaks, then the people who didn't like the ending will grow more fond of it. Most people were just tired of sitting in the theater for three hours straight that they were ready to get out of there, despite the fact that this ending was needed. I think these films really need an intermission half way through when viewed in a theater. [SIDE BAR] The absence of Saruman is something I do sorely miss. However, the way the scene is filmed where the "Voice of Saruman" chapter WOULD be is true to the book. But now, from rumors I'm hearing that we'll actually see Saruman get killed in the Extended Edition, I'm leaning towards the way the theatrical cut has this scene. The reason being because if we see Saruman actually die, then it's a completely different ending to Saruman's story. In the theatrical cut, from what we observe, he's locked in his tower to rot and wither away over time with no real confrontation from Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, etc. "And there he must remain...He's no power anymore" to quote Gandalf. That's exactly the opposite of what happens in the Extended Editions(if what I've heard is true). Sure, it'll be great to see Saruman in ROTK. But a totally different ending for him? The reason I'm bringing this up is because the Extended Editions of the first two films only enhanced the story. It didn't change it. The plot was still the same throughout. Sure, there were different scenes replacing theatrical cut scenes here and there, but the outcome of the plot was the same. The Extended Editions should only enhance the plot, not change it. I'll learn to live with it just for the sake of seeing Saruman, but I don't think that's the best way to go about it. As of right now, I don't have a problem with Saruman missing from ROTK. [END SIDE BAR] One minor flaw in this film was the demise of the Witch King. I really don't think the idea that only a woman could kill him was emphasized enough, because they say in the film that "No man can kill him." But referring to "man" could imply mankind. I don't know if there's any good way that this could've been said without ruining the surprise of Eowyn killing him. Maybe it could've been worded a different way. The dialogue could go something like this[referencing the book]: "It was prophecied [by the elves?] that no man can kill him. But I [Gandalf] have hope that perhaps someday someONE will." Because the way it comes off is like some girl power thing. I'll live with it, but I just thought the idea of it all could've been described and executed better. The other plot line involving the Witch King was the one where the Sloth-looking orc asks him, "What of the Wizard[Gandalf]?" Then the Witch King says, "I will break him." But then we never see any confrontation whatsoever. The Extended Edition will cover this since there was a confrontation filmed. It was actually in the theatrical trailer. The way it is now technically works. We just assume the Witch King either never got around to it, or it happens off screen. But ultimately this is a bad edit, and they should've just left out that little bit of dialogue between the orc and the Witch King, and just have it be apart of the Extended Edition along with the actual confrontation. Minor (and very few) flaws aside, this film is beautiful, emotional, and ultimately the best film I have ever seen. Actually, I really should say that The Lord of the Rings is the best film I have ever seen, because ROTK is only the conclusion to one long movie split into three parts which were all excellent. Nothing has ever been done quite like it, and it's something that will be treasured for generations to come.
10.0~Is there such thing as a perfect film? jdaames Sign in Permalink Well I don't know about you but yes there is and it's this film. Peter Jackson took one of the greatest stories in history and made a masterpiece of a film. Wrtten b J.R.R Tolkien ''The Lord Of The Rings'' was a the holy grail of cinema and I'm not surprised it had such a cult following up to it's final installment ''The Return Of The King''. When I entered the cinema on the 11th of December 2003 I had no idea what i was about to go through. The sheer amount of emotions brought to the screen in ''The Return Of The King'' was astonishing and I soon found myself crying like a small child towards the end of the film. After two years of L.O.T.R madness it finally came to a close in the most spectacular fashion ever. Now even four years on from L.O.T.R no other fantasy orientated film could have even come close to the genius of Tolkien and Jackson and it firmly deserved every Oscar it won and it's spot as one of the greatest films of all time.
7.0~***SPOLIERS*** lvscott Sign in Permalink OK guys, I agree this is a "master piece" of film making, no doubt; However, what is Frodo touted as the hero here? The little hobbit failed his task miserably. Sam is the real hero and in my opinion, his character was enjoyable. Frodo's character was not. Ya, always entrust a great task to a person who takes bad advice (keeps telling Same in all 3 movies "you are right Sam" but chooses to ignore his advice none the less, esp about that dirty little "Gollum".. Then he finally gets to the Mountain where he needs to destroy the ring, only to turn around to Sam and tell him "The Ring is mine", puts it on, and the only reason the damned ring gets destroyed is because Frodo fights for it back with Gollum.. I sure wish they would have killed off Frodo in the first film!! all that wisdom and they could not choose the right guy for the job? Frodo the hero? They should have taken Sam into The West, but instead they take someone who if he had his own way, middle earth would have been the fire eye, "also a moron for a villain" Saron's!! I bet you Frodo found a way to sink that nice little ship!! Now we can see why all these morons got into this whole mess in the first place? BAD DECISION MAKING will screw up 3000 years everytime!! Really now, 13 months to defeat Sauron and destroy The Ring right? Yet all the wisdom of the characters, esp Gahndaff, and he cant figure out that all they needed to do was get on of those "eagles" to fly Frodo (well not Frodo, but Sam, since Frodo is an idiot) over Mt Doom and drop the ring into the Mountain? haha!! Oh but we cannot have that; That would mean one 2 hour movie!! I have never read the book, and I do not think I want to!! Well having said all of the above, the rest of the series, from the 2nd movie on, has great battle scenes, plots and real intelligent and well thought out sequences. For me the whole "Destroying the ring" deal was a total absurdity! Take the Ring away and we have "The Lord of The Battles" because that is where the real strength of these movies reside!!
10.0~Great, just like the first one. WeirdRaptor Sign in Permalink There's a lot to cover on this film, since it is 3 1/2 hours long with A LOT happening. First of all, the photography of the sights is nothing short of superb. The acting is powerful, aspecially Sean Astin's, the battles are true epic scale, and the story is excellently told. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys 'The Lord of the Rings' or other fantasy works.
10.0~Great movie, a fitting ending to a brilliant trilogy bren_316 Sign in Permalink This movie is fantastic, while it differs from the book slightly which is disappointing to Tolkien purists, the movie delivers on every aspect expected with brilliant directing from Peter Jackson and excellent acting from the entire cast and the extraordinary creation and animation of Gollum. Credit must go to the WETA team who made this movie so realistic and detailed. Some people may say the ending tends to drag on a while, but it raps up everything very well. This is a brilliant stand-alone movie, as well as a truly great ending to a magnificent trilogy.
10.0~Excellent shadownlite Sign in Permalink I saw Return of the King on opening day and have to say that it was worth the buying the tickets in advance and waiting to get in for a good seat. It was full of drama, humor, action, emotion, and the most impressive battle scenes I have seen in recent time. I sat awestruck for 3 1/2 hours not once wishing for it to end and feelings ad when it did. take in with just one sitting. I was a little surprised that a lot of the film was of actions that took place in the Two Towers book of the trilogy...but they included just enough of the Return of the King book to be satisfying to this fan. I am planning to see Return of the King again and take more of it in because there is so much happening in the book and it is impossible to take in with just one viewing. Bravo Peter Jackson!
10.0~Speechless tsnake Sign in Permalink The final journey of the 3 picture epic does not disappoint. Purists might complain of some missing content and changes... but that's a moot point by now. There was a little more time between scene switches this time, which did make it easier for some to follow probably. I felt that they way all the ends stories/plots were tied up was awesome. There were plenty of emotional up-down-up-down moments like strikes in a kick-boxing ring. I honestly can't say much else. I was blown away yet again. I only have a few "issues", but nothing that could possibly lower my 10/10 rating for this. One question I wonder... was the first fly-by to Edoras intentionally played in reverse for effect? Or because the scene looked better that way? I'm sure the answer is about the effect.. I'm just not sure what PJ was going for. Now to await my second theatrical viewing of it with the family and the extended DVD release.
10.0~one of the best films ive ever seen zchallinor Sign in Permalink Such a great film, so well put together, well done everyone involved.
8.0~One Movie to rule them all MadFlava Sign in Permalink Glad like a small child I entered my cinema to see all three movies in a row. I was sure that this movie never would disappoint me..but it did..a little bit. Everybody knows that the story was changed a little bit in Part 1 and 2 but in Part 3 The Return Of The King the changings weight much more than in the other two parts. The biggest mistake is in the beginning, when Samuran doesn´t appear ! I can understand when Christopher Lee lives in big anger now. You can not handle a legendary Artist in that way. Besides C.Lee reads the Lord Of The Rings each year ! The next problem is that the audience often recognizes that there are a lot of cuts purpose a bit of the sound is missing or the next scene doesn´t fit really. The next thing which disturbs me was the atmosphere. For example there was a lot of suspence in Part Two when the Uruk-Hai Army arrived at Helms Deep. In Part 3 everything goes too hasty. We have to remember that the extented version will goes 1:30 Minutes longer ! The final chapter of the movie is completly different of the book. Maybe you will like it maybe not. I was a little bit too confused about that. Besides that it is still a great movie. Everybody acts well, there are still great effects, funny dialogs, bloody action scenes and an end theme song from Annie Lennox where some people of the audience started to cry ! I hope that this fantasy trilogy will change the mind of hollywood that fantasy isn´t profitable and that they will produce much more movies like that. Maybe it will have the same effect as Star Wars-A new hope. So let us hope for more movies like that. Hail to the King !
1.0~Incredibly stupid morfeus Sign in Permalink Well, as all of the Tolkien's books are nothing more than some dumb fairy-tales , any movie based on Tolkien's book is gonna...(well Jay and Silent Bob fans, you know the quote).I don't like, but I tolerate fanatsy in gerenal, but this is by far! Anyone who likes sitting and watching orcs and goblins speaking single-minded lines about some trashcan-worth ring for 2 hours are welcome. Any sane person KEEP OUT! 0/10
10.0~Excellent, mind-blowing and just too cool... DrNorton Sign in Permalink Saw the premiere of the movie last night at midnight and I was completely blown away. First things first, I loved the first movie, saw it a bunch of times in the cinema, then I bought the extended DVD and I loved it even more. The second movie, I saw twice in the cinema, then I waited until the extended was out, bought it and just saw it once or twice. On both these first movies the cinema versions were great, the extended versions excellent. Enter: Return of the King. Just the first scene blew me away (spoiler start) when we get to see Sméagol and Déagol finding the ring and fighting over it (spoiler end). The movie progresses, and does so beautifully. The dark moments in this film (and there are a bunch of them) really makes you...I can't say "scared", but sorry for the characters. The happy moments make you happy and - believe it or not - the sad moments are so well made that they actually make you cry. Or at least give you a lump in the throat. I know I got one and last time THAT happened in a movie was in "My Girl 2" (I was about 13 or so at the time). Sure, sure, Mr. Jackson has messed with the books from day one (but listen to what they say in the interviews they do) and with the pressure from New Line, I understand it. I'm sure Jackson would have loved to release a 50 hour movie and try to cover -everything- in the books, but they've changed stuff that a lot of people complain didn't need changing. I tend to disagree. You change something fundemental, that's going to affect alot of other things. Return of the King is an excellent movie, probably in my top ten list of best movies ever. The day I can watch all three movies in the extended versions (supposedly 11½ hours) is the day I will see the best movie(s) I have ever seen - and possibly even ever will see. Makes me kind of sad to think of it, actually, but then again - it's just a movie. Right? I will give this movie a 10 out of 10, not because a lot of other people will, not because it's the "right" thing to do - but because it deserves it. I have given out tens before, sure, but only a handful after voting on hundreds of movies. So, Mr. Jackson. Let's see what you can do with King Kong, The Hobbit (?) and anything else you do in the future - I'm sure I'll love those movies to. I salute you.
10.0~This film soared way beyond my expectations xphile_621 Sign in Permalink I have never been a diehard fan of the Lord of the Rings series. I attempted reading the novels but did not have the time to finish them. When the first of these three movies arrived in theaters I was told how amazing these films would be. When i discovered "Fellowship" was over three hours I was ready for a painful experience. I will be honest: I fell asleep. The next week I was talked into giving it another chance. I absolutely loved it. I eagerly awaited the extended edition which I watched in one sitting. When "The Two Towers" arrived my expectations were unfortunately too high. I enjoyed TTT, but it felt to me like it was missing something that was in the first film. I still remained excited for "The Return of the King" to arrive, but I figured it could never beat "Fellowship". Boy was I wrong. I heard many reviews and people said what a great film it was, so I began to get excited for the release. I saw it last night with higher expectations that i had for the second film. The expectations I had for this film were higher that what I have had for probably any film I have seen in recent years. This movie blew my expectations away. I was shocked by how well this trilogy wound down and concluded. Peter Jackson's directing really shined through in this one and the acting was superb. This film had BETTER win best picture or I will lose all respect for the Academy Awards (not that i had a whole lot). Even non-LOTR fans can thoroughly enjoy this film. This trilogy FAR outdoes the Matrix trilogy and makes Matrix Revolutions look like one of the worst films ever made (not that it took a lot to do that). Granted, this film was extremely long, but it is destined to become a classic and I know I will be getting that extended edition in November 2004. A+
10.0~Undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made. NateW Sign in Permalink Much too often these days, superlatives are thrown around to describe the greatness of movies and music. In this case, any superlative used is an understatement. This is unlike anything that has ever been made and probably ever will be made. Few films I have seen can stir as many emotions as effectively as ROTK. After more than three hours, the film still leaves the audience wanting more. If there is any justice, ROTK would sweep every awards ceremony in existence. Combined with Fellowship and Two Towers, the unprecedented trilogy helmed by Peter Jackson towers over any achievement in the medium in scope, character, and impact. The bar has been raised and the standard has been surpassed. Motion pictures will never be the same.
10.0~This movie has marked my childhood! athgeo Sign in Permalink It is the best movie I can remember I've watched while I was a kid!
9.0~Harika umitcigerci Sign in Permalink Izledigim en iyi filmlerden biri. Serinin en iyi filmi bence. Tavsiye ediyorum.
7.0~What does your heart tell you...nothing! joe-294 Sign in Permalink This film failed to convey the emotions and depth that sprung forth so effortlessly from the pages of Tolkien. Did anyone who saw this movie feel sad at the end? Or at any point in the movie? Or anxiety, or pity, or relief? Personally, I felt more emotionally invested in the hobbit cartoon. The detail and effects are amazing -- but I think he may have missed the forest for the ents.
10.0~Beyond epic. TuckMN Sign in Permalink Faithful to the original book(s) by J.R.R. Tolkien this is an amazing achievement by director Peter Jackson and a crew of thousands -- well, at least hundreds. Visually stunning and amazingly photographed this film is a complete visual treat. Much of the credit has to go to the dazzling editing -- seamlessly fitting several stories into one thematic whole. Much of what the viewer sees has been laid out in the books -- but it takes genius to realize the ideas and imagination and follow it so faithfully. While there are endless battle scenes, Director Jackson has a way of personalizing the struggles of the individual. Because of this ability to personalize the, at times, overwhelming and seemingly endless scenes of battle are put in a more individual scale and makes them more accessible to the audience. This is a story of how absolute power corrupts absolutely -- and how even the desire of absolute power can corrupt. This is also a story of how an individual can make a difference and how friendship, self-sacrifice and brotherhood will persevere. Composer Howard Shore does an exemplary job of making the music fit the scene; using individual instruments to play upon emotions and the brilliant use of the human voice as an instrument. The `Wizard of Oz' came to mind a couple of times both visually and thematically. I could almost hear `I am the great and powerful Oz!' Miranda Otto does an outstanding job as Eowyn; remember: when you want a job done right send a woman to do it. Elijah Wood is exceptional as Frodo; showing the inner turmoil and obsession with possessing The Ring. Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagal is superb -- he embodies the power that The Ring has over the individual and how it possesses them body and soul. Even though this film is 3 hours and 21 minutes long the audience is always completely caught up in the action and adventure -- a stunning achievement. There are not enough superlatives to accurately convey the brilliance of this film -- it is one that will live forever in the hearts of all that see it.
10.0~My favorite movie... EVER lcruzbruzl Sign in Permalink I've seen the extended version of this movie so many times and it seems that every time I see it, looks like I haven't seen it before. I can say easily this is my favorite movie ever, i don't get tired of watching it again and again! The relationship between Frodo and Sam is just wonderful, every character is unique, so I can say the plot is just perfect, the photography too, the art, costumes AND... Without that music I just don't know :s The music and the acting are my favorite parts of the movie, they are one for each other PLEASE, WATCH IT !
3.0~The story is just a little too silly to carry the emotional weight of a masterpiece. tccandler Sign in Permalink Okay... here goes. I am preparing myself for another year of vicious, profanity-laden and hysterically defensive e-mails from the rabid fanatics who refuse to believe that these 'Lord of the Rings' movies aren't beloved by everyone. I have received well in excess of five-hundred such emails, while only receiving forty or fifty in support of my views. Obviously, I am in the minority in this particular case. Only 17.2% of IMDb users gave the first two films anything other than an 8, 9 or 10 out of 10. Four out of five people, who regularly go to the movies, really like these films. Some are so obsessed with the film that it borders on a cult-like following. So lets dispense with the bulls**t. To save yourself some time... if you feel like sending one of 'those' emails, just type in the word "ditto" and I will get the message. Alternatively, you can be at peace with your rabid fanaticism and use your time more wisely... perhaps attending a LOTR convention dressed as your favorite character and rolling your R's when you talk to your fellow geeks. I am also going to dispense with the plot summary... Everyone has seen it anyway, and it will just feel redundant. Frodo and Sam are walking, Aragorn and Gimli are fighting Orcs, New Zealand looks beautiful, Gandalf glows -- Yada Yada Yada. I will admit this however... 'The Return of the King' came as close to a recommendation as any of the three. I even toyed with the idea of pushing it over the edge just to avoid at least some of the hate-mail. The final thirty minutes of the film did enough to evoke tears from my eyes, partly from relief, partly because it was very sentimental. If the previous ten hours of material had felt more like the final denouement, I would have given the films glorious recommendations. Those last minutes were gentle and kind and emotionally powerful... it actually felt like Tolkien's work for a change. The best acting in the entire saga came in that final act. The one that stood out the most was Sean Astin as Sam. Sam acts as our 'witness' throughout the film and I got choked up watching his character in the final scenes. Like I said... I was close to giving in to this film, but I just couldn't do it. There were too many corny scenes, too many lulls, too many overwrought speeches, too many special effects. Don't get me wrong, some of those battle scenes were spectacular, but they also never seemed to end. I felt more exhausted than exhilarated after having watched them. And interspersed throughout the film were a couple of musical numbers, that felt very out of place, along with a few intended 'tender' moments that seemed awkward and melodramatic. Can I give Peter Jackson any praise at all? Hell Yes! He must have worked his ass off for years to make this project happen. The amount of thought and coordination and organization that went into all of this must be mind-boggling. I respect and admire his accomplishment, but I think he was the wrong man for the job. He was concerned with the wrong aspects of the trilogy... the action, the adventure, the battles and the gore. He didn't focus on the kinder and gentler aspects of the story -- the hobbits, the friendships, the beauty, the innocence, the childlike imagination... but, of course, that would not have sold as many tickets at the box office, now would it? I think his limited and gory experience as a director hurt him in this regard. This was "his" version of the trilogy... but 17.2% of us didn't really share that vision. Will this third installment win the Oscar this year? Probably, but I certainly hope not. I agree with Roger Ebert who said, "That it falls a little shy of greatness is perhaps inevitable. The story is just a little too silly to carry the emotional weight of a masterpiece." Will this third installment surpass 'Titanic's' mammoth box office tally in the US and around the globe? No, not even close. You could add any two of the three film's worldwide gross and their tally would not add up to that of Titanic's total alone. LOTR is a huge box office success, but it won't change the industry in any substantial way. Perhaps we will see a few attempts to emulate the success with more fantasy adventures... it will probably become a fad like the recent Marvel Comic adaptations. Will this trilogy go down as one of the 'All Time Greats'? Probably not. I don't believe that this film will hold up over time, even with its strongest fans. Movies with special effects of this nature usually seem dated after a decade or so, as technology continues to improve beyond our wildest imaginations. There are rare exceptions of course... but even Star Wars' fanaticism is petering out slowly... and that was the most popular fantasy adventure ever made. 'Attack of the Clones' made $120 million less than 'Phantom Menace'. I doubt that the last installment will even reach $250 million domestically. The fact is that people grow up... they grow out of this sort of thing... it fizzles away into nostalgia. Most films that truly last and stand the test of time are based more in reality than in 'Orc-world'. That doesn't mean that a film like this can't be a wonderful diversionary escape, a fun trip to the theatre. But it does, in all likelihood, mean that it won't be remembered as a masterpiece of filmmaking. 'The Return of the King' is the best of the three... I really liked the final scenes, the farewells, the tying of the loose ends. But it still falls short of the Middle-Earth that I wanted to see, and thus I cannot rrrrrrrrecommend the film.
3.0~overlong and over-hyped to the max Slutmagic2021 Sign in Permalink The Lord Of the Rings series was something I was never really into. I like fantasy, action, drama, and all that stuff but to me they were a bit monotonous and clichéd. That said I enjoyed the first two especially the second one but I had no big interest to see this one. My neighbor however insisted that it was a crime against nature to have never seen it so I borrowed it from him. With in the first half hour or so I shut it off. I was in disbelief that this could possibly be the movie so many were raving about. I then heard it gets much better, so I put it back in and started to watch it where I left off. The amount of overacting is just astounding...from Viggo to Bloom, everyone seemed to be trying way to hard. The action scenes were not great either. Just because they are big does not mean they are good. I saw so many awkward battles and terrible reactions to CGI enemys....ugh. ANd then there is the ending that is complained about even by fans. It dragged on and on as if to say "we know you have to pee but instead here is some crap to make you think we are artistic by showing 300 different endings". Really, I feel that a lot of the appeal of this movie comes from Dungeons and Dragons type people who think anything Peter Jackson makes, and anything Tolken writes is immediately gold....it is not. Summary Acting-5/10 Story-3/10 Action Scenes-3/10 Paceing-1/10 Dirrection-6/10 Ending-0/10 OVERALL-3/10 do not be fooled by the die-hard fans. This movie is absolutely terrible and an extreme waste of talent for everyone involved.
10.0~Masterful rendition of an incredible novel; Definitely one of the best movies ever created in human history mdatile3 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is definitely one of the most excellent movies ever created. As the film's 11 Oscars more than subtly indicate, this movie was a perfect masterpiece not only in acting, but also in its wondrous musical score, top-notch directing (Peter Jackson did a superb job), and its outstanding work in adapting a work of literature to the screen. It did not just remain faithful to the text, but brought the book to life in vivid details which anyone and everyone can appreciate, whether they are an avid fan of the trilogy or have yet to experience the Tolkien universe. In terms of content, ROTK presents the viewer with the eternal struggle of good versus evil, in an incredibly powerful and startlingly beautiful way. Although the movie is 3+ hours long, every minute is worth it, reaffirming the traditional values of our society and leaving the viewer uplifted and once again confident that "there is good in this world, and it is worth fighting for." This movie encompasses much of life and, in my humble opinion, was the best movie created this decade. As a trilogy, The Lord of the Rings may be the most meaningful film that you will ever watch during the course of your lifetime.
10.0~Malicious People are lowering the ratings!! jarzan2003 Sign in Permalink Up to this point, 99 people have given a 1 for this movie. This can only be considered as online vandalism. The Return of the King deserves to be hailed as the best movie in cinematic history!! Nothing ever made could compare to the majesty and splendor of Lord of the Rings!! Awesome beyond belief. Granted that the ending is long, but anything less would have been just that. The closure that LOTR provides, is so satisfying, one could only wonder at the cold and dead hearts of many who disliked the ending. The only complaint I had was that my butt was sore. But it was all worth it. To say that I came with high expectations to see this movie is an understatement. And The Return of the King delivers!! Bravo!!!!!! If you should see only 3 movies in the next year, see The Return of the King, 3 times. Don't even bother looking for your socks when ROTK is over. They'll be somewhere in orbit.
10.0~The Ring comes full circle witch king Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has wrought the impossible. I have read J.R.R. Tolkien's great work more than two-score times. After the blasphemy of Ralph Bakshi's aborted "The Lord of the Rings" a quarter of a century ago, I was somewhat apprehensive two years ago when "The Fellowship of the Ring" appeared. I had nightmares of Bakshi's Hanna-Barbera cartoon cutouts crossing the screen on a cardboard Middle Earth. Well, the "Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring" was a tremendously moving triumph. And Jackson built upon his initial success with "The Lord of the Rings: The Towers," which was an even grander triumph than "Fellowship" was. "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," however, is greater than the first two--by far. This is a magnificent achievement of cinematic storytelling that perhaps has been matched by a handful of films..."Ben Hur," "The Ten Commandments," and the first two "Godfather" titles would be on my list of over-the-top cinematic epics. Sir Ian McKellen, perhaps, received the star's billing for this tremendous ensemble cast, and no single character receives more less] than his/her proper due. It isn't enough to list all the names and roles here; the acting is great from first to last. Jackson has found the heroic and human element in all three films; as in any great work, there are no false notes. Any serious Tolkien student [as opposed to "fan," which merely implies a cursory acquaintance with the great professor and his works]could take issue with Jackson's inclusions, additions, and omissions in any of the three films--the missing Tom Bombadil in the first film, or the absence of the chapter "The Voice of Saruman" in the second film. There are many changes from Tolkien's story here in "The Return of the King," but the story simply could not be told in a credible, entertaining, and profitable manner without cuts. There are films where there is always too much of war and battle, savagery and splendor. "The Return of the King" will endure for many reasons, one of them being the eerie, frightening, apocalyptic vision of what the end of the world must be like as Jackson presents his Ragnarok of the Icelandic sagas, the Gotterdammerung of Wagner. The forces of Saruman, crawling [and flying] inexorably towards the last bastion of hope and human decency unleash a violence and blood lust so utterly and inhumanly appalling that it must be seen to be believed. The sequence at the Sammath Naur, as Frodo comes to his great decision is, of course, the film's highlight, Elijah Wood absolutely nailed it. Andy Serkis will perhaps never be appreciated for his work as Gollum, a manifestly difficult role portraying all that character's complexities. Sean Astin's Sam will become one of the most beloved screen characters in history. McKellen never overdid it as Gandalf, as Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn provided the correct heroic, distant, emphasis on his shifting character. Gimli, Legolas, Merry and Pippin all have their moments and are admirably played; however, a special mention must be given to Bernard Hill. As King Theoden of Rohan, he is superb. The wreck and fire, the slaughter of the Fields of the Pelennor were very real, the the images of the mumakil and the frightening fell-beasts, as they have come to be known, seemed to have an organic life of their own. I never once thought, "well, these are only special efects." There have been complaints about the film's length. Well, I never got the impression of time passing as I watched the movie. All I can say of Jackson's magnum opus is what Tolkien said of his own: that people wrote to him and lamented that "the book is too short." This film's [and the preceding two's] greatness will consist of having gotten to the core of the Tolkien book's essential moral truth: the nobility of the purest human endeavors and how they can either succeed or fail because, as culpable beings, we are ignorant of the "divine" intention. A final note: the music of Howard Shore gives all three films emotional and psychological reference points of the highest moral stature, lifting "The Lord of the Rings" far, far above what anyone could wish in terms of film scoring. Shore's Wagnerian musical architecture is the perfect underpinning to Jackson's great work. We may see finer films in our lifetimes, but they will not be many.
10.0~Filled with wonder and awe, I know filmmaking can't get better Doddi Sign in Permalink "The best film of all time"... this is a phrase I've heard so many times every year. I have always believed taste and opinion can change through time and therefore my top-10 list has been changing a lot the past ten-fifteen years (since I started viewing movies as a huge movie-addict). While many people seem to be afraid to admit that filmmaking can get better (and constantly choose Godfather or Citizen Kane as a best movie of all time), I have not been afraid to mingle those different times together. "His Girl Friday" has always been a top-5 favourite, but three films have in the last two years put other films lower. And those films are the LOTR-films. Fellowship was a unique experience, Towers did equally good but Return of the King has outdone them both. Scriptwise, acting wise, directing wise, effects wise, costume wise, make-up wise... etc. Return of the King has everything that Fellowship and Towers had - and much more. There are dramatic and great battle scenes, emotional scenes and fun scenes. Lots of it. And as I sat through 3,5 hours of watching without noticing the length, I thought: This is the top, this is the best ... filmmaking can't get better! While many people will argue, I'm saying this because I felt this film had it all. I'll continue watching movies and who knows ... a better film might come along, but today I feel it's not possible. I know I'll miss seeing a premiere of a LOTR-film in December 2004, I know I'll have a hard time accepting it's over, I know I had an empty feeling little after seeing Return of the King, but I know also that I'll cherish this unique adventure for the rest of my life. Peter Jackson has shown incredible talents in the art of filmmaking, WETA workshop (Richard Taylor and co.) have also shown how props and effects can help a movie but not overrun it, Howard Shore has written the best music for a film trilogy ever, the actors... they'll continue their work but as an ensemble cast... you couldn't have asked for more than this. There are treasures to be seen in every corner and to blink your eyes would be a crime, since you'd lose some microseconds of a truly wonderful cinematic experience. Wonder and awe are weak words... but I'm forever grateful to everyone related to the making of this film - this is indeed what filmmaking should be about. Return of the King, along with the first two, will be remembered in movie history. A 10 out of 10!!
10.0~It was very innovative at the time of release AndreaTsereteli108 Sign in Permalink "Return of the King" is such a crowning achievement, such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects, such a pure spectacle, that it can be enjoyed even by those who have not seen the first two films. Yes, they will be adrift during the early passages of the film's 200 minutes, but to be adrift occasionally during this nine-hour saga comes with the territory; Tolkien's story is so sweeping and Jackson includes so much of it that only devoted students of the Ring can be sure they understand every character, relationship and plot point. I think this final film is. phenomonal as it is breathtaking to the conclusion of LOTR trilogy... Gollum speaks in an idiosyncratic manner, often referring to himself in the third person, and frequently talks to himself. When not referring to himself in third person, he sometimes speaks of himself in the plural as "we", hinting at his split personality. The rare occasions when he actually says "I" are interpreted by Frodo as an indication that Sméagol's better self has the upper hand. Gollum also uses his own versions of words similar to the original words
9.0~Very good firstone Sign in Permalink I thought movie was well done, in fact my only real compliant is that is seemed rushed. I know it sounds odd calling a movie this long rushed, but that had to do with the incredible amount of material that needed to be covered. I thought the acting was great, especially by Andy Serkis, and Sean Astin. I think they really brought out the emotion in thier characters. The visuals were of course stunning. Many hardcore fans may be upset be the ending being altered, but the book ending would not have worked well on film, nor would it have fit. Overall I gave it a 9.
10.0~Another Number 1 Movie in Erwin's List of Best Movies of All Time r_wind0300 Sign in Permalink ONE OF BEST MOVIES IN THE WORLD HISTORY, AND ABSOLUTELY MY ANOTHER MOST FAVOURITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME! The unforgettable movie based on a trilogy novel about which most people agree, that it's as satisfying as the novel. Peter Jackson has successfully made this "Middle Earth History" become real! I also give a credit to J.R.R. Tolkien for his wonderful novel Lord of the Rings and The Hobbits, he has amazingly created a story that feels like a real part of the world history! What an outstanding imagination! All actors and actresses have wonderfully given their best in this perfect until every detail epic movie, we really feel their chemistry one to another. This is also a movie that worthy and enjoyable to watch again and again, from which we still get something new even when we watch it for 12th times, either a new value or a scene we might have no longer remembered. One of best parts of the trilogy, I fell in love with Elijah Wood after watching its final one, The Return of the King; and he's been my another most favourite actor ever since! Lord of the Rings is one of most commercially successful movies of all time, also the most Oscar-winning movie in history, together with Titanic and Ben-Hur. Thank you Lord for this film...
10.0~WOW! higgypop Sign in Permalink Well i have just got back from seeing what has to be greatest movie I have ever seen!. Never before have I sat in a Cinema with my mouth open, tears of joy running down my face. Peter Jackson has created a modern marvel, an all time classic. On it's own The Return of the King is an amazing film but standing alongside the others makes The Lord of the Rings trilogy the greatest fantasy saga of all time!. Brilliant Just Brilliant!
4.0~Why is this movie rated that high? fjosnisse Sign in Permalink When it comes to TLOTR:The Return of the King, I personally think that this is not such a fabulous movie. First of all I would like to comment on the acting, many of the actors in the movie is to me very dorky. Orlando Bloom seems to only got one face that he uses throughout the whole movie,this is a very lousy performance. And Viggo Mortensen only seems good because many of his scenes are along with Bloom. That I mean is that, next to Orlando Bloom even Dolph Lundgren would appear to be a Oscar candidate. Of course many of the battle scenes are great, and very entertaining to watch, but this is not enough to make this a classic movie, but of course, it will become one anyway. And much of the comedy in the movie, specially the scenes with Gimli and Legolas, are totally unnecessary. This is not successful, and one of the things that could have been changed or even left out of the movie.
10.0~One of the greatest film achievements of all time jedijauregui117 Sign in Permalink I have seen many movies in my time, but it is ever so clear to me that this masterpiece deserves my final opinion. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is ground breaking to say the least and has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time and for great reason. It is movies like these that only come once in a great while and those who are there to enjoy the magic will not forget the impact that it brought to them. From the outstanding cast to the amazing visual effects, to the beautiful musical score, Peter Jackson has truly reminded us why we all watch movies in the first place. The Return of the King has made its place in history as a landmark movie and for others, it may have become something more.
10.0~Nothing can be more satisfying than a great trilogy-ending! Kirollos-Noah Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is once again directed by Peter Jackson, screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Peter Jackson, same of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings' crew. Starring Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis and Sean Astin. The final battle for Middle-earth begins. Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring. If you've read my The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers reviews, so you know that I loved both of them very much, even with its flaws, it's still of the best fantasy trilogies ever made! The final chapter of Lord of the Rings presents a very satisfying ending for every fan (of the movie or even the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien). Epic battles, emotional scenes, fascinating CGI, powerful and balanced-paced. Everything was wrong or flawed with the previous two is now completely fixed, nothing went wrong with this movie! The performances got improved, they're way better now. The slow-mo scenes are improved too, which is mean that the direction is improved too! All of that makes The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King one of the best movie with lots of memorable moments. The battles are essential, and even better than the battles of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. All of that is making it unique and breathtaking, with lots of fun and a repeatable movie, like for thousands of times! The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is definitely the best movie of the trilogy, and it deserves an A+! Lots of reviews are coming ahead, new and old movie, if you liked this review, you can stick right here and see my reviews. BTW, thanks for reading and supporting my work.
9.0~Closure mc-voltron Sign in Permalink So if you're a fan of the books, you might have a tendency to overanalyze what to the casual viewers is a nice farewell to the magestic world of Tolkien. Wraps it all up nicely for those who fell in love with these characters.
10.0~Now what? aschumacher Sign in Permalink I just saw TROTK of the LOTR trilogy and am feeling completely blown away by it. The movie went beyond my expectations, it was that good. I won't place any spoilers here, but I can tell you that I had tears in my eyes on more than one occasion during the movie. Now I just have to wait for the movie on DVD (extended version of course;)) If you loved the previous two movies and/or love Tolkien's masterpiece, you just HAVE to go and watch it!
10.0~Astounding! suicehyde Sign in Permalink First watched this movie only 3 months ago having been well acquainted with the grossly underrated Bakshi version. I simply cannot put into words the sheer awesome epic-ness of this third instalment! The Lord of the Rings film trilogy is one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking... Peter Jackson & co did an excellent job and should be immensely proud of themselves. Stunning visuals, a perfect score, great acting, memorable scenes, and more. The film does deviate from the book a bit. Why Shelob couldn't have done what she did in TTT is beyond me. It could have shortened the running time a bit. Ah yes, the running time...My one gripe is the running time & multiple endings (as others have pointed out). Its a very long movie but i enjoyed every single second of it and i think it could not have been done better. Simply epic! 10.1/10
10.0~Spectacular tecort Sign in Permalink This is one of those movies that take your thoughts away. You can't stop thinking about it at all. The action is unbelievable, the acting is great the special effects are beyond words. One things I had a little reservation about was the ending, I mean it just seems little to drawn out. Tecort.
9.0~Terrific conclusion to epic trilogy Spanner-2 Sign in Permalink The concluding chapter in Peter Jackson's epic trilogy... this one continues the excellent production values and lush storytelling of the previous installments and wraps things up quite nicely... a shame really that the series has to end here.. the actors have really gotten into their parts by this time and the performances, particularly by Sean Astin are top flight... some terrific battles towards the end highlight the drama as well.. Not much to complain about, if i must quibble the ending tends to drag a tad.. still terrific filmmaking. GRADE: A
10.0~Awesome, Awesome Movie! lecherd32 Sign in Permalink The movie was spectacular. For the most part, it was pretty accurate to the book. The parts that weren't from the book added to make it more understandable. The acting was great, action was great, music was great. I really felt connected to the characters and by the end was emotionally exhausted. What a movie! I will see it again and again.
10.0~o m g. peter jackson & crew pwn again. nemesis1 Sign in Permalink just a short comment... saw it tonight on 16th on a prescreening here on iceland and... I was blown away. the first two were excellent but this one was absolutely incredible. the battle scenes were just *so* amazingly fantastic, and the fight vs Shelob had me frozen in my seat. the use of music & sound was excellent, using silence where appropriate. the cast was superb as before, and the scenes with frodo & sam in the end was real touching... and the scenes with gollum/smeagol - wow. now I hate having to wait for far too many months for the extended version, there were quite a few spots where we could feel would be extended on the dvd, plus there's scenes in the trailers which weren't in the movie. peter jackson & everybody involved in the making of lotr, my hat's off for you, movies will never be the same.
1.0~The "Return of my money" please! joeyseattle30 Sign in Permalink I want to be as honest as possible in my review of this film, I comment on this movie as I feel outraged that it has been given such a high rating on IMDb. First my credentials as a fair and impartial reviewer: I am a native New Zealander, my mum new Peter Jackson well & I quite enjoyed his early films, Bad taste,the Frighteners, Heavenly creatures & particularly Brain dead. Some of the movie sets were just a few miles from my house, and I had the opportunity to work as an extra on the trilogy and all were treated graciously. Additionally I was a huge fan of Tolkien's book and had a sense of excitement and wonder that the Lord of the rings was to be made into 3 films in my home country. Many of the bad reviews posted here compare the book to the movie and the movie will always come off worse, and I must admit that when I saw the Fellowship I was horrified at how bad and boring it was compared to the book, but come two towers I came with an open mind and quite enjoyed the film, judging it on its own merits and I had the same plan going into the return of the king. Additionally I must admit there were a few parts of the Return of the king that I thoroughly enjoyed; The lighting of the torches, the juxtaposition of the brave warrior riding of to almost certain death, to please and prove himself to his father, while dad casually feasts on grapes supported by a beautiful song, the scene where the kingdom bow down to salute the brave hobbits. Also the brothers acting was fine. aannndd thats about it. This movie was awful for me first and foremost because it did not draw me in to the story, for only seconds at a time did I care for or could I make sense of the story and the acting, I was simply bored and restless. Some of the reasons for this follow: The length: 3 hours + +? Peter, have you heard about the innovations in film editing?, and what is with the multiple endings? It was like one of those nightmares where you wake up, but you are really still in the dream and can't seem to get out! I believe a natural ending would have been with the salute to the hobbits. Frodo: Oh Nodo!!, Frodo wore only one expression on his face for the entirety of two towers, and the majority of fellowship and return. You know that look of pained resignation, of sore weariness. All those head shots kind of got boring. Also I just did not buy him turning on his loyal companion Sam, taking the rascally creatures word over his. Additionally having struggled so long and hard, being so pure of heart for the whole journey, you just suddenly decide you want to keep the ring at the last moment? c'mon! Sam: (Smithers)The part where Frodo sends you away and you start to cry, I wish I could erase the pained forced feeling of that scene from my memory. Warrior woman: I can't remember whether it was in the book or not, but the ease with which you dispatched an enemy far more powerful than you, or just about anyone for that matter, seemed a little unlikely. It Bet Daniel Son's victory over a vastly superior opponent in KK3 hands down. Hordes of the undead: Those ghostly figures Aragon summoned, Um, it wasn't too suspenseful for me seeing them do battle, since they were invincible and could not be attacked back! Legolas: A shame to see the kick arse archer from fellowship & towers reduced to a one very fake looking scene taking down the baddies on the elephant. Dwarf: I like a dwarf to be ascetic and noble, not comic relief. Aragon: Why did you change your voice tone and go all James L Brooks on us when giving your Coronation speech? My friend suppressed a laugh. Karl Urban: There was an excellent scene in the trailer where you screamed and wailed at the sky, below your father-the king's body lying dead on the earth, that scene really got my heart racing, I can't believe it was absent in the movie. The Battles: Who was fighting who? the editing was such that I couldn't see which characters to root for as the action flied by too quickly and clumsily. Golem: We get that the ring has corrupted your soul and turned you into something horrible over the years, we get that you will make a play for the ring before the film is out. Was the opening scene biography really necessary? Finally and by far most disgracefully, please keep in mind that all three films were filmed at the same time, using the same actors, production crew and locations. The first two movies got just a few Oscar nods in minor categories such as sound effects editing, How can Return of the king be THAT much better than the other two that it sweeps up 13 or so Oscars, everything for which it was nominated! Shame on you academy!!, my guess is that the Money from New Line cinema was not all spent on making and advertising the film itself! Bouycott the Oscars!!
10.0~Work done with love PeterisKrisjanis Sign in Permalink I won't possibly say anything new about this movie as it's very professional, certainly best movie of the year, etc. But I want something to add - it's sure one of the best movies ever made because of love of all team to Tokein's book and material. It's something you can't describe it, because effects for example - yeah, they're great, but you have seen them before. BUT how they are done, how is acting is done, soundtrack, music, everything - it shows that many for them - for actors, artists, for all team - it was Magnum Opus. Work of Life. Made with love. Best movie ever made in fantasy genre - and best movie of the year. Oh, and certainly the best triology ever made, period.
10.0~A masterpiece samiul7283 Sign in Permalink This is a sheer masterpiece. I feel like Peter Jackson was able to do justice to Tolkien's mind-blowing depiction of Middle-earth.
10.0~Blows the other two away wizzrd1025 Sign in Permalink This movie is visually the best of the trilogy. The oliphaunts were even more well done than I could imagine, and the other "new" characters were all exactly as I remember them from the books. Jackson also does a good job wrapping up all loose ends, although the very end did not seem to come when I thought it should. But, I must say, I was impressed with the deepness of the story as told by J.R.R. Tolkien through the eyes, cameras, and CGI of Peter Jackson and company.
1.0~absolutely trash missy-24952 Sign in Permalink Don't get on the band wagon for this one it actually is the worst thing i have ever seen in my whole life. boring hard to follow and just horrible.
8.0~Greatness shoguntee Sign in Permalink There isn't much left to be said about this movie or the franchise as a whole. It's simply the best trilogy of movies ever made. All of the movies were great or very good with no dropoffs. The only trilogy that comes close is Indiana Jones. My only complaint with Return of the King is the ending. Didn't it seem to drag on and on a bit? How many people are going to jump in Frodo's bed? What, was Treebeard too busy bathing in his own Entwash to join in on the fun?
10.0~Flawless! sachsad Sign in Permalink Never have I seen a movie so flawless. In my opinion, this installment is by far the best of the trilogy. Often with movies, especially those based off books, I'm thinking "oh I wish there was less of that, and more emphasis on that." Not the case with the Return of the King. This movie was perfect. Every aspect about it was stunning and beautiful. Don't let the three and a half hours thing turn you off. It's an amazing experience to see this movie. If it doesn't sweep the Academy Awards it will be a travesty.
10.0~A magnificent epic that can be enjoyed by all ages. Rosematuse Sign in Permalink I find it difficult to separate the three films even though each one is a wondrous tale of its own. The following are the main points of The Return of the King that are my favorites and if you haven't yet seen it or read the book (which you should-on both counts)please do not read any further because these details may spoil the film for you. 1. Viggo Mortensen is spectacular as Strider/Aragorn/Elessar. Every country should have a leader as compassionate, brave, loyal,true, and determined as the heir of Isildur proved to be. And every woman should have the man they love look at them the way that King Elessar looked at Arwyn when he saw her lovely face again after the crowning ceremony. BTW the chant in Elvish that Viggo does after he is crowned is enchanting and moving and is on the soundtrack CD. 2.Gandalf kicks some serious butt and is the wisest of consulars and in his talk to Pippen at Minas Tirith when the whole town is on the brink of annihilation he makes death sound like a continuing journey that should not be feared. 3.Legolas is loyal and true to Aragorn and Gimli as well as being the most fearsome of warriors and his taking down of the 'Oliphant' is simply...well awesome! His quiet dignity even on the brink of war is most calming and his wise words to Gimli are heart warming. If only we did have Elves in this world, how cool would that be? 4.Ghost Soldiers: Aragorn demanding that the Ghost Soldiers follow him and thus be freed from their oath is very intense and the GS taking out the bad guys...again awesome! 5.The Hobbits: Frodo, courageous and determined, Elijah Wood gives him a sweet gentleness by the very power of those amazing large blue eyes and charming smile. Samwise: Could anyone ask for a better friend than Sam who rose to the occasion and saved his master from Shelob and the Orcs and carried him on his back to the entrance of the chasm of Mt.Doom.Sean Astin was perfect and should have garnered an Oscar nomination as a supporting actor. Merry and Pippin, perfect foils that lend a comic relief without being buffoons. 6.Gollum: Andy Sirkus is phenomenal as Smeagol/Gollum and no other CGI creation has ever appeared to be such a flesh and blood creature with such emotional depth.He gives us a good lesson in greed and what the love of possessions to the exclusion of all else can do to a person because even as he fell to his death his mind was on 'his precious' and not the fact that he was losing his life. 7.The whole cast under the direction of Mr. Jackson and his 'wizards' is superb and this movie along with the first two will be the Gone With The Wind of our time. I highly urge one and all to see the entire trilogy if they have not done so. Oh, I'm 59, my husband is 62, my Mom is 76, our son is 42, and our grand-daughter is 20. We saw all of the together and we all loved them. It's a movie for that can be enjoyed by one and all and besides the grandeur of movie magic it has some lessons on life,love,greed,and sacrifice that hold true to every day life.
9.0~Spectacular but not Brilliant erwan_ticheler Sign in Permalink Possible SPOILERS: "The Return of the King" is a spectacular conclusion to the LOTR Trilogy.The special effects and huge battles are a feast for the eye and the camera work is splendid.As is Ian McKellen as Gandalf. This makes for the best of the 3 movies(yet it is close to part 2) if you ask me.I was hugely disappointed "The Fellowship(5/10)" but "The Towers(8/10)" was a very good movie. What makes "The Return of the King" not an absolute classic are the following points: 1. The ending is too long,which takes away some of the power of the battles and the climax in Mount Doom. 2. Elijah Wood is a very annoying guy who can't act. 3. The battle scenes are,although very well made,not that original.It seems like an add-on to "The Two Towers" sometimes. 4. Christopher Lee is not appearing,which I think is a low down dirty shame.Lee is a legendary actor who deserves more than that and his character(Saruman) was the big bad guy in part 1 and 2,in a way. 5. The music gets a little bit boring after a while,there are only really two main themes that are repeated endlessly.for example,"Star Wars" has numerous themes so it never gets boring. I think that RotK will probably get a well deserved oscar for Special effects and sound,but not for the acting and not for best movie(It's just not the best movie of the year). Andy Serkis is very good,but it is a little bit too much to give an award for just a voice(they never gave Criswell an oscar,now did they?). Maybe an oscar for Peter Jackson,as sort of a sympathy vote for his 3 movies and his mammoth job over the years creating it. Overall,the best of the bunch but not the greatest movie ever(or 4th in that respect)! 8/10
1.0~Most overrated film in History Ozzy2000 Sign in Permalink It is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium. These three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. For example Peter Jackson knew that he could New Zealand Citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown New Zealand Countryside. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. This was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. How the motion Picture Academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious. The cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. This has been supported many Cinematographers in many blogs. The acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from Australians and New Zealanders due to Peter Jackson's view that they are better actors than Americans and the British. In fact Australians and New Zealanders have this strange dislike Americans despite consuming their films. The animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in "dusk till dawn" it makes you wonder if the CGI people had much imagination. The many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the Golum. In fact most of the CGI was carried out by Americans hired by Peter Jacksons multi-million dollar CGI suite. Which at the end of the day makes you wonder where Mr Peter Jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in New Zealand. The whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with Peter Jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.It is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination. It was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. I fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in CGI. I am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like John Boorman who was originally going to make the film. I am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and Peter Jackson.
10.0~A Sheer Masterpiece NightDemon88 Sign in Permalink If anyone was to say anything negative about this movie, they either haven't seen it or they are angry Harry Potter fans. The Return of the King is just a beautiful masterpiece of a film. Hats off to Peter Jackson, as this movie is wonderfully directed. Return of the King is the most character driven and most emotional of the three films, and the actors portray the spirit of the moment exceptionally. The action sequences are compelling and exciting. This movie also has one of the greatest screenplays I have come across in years. Return of the King is also a wonderful blend of CGI and actual models and such. Overall, this movie scores a 10/10 in my book.
10.0~Best movie in years cativa79 Sign in Permalink To try to reduce my feelings to words would be giving this movie less credit than it deserves. I must admit that I am astonished at how good a job Peter Jackson and his crew have done of tying together all the loose threads that he has woven in the previous two films. Never has there been a better adaptation of a book, and never has an adaptation made such a completely satisfying movie in its own right. I will probably see it many more times over the next few months. Fantastic special effects, brilliant editing, extraordinary acting, and most of all superb directing. If Peter Jackson does not win the Oscar this year, he will win everything else and the Academy will be ridiculed. Go See It!
4.0~Terrible, bloated ending to a terrible, bloated series. MonsterCube Sign in Permalink Epic. What is this obsession with being 'epic'? The tedious sweeping shots of New Zealand countryside.The ridiculous, poorly constructed 'shakey cam' CGI battles. The endless 'rousing' speeches and cringe-worthy battle banter. I suppose the story of Lord of the Rings suggests all of these elements, so perhaps Peter Jackson is not entirely to blame. What it really comes down to is that this is a *bad* story. Middle Earth is under threat from what? An evil lighthouse that controls an army of orcs? This is supposed to be menacing? Give me a break. Even after the 'threat' is dispelled, the film continues at its torturous pace for 30 or so more minutes! I couldn't care less what happens to the people of Middle Earth. Not a single character is likable. Too sum up Lord of the Rings in a word: Boring. Very, very boring.
7.0~Not as good as people say... again caricatunssss Sign in Permalink After the great film that was The two towers, i was expecting a great ending and... i actually got it... kind of. This film has a lot of great things, including great action scenes and the past of Gollum, which is one of the most interesting characters in the trilogy. I liked a lot this film but it has it's flaws. My main problem with this film is the ending, which feels very convenient. The eagles rescuing everyone is just obnoxious and stupid. Also, the solution with the ghosts battling is kind of... from nowhere. Overall, the film is fine but not as great as i was expecting. But if i got to give some credit to this film, the art direction on the final scene is just fantastic.
10.0~Fantastic... koghee Sign in Permalink I just came out of the cinema. This is a worthy ending to what must be the most stunning series ever produced. Chapeau Peter Jackson and crew, I think it's about time the Godfather moves over a place. Enjoy !
10.0~My humble opinion about The Return of The King seperez Sign in Permalink The Return of The King surpasses all my expectations, it's unlike any other film I've ever seen, it's just the best movie ever made. It just amazes me, the care, search of perfection and effort put on the movie. Peter Jackson, Sideshow WETA, and the rest of the team, along with the actors showed their quality and gave a 100% of them for that project. I truly enjoyed every minute of it, I was on the edge of my seat at the movie theater overwhelmed by this movie which I am sure will be a favorite from generation to generation.
10.0~A Great Ending To The Trilogy loveablejohn-46629 Sign in Permalink This movie was just outstanding from beginning to end with superb performances from the cast and the special effects were excellant along with the cinematography. Plus I liked the end titles as it had drawings of the main cast besides their names as well as scenes from the movie and the soundtrack on all three movies was outstanding as well. My only issue with this movie is that the violence was pretty graphic for a PG-13 movie. Also on the DVD set that I watched had a bonus disc which contained featurettes about the making of the movie along with trailers and a National Geographic documentary about the parallels between the movie and actual events in history which all are worth watching.
5.0~Very little to admire dxia Sign in Permalink There are a few things very admirable about Jackson's latest installment. The special effects are incredible, the...um...No, I think that's about it. Before I go any further, let me state I am an admirer of Tolkien's work, and this review will be largely biased because of that. The breadth and scope of 'The Lord of the Rings' amazes me every time I pick up the novel. The character dialogue is long, eloquent, and puts the reader in a grander time and place than his own. The story is about traveling with friends, talking over dinner, and exploring a world unlike anywhere else in literature. But Jackson's movie has very little of any of that. I understand that because of the cost of the movie, he had to adjust it for mainstream audiences. However, the problem is not that he adjusted the material, but that he absolutely butchered it. Tolkien's beautiful dialogue is trimmed down and thrown away to be replaced by bad one-liners and soap opera scenes. The characters feel one-dimensional and act like cardboard cut outs of their alter egos in the book. Does Frodo panting or groaning or complaining for the hundredth time tell me anything about him or why I should care that he's panting and groaning, etc? I don't hate everything about Jackson's interpretation. I enjoyed the wonderful sets, realistic cgi, and thrilling battle scenes. But was it necessary to make the Battle of Plennor Fields an hour long computer simulate scrimmage when Tolkien spends only a single page describing it in his book? It's a pity mainstream audiences have swallowed the movie and accepted it as a masterpiece, when really it's nothing of the sort. It's a real shame.
10.0~The best movie ever pricopalexandra21 Sign in Permalink I just wanted to say that for a long time i thought it was just a crappy fiction movie but i was completely wrong. It's the best movie ever made (: The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called 'Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.
6.0~A fitting finale josh_lambert1991 Sign in Permalink For me these movies are good but not great and this finale was a good end to them my main problem with it though is the long goodbye scene at the end he's saying goodbye to everyone and it takes around 10 minutes which is crazy!
10.0~Amazing! Ken Adiv Sign in Permalink Amazing. That pretty much sums it up. The number of films that move me the way this film moved me can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The scenes, the breathtaking scenery (I've never seen landscape shots like this anywhere!), the characters, the emotions, everything. 11 out of 10 :-)
10.0~Masterpiece... and more myot_24 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is by far, the most beautiful piece of cinema that has ever been made. After seeing the first 2 chapters, I thought I had seen it all, that I could never be amazed again by another movie. I was wrong! This masterpiece (what this movie should be called) will take you places you've never dream of going. The costumes, photography, special effects, music, actors, nothing could have been done better. And after seeing this movie, I'm sure it will be difficult for me to watch another movie for a long time, being that nothing could even come close to the magic I felt watching this historic picture. I'll be sure to watch the oscars this year because this movie is the only movie worthy of the best picture oscar. If I might add, I think that Sean Astin as Sam should win for best supporting actor. Go see this movie, I guarantee you will be thankful for have seen it... and much more!
10.0~Amazing ragdog1 Sign in Permalink So the almost 7 year long trek has ended with an amazing movie. All things aside not a single movie of a book has ever plodded along with every line in a movie. Never has one and there never will be. But a faithful representation of what the meaning is certainly here. We will never know what type of a movie the author wanted or would have done. So stop the arguing and just enjoy a fabulous movie, entertaining and so well done. Deserves all of the Academy Awards out there and still will not win. Hollywood is stupid as we know.
10.0~The love connection of Aragorn and Arwen is in the books. jamiedigsseals Sign in Permalink I would just like to say that Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best movie ever made. There are a lot of other pretty darn good movies out there, but don't compare to Return of the King. Star Wars is the closest movie that comes to Lord of the Rings. I would also like to say that the love connection between Aragorn and Arwen IS in the books. Look it up in the Appendices 2, it in fact has every line that has to do with Aragorn and Arwen in the movie. You people who just heard rumors of the love connection being fake decided to skim over the books and not READ it all. That is all I have to say about that. Thank You. 10 out of 10(the movie)
10.0~Better the second time around ikester8 Sign in Permalink The film greatly benefits from a second viewing. The first time I saw it at the end of Trilogy Tuesday, I viewed it as a film critic might, or a fan of the books. I was too busy trying to take everything in and noting the changes from Tolkien's canon to get fully swept up in it. But everything changed with the second viewing on Saturday morning, and I can honestly say I now consider it the best of the three. If you were at all put off by the film the first time you saw it, please give it one more chance. You will be rewarded. 10/10
9.0~Solid, solid movie. rooboy84 Sign in Permalink What a way to end the trilogy. Perhaps if you had to you could find mini chinks in the armour for the third movie, but they are covered up by delicious suspense and excellent screenplay. The large battle scenes near the end are just about as good as the two towers main one is, But maybe Legolas getting on and taking down the giant mammoth-like creature like he did is just a tad far-fetched? But who cares I suppose when you have a movie like this? There's always going to be some little thing about a movie that may seem a tad on the negative side. I wouldn't even call it on the negative side anyway. An unforgettable trilogy. 9/10
2.0~What was the point Kingsage Sign in Permalink This had to have been the most anticipated films of the year, Lord of the rings return of the king had everything going for it except a storyline or purpose. What was the point of this film. For starters it would have been more than easy to finish the film within the first ten minutes of it starting. If they had spent more time actually doing something instead of crying then Perhaps i would be writing a totally different review here. It has to be said that the Special effects with the fight scenes are the best i have ever seen, not to mention the amazing Scenery, but in all honesty there really was nothing else to this film. The film was always going to be hard to make as people are never going to be happy that it isn't exactly happens in the book, but really did they even read it. On an overall rating i shouldn't even score it, but with the best Special effects and amazing Scenery i would give it 3/10 grudgingly
10.0~The Best Movie I've ever seen soccer1818 Sign in Permalink Thank you Peter Jackson, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortenson, Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom and everyone that worked on the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Thank you for bringing Tolkien's wonderful story to life. I don't know what to say about The Return of the King except that it was exceptional. I didn't look at my watch the entire movie. If you thought the ending was too long or the story wasn't developed enough then you didn't read the books and you didn't see the friendships and patriotism of sorts that was so powerful in the movie. Wonderful, wonderful movie. Read the books. See the movies. Love the story.
9.0~Best of the Series jararbangash Sign in Permalink After I finished watching the Two Towers (Which wasn't as good as the First one), My expectations were kinda low for this one. This all changed ten minutes into the movie. Firstly, The script is great! The story was awesome with only minor flaws. The acting was superb, And you really feel like your part of it. The soundtrack was awesome too. It greatly added to the whole effect and suited the movie Overall, I'd give it a 9/10. I would've given it a 10, but the ending gets a bit confusing though it was nice otherwise. This is one Trilogy you cant miss!
10.0~One word darkgift Sign in Permalink What can I say about this movie? I think anyone who watch the movie can say the same, 'cause there's only one word to define this movie: Perfection. Maybe everybody won't think that but remember: Perfection is different for each one of us...
8.0~beauty and long(so long) seeramuun5 Sign in Permalink We watched Frodo and the others live like two separate films. Expected end. It was a classic. The film in the Shire did not notice anything, and the film added something different. I do not really understand the end, but anyway. Other than that, the characters finished in keeping their classics.
10.0~Best movie ever made rstoffer Sign in Permalink I love the enire triolgy. If you have not seen the extended version of part 2, you must. It is extraordinary! Return of the King, in my opionion, is among the best movies I have ever seen. The triology in whole is the best cinema event of my life. I believe to date the best thing ever done.
10.0~PURELY TREMENDOUS MASTERPIECE ohad-84719 Sign in Permalink Damn it ,this movie is just a flawless masterpiece (except for the long runtime). From the first shot until the middle and the grandiosely epic end ,the LOTR Trilogy ends up with a huge epic war and with historical production design ,epic music and a perfect cast which acts out the most alongside brilliant story-telling and genius writing as well as hugely spectacular action sequences with full heart touching tone of drama. Every time i watch it and survives 200 minutes ,i recall the time i saw it at the cinema alongside many LOTR fans. I'm a fan of LOTR but not too much. Anyways ,this movie is hands down the best fantasy film of all time. It's also my most favorite fantasy movie more than any single movie of fantasy genre!.
1.0~boo teejay17 Sign in Permalink I've waited three years for a disappointing ending. The scouring of the Shire wasn't in the film, and that was by far the most important scene in the story, with Saruman and Wormtongue. Okay, so maybe it's in the second DVD comes out, after the regular one gets bought up---but this is just a marketing scheme---the exploitation of a fine story. This proves once and for all that literary adaptations are a true rip off of the author's intent, fixed only on making large sums of money. Tolkien is no doubt rolling over in his grave. People against this argument no doubt say that, "well yes, but it brings the story to the masses!" Why not encourage them to read instead? I feel that the imagination of millions of kids is now ruined because they will never be able to read the books without having Wood in their minds as Frodo, or Astin as Sam. And the characters don't act that way in the book. And how can we justify Jackson's liberal treatment of the story to promote CGI graphics while disregarding the characters in the film. Basically the computer is now a character. These books should have been left alone. This isn't the best film of all time, it is the best example of exploitation that has thus far been imagined.
10.0~OH MY GOD dicklal Sign in Permalink !possible spoilers! today i went to this movie. and what i saw. OH MY GOD. it is truly astonishing. amazing. not to describe. the way that Peter Jackson transferred the book to movie. RESPECT. it was beyond my imagination. and the fight scene. magnificent. i've read the book and some things i could remember. but i completely forgot the book and was in the movie. the 201 minutes of the movie is worth it. for my part they could have made the fight at minas tirith longer. about the acting. i really could live in with the characters. and gollem. in this movie he was really vicious. SAM was da man.his performance was great. and what to say about the special effects. OH MY GOD. i really had sympathy for the soldiers being crushed by the elephant. and the orks being crushed by the rocks thrown from Minas Tirith. GREAT. i cant wait to have the special edition dvd in my hands. i could recommend this movie to everyone, except the really little kids:). i give this movie a 10 out of 10. i'll watch this movie again.
7.0~A technical master piece that falls short in other areas. Onslaught-I Sign in Permalink It is hard to make a fair review based on the shortened version of the movie but I will give it a try. First of all I want to praise the team behind the CGI and especially that of Gollum which is nothing short of perfect. The sound FX crew, costume designers, smiths, makeup artists, sculptors etc are all worthy of praise as well. Unfortunately, all is not well in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth. Many important characters are ill adapted, ill casted and perverted. Take Aragorn for instance, who in the book is a tall, proud and weather bitten man with many hard years of life carved into his body and features; a descendant of kings with great claims to make. In the movies he is of average height, narrow of shoulders and weak of limb, judging from how he moves. His face does not carry the slightest trait of a hard life and his manners are soft and his voice is weak. Take Gimli who in the book is a great dwarven warrior with a passion for hollow halls of stone. In the movies he is perverted into a comic relief character who moves nearly as poorly as a "real" dwarf. Take the Ringwraiths who in the book are imposing figures with dark powers that make their enemies shake with fear. In the movies they are a bunch of sissies who get their asses whooped time and again while actively seeking physical confrontations. Take the elves, who ought to be timeless and beautiful beyond words. In the movies they look ordinary and nearly ugly at times. Take the Orcs who ought to be fearful and cruel warriors with their own cultures, languages and conflicts. In the movies, they are killed as easily as bugs and they move as if they were 100 years old and moreover they do not show off any soul or will of their own. I could go on and on forever with a list of such poor adaptations but will end it here. The point is that fantasy is very much about the individuals who inhabit the world and how some are of greater power and stature than others. This is something which Peter Jackson has not managed to bring to the screen visually at all. What he on the other hand has brought to the screen visually is Sauron himself: the greatest power and fear of Tolkien's Middle Earth compressed into first a mail clad warrior and then a burning vagina revolving on top of Barad Dür like a search light. Whether to laugh or cry at this adaptation is up to the viewer. It is pretty much the abc of horror that what you can imagine is a lot more scary than what you can actually see. And this brings us to my next point, the aurals: It can never be stated too many times how important the aurals are for bringing a world to life and drawing the viewer into it. While the sound effects are very well crafted in Peter Jackson's LOTR, the music is not. In fact, the music is so poorly fitting that it spoils the entire experience. It is too ethereal and carries no dynamics or inspiring rythms and where it tries to do so it is more of a turn off than whatever crap the standard radio station is playing. It is altogether pretentious and the only feeling it successfully conveys is melancholy. Another thing that strikes me is how empty the world is. No wild life, no natural beauty but bare mountains, no hamlets or buildings outside of the cities, no roads, hardly any traits of the civilizations of old and no agricultural signs at all except in the Shire. A few cities and the rest is wasteland. The movies can be summarized as technical master pieces but ill adapted, ill casted and musically disastrous.
10.0~The best cinematic trilogy ever khan0890 Sign in Permalink Amazing. Breathtaking. Emotional. Epic. The Return of the King is the final chapter in the greatest cinematic trilogy ever. It is a spectacular achievement of filmmaking and it eclipses the scope and sheer amazement of any movie in recent memory.
8.0~Best LOTR of the three HockeyplayerDT@charter.net Sign in Permalink I have seen all three LOTR movies now, and in my opinion, 'Return of the King' is my favorite movie of the three in the trilogy. I agree with Peter Jackson when he said this movie was the more 'emotional' of the three. All the actors put their hearts into this movie, and it shows clear as crystal.
10.0~The second greatest film of all time. AnakinVader1138 Sign in Permalink I consider this trilogy to be one movie, as JRR Tolkien intended the books to be. This movie is an excellent adaptation of the books and it captures the spirit of them perfectly. This movie should serve as an example for all future book to film adaptations.
4.0~Not worth it, sorry ekatherj Sign in Permalink Ok, the first one was cool. The second lost it in the middle... But 11 oscars for the third????? "Just shoot me" I would NEVER have given them one! No-no-no, to be nice to Peter J., I will say, that from Bad Taste to Lotr - A great achievement. Cool scenes, very computerish. No ketchup used? But the book was lost as the Ring itself. I am so sorry to announce, that the battle scenes were all the movie was. Nothing else, really; while the book is actually about life, love and bringing light to the dark places. Oh well, adaptation.... Cool Gollum thou. His appearence almost saved the movie, but then there was FRODO...... Weird, in the book he grows stronger thru adventures, but in the movie - gets more and more like a whining cat. BIG MISTAKE. Sorry. All in all a cute enough time-amusement, but.... The Oscar goes to.....???
10.0~Third-Hobbit, Third-Wizard, Third-Cinematic-Genius... makes one of the Greatest Cinematic "Thirds"... ElMaruecan82 Sign in Permalink I can't talk about the film as much as I want, I'm afraid I wouldn't get the name rights, the locations or the characters who weren't there from the start, I'm even afraid some events or scenes escaped my attention, but I know I love poetry, and the last twenty minutes reminded of these words from Du Bellay. "Happy the man who, journeying far and wide As Jason or Ulysses did, can then Turn homeward, seasoned in the ways of men, And claim his own, and there in peace abide!" This is one of the most famous verses of French Renaissance and I can't think of a movie that captures the innermost joy and relief of homecoming as the third and final installment of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy did. Even the title carries this regal glory and satisfyingly conclusive nature. And through this "Return of the King", Aragorn, to name him, also ends the journey of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Gollum and so many names that, two years earlier, could only -no pun intended- ring a bell among Tolkien's readers. I know they were many of them as we're talking of the most outstanding work of fiction from the second half the 20th century, but I suspect Peter Jackson multiplied the number of fans by a two-digit number, with a cinematic wizardry of Gandalfian proportions. Extending my statement about Jackson in the first film's review, there's indeed more than a hobbit within the New Zealand director. But for honesty's sake, and not to spoil my enthusiasm, I must confess I never read Tolkien's books, I've never been into medieval and Fantasy world anyway, although I know the story wasn't intended to venture in the realm of magic and fantasy alone. I enjoyed the first movie because it pushed me into a world daringly unique and imaginative, but so obsessed with its own reality that it almost confined to realism. More than the plot, I cared for the characters, because they seemed "to have a story before the story", they were not cardboard heroes or villains; they were archetypal but never at the expense of depth and obscurity. Despite these strengths, I welcomed the second film with perplexity because the surprise was gone and the entertaining value was inevitably hanging on the set-ups from the first film and the expectation of the third, situations that were no-more or that were yet-to-come. Unlike its two predecessors, the final film is great on its own. Everything has been said about the visual imagery and on that level, with the magnificent shots, battle sequences and that defining image of Gandalf the Grey arriving at Minas Tirith, Jackson really pushed the envelope and broke new grounds in the field of special effects, CGI wouldn't be a curse word anymore. But all the sets of skills in the world wouldn't amount to anything without a story. Indeed, I was surprised by how moving the final act was. The last thirty minutes of "The Return of the King" provided some of the most emotional moments of the last twenty years, something whose resonance transcends the limits of the Fantasy genre. And that's an even greater achievement than special effects, Jackson had created characters who had their own special effect, built over the course of two movies, that equals the lengths of three actually, allowed us to get emotionally involved with them. I compared Gandalf with Obi-Wan in the first opus' review but he doesn't deserve any comparison, he's in a class of his own. The bravery of Aragorn, the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, the torment of Gollum and of course, the friendship between Sam and Frodo could finally culminate. And in this glorious gallery, Sam is perhaps the unsung hero of the film because he suffered no fear or hesitation, he was Frodo's guardian angel with unshakable loyalty from beginning to end, and never let his ego trespass in his sense of duty. Of all the characters, this is the one I had a soft spot on, and from the ending, I have the feeling, this is what the long epilogue was trying to convey as without him, all the battles and desperate efforts would have lead to nowhere and forget about the ring, his smile and satisfaction in the end, is perhaps the true emotional reward. Indeed, the Ring was only a plot-driver, the film is about people, who overcome the adversity and come full circle with their own personalities, who seek for the peace of the world, for their own peace's sake. And what a price for peace! What a magnificent journey coming to an end, and what a satisfying ending! The first two films ended with interrogation marks, with an urge to see more, there was excitement, but an excitement pending over the reception of the next opus, undermined by the uncertainty. This film closes the chapter and leaves with overwhelming emotions and inner satisfaction; it is a "The End" in the tradition of Hollywood epics. And this glorious finale redeems all the flaws or the little imprecision from the first, all the removed chapters or cut sections. Speaking of Hollywood, the film is also known for being the third to get eleven Oscars (including Best Picture) with other classics like "Ben Hur" and "Titanic" I guess it is the reward of the whole trilogy, whose last opus was the apotheosis, something that proved that cinema had this unique capability to transport you into a world where imagination and reality made one. And Peter Jackson is one name to be chanted by the bards of the "Lord of the Rings" Pantheon, for he ensured the popularity of the saga, by translating it into a new language, a new medium. This was a Herculean task that the third hobbit, third wizard, third cinematic genius marvelously accomplished for one of the best cinematic thirds ever.
10.0~Breathtaking! Heather2016 Sign in Permalink This movie was unbelievable! It better win the Oscar! Wow is all i have to say! The cast was incredible once again. The emotional story took me away along with the special effects! Doesn't anyone else notice that there is a deeper meaning to these movies? Like in Gandalf's speech to Pippin about death being a road we all must take. Friendship, love, courage, and determination are the emotions and state of minds that are in the movie, that are overlooked. I love this movie!
9.0~Jackson makes best of three with smart appreciation of entertainment Stampsfightclub Sign in Permalink Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue their quest for Mordor to destroy the one ring while the Battle for Middle Earth rages on. The final part of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy was at the time, the highest grossing film ever to grace our screens and up until this film, fan hype and speculation was rightfully anticipating how the magician Jackson would conclude the wonderfully courageous adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's novel. The previous release, The Two Towers, was showcased by an eccentric display by the director, orchestrating a once more beautifully cinematic approach to scenery and balancing it with a blend of tight and exciting war and fantasy concepts. He proved The Fellowship was no fluke and maintaining his flow in the sequel, the New Zealander was able to carry forth this momentum into the final part with the same vigour and energy as his previous two smashes. There are certainly cases here for the best shots of the entire trilogy. When Frodo is walking slowly and there is a huge spider looming makes great tension but, on a personal level, the best part of the entire series comes near to the end when Frodo and Sam are so very close to banishing the ring for good, and with one simple close shot, Jackson captures Frodo's feelings of desire and madness, which makes for a heart stopping and riveting twist. Peter Jackson has certainly taken the magic of the novels and twisted and shot them into fan's favourites. The complexity of the battle sequences, the close eye upon constant political and action ideologies and weaving a tight knot around such a huge crew is a fantastic achievement and is only bettered by the fact he has made the legendary books into films for anyone of any age, for anytime of the year and for any situation. There is humour, romance, action, war, drama and significantly a wonderful sense of escapism with the fantasy genre, astounding stuff to recapture the critically acclaimed mind of J.R.R Tolkien's work. One huge input into the success which still has fans in awe is the CGI Andy Serkis who blew audiences away with that voice and self manipulation. Smeagol opens proceedings here as his friend discovers the one ring at the bottom of the lake. Up to this stage we are fully aware of the ring's pull over Gollum, but there is a delightful shock in store when the real Andy Serkis sets his eyes upon it in his friend's hand. A wonderfully cut montage sees Gollum up the present and his still changing debate over how his master affects him. Like the previous two films, there are multiple stories with the fellowship in the battle for Middle Earth, Frodo and Sam on their quest whilst there are numerous activities in the different parts of the country. The multiple concepts and issues flying around are smartly condensed into manageable moments of brilliance. Jackson has easily made the best of the three here, and rightfully and finally clinched his Oscar.
10.0~As good as it gets! andrewklocek Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings the Return of the King is arguably the best movie in the history of movies. It is almost perfect, if not perfect. Peter Jackson will go down as one of the greatest Producer/Director of all time. So many times we see great books series butchered on the big screen, but not this time. This is 2nd best movie series of all time, the only reason its not first is because Star Wars wasn't a book before the movies which made it a little harder to make. But if you are just looking at how well each movie was it is the best series of all time. Im not gonna go into much detail because I feel like a review on here should just let the person that is reading it know if the movie is good or not. If you have seen the first 2 than get ready to be blown away. Finally you get to see what happens to the ring and all the characters responsible for getting the ring to the place they can destroy it. Will they get there? If they do will they lose anybody else? What happens? Trust me watch this movie, along with all of your questions being answered you will also witness one of the greatest movies ever if not the greatest.
10.0~Awesome! but could have had more djm340 Sign in Permalink After my adventure of sitting through the whole trilogy, I came to a conclusion that it was all was great. I was disapointed about some items that were left out from the novels like the final return to the Shire and Sarumon (like you didn't know it would happen!) but because of the length of the movie already I can understand why it was cut out (even though they made us quite alot in the Two Towers with Faramir that wasn't needed) It was a day I won't forget. How long will the exended version of Return be? I can't wait!
10.0~A Sad Farewell to the Third Age atcalvary4477 Sign in Permalink Let me start off by saying that this is absolutely the greatest movie I have ever seen ... I will admit I am biased by my love for Tolkiens written work and Jackson's cinematic epics, but I truly feel that I cannot think of any single film that can top this film, in any way ... I believe that the definition of the word "bittersweet" certainly has to come with the viewing of this movie. A long-expected conclusion, but nonetheless sad goodbye to a film series that has touched the lives, I truly believe, of millions. I think the only proper thing to do, since I really can find no words to describe the perfection of this movie, is to give thanks to everyone involved in creating them. I don't know if anyone from the films reads these comments, but if you do, I know I speak for millions when I say that you have succeeded beyond any other in bringing so strong a tale to life. To the actors and actresses, thank you for bringing life to the characters and making them beloved in our hearts. To the set artists, your visual masterpieces have been flashed into our memories forever. To the musicians, vocalists, and Howard Shore, your score plays on forever in our ears. To Peter Jackson, your vision has extended far beyond the borders of film and into the very hearts and souls of your audiences. To the writers, Fran Walsh, Phillipa Boyens and Peter Jackson, you have layed the foundation of a film series that will conquer the disheartened everywhere. And lastly, the greatest of all thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien, the man who deserves no lesser title than the spinner of dreams. And if you have not ventured out into the world of Tolkien, it's about time you went there and back again ...
10.0~Loved it! Absolutely wonderful! halielizmiller15 Sign in Permalink I just love The Lord of the Rings and this one is amazing. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone! It is adventurous, heart-warming, and a tear-jerker. It is definitely the best way to end the trilogy. I cried so much but it was wonderful and I will never forget it. I love anything that has to do with The Lord of the Rings and this movie completely changed my life. The Lord of the Rings is such a wonderful story, full of love, friendship, action, and hope. I am reading the books, too, and I think that all three of these movies follow the storyline very well. I just know that anyone who will watch these movies will love it. Of course I recommend reading the books first!
10.0~"One does not simply vote this film a ten" Its much better than that! illbebackreviews Sign in Permalink *This will be a completely spoiler-filled review.* 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers' are my 2nd and 3rd favorite movies of all time simply because of the plot, the great characters the way it was all adapted, the score, the acting and the cinematography but 'The Return of the King' has everything of everything that any film needs to have. The film starts off in an extremely dark manner with a flashback of the Gollum's finding of the One Ring. That entire scene served great purpose as you still feel pity for the character, even though he intends to kill the Hobbits. Its for this same reason that you love Gollum so much, its because of Andy Serkis' Oscar-worthy performance. Then the film's highlight of the first 30 minutes easily goes to the scene 'The Voice of Saruman' which is found in the extended edition where Saruman exchange words with Gandalf and Theoden whilst on top of the Tower of Orthanc. This scene was superbly done and who wouldn't like to listen to Christopher Lee's voice. It was like GOD! The magic ends with Grima showing up and stabbing Saruman, causing him to fall to his death. The cinematography and score in this entire scene was amazing. It adds more and more interest to the scene. Then for a short while, we stay at Edoras farewelling those who died at Helm's Deep. Its got both grief and sadness and a nice little moment between Legolas and Gimli, which clearly proves that their friendship grows by the day, much like Sauron's. Then, Pippin decides to open the Palantir and Gandalf realizes that Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, is targeted by Sauron, so he rides with Pippin to Minas Tirith to warn them. Frodo and Sam continue venturing alone, through Minas Morgul to the staircase and into Mt.Doom, and the whole time Sam still doesn't place his trust in Gollum. Eventually, Gollum lays a trap on Sam and frames Sam for the crime and after offering to carry the Ring for Frodo, Frodo believes that Sam wants it for himself. It becomes highly emotional when Sam is left behind and told to go home. Eventually, the battle of Minas Tirith starts and Rohan are called to war. However, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn venture through another road to get to Minas Tirith, attempting to bring with them the cursed Gondorian army. I loved how this entire movie focused heavily on the great battle. The fight scenes looked superbly filmed, the cinematography was easy to follow keeping the fight scenes watchable. Gandalf was awesome during the fight scenes and the score was breath-taking. Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings soundtracks were beyond epic. Sam returns to Frodo's aid after realizing the trap laid by Gollum. In that time, Gollum leads Frodo to the predator, Shelob, a giant spider. She stings her and Sam comes to the RESCUE! He fights the spider and he wins it, but not without a defeat as the orcs take Frodo to the tower. This film heavily builds on Samwise Gamgee's character, showing that he will always be there for Frodo, through thick and thin. Sam really was the highlight of this whole film simply due to the number of times he saved Frodo After that battle comes to an abrupt end, the men of Middle Earth must ONCE more join up and rally to the Black Gate as a way to give time for Frodo and Sam to destroy the Ring, as 10,000 orcs were blocking their path. The idea of that was great as all the men agreed to go to war and to their deaths just to give Frodo a chance to destroy the Ring. Eventually, Sam frees Frodo and the two move off closer to Mordor as the orcs are called to war. Whilst the men engaged a heavily outnumbered battles, we had the greatest Gimli-Legolas moment of the trilogy with the 'Stand side by side with a friend' clip. It really was an absolute great and emotional scene. Whilst standing just on top of the fire, Frodo becomes unable to destroy the Ring as he has succumbed to its power. He puts the Ring on and Sauron and the Nazgul now know where it is. Gollum comes back and just bites the finger the Ring was in and Frodo becomes visible. Just as Gollum has his precious, Frodo attempts to grab it off him and Gollum falls to his death with the Ring. Just as the men seemed completely hopeless, evil was destroyed forever. In my opinion, the entire last 1 hr was absolutely amazing building up to yet another epic battle, but what was interesting in this battle was that it doesn't focus on the battle itself but more on Frodo and Sam which is a very clever technique. Now comes the part that everyone hates with 'Return of the King' but the part I love, and that is the 10 different ending scenes to the movie. However I loved it and was willing for more at the end, in particular a scene with Gimli and Legolas as well as another with Aragorn and Arwen. The greatest trilogy ends with everything. This film had everything: darkness, comedy, friendship, betrayal, treachery, emotion, loyalty, courage, determination, bravery and pretty much any other theme. At the end, that was what made Lord of the Rings great.
10.0~Awesome on the end of your seat movie! i3ai3ygrrl Sign in Permalink This movie was soooo awesome. The actions scenes were so amazing. Legolas was of course sexy and sleek as ever! I won't give away the movie but just say that this is one you cannot miss. After seeing it you will be wanting more! The dwarf was hilarious as ever. Smeegol was funny and creepy in this one. You truly see him as who he really was and how he obtained the ring in the first place. Merry and Pippin are heroic and funny in this movie. I am proud of them. The kings daughter is very brave too. There was a lot of surprises in this movie that you would not have imagined. The director should be commended for his excellent work. I am truly amazed. Like I said before this movie is better than the other two in my opinion and I encourage any Lord of the Rings fan to see this movie....I even encourage others who are not fans to see this movie. It will have you cheering, laughing, crying and amazed.
3.0~Somewhere in the "trilogy", this book lost it`s content and became an actionmovie like Terminator or Rambo. Sad but true. teleulven Sign in Permalink Somewhere in the "trilogy", this book lost it`s content and became an action movie like Terminator or Rambo. Okay, so they do have some really good animations and fighting scenes, but is it really what Lord Of The Rings is about?
8.0~Thank You Very Much King! meeza Sign in Permalink Come on, my precious master readers and follow me as I will take you to my film reviews of the first two installments of `Lord of the Rings- Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers' which I praised as one of the best fantasy films of all time. Come on my precious readers, do not read the film reviews of that fat hobbit I mean critic Roger Ebert. My reviews of `Lord of the Rings' are more profound and better articulated than those of that fat critic. Follow me my precious readers to my reviews. Mr. Frodo, I mean readers is a trap! Do not read Meeza's relentless derogatory reviews of the first 2 installments of `Lord of the Rings'. It's too late! Here they are: Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Oh!!!!!! Lord!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could not understand why `The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' was nominated for so many Oscars? In fact, my fellow man, I think this film should be shipped right out of every multiplex cinema in the country. I was never engaged to this ring tale about wizards, hobbits, and dragons. I hope the film chokes and has a severe case of `ring around the collar' on Oscar night. I did not like anything about this film! The wizards should be locked up in `Oz' prison, the hobbits were very earrryyyy, and the dragons should have stayed in their dungeon. All in all, the only finger that would fit in this ring story would be my. ( I think you can fill in the blanks.) * Failure Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers We have witnessed another melancholic Two Towers tragedy. That is the second installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'. This ring also fits into the hand of pathetic cinema just as the one of the previous fellowship. The film brings back all of its characters: hobbits Frodo & Sam, Gandalf the Wizard, hobbit defender Aragorn, and all the rest of these ludicrous characters who are more reminiscent of `Ringling Circus' animals than Lords of Rings. My quest, just as it was last year, is for this ring version to get destroyed at Oscar night and not receive any major wins. * Failure Ok! So this is not in the same category of a Gollum trap, but as you noticed I was not the biggest fan of the first 2 installments of `The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. However, I must bow my head for the final installment of the trilogy `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. This is not a Meeza Gollum trap! I really enjoyed this one! It is a visual spectacle! Director Peter Jackson has to be commended for his extraordinary direction. This Action Jackson will not molest children but yet entertain them with the film's thrilling battlefield sequences. Sorry Michael! He He! Sean Astin was very inspirational as an undersized linebacker (oops! wrong Astin movie) I mean oversized hobbit. It is worthy of a Best Supporting Actor Nomination. It was a pleasure to observe how all the pieces of the puzzle came together for all the film's characters in the trilogy's final installment. However, I am still puzzled that I actually enjoyed `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. Could it be that my new hobby is now to continuously watch these hobbit tales? I hardly think so. However, `Return of the King' was fantasy film cinema at its supreme! I guess because of the film's astronomical profits and award accolades one can say that `It's Good to be the King!' **** Good
10.0~This is the last part of this movie. uttapkishor Sign in Permalink This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*. The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films. The special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few little things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on DVD, there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen. The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer. There are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on, getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to look into real estate purchases now. Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the series.
7.0~A decent film, nothing more, nothing less. die_hard_kavorka Sign in Permalink I am astounded by the sheer magnitude of praise that this film, and its two predecessors, has received. This film is overstuffed, overacted, and over-directed, and yet, it elicits a fanatical following of kool-aid drinkers who bought into the hype. There are just too many things wrong with this film and the series in general for me to look at it in an objective manner and say it is one of the best films of all time. It's definitely not Best Picture-worthy, but it can hold its head high as one of the better sci-fi/fantasy films in cinema history. Maybe it's just my non-conformist nature, but I find myself, a year removed from the last release of the three LOTR films, questioning the magnetic power of this lumbering behemoth of a film. I just find myself in awe of the rabid following this movie has generated. It's good, not great. Well-made (to an extent), but overdone at times. 7 out of 10
5.0~Why??? derlith Sign in Permalink Why does everybody like this movie? I can't understand the big fuzz about it. It's predictable (I know it's a book), it's sometimes boring it has bad actors and has one of the worst typical Hollywood endings I've seen. The good thing about the movie is the direction. I have always liked so it's very weird that I didn't love this. It's a good movie but not more, if it wasn't for all the production-money they had it would have been crap. This movie won 11 Oscars and was top box-office movie of the year. I give this movie 6 out of 10 (good but not more). It's my opinion and i don't want any fanboys to argue with me.
10.0~the greatest movie jorborbffaa Sign in Permalink LOTR Return of the King is an extremely uplifting movie that tells about the success of good over evil and the triumph of a small seemingly insignificant race that has the strength and determination to complete what no others had ever had the strength to do before. Samwise is the epitome of the small character who is not very smart (his name means half-wise) and is not obviously the hero or focus of the book or movie. However, the movie shows exactly that he was the hero as Tolkien intended it, because his loyalty to and love for Frodo brought the strength needed to complete the impossible. Watch it, and feel significant and useful because good always wins and the little man is always stronger than he could ever predict.
10.0~Tolkien's Experiences of World War 1 Played Out mikestollov Sign in Permalink For me this film is both fantastic & disappointing. For a start let's get the negative out of the way. This final section of the trilogy is the one that deviates from the original story the most. For instance Shelob's part is almost sprinted through, Saruman simply disappears from sight, the Shire isn't wrecked & rebuilt & Sam is not seen to depart into the West (there's plenty more deviations too). However this is small citicism of probably one of the hardest stories to portray on film & Peter Jackson has done wonders, keeping the narrative faitful & gripping while avoiding the need to go as far as having to make a 4th film, which would surely have been necessary if he'd stuck to the book. What struck me the most, though, was the overwhelming clues & references to Tolkien's experiences of World War 1. Perhaps Jackson had this in mind when shooting the scenes, but reading the original book you can see that not much has been changed. Perhaps the most obvious is the scene where Frodo & Sam are struggling up the slopes of Mount Doom, amid the chaos & devastation, facing almost certain death Sam asks Frodo if he can remember the Shire. Squint a little & you can see them cowering in the trenches of the Somme or Ypres. Again & again this section of the story shows how ordinary, remarkably innocent creatures are propelled into inhuman adversity & somehow manage to prevail. It is no coincidence that the Hobbits come from The Shire, where so many volunteers for the ranks of the British Army were filled for the conflicts on Vimy Ridge & Paschendel, echoing the rural idyly of Lancashire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire... all "Shires". In the previous section, The Two Towers, we see the Dead Marshes, a portrayal of the dead lying in the mud of Flanders after battle. Quietly Tolkein gets the horror out of his system & onto the page, wrapping it up in a tale of fantasy. This is why I was disappointed with the deletion of the scenes regarding the return to the SHire. In the original the wizard Saruman has set up camp there following his defeat by the Ents & has set about destroying the area. The party of Hobbits return to find smoking chimneys, machines, polluted rivers & sickly children. This is an allegory for the different England that awaited the return of surviving tropps following the armistice of 1918. England had industrialised to meet war demand, as well as adopting a new wave of mechanisation to make up for the loss of so many men to the war. Men returned to villages that were as changed as they were & perhaps this is what we see when Frodo & all who were affected by the ring finally set sail for the mystical "West" where they will be healed & find peace. In all it is a fantastic effort, the whole trilogy is cohesive & masterfully brougght to the screen. Of course it had a good start in life due to the amazing story Tolkien wrote, but Jackosn has worked miracles with the film making process, stretching to new heights. In a Hollywood dominated world, where originality is sadly lacking & innovation all too often regarded as dangerous, Peter Jackson has triumphed over mediocrity & banality. Where others play it safe by remaking old favorites, Jackson has created something entirely new, a genuine trilogy, not something like "Die Hard" where each offering is the same as the rest, only with a bigger budget & more cheesy one liners. It will be a VERY long time before anyone makes a film as good as this, let alone 3! And I doubt that anyone will be remaking this trilogy within our life time, unless they want to be compared very unfavorably to the original.
10.0~A wonderful fictional film!! KodaiYamaguchi Sign in Permalink I have been watching Lord of the Rings since a teenager, and the series has inspired me, and influenced me to the fictional genre! I love the J.R. Tolkein series, along with it The Hobbit!
10.0~The Film of Our Century-Amazing! pfoley180 Sign in Permalink This is THE film of the century. It's got everything, great storyline, amazing visual effects, and excellent actors (especially Andy Serkis as Gollum). Peter Jackson has done an excellent job on the film, and I think that he has discarded most of the boring bits from the book, and only included the more exciting bits. In the extended DVD Edition, an appearance from the mouth of Sauron, keeps you thinking, while Gandalf's skirmish with the Witch King and Saruman keeps you entertained. I won't say what happens at the end, even though I am sure most of you have seen it by now. But I'll drop a hint: Frodo might just destroy that ring of his. Overall I think it is an excellent film, and deserves 10 out of 10!
9.0~One Movie to Rule them all AWANA16 Sign in Permalink The anticipation leading up to this culminating epic only made it that much more spectacular when this movie delivered on it's amazing hype. This is undoubtedly one of the most powerful and well-directed epics I have ever seen. I was amazed with the cinematography and the brave journey into the psyche of Gollum/Smeagol. Mortensen was a lot better in this movie than the other two, and the same can be said about Elijah Wood and Sean Astin. The development of their relationship is particularly moving. The only complaint I have about the movie is the drawn out ending. I'm not familiar with the books so I'm not exactly sure if this was necessary. Oscar gold should finally come to Lord of the Rings in the major categories (Director & Picture) & it should reprise it Cinematography win from 2002. This is an absolute must see. -James
10.0~in a word: wow. dmoffitt Sign in Permalink I almost never like sequals. much less trilogies. stories tend to wane and fade as time goes on... not so for this film - in fact, for the first and only time i've ever said (and ever truly expect to say) this, i would say it outdoes the original film even. absolutely overhwhelming, but not in that visually-assaulting way like Matrix Revolutions was (i.e. lets just throw enough crap at the audience that they feel they're 'imersed' when really they're just oversaturated with sound and picture). To look at it another way, its like the difference betweeen hi-fi sound and club/concert sound - I would liken R.o.t.K to a good hi-fi recording where the idea isn't to drown you (whereas rock concerts try to blow your socks off) - which, considering it's basically an effects / cg / epic / spectacle type film, is absolutely astounding. Great performances (esp. considering the CG characters and environments), excellent music, sound design was awesome. Seeing it on opening night (midnight:01 tuesday / wed am) was a treat - and it was incredible how much the audience CLAPPED - something you hardly see / hear in a cinema these days.
10.0~Best movie, of the best fictional world ever made viniamador Sign in Permalink Best movie, of the best fictional world ever made, no doubt that this movie and the franchise itself are marked on the history of movies as the books are, Peter Jackson did a great job giving life to the marvelous work of J.J.R. Tolkien, even going a little bit further than Tolkien in the character development, in resume: 10/10
7.0~Most overated series puts out another overated movie! CactusJohn Sign in Permalink Warning! This Movie is not for the serious film watchers. LOTR ROTK was at par with the rest of the LOTR. The patented LOTR lighting was present as always being horrible with the continuity of the shots from the far shots and close ups (which there is a lot of). Hey if you miss the helicopter shots, you won't be dissapointed there is more in this one. There is less walking around in this one though but more mindless quotable moments and fake heroism. Music is pretty much playing through 90% of the movie to make up for the horrible acting, you just know your supposed to pay attention when that cheesy flute music comes on. Biggest beaf with this movie is that it seriously needs to see the editing board once again, for it can be cut down at least an hour. I find it insulting to my intelligence to have the pound in my head the friendship between sam and frodo. I GET IT ALREADY! Also Mssr. Peter Jackson throws in the 30sec solo speal of Legolas vs. The world for the fan girls so you ladies won't be dissapointed. All in all decent movie not to be looked at as an artistic stand point. 7/10
10.0~Living Proof That Sequels Don't Always Suck(Far From It) neoimpersonator Sign in Permalink Not many people I knew of had confidence in Peter Jackson when it was announced he would be bringing these movies to life 11 years ago. Me and my friends all loved Heavenly Creatures, and Bad Taste is fun to watch, but we weren't confident in Jackson's ability to make a blockbuster based off a book series I love to death. Happily,I was wrong when we saw The Fellowship Of The Ring in theaters. I found to be a successful Tolkien adaptation, and a great film in its own right. The Two Towers came and went, and I was feeling confident about the final chapter in this epic trilogy. Then came the day. I went to my nearest theater, bought snacks, plopped into my seat, and had to date,the greatest film experience of all time. I literally sat in my seat, not wanting to leave Middle-Earth behind when the credits finished. The Adaptation was incredible. Parts that felt odd in the book flowed better in the movie,and changes were made that I still don't complain about. The Acting was stellar, the highlights being Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellan, and Bernard Hill. The chills that went through me during the Rohirrim's charge, the quiet explanation of death, the entire climax at The Cracks of Doom, and Frodo leaving forever deserve to be hailed as some of the greatest moments in film history, period. The Music, Sound, and Visuals still hold up to date, which to me says something. Now as We wait for further news of the next Peter Jackson movies detailing more adventures in the lands of Middle-Earth, we should take the time to look back onto why this is even possible. Thank you Peter Jackson, for making something that can't be ignored.
10.0~Is there anyone who hasn't seen this? tmp_mufc Sign in Permalink Every minute of the film is epic, the visuals, the dialog and the score. The film alone is a masterpiece in the way the story is brought to its climax, the music brings it to another level of emotion. The first two films build the momentum for a huge finale, the battle of helms deep was incredible, but the real battle is yet to come. We see man and beast collide over numerous battles, whilst we see Frodo and Sam struggle on their quest, meanwhile the other members of the fellowship face their own obstacles and ultimately fight to survive. The ending really creates a roller coaster of emotions regarding particular characters, some of their lives are in jeopardy. I must conclude that this has been my number 1 since it's release and I doubt I shall see another film as good. Greatest Film to end the greatest trilogy.
10.0~Thank you, Mr. Jackson radical_edward_1 Sign in Permalink I would like to send a personal thank-you note to Peter Jackson for making this trilogy. I have been a ridiculously avid fan of this story since I was an 8-year-old girl. I'm now 22, and thank my grandmother for introducing me to a great novel. Anyway, I thought that Peter Jackson did great justice to the book. Regardless, this is a trilogy great enough to rival the holy trilogy, Star Wars.
5.0~Too long, redundant...and confusing ending sequences??? thesundance14 Sign in Permalink I guess it is akin to desecrating the flag to say anything bad about this film but it IS too long and painfully redundant, and I almost left twice thinking it had ended. If this movie is Academy Award material then David Lean's entire body of work should be elevated to some near deity level! I have brought out the dreaded "thing" definition for this over stuffed turkey. Perhaps it could have been a pretty good little movie with someone other than a moron editing it...but this "thing" is over three hours long and then it tried to end a half a dozen times and couldn't seem to decide which was best ...so hell do them all. Ok, ok I'll settle down and give a few thoughts to this..."thing". It had some neat special effects...even if they were not all that original. The giant elephants were cool but reminded me of better done versions in Star Wars. The battle scenes were ok one time through but they were redundant to the absurd! The acting is ok in spots considering what was there to work with and...let's say the un-thinkable here...the movie was a mess of too much time on too little substance and the ending...make that endings ...well a couple of them I actually liked but....not at three hours plus to get there!!! So, it is not a good movie. Cut an hour out of it by a skilled editor and it might be an ok movie and straighten up a few silly sub plots and the ending (s) and you would have a fair movie. Sorry...the king is naked as a Jay-Bird and he has no new cloak!
7.0~Gets on my nerves. pkanzow Sign in Permalink I am a big fan of LotR, at least, I was after the two first films. I started reading the book and made it until ca. 75%. The problem for me is that both the film and the book did not deliver what they promised with the first two thirds. The Fellowship was great: interesting characters, interesting peoples, great landscapes, a great task to fulfill. Two Towers increased the pace, there was a great villain (Saruman) with all his machinery and yet he wasn't the main Evil. He messed with Mother Nature and that was never a good thing to do and caused his demise. Hey, the old 80's green message which is still topic. And we had Frodo on his journey becoming changed by the Ring. And the interesting schizo Smeagol/Gollum character. And Sam, the loving caring guy who stands for the right thing to do, for friendship and the good things worth fighting for. Interesting, great story. But the third part never fulfilled the promise. Both Tolkien and Jackson failed to conclude this great story adequately. Start with the villain: Sauron never entered the stage. Neither in person, nor as ghost. He just sent out more of the things we've already seen before. He did not even notice the Ring was entering his country. The Nazgul king was a poor substitute. We never saw Barad-dur other than from far. And at the end, oops, it crashed. That was a very poor view compared to the defeat of Isengard. Continue with the voyage: Frodo was approaching Mordor, yet Sauron's knights got him totally out of sight. Weren't they supposed to chase him even more close than in 1 and 2? But no, it was Gollum who posed the danger. Frodo never was more secure than in Mordor after Gollum left. And Gollum: Even his two personalities were schizo. Why are they always referring to themselves as "us", even when Smeagol talks to Gollum? Why are the calling each other, the ring, and even Sam "my precious" ? Just confusing what the good side of the creature is. Frodo himself never showed any influence by the ring, other than it became "heavier" (but Frodo's worsening condition could also come from the journey stress. BTW - the "fat hobbit" turns out to be rather sporty!). At the end, Frodo rushes upwards Mount Doom only to refuse letting the ring go. Not very believable, not very consistent. The slow but ongoing change in his character that was developed in the first two films was totally dropped in 3. Other than disturbance by Gollum, the journey was pretty straightforward. Was the Ring sleeping? In the first parts it was doing everything to get back to its Master, but it could not make itself noticed whan it was directly in front of Sauron's eye? And Sauron was stupid enough to a) not guard the Mount of Doom and b) start the war before the ring was in his hands. The only good things were the battles. The rest of the film was all too much crying and slow-motion and having feelings for each other. Can't see Sam full of tears and Frodo's wide-opened eyes anymore. Can't hear the kings' pathetic speeches anymore. Can't see Arwen in soft-focus and hear her whispering nonsense anymore. Eowyn is a much cooler and prettier character. I also wish there had been more Gimli and Legolas. The film bored me the second time I saw it which never happened with the first two. I give it a 7/10 while the others were 9/10.
10.0~incredible majestic2010 Sign in Permalink to say that the return of the king is the best movie ever made is a complete understatement. no movie in 1000 years can come close to up seating the spectacular, tear jerking, action packed, dramatic, awe inspiring movie as best movie in the universe. if you haven't seen this yet, you are missing out big time. the special effects are unlike anything anyone has ever seen before, and the panoramic battle shots are unparalleled. receiving enormous critical acclaim and 11 academy awards including best pic, director, adapted screen play, visual effects, score, song etc etc, this movie has been widely endorsed as the best movie yet, many calling it "pure genius", "incredible", "4 stars!" and the tough to please and respected kenneth turan saying "As a model for how to bring substance, authenticity and insight to the biggest of adventure yarns, this trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal."
7.0~My return to the King (DVD) leplatypus Sign in Permalink Actually, it's my second viewing of this movie. I saw in Spain at its release for Christmas 2003. But i went out before the end because i caught the flu in the plane and above all, having not seen the second one at this time, i felt totally lost then. For me, I had left the fellowship at the Moria gates and now, every one was split in unknown territories. As for the "Two Towers", Tolkien is only responsible of this alienation because he just wrote a huge single story. Now, with this final act, if you are brave enough to support two hours of babbling, the final hour is rather climatic and exiting because the problems are answered at last! In conclusion of this movies marathon, i wasn't a die-hard LOTR fan before and failed to become one after. But the cast and production shared a sincere and contagious passion! Thus, it must be an happy reward for them to see that this is the only big franchise selling continuously more and more tickets!
10.0~Simply Amazing psycho_muppet Sign in Permalink *Minor Spoilers Within* I saw this movie yesterday and i am still beaming from the experience. I have seen many movies, but for me, this was one of the greatest movie experiences i have ever had. Peter Jackson has created a trilogy that will be remembered and revered generations from now. Superb casting ensured that this trilogy would be enjoyable even if the rest wasn't up to par. But in this movie in particular, all of the cast members came into their own, and each performance was incredible. Especially great performances from Viggo Mortenson, Ian MacKellen, Bernard Hill, and also from Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, who proved that they could be more than just comic relief. However, Orlando Bloom seemed resigned to the sidelines, simply providing eye candy for the hordes of teenage girls, and performing the odd gravity-defying stunt. But the stand-out performance for me, as with many others, was Sean Astin's Sam. There are scenes where my heart just broke for him, and he delivers one of the greatest performances from an actor in years. Many complaints have been made about the length of the ending, however i believe that it was fully necessary and worthwhile, as it shows that whilst the battle is won, nothing can ever return to the way it was before. The Special effects and cinematography are breath-taking. There were moments where they audience collectively gasped in awe, for example, the Ride of the Rohirrim, the army of the dead emerging from the darkness, then swarming minas tirith. There are so many moments in this movie that stay with you long after the credits have rolled. Faramir's suicide mission and pippins's heart-wrenching song, Theoden's final encounter with Eowyn, sam cradling Frodo's lifeless body in Shelob's lair and later carrying Frodo up the slopes of mount doom. This is a movie that i will cherish for years and years to come. Thanks PJ Simply Amazing 10 out of 10
9.0~Magnifico! troy-manatunga Sign in Permalink The King returns fiercely to command and conquer not only the dark lands of Mordor but also to wipe the slate clean at the 76th Annual Academy Awards. Director Peter Jackson fashionably wraps up the great tale of THE LORD OF THE RINGS by securing 11 wins at the ceremony and joins the ranks alongside BENHUR and the TITANIC as the movies for the most number of wins at the Academy Awards. TLOTR: THE RETURN OF THE KING so far is the only movie to have won all awards that a motion picture has been nominated for. This noteworthy achievement is solid enough to determine its greatness and consider that this is undoubtedly a must watch movie. If you are reading this then you are a fan and also is well aware about the direction of the story. In the simplest forms this is where the fellowship clashes with the dark lord for the last time and mans greatest battle is fought. Over and over again I have emphasized on the emphatic effort and the miracle of makeup and effects of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Soaring through the clouds the bars are raised into new heights in makeup and costuming as Peter Jackson and his crew clearly outdo themselves. The detailing of the costumes, the detailing of the scenery and the detailing of the entire environment is skillfully orchestrated and for one second one will not suspect that this is in fact a motion picture. Much like the miraculous journey through the wardrobe into the land of Narnia every turning stone in the path of TLOTR: THE RETURN OF THE KING is magical and it's novelty in CGI cannot be compared to any picture that has yet been done. Do you remember how Aslan blew the breath of life into the frozen folk in the land of Narnia? In retrospect this is exactly what Jackson does he takes the manuscript written by Tolkien decades ago and he makes it into this wonderful finale which is TLOTR: THE RETURN OF THE KING. Over a period of three years Jackson, his cast and crew have been carefully working their way up to this point, this very day where the whirlpool of creativity J.R.R. Tolkien envisioned is finally coming to an end. Pulling all the stops this 200 minute piccasso explodes into infinite entertainment bringing the daunting journey of Frodo Baggins and the one ring to its end. A flamboyant finish to an epic master piece that will remain in the hearts and minds of the fans for years to come! TITLE: TLOTR: THE RETURN OF THE KING DIRECTED BY: PETER JACKSON STARRING: STARRING: ELIJAH WOOD, ORLANDO BLOOM, SEAN BEAN,SEAN ASTIN,CATE BLANCHETT, BILLY BOYD, IAN HOLM, CHRISTOPHER LEE,DOMINIC MONAGHAN, VIGGO MORTENSEN AND IAN MCKELLEN WITH ANDY SERKIS RATED: PG 13 RATING : 09/10
10.0~Epic Film Trilogy! pied Sign in Permalink I've now seen Return of the King six times and am in the process of listening to all three books on CD. Without a doubt this film series is the best ever made. It was a very difficult task to translate J.R.R. Tolkien's vision to the screen. I believe Peter Jackson did it best in The Two Towers. The books are very wordy with much conversation and much description. Tolkien actually read the books to a group of friends called The Inklings (one of the Inklings was C.S. Lewis). When listening to the audio books, it is obvious that they are much easier listened to than read. Tolkien's creation of Middle Earth composites and entire history going back before LOTR to The Hobbit and the Silmarillion. There are many references in the book, LOTR to the First Age and the Second Age--many references to past battles, elves, and the men of Numenor. Peter Jackson has taken the story and pared it down to its essence, using wondrous special effects and computer animation. He knows that the story is about Good Vs Evil, the ultimate power of evil to corrupt and mankind's effort to resist it. Christian symbols abound throughout the movies. The light of Galadriel, who symbolizes the Blessed Virgin, the humility and cross of the ringbearer, Frodo, everyman Samwise who rises to greatness. Gandalf is also a Christlike figure, dying and returning again to serve Middle Earth. I touch upon only a few. While many complain that this movie is too long, I believe Jackson actually had to cut a couple hours out of it. There is simply too much to tell in ROTK to encompass under five hours. The movie feels choppy in places. These criticisms in no way detract from the greatness of ROTK. Watching it in conjunction with the first two films, The Two Towers and Fellowship of the Ring is an experience which I recommend to everyone but small children.
10.0~The Greatest Film Series Ever Phoenix-107 Sign in Permalink I don't know what else I can say. The film is beautiful beyond words, and I feel like a better person for having seen it. I finally feel like I have seen the movie...to me, The Lord Of The Rings is one big 11 hour movie (Extended Editions) , and it has been incomplete...until now. An epic that will most likely never be equaled. Out of sheer respect, the movie deserves to win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Sean Astin...he's incredible...one of the better supporting performances ever) , Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Sound, and more. Bravo, Peter Jackson. And thank you.
10.0~The Saga ends... But the King Rules arcarrol Sign in Permalink This was pretty damn amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better ending; beautiful film with awesome effects and even better story. If Jackson isn't nominated boo the academy, and if some of the actors fail to be nominated I will be p***ed. So we will see! I just enjoyed the movie completely, but I saw one problem in the filming, to many long black pauses, because people in the theatre were beginning to leave thinking it was over. But this film was brilliant, a masterpiece, and I hope that it gets all the praise it deserves. "I can't carry it, but I can carry you" That line is amazing. ~Adam
10.0~In the Extended Edition Allen-31 Sign in Permalink Do not take this list an absolute authority on what will be included in the Extended Edition (EE) of "Return of the King". Take heart however that there are good reasons for every entry on this list because most of the scenes were known to have been filmed as still shots have turned up in various books that have been published on the film, and even the official movie site. Also, apparently not long ago, Jackson gave an interview to a German magazine and gave a ballpark running time for the extended edition of 4 hours and 15 minutes. This may just be a rumor, but if true, the EE will then be roughly 50-55 minutes longer than the theatrical release. Things most likely to be seen in the Extended Edition: 1. The wrap-up of the Saruman-Wormtongue story line. Jackson has already gone on record that this 7-minute scene will be the EE. Saruman's and Wormtongue's fate will be spelled out here. 2. The confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch King. This doesn't happen at the breaking of the main gate but instead on the walls of Minas Tirith. Pippin is with Gandalf on Shadowdfax and the Witch King is riding a fell beast. 3. The Houses of Healing. Many missed the part of Eowyn and Faramir's relationship. The Houses of Healing will show Aragorn's healing ability and help fill in this beautiful sub-plot that resolves Eowyn's unrequited love for Aragorn. 4. The trek across Mordor. Think that Sam and Frodo's journey seemed a bit compressed once they were inside Mordor? The official movie book provides a two page spread of pictures and explanation of Frodo and Sam getting caught up in the orc armies and forced to march with them as they are mistaken for deserters. It's reasonable to assume that this and other scenes with flesh out the final trek quite a bit more. 5. Merry's pledge of service to King Theoden. Pictures exist of this scene, but not much is known about how it is fleshed out. 6. Confrontation at the Black Gate with the Mouth of Sauron, Mordor's chief human lieutenant. Although no pictures of this scene have surfaced, The Mouth of Sauron was credited in extended cast lists to the same guy who played the Train Master in "Matrix Revolutions". 7. Eomer's discovery of King Theoden and Eowyn where they fell on the battlefield. If there is indeed 50-55 additional minutes, then this list is by no means exhaustive. There will probably be a lot of longer scenes like in the Two Towers EE as well as several wholly new scenes we know nothing about as yet.
10.0~never in history has this happened, and never will it again SithHappens1138 Sign in Permalink no project of this magnitutde has ever been attempted, it was the biggest gamble of any production studio in the history of cinema. with reutrn of the king, the final chapter in the lord of the rings, you come to realize that these may possibly be the grandest, most epic movies ever made. i gave it a 10 out of 10 because really, its not for just this film its for all three as a whole. what an ending for such an astonishing trilogy of movies by peter jackson. this film truly defines the meaning of great cinema.
10.0~Purely Stunning Kallanta Sign in Permalink This review is virtually spoiler-free. So is it any good? Is the conclusion that we Tolkien fans have been waiting so many long years for worth the blood, sweat, time, and tears it took to manufacture? Definitely! I should qualify this by saying that I loved Fellowship of the Ring dearly, but Two Towers left me more than a bit miffed at the changes. While Return of the King has changes (only 2 really notable ones--neither at all anything worth seriously whining about) to the text, what its only true downfall is are the exclusions. There are several moments in the film where you feel that there used to be a scene there. Not just because, if you know the story, you know what's supposed to happen where, but more like edits that needed just a few days more time to make perfect. This will keep the film from winning best picture (it will get nominated), though I'm fairly confident in saying that the film will get Jackson his much deserved Best Director Oscar. This will also make the Extended Edition easily the best of the three. You really do get a ton of story even if so much is clipped out. As expected, the Battle of the Pelennor Fields is utterly brutal and gruesome and sad and heroic and amazing--much more so than the Battle of Helm's Deep. Each battle really has their own place being a great action sequence, however. Helm's Deep had a feeling in it all like they would eventually win and it was fun watching our heroes kick hard and take names. Pelennor has a feeling of utter despair. The acting, as always, is spot on with special note again to Sir Ian McKellen for truly being the Gandalf we all know from the books. Fans of the books and films alike will be glad to know that the White Wizard really gets into the thick of battle in this one. He also looks great doing it. Aragorn finally gets to show off some of his heretige, and Viggo Mortensen acts it marvelously. Also coming into their own are Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan. Merry and Pippin truly get their chance to shine in this film (as in the book), and show true courage and spirit. And then there's Elijah Wood's Frodo, Sean Astin's Samwise, and Andy Serkis' Smeagol. Andy actually has the oppurtunity to be himself without the effects as just Smeagol for the first ten minutes or so of the film, showing his downfall and enslavement to the Ring's power, and just like before, his Gollum is cruel in all the right ways. Elijah Wood seems, as usual, to have been born for this role. As Frodo quests the long dark of Torech Ungol and across the Plains of Gorgoroth in Mordor, you really do sense that he's just exhausted--you truly feel that his body will give away at any moment. For the short time he is without his shirt in one scene, check out the scars around his neck where the ring has been hanging. Frodo is a truly powerful role and Elijah fits the bill perfectly. I have mixed, though honest, feelings in saying that I believe that this will be the role he will always be remembered for. And then there's Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. If anyone in this movie is going to get nominated for anything, it will be him. No question about it. What you see him go through is truly painful and heartwrenching, and Astin keeps every line in check and every emotion exact. His role is so shockingly powerful that it is hard to describe. Those that have read the book will be glad to know that (my personal favorite chapter) the Choices of Samwise is just as powerful a moment in the movie as it was in the book. I could frankly go on and on about his performance, but really it is simply utterly perfect. As to my own reaction to the film, I thought the first hour was just a touch weak (Towers' theatrical cut has the same problem for me), but once it clicks, it clicks hard and has an emotional resonance that is simply undeniable. The film has the feeling to me of being just a tiny bit inferior to Fellowship's theatrical cut, and far better than Towers'. I knew how the story went before I walked in, so I made sure to bring quite a few tissues. I'm not afraid to admit that as a stoic male in an age where showing one's emotions is almost cardinal sin, I cried. I cried hard. I cried out of joy, I cried out of sadness, I cried for every reason worth crying for, and I honestly can't think of a better story to have let loose this way for. Also, what you've probably read by now is completely true, the movie ends several times, but each is pure magic. Looking back, it really is hard to believe the story is over now. Just like reading the book, when it was over I really didn't want it to end. I wanted something, anything, another chapter, another fifteen minutes to spend with these characters and in this world. But "The End" does finally appear, and the last chapter in the book does come to a close. And just like the book, the movie ends appropriately though not quite how you want it to. You really do feel that the story is finished, and when it is all over you can wipe away the tears and think back fondly on a story told that was certainly worth telling. Like so many others, I truly cannot wait to see it again.
3.0~Way Overboard dstrong55 Sign in Permalink Well New Zealand gets a 1.5 for this movie. Way to long, 3.5 hours without an intermission is not good. Did the director never see "Gone With the Wind" when he was a young child? I also found somethings quite disjointed, they just didn't make sense, such as, the switching of the ring back and forth between Sam and Frodo. And why do they have some of the redundancy in the lines. When Mr Evil says "No man can do...", the King's daughter then takes off her helmet, but has to reiterate, that she's no man. Duh!! Another part that was poorly done was the ending, they get to what should be the climatic ending and then decide, well we've shot an extra 15 minutes of celluloid, so let's put that in the film also! As for people who've asked about getting 200 horses and riders to go up or down a hill, that's already been done, it's called the Civil War (a reality show from the 1860s, not a SciFi makeup). Speaking of the battlefield, next time please get Dale Dye (Cpt, USMC, Ret) or somebody to please help. Frontal assaults with light cavalry rarely work against infantry, except in favor of the infantry and usually resulting in a lot of bloodshed. Also where was all the blood on the battlefield, with that many dead, you would have expected to see pools of blood all over! This story was done better in the original 3 of Star Wars, but without the benefit of all the latest in computer graphics.
9.0~The Return of the Epilog baltopro Sign in Permalink A great film otherwise, the ending of Peter Jackson's Return of the King is far too long (irregardless of what is or isn't in the book). Don't delude yourself - there ARE "too many endings"! The victory at the Pelennor Fields is the obvious climax of the film (that's the point where actor Jack Nicholson said he left the theater, certain the film was over). Of course, Frodo and Sam's quest must be resolved with the destruction of the One Ring (and thus also Sauron, The Lord of the Rings), and Tolkien lovers would have been horrified if the associated and anti-climatic Black Gate battle were omitted. Plus we need to see Aragorn crowned king (the title IS "The Return of the King", after all). Okay, and he gets the girl too. But THAT'S IT! Enough is enough! End it already! Jackson may have remained more faithful to the story by tacking-on an agonizingly long and boring ending, but it RUINS THE MOVIE. For die-hard fans it doesn't work anyway - he leaves too much out. Thus, "The Two Towers" will always remain the best of the three. Don't get me wrong: I was enthralled by Jackson's trilogy. He just wrecked the end. Badly. I clearly remember seeing "King" when it opened in theaters: People were yelling "Aww, come on! End the movie!" At least a quarter of the audience left before it was over. I watched the last 15 minutes standing in the aisle. It was agonizing (especially since I had to pee!). I recently watched the extended version of "King", or at least most of its 4 hours and 11 minutes. It took me two separate evenings to get to the destruction of the ring, and that's all I could take in two installments. I later fast-forwarded through the rest, and only to make sure I didn't miss anything new. There's more than 15 minutes from Aragorn's coronation and kissing Arwen to "The End". The theatrical and extended versions are the same. Jackson had miles of film he could have added to the already protracted ending, but I'm certain he didn't dare, after all the complaints he heard about the theatrical ending being too long. There was no real reason to paste a lame and unsatisfying ending onto the film, and also no real reason to give the story's conclusion the short-shrift. HERE's what Jackson should have done: Create a fourth "Epilog" installment that resolves ALL the characters' stories in-detail. This would have freed Jackson to make ROTK the taught film masterpiece it should have been. Said "Epilog" should NOT have shown in theaters (would be way too boring for the average film-goer), but only made available on DVD/BD as a separate purchase, or with a boxed trilogy set. Costing them virtually nothing extra, the studio would have made even more $$$ with the Epilog concept, and more people would have seen and bought ROTK. Plus, ROTK would now be considered a great movie classic of the highest caliber, instead of bloated, self-indulgent geek fodder. One could argue that splitting the LOTR movies into Tolkien's six original "books" (instead of the three "volumes") would have been the best approach, but the ending would still be boring. I think Tolkien would have liked the "Epilog" approach. In fact I know it, because JRR Tolkien's original version of LOTR did indeed have an Epilog, in which Samwise narrates (to his children) what happened to all the characters after the ring was destroyed. Perfect! However, his publisher didn't like the Epilog, and Tolkien was forced to smash most of it onto the end of the main storyline. Thus, Peter Jackson had a golden opportunity to make ROTK a far better film by resurrecting Tolkien's Epilog, while arguing that "This was Tolkien's original vision for the Lord of the Rings". I don't know if Jackson and the other screenwriters considered an "epilog" approach, but they should have, and should certainly regret now not doing something along those lines. Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy is wonderful, but the ending is awful. That pretty much sums it up. My opinion is directed primarily toward the people that will remake The Lord of the Rings films in the future - and they will (20 years seems to be the standard waiting period for starting a major remake, so look for the new LOTR movies in theaters in the late 2020s!). Now you know how to do it right!
10.0~Don Quijote with a golden ring. mateocool Sign in Permalink The last film of a trilogy that is a masterpiece. I can only compare this experience with "Don Quijote de la mancha" or just Don Quijote. Itvis calm when it needs to be but when the action scenes show up they are great. The man fighting against the industrial revolution, trying to save the planet from horrible creatures that are the worst human side representation. You just don't watch this movie, you feel it.
10.0~The greatest story now retold in film so non-readers can experience the wonder of Tolkien peter-lewer Sign in Permalink The first book I ever read for myself was the Hobbit. I was six years old. When I was eight I read The Lord of The Rings. As so many others I then read everything Tolkien wrote, including his letters. At least Twice a year for the next ten years I re-read LOTR. Now in my late thirties I still read it at least every other year, and have introduced my children. They are too young to watch the films, but I trust they will love them once they are old enough, and see Peter Jackson's genius for directing and his child like trust in the original story to present it as I imagined it all thoughts years ago. The third film provides the same sense of closure as the book, and leaves the viewer with no doubt that middle earth is part of our history, and as real a place in our minds and hearts as ancient Greece or medieval Britain. The acting and direction is almost perfect. Middle Earth exists as much in these films as it always has in our imaginations. The only disappointment is that at times in all three films the CGI demonstrates a level of slackness that is only identify able when compared to the amazing detail of attention given to these cinematic masterpieces. Do not just watch these films. Take time to live them. As you would with a good book, put the rest of life on hold, close the curtains and tell friends and family you are away. These films are to be enjoyed at relational depths, not just to pass several hours. Enjoy.
10.0~15 years on... Still the greatest jamiedphilips Sign in Permalink I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them. I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!
10.0~Astounding jonothanwarriorpoet Sign in Permalink This is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of cinema to grace the screen, EVER! Go to see this movie in theaters, because you will be absolutely blown away. Let's take it point for point: 1) Directing: Nearly flawless. Peter Jackson needs to be commended, not to mention, awarded (cough cough) for putting together a masterpiece of these proportions. One problem: Could have done with less Arwen. Pulling the movie continually from Mordor or Pellanor Fields back to Rivendell is completely unnecessary, slows things down a little, and gives an occasional herky jerky feel. All that is important is whether or not she shows up at the end and it should have been left at that. That aside, awesome directing. Easily oscar worthy. 2) Special Effects: There are no standards by which to compare this movie. Think of it this way: Matrix? Two Towers? Mere child's play! Gollum is fantastic as in the Two Towers, but he only leads the way. There are Oliphants, Nazgul, dead soldiers, mountain top beacons. and most astoundingly, the Witch King of Angmar. I was worried that they wouldn't be able to carry such an amazing creature who also has such an important and amazing fight scene, but I was taken aback by how well they pulled it off. Hats off to the men at the computers! 3) Acting: Viggo Mortensen: Flawless, strong, and overall amazing. I would follow Aragorn into battle any day. Ian McKellan: Perfect and definately oscar worthy. Not to mention the man has some moves with his sword and staff that I didn't expect to see out of him. Bravo! Elijah Wood: Strong. An incredible face actor. The Mount Doom sequence, without speaking, gives you a clear and visible transition. The poor angsty Frodo character was getting a little old and I was hoping to see him show a bit more of a range, but that is the way the part seems to be written. So given his part he just may be given an Oscar. Sean Astin: Wow! Sam to perfection. Astin is phenomenal in this movie and you could make a how to act highlight reel just out of his performance in these films. More than anyone he deserves anything the academy can come up with to give him. Miranda Otto: This girl is an amazing actress. If she does not go on to make some more great movies after this one then it will be a great injustice. I feel she has been greatly overlooked so far and shows some amazing skill in this film in particular. Orlando Bloom: Well, he's really more eye candy in this movie as he doesn't do too much. What he does he does well though. He indeed deserves some props, though he's not likely to get any awards out of any of this. John Rhys Davies: Really has a stepped down roll in this film. He is as dynamic as usual on screen and plays the character to a tee, but he's really not around much, which I'd say is a shame. Billy and Dominic: They have been proven an excellent acting team through the first two films and are finally given a chance to show one they can do on their own here. Boyd shows some excellent skill with Monaghan not far behind. These two own the screen while their on it and show serious potential. The rest of the cast was excellent as well. You really love Theoden and hate Denathor just as much as you should. 4) Score: Beautiful. I've just never heard anything like it.
10.0~A Cinematic Triumph and One of the Greatest Ever Made blackburnj-1 Sign in Permalink If anyone thought that Peter Jackson had "bought it" with "Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Two Towers" then I would like to hear what they will say about "Return of the King". The film is nothing short of a triumph. From its intense, frightening and personal beginning, through the awe-inspiring Battle of Pelennor Fields right to its melancholic ending the film is a feat of cinematic skill and technique. Once again Jackson maintains a long film without losing the audience. His editing of battle sequences remains superb and all of the various elements that contribute to the film make it the a truly great film. The visual effects, which are out in broad daylight with no where to run in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, are spectacular and remain unequaled, even by films such as the Matrix (the original, not the shoddy sequels). Andrew Lesnie's cinematography remains flawless. He incorporates huge epic shots that daze the eyes and intense personal ones with great skill. The acting remains very strong. Sir Ian McKellen is once again superb particularly in a wonderful scene with Pippin during the Siege of Minas Tirith. Bernard Hill's performance is brilliant, building on his performance as Theoden in The Two Towers with an extremely well constructed performance. Elijah Wood's performance is fantastic and he is supported well by Sean Astin and Andy Serkis, whose Gollum is once again fantastically animated and remains a real technical achievement. The rest of the cast's performances are superb, right across the board, but in particular Viggo Mortensen who deals with a difficult character well. 10/10 for a wonderful cinematic achievement.
9.0~Great period justcoolb Sign in Permalink No movie deserves perfect 10 out of 10 however, When a movie trilogy sticks to its main plot and does not over exaggerate the characters or their environment then it is a marvelous movie experience. All of these movies deserve about the same great rating and many thumbs up for its ingeniousness and no nonsense storyline. Most other movie series' have to make some ridiculous and over-do-it ending like in pro wrestling or like in the last matrix movie - just to keep people interested. But when a movie is made with such a wonderful story and characters and filmed with such great quality and talented actors then you have a movie this great. The LOTR trilogy sticks with its success from the first movie throughout the series, which is almost impossible to find anymore. This is a movie series that if you have not seen then you need to take the time to see them all. The only thing I dislike about these movie is the hobbits. They are just annoying to me like Jar Jar Binks in star wars but it is a necessary element to have in movies to let everyone enjoy them.
10.0~tales like this can never be told better westreal-1 Sign in Permalink Where can i begin? ,because tales like this can never be told better than it was illustrated in this movie.It's useless and pointless to say more than others have said it ..this is the movie of all movies...and truly can't be seen without the other two..it's a trilogy and we can't miss out on that point..so probably because of this it hasn't reached the top spot..but it is a shame people gave this movie 1's and 2's..even if u are blind,deaf,and mute..if u feel..like this movie makes ...u are to be reborn. I'm not a Hollywood critic but right here ,right now everybody has to make a bow and like in the end of this tale..the ones that made this project come alive are like those 4 little hobbits..they have the world at their feet. My personal opinion is that as a stand alone movie..you can't like it fully but as a whole with the other 2..u are taken trough the adventure of a lifetime...i think..after u see the trilogy u are changed forever...
10.0~Slightly Flawed, but Amazingly Engrossing jordan-79 Sign in Permalink Yes, there are some flaws. See above. But given what was achieved here, and the great difficulty of bringing this to screen at all, I think we can safely say that this was a stupendous, amazing, and wonderful movie that was completely satisfying. I am, though, looking forward to the extended DVD in a year, to see the final scenes with Saruman and some more that unfortunately had to be cut out. But look, to really have left everything in would have been more like 3 4+ hour movies, which just wouldn't have been viable. Ultimately, I am very happy with this, and feel that this movie should definitely win the Best Picture Oscar.
10.0~Absolute, consummate perfection in every way sage-75 Sign in Permalink Simply the greatest movie ever made. I've been a fan of the books since childhood and although my hopes for this series were high, my expectations were disappointment. Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew delivered more than I imagined possible. They really brought the books to life, and even the few plot changes went over well with me. I can't wait for the extended edition of this one! Meantime, I'm heading back to see it in the theater as many times as possible.
10.0~the return of the king jkatsas Sign in Permalink The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, is the best movies ever...thats because the whole movie is based in a fantasy world that seems to be real, made by Tolkien...the creatures, the heroes and the content of the books can make your mind travel...as far as the Trilogy is concerned, the cast is wonderful and the actors are excellent at their roles...the costumers and the make up are wonderful...the creatures are so alive, like there are real...the special effects, the producing and the image are so good that the fantasy world of middle earth seems to be real...finally, we 've got this epic music who travels you all the time through the adventures in Middle Earth
10.0~The Lord of the Rings : The Return of The King - Saturday Night Review prashanthology Sign in Permalink What a Movie! What an end to a simply superb Trilogy! Take a bow, Peter Jackson. The Return of The King is all what you expect in a movie! Brilliant story, brilliant acting, brilliant scenic locations, brilliant war sequences and a brilliant ending. It is a visual treat even for the blind. The story starts, or rather continues with Frodo, Sam and Sjmeagol continuing on their journey towards and into Mordor for the ultimate purpose of destroying Sauron's One Ring, while Aragorn and company fight it out, to protect Minas Tirith, along with the help of Rohan. The sheer magnitude of some scenes takes you by surprise! Such is the scale of this project and Jackson executes it to perfection. The landscapes are gigantic, the scenes are breath-taking, especially the lighting of the beacons. Inspiring, to say the least! The performance of Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is perfect. When he says, "For Frodo" and "My friends, you bow to no one", it sounds so classy, simple and yet so sublime. And what follows is a speechless moment of vigor, determination and hope and trust. Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee steals the show towards the end. His performance was nothing short of authentic and complete. His loyalty and friendship towards Frodo is depicted beautifully with lovely dialogs and sequences. Special appreciation also to the creation of Sjmeagol, the creature who seeks The Ring. His character has been aptly shown on the screen and one can only admire the lengths of effort put in. All in all, The Return of The King is a success. It is much more than just a movie. It has been a revolution of visual cinema in a way that has inspired many fantasy books and movies, from the era of J.R.R. Tolkein. The film is complete, with the battle at Minas Tirith, one of the best movie scenes ever to be made. It is long, a joy to watch, and a bigger enjoyment to watch again. The background score is splendid, especially towards the end when Frodo nearly reaches the foothills of Mount Doom and proceeds towards the depths along with Sam. This movie will move many hearts and win even more. Very few movies of this caliber come and go every year, let alone a decade and to miss this saga would be a fool's idea. Without any hesitation, a supreme 10 / 10.
9.0~Errol Flynn meets JRR Tolkien pekinman Sign in Permalink This commentary on 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is really a summary on the entire trilogy as filmed by Peter Jackson. This was a mighty effort on the part of Jackson's production team and it deserved all the awards it has received. The art direction, cinematography, costumes, music (especially the music by Howard Shore), the editing... every aspect of this monumental creation is not to be faulted, unless it be the screen writing, but even that is so expert that it would be unfair to single those people out for criticism. They have made an unfilmable book into an exciting and compelling experience, and it is clear that they love the original stories and did their best to be faithful to the spirit of Tolkien. But Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' has been greatly altered to make it more cinematic. Many characters have been cut for the film version, the shape of the original story has been altered almost beyond recognition for people who have been long familiar with the books, as I have for over 40 years. Events have been added to make the movie more exciting and emotional. I am not a purist, however, and I don't mind that Jackson has made these extensive changes, adding modern psychological elements to the story line to justify these changes, but sometimes I wished he had perhaps taken a different, less battle-focused and sentimental approach to this epic tale. For instance, turning Arwen into a soap-opera-ish figure with her self-sacrificing devotion to Aragorn, appearing as a major character in all three films, was almost a betrayal of the original point of the drama. In Tolkien's book 'The Fellowship of the Ring' Arwen does not speak a single word. Nevertheless, Jackson and his co-writers make it work, and the love of Arwen and Aragorn does not slow down the action or become overly maudlin, out of keeping with the more cut and dryed story-telling of the books. I suppose the film-makers felt compelled to include the usual romantic interest which, to be quite frank, keeps these movies from attaining true greatness. This is formula screen-writing 101, but it's masterfully done within that context. Much dialogue has been invented, and much has been switched from character to character, from the books to film. I think too much emphasis has been put on the battle scenes, which are very long (in the uncut version) and almost boring, if they weren't so hair-raising and grippingly done. These movies were written as action-adventure epics and they succeed brilliantly in that respect. It is understandable that the melodrama had to be 'upped' to keep the audience from dozing off with too many council scenes and the like, but much subtlety is lost in the translation. The acting is mostly excellent. Best is Viggo Mortensen's complex and quietly virile performance of Aragorn, the lost King of the North, part elf, part man. He is partnered by strong performances from Orlando Bloom as Legolas, the wood elf, and most especially by the wonderful and very funny John Rhys-Davies as Gimli the dwarf. And casting Christopher Lee as Saruman was divine inspiration. And Andy Serkis is incredible, no other word for it, as Gollum. Cate Blanchett is perfectly cast as Galadriel, and Ian McKellen is a joy to watch as Gandalf. Mirando Otto Shines as the Valkyrie like Éowyn and Craig Parker makes much of the small role of Haldir, an elf from Lothlorién. The four Hobbits are good. Sean Astin is the most convincing little person, as Samwise Gamgee. Elijah Wood is oddly irritating as Frodo. There is something too smug about him, but Frodo is not the endearing creature his Uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm) is. Only Brad Dourif's Wormtongue seems out of place. His acting is straight out of Stella Adler's method classes and it jars. I don't think I will live to see this gargantuan tale filmed again so splendidly as Jackson has done. I can read the books when I need to experience Tolkien's Middle Earth. Not recommended for young children.
10.0~WOW Kellswear Sign in Permalink Hollywood better pack it up, because there is no sense in making movies anymore after this one. Nothing can compare. Everything will be a let down. The best movie ever made or will be made. After the first time I saw it, I felt like Frodo...how can I go back to my regular life after living through that? Neither I nor Hollywood will ever be the same.
10.0~An Indepted Fanboy's Love Letter to The Lord of the Rings: A Critical Essay on the Film Trilogy, Part Three Science_Fantasy_Guy Sign in Permalink (click on my name for Parts One and Two) Yet, despite the size of what they have to compete with, the entire cast never misses a beat. Elijah Wood goes through the motions as Frodo for most of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, before Frodo goes renegade in the second half of The Return of the King, with Wood nailing a depiction of dependence and attachment to the Ring that is critical for the story's message of corruption of power to come through. Andy Serkis chews up and spits Gollum back out with such ease that it seems Gollum was the role he was born to play. The same can be said for Ian McKellen, who had never even heard of Tolkien's novel when Peter Jackson and co-screenwriter/producer Fran Walsh offered him the part of über-wizard Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen gives the somewhat arrogant Aragorn a refreshing mix of anger and vulnerability, Miranda Otto transforms a stock damsel in distress into one of the best female action heroines in recent cinema history, and as father and son John Noble and Sean Bean each portray complex, almost deranged men who have succumbed to their shared susceptibility to power and greed so brilliantly you could be forgiven for mistaking Noble and Bean for an actual father and son pair. However, in my opinion the actor who pulls the rug out from underneath everybody else here is Sean Astin. And in just one short scene. The expression on Astin's face after Wood's Frodo sends his Sam home in The Return of the King simply makes you want to, for a very short while, choke Frodo to death. How the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences snubbed this heartbreaking performance  and about three other performances in King  and granted only one acting nomination for the entire trilogy (but no disrespect at all to Mr. McKellen) is anyone's guess. But of course, the only negative all the actors in the trilogy will get is being forever thought of as their characters, even if half have already managed to escape the typecasting. In the eyes of fans everywhere, Wood IS Frodo, McKellen IS Gandalf (despite his career-best performance in Gods and Monsters) and Mortensen IS Aragorn and so on, just like Mark Hamill IS Luke Skywalker, Sean Connery IS James Bond (that one's probably not a negative though) and Harrison Ford IS Han Solo and Indiana Jones. Even after little more than six years, the cultural impact of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings cannot and should not be underestimated. Jackson has made himself one of two prolific individuals  the other being J.K. Rowling  who have re-awoken children and teenagers of the twenty-first century to reading. After the release of just The Fellowship of the Ring, J.R.R. Tolkien's works shot right back up to the top of bestseller lists worldwide. Jackson's adaptations also slowly pulled the rug out from underneath the more-hyped Harry Potter movie adaptations, both critically and financially. The movie, along with J.K. Rowling's Potter series and its subsequent movie franchise for credit where credit is due, has given rise to endless merchandising and pieces of fan-fiction. But perhaps most of all to Jackson's credit, he crafted a fantasy masterpiece so undeniably perfect, and with such passion and stubborn determination, that it eventually forced a bunch of fickle old men to get over their seventy-six year-long bias (even Steven Spielberg  who only shut the Academy up when he started to make serious films like the masterpieces Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan  and George Lucas can't lay claim to that). To close, I can't come up with a statement of my own with which I can do justice to Peter Jackson's colossal adaptation of The Lord of the Rings in just one sentence, so as one critic wrote following The Return of the King's December 2003 release, "Never has a filmmaker aimed higher, or achieved more." Couldn't have said it better myself.
9.0~Excellent movie kljajic_sanja Sign in Permalink The best part of the trilogy. I enjoyed as I watched this movie. It's so good I can watch over and over again. Definitely the most emotional part of the trilogy of the series. It's too bad the movie is permanently ended.I wish to record another part of this film.
10.0~Terrifically wonderful. Battle of Pellenor Fields is awesome. alwaysthere Sign in Permalink WARNING: THERE BE MANY SPOILERS HERE!!! There aren't really many films that come along and blow you away, both visually and narratively. But the Lord of the Rings trilogy is by far the most visually and narratively mind-blowing film ever seen by the human eye. Perfectly satisfying, and the most awesome trilogy ever comes to a wonderful close. Minas Tirith is besieged. This is the major set peice of the film. Trust me, once you see this scene, you'll realise that just seeing half of this battle would be worth twice the price of admission. It's bigger than Helm's Deep. I don't think it's quite as intimate or emotional as Helm's Deep was, but it's definitely bigger in scale and action. It is the biggest battle scene that has ever been put on film, and it doesn't try to hide that fact. It just comes full force and doesn't hold back. There's not really any build up to it, it just starts, but I'm glad about that, because trying to put in a build up to it would just be a waste of time, because the movie is already full of great stuff, and important things that are straight from the book. So, yeah, the Battle of Pellenor Fields is by far the biggest thing in the trilogy, and it really sells the climax of the trilogy. I couldn't have been happier with it. The rest of the film is mostly very faithful to the book as well. The biggest is perhaps the whole Frodo separating from Sam at Cirith Ungol, but that moment when he tells Sam to go home is just so emotionally powerful, that it's worth deviating from the book to see. The destruction of the Ring is in fact the climax of the trilogy. It's handled mostly well. I wasn't sure how they were going to show the "end of evil", so to say, in Middle-Earth, and the concept of what happens is rather cheesy, but the execution was done very well, and it came off pretty good. The huge ground-collapsing thing was rather cliche, but it was done well, so it fit nicely. The Eagles coming was perfect, and really brought that moment from the books to life in an awesome away! Overall, the movie was almost perfect, but, of course, nothing is perfect. The absence of Saruman, and the confrontation of the Witch King by Gandalf was sorely missed by me, but i can see why they wouldn't fit into the theatrical cut. The extended edition should be a very big treat, and I can't wait to see it. It seems so far away! My ratings out of 10: FOTR: 9.9 TTT: 9.8 ROTK: 10 For anybody who hasn't seen RotK yet: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?
8.0~A Perfect Ending To The Greatest Epic Of My Time kitty-149 Sign in Permalink I would like to say that in all of the trilogys of my generation this has been one of the best. The Return Of The King left nothing out. Everyone in the movie had there ending leaving the audience closure. Closure is something you don't get out of most movies, most of them leave you hanging, guessing. This movie made sure that after everything was over that you knew what happened to these characters at the end of all things.Of corse we can not forget the brilliant acting and amazing special effects we came to expect from the first two movies! I've seen all 3 movies 6 times. I know I giving this movie a great review and you are wondering why I only gave it an 8 out of 10. Well I'll tell you. I said that this was a perfect ending to the greatest epic of my time. There is another great epic that was made before my time that in my point of view surpasses The Lord of the Rings (your gonna laugh) The Return Of The Jedi gets my 10 out of 10. It's a better story. It's a better trilogy in my opinion, but that's just my opinion.
10.0~Cinematic perfection RafaMigRivera Sign in Permalink I am NOT a LOTR junkie like some of the others that I have met since these films have been released, and I was very impressed with the first two segments of the story. I have read all the books and thought that Peter Jackson up to this point had done an outstanding job with the overwhleming amount of story to cover. I was excited about this release as I would be for any other solid movie release. What I recieved for my $6 was one of the most unforgettable movie experiences of a lifetime. Never did I expect...THIS!! Like other posts, I could go on and on about the plethora of areas that this movie transended film and became true art but that will be for others. Anything less than a complete sweep of best picture, best director, best supporting actor (Sean Astin)as well as the lot on technical and cimemtography would be a true disservice. SEE THIS FILM!!
6.0~Good to a point, then rushed to the end(s) webdev511 Sign in Permalink This is one of those movies that really NEEDED to be longer, a LOT longer. There are too many things that just get rushed past. I hope the director's cut is at LEAST 4 hours as I think too much of the story was cut out for "theater pacing" when the story really NEEDS to be longer. That aside, it was an excellent bookend to the trilogy. Acting,Sets, Costumes, Music, SFx, were all Top Notch.
10.0~Wow!! What more needs to be said! gibbsman Sign in Permalink I had gone into this movie ready for a great movie, but came out with an absolutely incredible movie. The movie was much more than I had expected it to be and it was just non-stop. It was so nice to see the story and have them tidy up the loose ends at the end. Thankfully it was not the train wreck of an ending that the Matrix trilogy was. These movies just kept getting better and better. Much praise should be given to Peter Jackson and all the actors for their hard work and dedication to the film. Each actor played their parts perfectly and was always very believable. Congratulations on a trilogy very well done!
7.0~not so fantastic hoverr Sign in Permalink OK, i agree, this movie is good. But why it's third movie on the list? And why it won an Oscar? I think that -for example- 'Mystic river' is definitely a better movie, with more moving act, more fantastic story and music. 'LOTR: The Return of The King' is overrated! I enjoyed it, but the technical side is most important in it. The story, and acting are, maybe not bad, but not excellent too. Cate Blanchett, Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler - they were almost wonderful, but other cast (with Mortensen on the top) weren't so 'unussual'. I appreciate Peter Jackson - he just did a good job.. nothing more. I recommend it, but people... it's not a greatest movie ever...
10.0~My Favorite Movie of All Time charms4u40 Sign in Permalink If you were to ask me "Aren't the Lord of the Rings movies the greatest movies ever made?" last Feburary, my answer would have been, "I don't know, i refuse to watch them." However after reading the books, i was amazed by the action, detail, character development, and plot, that i had to see these movies. I saw each movie over the coarse of 3 weeks. The thing that shocked me most about each movie was how true to the books they were. Like most Tolkien fans and fans of the books i was disappointed by the lack of the Scourging of the Shire, Sarumans death, and the Mouth of Saruman. After thinking it over I realized somethings that were cut out of the movie were a good thing. Although the battle at the Fields of Pellenor, Osgiliath, and at the Black Gates are remarkable, imagine having to sit through another battle. It wouldn't hold the audiences attention and they would become agitated. I also found the Fading to Black and White at the end of the movies very irritating, while they give closer to that part of the story, it seems as thought the viewer is to think that the movie is over. Another fault i noticed was the timing of the battles. On the mountain the morning the Rohhirim leaves for battle, Theoden tells Merry, "Its a two day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear you as a burden," and leaves. However, Back at Minas Tirith the battle has already begun, Gandalf is Leading the armies of Minas Tirith in battle as they try and stop the Trolls from pushing th towers to the city walls, Cut to Frodo at the Tunnle with Shelob in pursuit, then when we go back to Gondor, it is around Dusk, and the The orcs are at the gates with the Flaming battering ram "Grond" They break through and rush into the city. When Pippin comes down and tells Gandalf that Denethor is burning Faramir alive, it is around Dawn. Gandalf and Pippin save Faramir and Denethor runs out of the citadel and jumps off the cliff to his flaming death that morning after the sun has risen. Around that point Theoden and his army arrives in the battle, what seems about a day early by what Theoden said. Several things i was impressed with were, Frodo finally succumbing to the power of the ring, Shelob, and the fact that for the first time in 2 years i cried in a movie. This is the movie where it actually hit me that, Frodo and the ring are the deciding factors of what will happen to the world. In the first two, we sympathies with Frodo because of this burden and don't fully realize what is going to happen to him, but in RoTK you see everything that has happened to him, and pity him, and when he claims the ring as his, for me it was like a good friend stabbing me in the back. I normally am not scared in movies by something i know is fake, however I am terrified by Shelob. No matter how often I tell my self that Shelob is a partial, if not fully CGI character, I'm terrified. The last movie I cried in was Titanic two years ago. No matter how sad a movie was i wouldn't cry, but listening to Sam asking if Frodo could remember things about the Shire, and Frodo not being able to remember just hit me, at that point I sympathised for Frodo more than ever, but when Frodo says "I can see the Shire, Bywater, Bag End," I began to cry,at first it was only a few tears as the movie continued I continued to cry more, until as Frodo is boarding the ship headed for the Grey Heavens, seeing him smile while all of the other three are sobbing, was where a few tears became several. Overall I think this movie was a 10/10 even with the disappointments because the positives corrected everything
8.0~Good, but not something I would want to see again jesterjoe20 Sign in Permalink This movie was extremely entertained and well, filmed, my only complaint was that the ending kept ending, then starting, then ending. However, I would not see it again, or purchase it on DVD. At three hours, sitting down to watch it is a daunting prospect to say the least. Some scenes seem to go on forever, but at least it does not suffer The Two Tower's problem of having half the movie be entertaining and the other half necessary drudgery. Still, better editing would have helped step up the pacing a bit, and the filming for close quarters was poorly done, with far too much shaking around and closeups of random bits of steel. Overall, I say rent it, don't buy it.
10.0~Very Graphic for a PG-13? licensetophil23 Sign in Permalink LORT3 was very graphic for a PG-13. There is catapulted severed heads, Dragon-like animals decapitated with blood, and a blood depiction of fingers being bit off. This one was definatly the goriest out of all the LOTR films.
10.0~Very good end to a very good set of movies. Aaron1375 Sign in Permalink This was probably my favorite trilogy of all time, as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me. This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all. This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one. This one has epic battles and great visuals as well. It is also very well acted. Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one. All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch. I would write more, but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than I can.
10.0~ridiculously good jdavisjdavis Sign in Permalink Yup. Words can't describe it. I'm just surprised the masses like it too... but heh, I guess you can't fool them every time. The story is incredible... the basis for all fantasy and such in the modern world. This movie somehow translates it so well and then some. Just excellent.
10.0~Safe pair of hands KGersen Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson deserves something more than the degraded Oscar for not letting cinema-goers down with the final installment of the LOTR trilogy. Is this movie perfect in every respect? No. Is it a rousing finale to one of the finest series of films ever made? Yup, damn diggity! Everything Jackson said he would do with ROTK, he does the Battle of Pelennor Fields kicks Helm's Deep (and just about all other film battles) into a bucket. the relationship between Frodo, Sam and Gollum grows in meaning and stature the other two hobbits justify their existences from being comedic add-ons to members of the Fellowship Aragorn takes on the responsibilities of kingship when he must I think for many who have read the books, Fellowship of the Ring is the most important. I however always preferred ROTK. A couple of bits were missing which I wish he had included but I assume they will be in the extended DVD version: 1) The face-off between the Witch-King and Gandalf at the gates of Minas Tirith once Grond has broken open the way. (in fact without this one line in the film where the Witch-King says he will 'break' Gandalf makes little sense) 2) The Mouth of Sauron and final despair outside the Black Gates The non-inclusion of the Houses of Healing and the non-filming of any of the Scouring of the Shire I can fully understand, but the above two scenes present some wonderfully dramatic opportunities. Anyways what to do? As for the ending...jeez, what do people want? "O.K. everyone now I'm King everything is cool and that's the end of that. Goodbye and take care"? The whole idea is that some things changes one's life forever, there is no going back and some must sacrifice their futures for the good of others...exactly what the final scenes try to show. Perhaps Frodo's pain could have been conveyed more deeply or emphatically? But I find it hard to comprehend when people moan about the ending. What the hell did you want? Anyways hats off to Mr Jackson for proving all the doubters and naysayers (including myself) comprehensively wrong. Big-budget cinema can still deliver epics when suitably controlled. Lucas you self-satisfied prig, are you watching?
10.0~GREAT ENDING TO TRILOGY fastspiderman Sign in Permalink It felt like Peter Jackson had finished a humumgous project witch his imagination into it combining it with j.r.r tolkens. It's such an emotional movie. The fellowship meets again at the end but the scene that made me cry was when frodo left the 3 hobbits. The 2 movies had just led to this great conclusion to this beautiful trilogy
10.0~A True Cinematic Experience, Every Time. Micthocar Sign in Permalink On a Winter's weekend, when I was Six, my family and I, having not seen a LOTR film before, watched the Trilogy. And yes, it deserves a capital. Then, I watched it for the battles, the epic battles. Now, I watch it for the story, nostalgia and, of course, the battles. I have watched each of the Trilogy many, many times. I've watched them in the car on an old portable DVD player that only lasted two hours and I've watched them on each of the three TVs my family has owned in the last nine years. I've grown up with the films and the games of the films, the top trumps, and the knock-offs of the films. Nothing can replicate the plot or the spectacle, I know, but something to remind me of them is enough. And I am therefore finally reading the books Yes, I'm looking forward to the Hobbit trilogy (note, no capital, not yet at least.) but I am always looking back at LOTR.
5.0~Disappointing! internetgarbage Sign in Permalink This movie was disappointing. As the third and final piece to the LOTR trilogy, this film took a step back from the previous two. I commend Peter Jackson's work on "The Fellowship..." and "The Two Towers" as great spectacles in modern film, however, "The Return of the King" will go down as the weakest link in this trilogy. Some problems I had with this movie is the reoccurring patterns that we have already seen in the previous two movies. Just when it seems as though all hope is lost for the "good" guys, some swooping x-factor comes in and helps and saves the day. And come-on...how in the world is anyone supposed to beat ghosts. I feel this was a poor interpretation from the book. And how many more times do we need to see Frodo about to give up, and then Sam giving a pep-talk to keep his spirits up. We've seen this scene about 20 times already in the previous two movies. The main battle scene in this movie does not compare to the other main battle scenes from the previous two movies also. I usually don't complain about long movies, but this movie was ridiculously long at almost 3.5 hours. All-in-all it was still a decent movie but the worst out of the trilogy. 7/10
9.0~Delivers on every level Psy Dragon Sign in Permalink I was fortunate to see this film at the press-screening and it didn't let me down one bit. An overlong running time, filled with action, suspense, drama and one of the greatest battle-sequences ever filmed. It's a safe bet, that if you liked the first two installments, you'll like that one as well. Technically, it's top notch! Where the second one was a bit rough around the edges (especially the Warg-Riders, this one is a big step forward. Gollum has even more punch this time around! LORD OF THE RINGS is now completed and here to stay. One of the greatest books turned into one of the greatest films and there will be generations benefiting from the pure imagination both of them delivered so deliberately. Hollywood, please take note, that in these dark times, we need films with heart and passion to get us through. LORD OF THE RINGS is the best example of how this is achieved.
10.0~If you haven't watched this film, you don't know what you missed. shomy007 Sign in Permalink One of the films who made me want to become a film maker. There aren't many films with this kind of magic. The world should thank PJ for making these films. If you haven't seen first two films, please go watch them otherwise you won't understand the film in the way it should be understood. Many people find the film too long, but i don't share their opinion. The end isn't too long, because you cannot finish the 9houred film with simple, short ending without explaining what had happened with all those characters, and LotR has a lot of them. It is hard that you will ever find a longer film that has these kind of heart, wisdom, cinematography art in it.
10.0~The most disappointing, for me, of the three retroman85 Sign in Permalink A few minor spoilers, nothing big When I walked out of Fellowship, I was not disappointed in any way. Every single frame of that movie was perfect and could not have been better. When I walked out of Two Towers, I was disappointed that they cut the Shelob scene from the books, but I felt that every single scene that was transcibed was done perfectly. When I walked out of ROTK, I did feel disappointed. Many people like this movie the best of the three because it has the most memorable story plots- ie Pellenor Fields, Mt. Doom, Shelob. It's true. It has the best and most iconic parts of the book in the movie. What makes me disappointed was how POOR the translation of these great scenes was. Although the Two Towers was lacking in memorable scenes, every single scene that was in there was done to the best it could be. In ROTK, there are great plot stories but it is n ot done to the best. Here are a few of the things that made me feel disappointed: The poor use of music- The makers decide to play Shire music with the flute on the foot steps of Mt. Doom. I know its trying to conjure some of that brotherly comradery, but it seriously misued and a darker music should have been used. Mt. Doom sequence- In FOTR, we get to see Ring vision where the world flutters about wildly- something that looked great. How come there was nothing like that when Frodo puts on the ring at the climax of the books? No ending narration- This I don't understand. At the beginning of FOTR, there was a great prologue. In the Two Towers, 1/2 way through there was a great sort of Galadriel voice over. Why not detail the fate of the fellowship? That would have been a much better way to tie up the loose ends of the project than the lingering ending The ending- Well, so much has been said about how this movie keeps dragging on I will not bother to go into this. Shelob- Call me crazy, but I felt the Watcher from FOTR was a hell of a lot scarier than this bug. I wish PJ would have emphasized the fact that Frodo blinded it more. If PJ put 1/2 the amount of creativity into Shelob that he put into desigining the superb Balrog or Watcher, we would have had a much scarier climax. Witch King Confrontation- Poorly done, I got no emotion from watching that. It felt terrible Smeagol Deagol murder- I thought the transformation of Smeagol to Gollum was, but the Smeagol Deagol murder was so poorly executed. PJ makes the two hobbits look like Teletubby idiots. Why doesn't he make it more serious, more solemn, with some of that great Prologue charisma? Anyways, I could go on and on about how disappointed I was. Will I buy this movie? Hell yes. Is this a good movie? Hell yes. But in terms of being "better than the 1st two movies combined" - Elijah Wood, or being 'the crown of the trilogy', I believe these people mistake memorable scenes for being good than actually reviewing at how well these memorable plots were translated. I say its the worst because it was poorly translated.
10.0~The greatest story ever told ludakrisb86 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy has sealed it's spot as the greatest story ever told. In the final movie of the trilogy there is an excellent mix of action, story, and closure. I can only describe the movie as beautiful. The cinematics are beautiful. The mix of visual and special effects blend perfectly. There is even a bit of humor mixed in, mostly between Gimley and Legolas.
10.0~Perfection in Film-making kdladage Sign in Permalink In my review of the first two installments in this trilogy, I wrote: -----=====----- It has been tossed around in Hollywood for a long time. The very idea of making a big-budget feature film of the timeless novels is intoxicating. But how do you create a film that is true to the stories (and thus not going to upset the legions of rabid fans that can practically quote the books from start to finish) and still make a film that will attract the non-rabid fan who has vaguely heard of the existence of these books by some author from World War I? -----=====----- Well, for the last time, I do not claim to be a rabid fan (I read the books, I liked the books, and have felt for a long time that they could make a good movie). I also do not claim to be some sort of insider that can give someone the secret to the process that lead to this masterpiece. Just as with the first installment, the cast, crew, writers, producers, and very talented director managed to tell a nearly flawless version of the third book's tale... ...as an adaptation, and as a stand-alone movie, and finally as the capstone on a monumental film-making achievement, this film is a "10/10" if any has ever been. the film not only has no real shortcomings, it manages to fill in gaps that were left by the previous two films. Although I was disappointed to head that the final Shire scenes of the book were not included -- the point of those scenes were included as Sam dealt with he spider and the other trials and tribulations of the last parts of his journey. The film is a fantastic piece of work that I highly recommend to anyone and everyone. But: I recommend that you watch the extended cut DVD version, and that you plan to sit down for all three films -- because this is not (technically) a stand-alone film. It is just Act 3 of a 3 Act screenplay.
4.0~A beautiful letdown logancow Sign in Permalink Everyone said it was great--the final piece of the puzzle--the fantastic finish--all good things must come to an end. I found only the last part of the statement to be true. I was excited about the Return of the King. After all, it the trailers looked amazing, the CG sweeps were stunning, and what we'd been waiting for for a long time had finally come true. I was disappointed. I have read the three Tolkien books. I have no idea why anybody would read them, but the first two movies were great--that sense of adventure, journey, comradery--all formed together to make a masterpiece. But what we can see when we look at the Return of the King, is that Peter Jackson ceases to make a movie about the characters you've grown to love, and instead shows hundreds of thousands of men and orcs duking it out for most of the movie. I found it exciting at first, and then boring. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas disappeared for most of the movie. That was a HORRIBLE directing choice. Whether it was in the books or not. What made the battle of Helm's Deep so great was you actually could feel what was going on, the dramatic course of the siege and some pretty sweet moves by our heroes. In ROTK, all you saw for most of the movie was a noisy clanging of swords and an excuse to show hundreds of thousands of men charging and dying. What a lame part of the movie. Then come the elephants. I tell you, this was where i started to feel the adrenaline. This was the type of stuff i had been waiting for. You could follow each individual story of how they brought down the elephants and everything, just like The Two Towers. But unlike TTT, where were Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas? No where to be found. Finally they show up with the ghosts, but then the ghosts kill everybody and its all over. Lemme stop here and try to make an outline: Orcs almost take the city. Rohanians show up, thunderous charge. Beat the orcs, then come the elephants. Start losing to the elephants, then come the ghosts. The ghosts clobber everybody. I don't know about you, but if you ask me, that sounds pretty linear. No plot twists or anything. And cutting away to Frodo and Sam didn't help anything. It didn't serve its purpose: Rekindling our excitement to see what happens next in the battle. For me, it just dragged the movie out. And Frodo and Sam's adventures were just as linear. They're just what you expected: Gollum turns on them, they go all the way to mount doom and drop the ring in. The End. It had as much drama as a soap opera, but that didn't make it exciting or keep me on the edge of my seat, like Helm's Deep in TTT did. The final battle, on the soil of Mordor, was intended to be the final frontier--inspire teary eyes and be the final huzzah. I almost fell asleep. We had all seen it before. No plot twists, just a plain-jane battle. I like violence and enjoy a good battle, but this was just dumb. They make you sit through an entire 2 hours of battle in Minas Tirith and then pull this one on you and expect you to think its all new. Its not. Its old, linear, rubbish. Everything you expected: Battle, Frodo drops the ring in, the end. If only it was that simple. Unfortunately, as if you haven't already seen enough, they make you sit through a good 25 minutes of endings. An ending here, an ending there. An extra ending here, and look! another ending! I would have given a standing ovation, despite the laughability of the movie, if they had the courage to cut the movie right after the eagles came and carried Frodo and Sam away. It would have been perfect. On one hand, i would be saying, "If only i could have seen what had happened next", but that's just what you want out of an audience seeing the last movie of a trilogy. They always want more. Don't give them the last 5 yards. We're like fat people wanting the extra slice of cake. On the one hand, we want it, but on the other, we know it would spoil our opinion of the whole cake because we got sick of it after eating the last piece. The special effects were nothing short of spectacular. The drama was fairly intense. Everyone was ready to see a smash hit. Unfortunately, the Return of the King was another case of---a beautiful letdown.
10.0~The Trilogy Lives! mormoniacal00 Sign in Permalink When I first read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was somewhere at the end of my fifth grade year. Almost immediately I was engrossed, and began to dream of one day making the film version of the epic. Sadly, it wasn't realized, but never did I truly expect its fulfillment. Peter Jackson and his enormous group of dedicated, passionate, and talented coworkers have somehow lived up to this dream. The Fellowship blew me away completely. I must have seen it at least eight times in the theaters (each with a different group of friends), and on only the last viewing did I tire of it in the least. Here was my imagination of the screen, all its power and beauty forever ensconced on film. Now I could only pray that it would continue in the same glorious vein. The Two Towers continued the unbelievable. I was perhaps not as astonished by it as Fellowship, but in no wise was this due to a failing on a part of the movie, only a change in my perception. I had actually experienced Jackson's Tolkien before (or at least a third of it), and therefore the original shock was missing, but all that was beloved from my memories and the books remained. And now comes, finally, the Return of the King. Not even in my wildest childhood fantasy could I have concluded this beloved tale to this degree of perfection. The Return of the King and its predecessors are by no means flawless, but each deliver the powerful essence of Tolkien's work, refined and heightened. Truly, the Trilogy Lives!
10.0~Best Film Ever anjibreen Sign in Permalink Probably the best film I've ever seen at the cinema. Viggo Mortensen was EXCELLENT, I almost believed he was Aragorn. Peter Jackson is a LEGEND. All of the cast are a credit to Jackson. (Loved the Hobbits). Orlando Bloom..what can i say? fabulous - as ever! Ian McKellan- his best role ever. The battle scenes were spectacular, Minas Tirith was beautiful. MUST win Best Picture and Best Director at The Academy Awards and BAFTAs. Ive seen it 4 times already, and can't wait for the Extended edition DVD, then I can watch all 3 extended versions..YAY.
10.0~My very very favourite movie muammerbakir Sign in Permalink -Spoiler- Firstly, I think it is the best movie of all time without discussion. It is the final part of the Lord of the Rings serious whose writer is J.R.R. Tolkien. A movie can be only this great. The artists are really perfect, I adore all of them. On the other side, it is very sad that Cate Blanchett has a very short role, but I love her even with that short role anyway. I love Sam as character as well. He is the real proof of friendship. Minas Trith war (don't know in English) is also something perfect. It make you really emotional and exited in the riders of Rohan' arriving to Minas Trith scene. Finally, I recommended you that if you will watch this movie you should watch the trilogy with extended versions. Thanks...
10.0~best of the 3 grumpyass Sign in Permalink I just want to say that this movie kicked major butt. I loved it, it was action packed. I believe it's better than the other 2. The others were good but not like this. This is a must on when it comes out on DVD. This is one of the greatest trilogys of all time, the other being the Back to the Future trilogy. This movie made my dad shed a few tears cause he was overwhelmed at how well they keep the movie so much like the book, they did a great job and I hope it's true that this guys makes The Hobbit. Go see it if you haven't you'll be glad you did. **********/**** stars (10/4).
10.0~Really good movie.... drwillis_00 Sign in Permalink The more time I have had to think about this movie, the more I realize that it really is a great movie. I saw it last night for the first time and when leaving the theatre, I was not in total awe like with some movies. After sleeping on it and working some today, I have thought more about the character development, the story and the action and I believe this is one of the best movies I have seen. I still think FOTR is the best of the series, but Golem's character development in this movie is pure greatness. Samwise was my favorite character in this movie, Sean Astin did a marvelous job and deserves an Oscar nomination for this movie. I was a little let down by some of the battle scenes, but know that once the extended version comes out, it will be much more clear. Overall, Peter Jackson did a great job with all three movies and deserves more credit than could possibly be given. I am giving this movie a 10 of 10 rating, great movie. KW
10.0~Lord of the Rings - Nothing better! brandonennals Sign in Permalink This is the final installment of the best Trilogy that I have ever seen. I love all of the Rings movies and I love this one just as much. Everything about this movie is great. Great costumes, acting, story, scenery, CG, everything. I really am not a fan of fantasy, actually I do whatever I can to stay away from it. Ever since I saw the first LOTR movie I was hooked. Actually I can say I like this LOTR movie the last since it is the last. I really didn't want this story to end. Personally, I can only find one thing in the movie that I didn't care for and that would be the people, for lack of a better term (I don't like to give away anything in my reviews), Aragorn recruits to assist him. Other than that I really love everything about this movie. Also, I am a huge fan of battle scenes and this movie had the best battle scene I have seen since the Helms Deep scene in the 2nd movie. Peter Jackson has earned a fan for life since I had seen this movie. I realize that nothing else he does will ever compare to the trilogy, but maybe just maybe something will come close. When comparing movies to this movie, even if it is only half as good, it is still twice as good as most films. Classic film! In my top 10 ever.
10.0~An Epic Chapter in Cinematic History pearsonry Sign in Permalink As someone who has grown up surrounded by the world of Tolkien, I had high expectations for the third edition to the Lord of the Rings series. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job directing The Return of the King, and exceeded all of my exceptions. With the wonderful array of music, composed by Howard Shore, the scenes surrounding Middle Earth were made complete. Without music, the transitions and anecdotes of a film are left barren. Jackson and Shore were the ultimate team, and without their hard work and dedication, this film would not have been as masterful as it was. As someone who considers their self a "Tolkienite", I was extremely satisfied at how this movie followed the storyline of the book.
10.0~Sweeping warneberg Sign in Permalink The Return of the King was everything I hoped for and more. The action and drama are woven together in a beautiful, heart-stirring way. I was deeply moved by the time the final scene faded away. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for bringing the heart and soul of J.R.R Tolkien's world to life for this generation and all to come.
1.0~Delusional. saturdaynightbeaver Sign in Permalink This is not a movie deserving of an Academy Award sweep. I remember watching it on opening night and seeing the audience confused about when to leave. Fanboys with staffs and fake beards got up a good twenty minutes before the final roll and then quickly sat down realizing that "hey, it ain't done." Well, it should have been. I think that if you win an award for something, it needs to be great at whichever aspect throughout. The movie won for editing... but it wasn't edited well throughout. The direction wasn't anything to hoist high either. I didn't find the acting dynamic in any way... and if I see one more helicopter sweep of the mountains as our heroes run, oh never mind. Oh, and the giant arachnid was nice, but some of the other special effects, ugh. Nonetheless, the series was impressive because the time it was turned around in. But I don't think they needed to sacrifice quality for getting 'em out three Christmas' in a row. Some of the special effects in the final lava sequence looked like "Land of the Lost" for Chrissakes. So for those of you who want to argue that they deserved awards because of the daunting task of turning around such films, forget it. They could have taken their time like Harry Potter and done fine. I don't even like Harry Potter, but I don't see flaws. I don't see repetition. The acting is more impressive. So why award them when they didn't even live up to their best potential? I look forward to the fan boys saying my comments weren't helpful. That's why I gave it one star. If fan boys are going to bully the vote to put these movies in the upper echelon of films (which is ridiculous); I reserve the right to underscore them to help future generations know that the fans are delusional and overzealous.
10.0~What Tolkien Did For Literature; Jackson Has Done For Film! jbirtel Sign in Permalink No matter what anyone says; Jackson and Co. did the near impossible. They brought their vision (& sound) to worldwide acclaim to the best heroic-fantasy film ever made (and likely for many decades, this will be the film to top). Having read LOTR 33 years ago (& 14 times since), I also had certain prejudices on how the story could justifiably be filmed. And the same thing happened that happened with 'Fellowship...' and '...Towers'. I enjoyed the 2nd & 3rd viewing more than the 1st. Why? Because of a visual interpretation that had been stewing for over 30 years. Film is a different medium. As Jackson stated: "You just can't shoot LOTR as is". So alot of dramatic licences were taken that were minor diviations. And once you surrender yourself to the film makers vision, the rewards are enormous. No... Sam would never have abandoned Frodo at anytime during the quest no matter how hurt his feelings were. But so what! He returns with a vengence. His absence allows more of a thrill to Shelob's deadly threat, especially when you take into account that the majority of the movie-goers will have not read the book. One reason the film 'Lord of the Rings' (notice I didn't say films or that over-used label...'trilogy') works so well against all odds is because the production team never lost sight of the story's heart. And the only way to do justice to the heart of the story was to present it in the length that this film deserved. Applaud Jackson & Team the courage to slow the action down and display the loyalty and love that existed between the characters. Because the characters cared so much for each other for honorable reasons; we, the audience, were able to jump on the care wagon right alongside them. And applaud New Line Cinema for taking the biggest gamble in movie history (and shame on Weinstein for thinking it could all be done in 2 hours; why is his name even in the credits?) The Minas Tirith battle was beyond expectation. The book is not without flaws (but still remains my favorite). Neither is the movie! But because it was done with so much meticulous care and detail, the flaws are forgivable and forgettable (huh? what flaws?). Minor Spoiler: Always felt the book's Crack of Doom's climax was a tad weak with Gollum's careless trip over the brink. But what if... According to the appendices: Sauron had already begun to take shape at Deagle's finding of the ring 500 years before the fellowship (may not be accurate). And when Frodo stands at the brink of the fire and claims the ring as his; Sauron is suddenly aware of him. And in an earth-shattering roar of terror and fear, he summons his most foul beast, instantly mounts and crashes forth through the top of Barad-dur and races toward Mount Doom. And Gollum and Frodo are grappling for final possession of the ring when Sauron and beast burst forth through the doorway's opening. And instinctive reaction causes them both to topple over (Frodo is saved because he lets go of the ring). And Gollum plunges down as Sauron hurtles toward him. And Sauron's beast grabs Gollum just as Gollum hits the fire, but not enough to prevent Sauron to rear his beast upwards in time to prevent the 3 of them to be engulfed by the molten lava. And Sauron makes a grab for the ring just before it is unmade. And...and... Naa-aa-ah! That may have upset the many leagues of Tolkien purists. Besides...I'm out of breath just thinking of the sequence done that way. Don't matter cause the movie still gets a 10 overall. As far as I'm concerned, the theatrical release is a major tease to the extended version that will (will it?) be released in late 2004. Christmas ain't over yet. Bring on 'The Hobbit'.
9.0~I always felt they were over publicised, but with films like this, it's to be expected! TheNorthernMonkee Sign in Permalink SPOILERS Well here we are, the final chapter in what is being refered to in some circles as the greatest trilogy of all time. Ultimately though, does "The Return Of The King" hold it's ground against the other two? Truthfully, I'd say it's ten times better. I must confess before really considering this film, that when I think of the first two chapters, I find myself gritting my teeth together and wishing they'd go away. Don't get me wrong, they're good films which for the first time or two keep the audience gripped. The problem though with the first two is that they were so over publicised and so overly pushed that I'm just incredibly sick of them. Now, I know your probably sitting there and thinking "but surely the same can be said of chapter three?", well at this moment in time, you'd be wrong. I remember going to see the second film at one of it's first showings and coming out of it happy. I really enjoyed it. The problem was that whilst I did find it a breathtaking experience I found myself frustrated by talks of Oscars (neither of the first two films deserved anything other than technical awards) and of constant pushing to see it. In "The Return Of The King" however, whilst again leaving with a feeling of awe and satisfaction, I do confess I can hear Oscars for Best Film and Best Director in the background. In this film, everything built up in the first and second films are concluded, often in the heat of battle and also often with a tear in the eye. The paths of all the characters are woven together in a Spiders Web which even Shelob the Spider would be proud of. Moving away from plot (as I don't want to ruin anything for people), what can be said about this film? The special effects are absolutely beautiful, the makeup superb, the acting good (but possibly not quite Oscar winning), and everything else which is part of this film is by and large superb. I won't deny that the beginning and ending do take what seems like forever, however both are necessary. It's hard really to describe the good points of this film, but as far as I'm concerned, if something can't be heavily analysed, that's a sign that there's nothing wrong with it. Having said all of the above, is there anything I really dislike about this film? Only two things really stand out to me in all honesty. Firstly, I can't help but feel that by enlarging it by 20minutes and including Christopher Lee's scenes, then it would add a bit more of a dimension to the conclusion regarding the ending of "The Two Towers". His absense is noticeable and rather than just cutting it, the film feels as if he has died and they've looked for loop-holes to avoid featuring him. The second thing I hate about this film? Truthfully, it's not as much this film as the Trilogy. Basically, I HATE Cate Blanchett's character. Galadriel the Elven Queen is an incredibly irritating and infuriating woman. It feels at times in this film like herself & Liv Tyler's Arwen have simply turned up and attempted to share the glory without actually doing anything. Add this to the fact that Blanchett's voice seems almost satirical in how bad it is, and your left with a spine scrappingly frustrating character. Ultimately though, I mustn't complain. Some die hard fans have already began to complain about a few changes from the book plot, but I'm left with the naivity of life as I've not read them. This, sided with the fact that as with most males, I've always had a bit of a soft spot for the whole knights and swords scenario, leaves me feeling a glow after watching this film. If someone complains about this movie, let them go ahead, but don't listen to hard. If someone (including myself) complains about how over publisised these films have been, again let them moan, but ignore them. Finally, if someone would state in no uncertain terms that the third film in the trilogy isn't the best, then leave them to it as simply put, they probably are lying and haven't seen this film yet. To conclude, I'm just going to say three words, See this movie!
10.0~A masterful adaption Namgnihton Sign in Permalink I like to go to these movies with people who have not read the book. It allows me to appreciate the point of view of a LOTR 'virgin' and keeps in check my desire to see every nuance of the books portrayed on screen. I understand that adaption is necessary. The geeks might be a powerful force, but are still the minority of the film-going public and these are already complex movies. The Return of the King is another masterful adaption. It is easily understood, but with enough depth if you care to take notice. There are plot differences, additions and omissions from the book, but there are enough iconic moments and lines lifted directly off the page to satisfy this fan. The visual look of the film faithfully represents middle earth as many fans have envisioned it - perhaps because John Howe and Alan Lee's illustrations have inspired our imaginations long before these movies were conceived. This is my favourite of the series simply because it was my favourite book - with my favourite part of the two towers (Shelob) thrown in for good measure.
10.0~Truely Excellent Overall - but I missed some familiar friends from the book kiwimeat Sign in Permalink I need to go again so I can see more of the movie - my first viewing was not enough to see everything. I must admit to being slightly disappointed by a couple of things: - I felt that the Palantir were not done well at all - no explanation and context seemed wrong - much I guess due to the cutting of Saruman's scenes. As an avid reader of the books, I missed the Mouth of Sauron, the mustering of the allies before Pelennor Fields, Sauruman's downfall and ultimate end during the Scouring of the Shire. My other issue is one that I guess cannot be overcome in movie adaptions of books, and that is the loss of almost all of Tolkein's rich historical fabric of Middle Earth. To even attempt it would have required a voice over which I don't think would have worked. These minor nitpicks aside, so many things were excellent: - The aerial tracking shot of Gandalf and Pippin riding up through the 7 rings of Minas Tirith, The Witch King preparing for war, and his downfall at the hands of "Dernhelm" Grond the Ride of the Rhorrim Shelob Gollum Samwise Gamgee - Sean Astin acting his socks off compared to any previous work Aragorn and all the "men" bowing to the four hobbits Overall, I think Peter Jackson and fellowship have crafted a truely excellent movie, and a fitting end to the Trilogy. I haven't made up my mind whether it is the best of the three yet. I still favour FOTR if only for the reason that it was the first and it so clearly proved that it was possible to make Middle Earth real on film and keep the spirit of the books.
9.0~Best fantasy movie ever made!!! mmustafad Sign in Permalink Editing, story, scenario and so on. Everything I've seen in this movie is perfect. This is best until a better film(triology) is made.
10.0~Amazing Story thegillettetv Sign in Permalink If you read the books, and expect 100% accuracy, then your in for a surprise. I've yet to see any movie do that. Yet this series has a lot of great things going for it. The story line is great, the CGI is insane, and the actors are good. A classic indeed.
9.0~I miss 2003. svbfilms Sign in Permalink I want to write a review so I can complete the checklist that new members have to go through when they create their new accounts. I was eight when this film came out, it was a wednesday and my brother and I were the only kids in the cinema (we went in at 22:30, school next day). I really enjoyed the film, I never asked myself why and I'll probably never will. I hope this is long enough to count as a review. Good film.
10.0~Unprecedented. GuyCC Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has done it. He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole? Perfect. I've never seen a series like this. A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible? I have always loved the original "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. They do not make films like these anymore. As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where "Two Towers" ends, so brush up before seeing it. I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective. I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done "right". And when it happened, it was. I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level. The cast comes through once more. The musical score retains its beauty, elegance and power. The special effects, notably Gollum again, are nothing less than breathtaking, and simply move the story along. The battles are monumentally huge and exciting. There are some liberties taken with the story, especially during the end with the homecoming, and yet, everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself, the story provided a breather. And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years. It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no "Rings" movie in 2004. I will miss this talented group of actors. As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. This film is so much more than a simple "fantasy" epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been. I will miss looking forward to a new "Rings" movie, but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story, bathroom humor, or a "Top 40" soundtrack. George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fanbase. Each film has earned a "10" from me for the last two years, which for me to give is a rarity. This one, however, is as equally deserving as its two predecessors. The Academy had better not look over this film for "Best Picture" of 2003. To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them.
10.0~The BEST movie of the series Mitch-25 Sign in Permalink Watching this great movie for the second time, I remember some of the best times I had as a moviegoer especially as a kid. I remember watching the original Star Wars series with a SERIOUS amount of amazement. Raiders of the Lost Arc gave me a great sense of adventure. And, the first Jaws scared the hell out of me. All these movies (and others like them) PROVIDED something for me to remember. In addition, they were just plain FUN movies. Not pretentious, overwrought or just plain dumb. Most of today's movies are just plain nonsense. They have no heart like they used to. They are all made for the sole purpose of making a buck. Although I am sure that New Line Cinema would love to make billions on this series, and Peter Jackson and his people are being paid well for their efforts, that does not prevent these movies from being great works of art and just plain fun. I remember reading these books as a kid, and I have always loved them and wanted somebody to do a proper adaptation of them. Now that the final book has been brought to the big screen we can see the entire series from a new perspective and I for one admire it more than I ever have. It would have been easy for Jackson and co. after the success of Fellowship to just give people a shortened version of the last two books with teasers here and there but no substance. But, he has not done this. Return of the King is the best example of this. In this movie, Jackson has made a movie that works very well with the books and finds the most essential parts of it to make a movie that works on just about every level. From the scenery in New Zealand to the look of the battles (I felt as if I WAS there) to the incomparable computer effects of Gollum and the equally amazing effects of Shelob, ever part was filmed with a care to the details that the books deserved. The dialog in this movie is also much better than in Two Towers. I loved this movie from the first scene of how Smeagol finds the ring of power to the last frame of Sam closing his door in the Shire. Back to what I was saying at the top. Very few movies today give me a sense of wonder that I had as a kid. This series certainly does this. From the beginning to the end, the movies are a stunning achievement and worthy of any awards it receives.
10.0~A modern masterpiece tigger_robinson1 Sign in Permalink From the opening sequence to the final curtain, The Return Of The King is an outstanding piece of modern cinema. The story kicks off where The two Towers left off. Frodo is trying to destroy the ring and his friends are trying to save Middle-earth. As expected the storyline is fantastic, the acting outstanding (special nod to Sir Ian Mckellen), and the special effects the best ever committed to film. As a non-fantasy lover, I wasn't interested in these films and was forced to see the first one by my partner, but I was bowled over and the anticipation for the third almost killed me. With such hype you always end up disappointed (see The Matrix Reloaded), but with this, my expectations were exceeded. With so many stand-out moments its so hard to pick a favourite, but do know this, The Return Of The King will be hailed as a benchmark for all that come after it.
10.0~Wow...... Pretty much superb. leeboyoellis Sign in Permalink A few years ago, I was into really gory horror films (still am now), and one that I saw was braindead. I thought it was brilliant and funny, and the direction was superb - it was my best movie ever. Fast forward to the year 2000, and I read this story - the lord of the rings. I loved the book, I was 20 at the time, and heard that the film was coming out - and guess who was directing it - the director of my favourite film ever - Braindead - yep, it was peter Jackson. I was a wee bit excited, to say the least, and the film didn't disappoint. The direction is the same style as braindead - novel approaches and amusing angles, but I was worried it wouldn't be taken seriously due to Peter Jacksons' previous films. I find the films very close to the book - though not exactly as the books are (Tom Bombadil being someone who should have been included in FOTR). The Special effects are superb, and you can tell the actors enjoyed making the film. I love all the films, and give them a worthy 10/10. Well done Mr. Jackson!!!!
10.0~This Christmas The Journey cjx_009 Sign in Permalink The Fellowship makes its final path through war and wilderness. The story comes to an 11 academy award winning climax. The movie has a stunning power unlike the other two. Peter Jackson uses incredible insight into sstories and themes and character study. The Return of the King culminates its three story lines unimaginably. As the characters finish what is a three year journey you see exactly why Peter Jackson made the fellowship and the two towers because he wanted to arrive at this incredible finale to what is a career trilogy. I enjoyed this film for two main reasons action and intimacy. The action is stunningly realized by weta workshop. But even though the action is great at the center of it is what is a wonderfully intimate story. As Frodo and Sam make their way to Mount Doom we really get to see them both rise to the occasion. We see the real power of friendship as Gollum continues to try to break it. When Aragorn and Gandalf arrive at over 600.000 orcs and yet they stand as strong as they were at Helm's Deep. I become more amazed as the tale goes on we see how difficult and at what price will either side win. The feelings of community within us. This is a classic and whoever watches will not be disappointed. 10/10
10.0~amazing movie... future classic and sets the bar for others almi_kala7 Sign in Permalink This movie completes the series perfectly Jackson is a genius. This movie is a must watch for any and every person, no matter the race or gender. The only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. It's quite depressing. I have watched this movie at least once a new year, and ever road trip. It's very entertaining, kills time, inspiring, awesome action scenes and the work on the Uruk-Hai and the other beasts is incredible. I only hope they make a remake that is even better than this movie, if thats possible. All those haters who say that this movie is boring, then they are missing the point, and i would love to see what movies they find interesting. If there was a rating higher than 10, i would give it hands down. OVERALL = AMAZING 10/10
10.0~Great jared_thesubway_guy86 Sign in Permalink This is the best of the trilogy, and I am glad that It ended so well, I think that this movie will have the critics buzzing again when it comes to Oscar time. This movie will shape the way other movies advance over the next few years.
10.0~Finally a perfect ending to a masterpiece in film-making! hyrumnephi Sign in Permalink First of all, let me say I have never read the books. (That is my next step) I can't say enough about ROTK. This movie will, without a doubt, go down as one of the greatest movies of all time, I certainly am not aware of any sequel that parallels this movie in any way. The acting was superb, the story was obviously amazing. Sean Astin as Sam should win an oscar for his picture. Dare I say best picure as well? And finally the ending was just perfect. As I was watching the last 20 minutes, I just nodded my head gently up and down, and thought "Yeah, this is the way this movie needs to end, this is perfect" For all those who have not seen the movie, you are in for such a special treat!
10.0~Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have a great dynamic Maniac-9 Sign in Permalink It's easy to say that LOTR: The Return of the King has the most interaction of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee of all the LOTR movies. A result of that is you get to really see the great chemistry exhibited by these two actors working together. This is the best of all the LOTR movies in my opinion, the way all the stories tie together just works to perfection. Finally you can see Aragorn taking his rightful place as the new king. When Frodo finally gets to Mordor and throws the ring into the pits of it is an extremely well done scene. This is probably the longest single movie not counting the Godfather movies I've ever seen but it entertains from start to finish.
10.0~An epic conclusion to an epic saga chizzlemoviepicks Sign in Permalink I first watched the LOTR Trilogy when I was 13 y/o. It was my father's favorite movie. Back then, I was not able to understood fully what it is all about but I liked it. I did not love it like I loved Harry Potter back then, but I liked it. Entering High School, I have gotten the chance to re-watch the whole trilogy again and again and again, and this time I absolutely loved it. I became obsessed with the story. Tolkien, created a beautiful world, and wrote about this amazing characters. We see each of the characters' growth as we followed their journey up to the end. The cinematography of all movies are spot on. The sound was done beautifully and the actors gave life to one of the most-loved characters of all time. The Return of The King concludes the story of Middle-Earth, having peace back in their world. We know that CGI can both be the angel and the demon at the same time but with this film, it was done just right. This truly elevated my standard with films. The quality was spectacular and truly a timeless piece.
10.0~Awesome movie judsongarr Sign in Permalink I love this movie. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. Of course, the book is better, it has more detail in it. But overall I think that the movie had some pretty awesome detail in it. I recommend this to anyone who has seen, and liked, "The Hobbit". If you are going to watch this movie, then I suggest that you get prepared for random attacks, jumping up in your seat from a monster on the screen, or even get a little bit excited for the romance that is in the movies, of the series. If you don't like "Harry Potter", this is still a good movie for you to watch. You should probably watch the movies in order, because the last one will make like no sense what-so-ever. Be prepared for action and adventure, because that is what this movie is all about. Thank you for taking time to read my review on "The Lord of the Rings""The Return of the King".
10.0~There are "movies" and then there is LOTR cacikra Sign in Permalink I admit I have an irrational fondness for these films, loving them more each time I see them. I know others here have said this, but if you've only seen ROTK once, go again. There's too much to absorb on first viewing. I've seen it several times, each time in a large, filled or nearly filled theatre, and I think it speaks to the power of the filmmaking and the story that I marvel each time at how little squirming, shuffling, and sighing there is for such a long movie. Granted, there are people who hate the ending(s), but again, on second viewing, it feels right and deserved. I'm sad only that there won't be another one to look forward to next December.
10.0~Simply Unbelievable smobocop Sign in Permalink This is film is simply amazing.Admittingly the begin was somewhat slow, but as soon as it the story begain to pick up it was just consuming. The visual effects were just as spectacular as ever but it is the acting of some of characters which is truly impressive. There so much you can say about this movie, but all you can say is Long Live The King. If no oscar is given to this its a farce to all movies.
9.0~Very good... but slightly overrated 8.5/10 vyperman7 Sign in Permalink I was able to see this film at the Midnight premiere on Wednesday morning, before it hit the theaters. While I did enjoy the film a lot more than The Two Towers, Fellowship of the Ring is still the best film of the trilogy in my opinion. ***** SPOILER ALERT ********* Pros : Great battle scenes Sean Astin was flat out amazing as Sam Gollum was great The army of the dead was very cool Aragon finally accepted his role as king. Arwen and Aragon end up together Cons : No Christopher Lee!!! - He was such a huge character in the two previous films, and in Return of the King, he was simply written off because he had lost his powers. I was also disappointed with Sauron. He is the driving evil force for the whole trilogy, and he went down so easily. He stayed trapped within the magic eye. I would have loved it, if Sauron would have manifested himself so that him and Aragon could have fought it out. This would have symbolized the ultimate battle for good vs evil perfectly. The sword that was responsible for destroying Sauron was reassembled in Return of the King and given to Aragon to fight with in battle. It would have been very fitting, if Sauron would have had to battle the sword once again. Then just as the ring is destroyed, Sauron is defeated by Aragon. My biggest complaint about the film was the ending. It was extended unecessarily by at least 20 minutes. The perfect place to end the film, would have been when Aragon said that Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Meri bowed to no one, and the camera pulled back to show the entire crowd near the castle. Instead, it just kept going and going and going with constant tease after tease. That kind of slowed the pace of the film down for me. Overall : The film is not perfect like people are making it out to be, and the film is slightly overrated. But the film is very enjoyable, and provided for a marvelous film going experience. Peter Jackson should be proud of himself, because he did the impossible of bringing Lord of the Rings to the big screen. How I rank the Lord of the Rings trilogy : Fellowship of the Ring = 10/10 The Two Towers = 7.5/10 Return of the King = 8.5/10
9.0~And so it ends... dave_brent_office Sign in Permalink ...but on such a high note. The Return of the King is the best of the trilogy in my opinion. Surpassing TTT in special fx and computer animation in the battle scences, and extending the storyline, which I think lacked a bit from TTT. RotK is a stunning conclusion to an epic trilogy; Watch out for the "oliphonts" Si
10.0~The Best Movie Ever Made, really! germanflyboy Sign in Permalink This movie was just spectacular. I finished watching it for about the fiftieth time, and it never gets old, worn out, or boring. Its scenes are powerful, its dialogue delivered with Shakespearean grace, and its acting is top notch. Sean Astin is the star of this film in my book. He took a simple character and over the course of three films built that character into someone special. When Sam started carrying Frodo up Mount Doom, everyone in the theater cheered, and so did I. It was beautiful. Ian McKellen has also been given a monumental role. He fulfilled all my expectations after rereading the book, evoking all I ever imagined about Gandalf and the Siege of Minas Tirith. The battles were perfect. The sense of timing, of detail, and emotional intensity was incredible. I have never seen such heartfelt power from a battle scene in any movie...ever. King Theoden's charge was probably the greatest moment in the movie, but there is stiff competition. The scene called The White Rider comes in a close second. Recent movies like Troy have tried to recreate that sense of epic warfare, but they've not come close to intensity of Return of the King. This movie is the fastest three hours I've ever been blessed to sit through. From being a fan of Tolkien's work, this movie was richer because of it. For me...this movie is the best ever made.
8.0~Not bad but a terrible ending ellimic Sign in Permalink I never read the books but think this trilogy isn't bad, at times I'd even say they're good films, but they RUIN IT with that army of dead men! Ghosts that cannot be touched by anyone (except Aragorn) yet are able to cut through living beings like they aren't there? Without the dead men Sauron would undoubtably have won, despite the death of the lead ring wraith, and I would have enjoyed seeing how that played out. I'm just glad after going to recruit the dead army it cut back to the decent scenes in the battle (implausible giant elephants aside) and we did not see the dead again until they rushed off the water.
10.0~I was moved to tears kenobi503 Sign in Permalink I would call myself avid movie patron and thus have seen my fare share of movies. I have never in all my life seen a movie to where I was moved to tears never the less throughout the entire film. Each seen kept getting more powerful and no matter how hard I fought back it couldn't stop the pure joy and admiration I felt. Thank you Peter Jackson and Mr. Tolkien, today i was honored and priviledged with the opportunity to see that film. Thank you.
10.0~A day after I've seen it and I still can't do anything... Heraldus Sign in Permalink I had the privilege of seeing the movie a day before it was in theaters. Actually, I've seen all three of them in a row! And if I attempt to describe this movie in one word, it would be: Astonishing! Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job, and the ending is just 'wow'! This movie is definitely a recommendation for everyone!
10.0~First was better ADOZER200 Sign in Permalink This was all around a great film. The graphics were beautiful and the acting superb. I just feel that there was something missing. I guess something didnt meet up to my expectations, but the extended version promises much more deleted scenes. Hopefully that will fullfill my needs. The second film i felt the same way so hopefully they will have more in the extended version. Above all I thought the movei was awesome and I have to give Sean Astin credit for doing what I think was the best out of all the actors. I loved his performance in the movie and hopefully hollywood will realize who the real actors are in stead of these crappy actors like colin farrel or ben affleck. I recommend this film to anyone who is into fantasy adventure type movies.
10.0~The best Finale to an amazing series vulpeculaca Sign in Permalink This is not a movie for the uninformed.. Read the book, and you will love this. Peter Jackson has done an amazing job, and brought out the best in all his actors. I could not have asked for a better end to the trilogy, although i had kinda got used to looking for a new LOTR movie every christmas, but all good things must end. Purists might argue Peter Jackson's omittal of Tom Bombadil or the scoring of the Shire, but hey, why don't you try fitting the story within 3 movies!! I do wish that he's shot some more stuff that never made it past the cutting room, and something that we may get to see 2 years from now... The COMPLETE story, 15 or so hours! I'm eagerly looking forward to the extended edition next Fall.
10.0~one word.... EPIC eskimo_dan Sign in Permalink The only word that can describe the film, gigantic, wild, beyond belief. The story is great and the film is even better. The finest of the three films, over the past two films you have got to see the characters and now they have grown on you in the final chapter. The Music as always is fantastic and sets the scene. Along with great sets, backgrounds, props, and above all the acting. Peter Jackson, has accomplished is main aim, to do justice to the book, and to make the film seem real. And it does, at every step of the way, you feel like you are there in the world of middle earth. I am sure you will all see it, without reading this, but even if you didn't like the first two, you will surely like this, even if it is only for the fighting scenes, which, to be honest, make the battle at helms deep seem like a joke. This really is one of the top 10 films ever made
10.0~Can we say fab? dbracco86 Sign in Permalink Yes, we can! I mean honestly, what more can we say about an ultramod finale to the LOTR trilogy. Everything from Billy Boyd's singing, to Orlando's every move...perfection. Shore's music combined with every camera shot makes for an incredible, oscar-winning film. The cast is comprised of talented individuals that bring Tolkien's book to life. It does what it can, and as for the long ending that some audience members feel is too long...how could the film possibly end any sooner? The story itself is huge, so with all respect to finding closure in each aspect of the storyline, every moment of the ending is necessary. (And to the LOTR diehards...who wants to end the movie?) This is an absolutely fabulous movie, period.
2.0~work of ART??? korhun Sign in Permalink If I had never watched a movie in my lifetime, this might be so.. however it is not so. I haven't read its book and my words are not for its source, but this is a boring film with lots of conflicts.. the only thing looked nice was the city design and some war scenes.. but these does not make something a movie.. People who read the book around me forced me to see the imagination of the writer? Sorry but is this an imagination? :) The good who is weak but handsome always beats the BAD who looks very strong and having all the advantages.. it was also interesting to watch the adventures of the cut on Frodo's face :)) I m very surprised to see this movie almost at the top of list..
10.0~Best one of the lot rookie-8 Sign in Permalink I don't know what to say about this film. I don't know where to begin. I don't know what to focus on, think on, obsess on first, as I have never seen a film so complete, so nearly perfect, that it almost calls for no words at all. I usually have a lot to say, thinking, and sometimes rightfully so, that the better a piece of art the more one should dissect it. Make no mistake, this is a piece of art. The whole trilogy, all three movies, are breathtaking pieces of creativity at its highest. It is what Aristotle considered "high art" and it makes no apology for making its audience think, while giving them enough visual effects to just astonish a a dumbfounded movie theatre. While all three pieces are art, this last film is the Mona Lisa of the group. I adored Fellowship, loved Twin Towers but found some of the magic gone, and have been changed by Return of the King. This movie tried to do so many things, which usually makes for a choppy, chaotic movie going experience. Movies that attempt too much usually in the end resemble politicians trying to be everything to everyone. By the end no one wants anything to do with them. Consider this the exception to the rule. It tries to be a character driven drama, which is succeeds in doing. It tries to be an action packed, visual effects masterpiece, which it succeeds in doing. And finally, it attempts to interject enough humor and lighthearted attitude to keep the audience from become enveloped in a dark cloud of its own, which it also succeeds in doing. Oh yes, and one more thing: it attempts the greatest challenge of them all, how to turn a literary classic, of such utter complexity that no one else has ever attempted it, into a classic piece of film, while staying true to the books themselves, and in this the film succeeds beyond my wildest dreams. The struggle in this last film is so desperate, the drain so apparent on all the warriors faces, that even those of us who know the end by heart still grimace as our heros face peril after peril. And our characters connect with each of us, completely. We feel for each one. We know each ones strengths and weakness's, and we fear that one or two may, in the end, not make it. I can imagine what it must be like to fall in love with these movies having never read the books, having never fallen in love with the world Tolkien created on page. To not know what is going to happen, who is going to live and who is going to die, must be a nerve racking experience in this film. One I envy in some ways, though the love of the books is far greater and more fullfilling then anything experienced in the theatre. No, this film keeps the book to heart, and respects the author, the true imagination behind the world we see on the screen. So many films today, taken from extrodinary novels, try too hard to distance themselves from the writer and their vision. Each one inevitably fails miserably. But this film, and all three in fact, stay as close as possible to the novel that one would suspect Tolkien is smiling to himself somewhere right now. I could write another 1000 words on the acting in this film, which should eventually be recognized, and the direction of such complex movies that require so many story lines to blend seamlessly, but that almost takes away from the beauty of this film. You see, at the end of this movie you don't feel as if you have watched a story, a fictional tale involving fake characters. Instead, you feel attached. You feel one with the people who have sweat and suffered in the screen above. There are no actors to congratulate because these are real people, living real adventures, adventures we have the privilege to ease drop on. I am sad these films are over, sadder then I have ever been before. I will eventually own these movies, and eventually, on a rainy or snowy day, I will watch all three in succession. But I will never again have the pleasure to experience these movies for the first time. I will never again be able to feel that pit in my stomach as moments are revealed and characters become heros. I will never again feel the way I do tonight, and that makes me sad. But for all of you who have not seen this movie yet, those feelings await you.
10.0~Oscar Worthy? garycharris Sign in Permalink ABSOLUTELY!!!! Peter Jackson should win Best Director and I'm guessing this film wins Best Picture. I've seen it's biggest competitor "Cold Mountain" and there is no contest. Don't hold your breath for acting nominations however, this film is too much of an ensemble piece to garner any.
10.0~Awe Inspiring danny_beaton Sign in Permalink Potentially one of the best films of all time. The final of the three films presents a holy front, concluding both the predecessors with no remaining questions. The scale and scope were impressive to say the least and I couldn't utter a bad word about the film. Also Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite stories, because it has the ability to reach into the souls of everyone and let them become part of the journey. My five year old sister, my mother (who does have some appalling tastes), my best friend (who HATES fantasy), my female friends and my young teen sister all love the film and can connect to it. It is a story in essence about hope, and that is something everyone can relate to. I love you Peter Jackson.
10.0~The God(JRR Tolkien) wrote The Bible(The Lord of the Rings) and the Prophet(Peter Jackson) spreaded it all over the World vivianjoyson Sign in Permalink My God. I was shocked after watching this movie. I cannot even imagine someone can adapt the novel so well that you will become part of it . The greatest cinematic achievement ever. This is and will be the top No. 1 favorite movie of mine all time . I could proudly say, I lived in the time of the LOTR movie made. I lived to watch this Epic saga .
9.0~Powerful film jfarms1956 Sign in Permalink The movie is for those older than 9 years old. This movie forms a powerful conclusion to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. The cast is truly outstanding. The scenes are epic in dimension. To me, it seems as though almost the entire fellowship of the ring become heroes in this chapter. Although it is a standalone movie, it is the conclusion to the other two Lord of the Rings' movies. I have read the books several times and the movies does do justice to the story. Although Frodo is the ultimate hero, to me, it is Sam (Frodo's friend) who inspires me. The movie demonstrates that it takes more than one or two heroes to defeat evil, it takes the teamwork of all who have a vested interest in goodness, loyalty, and honor. It takes courage and the steadfastness to see a task through. This movie presents a glorious ending to Frodo's task to rid the world of the evil wizard and his hold on power. The movie also shows that however good and courageous are the hearts of men, they can in the end lose faith and falter. However, it is the team that wins and one heart is not enough to turn the fates of men to lose. Way, way thumbs up.
10.0~A Mindblowing, Breathtaking Masterpiece Darkest_Rose Sign in Permalink In the final stunning achievement of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the movie finds Frodo and Sam, along with Gollum who has a new sneaky plan of his own, still making the long and dangerous way to Mordor to get rid of the Ring once and for all and save Middle Earth. Meanwhile, the rest of the fellowship, such as Gandalf, Aragorn and Legolas are battling many evil forces and villains in order to save Gondor from becoming a disaster. I thought this movie was just simply amazing. I am a big fan of the first two Lord of the Rings movies but this one just tops it all. Everything about it was just breathtaking. To the amazing battle scenes, the beautiful soundtrack and to the wonderful battle for friendship that will make you weep throughout the whole movie. The best movie of the year so far, it will leave you breathless from the beginning of the journey till the end and the story will stay in your minds forever and in your hearts even longer. I would give The Return of the King 10/10.
5.0~Middle of the road, but not a total loss gentsch Sign in Permalink Had the director removed the long gazing looks between the halflings, respected the audience to remember the story of Golem and limited the movie to one ending, I would have given it a much higher rating and been fairly excited about the movie. As it is, find a theater with big seats, lots of leg room and sneak in a beer or two.. g
10.0~The Epic Conclusion anand_pandey38 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created t is one of the masterpieces delivered by the legendary director Peter Jackson.The film takes us to the final part of the journey of the hobbit Master Frodo baggins and his friend samwise gamgee to the rough and dry evil land of mordor to the mount doom to destroy the ring made by the evil lord Sauron.This movie completely grasps you and amazes you alongwith inspiring you and giving a simple yet important message that with courage you can achieve anything as was done by Frodo and thus disproving the phrase "Nobody simply walks into Mordor".Legendary actor Sir Ian mckellen completely justified the with the role of gandalf.Elijah wood as Frodo baggins and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn has delivered the performances of their lives. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema
9.0~Waiting for the DVD jaydmac Sign in Permalink The movie was awesome. Now, if you've read the book, you kept getting an elbow in the arm each time a scene came up that whispers, "wait till you see the DVD in August!" There were at least 10 scenes, conservatively, that presented themselves and were not fully realized in this showing. I'm completely satisfied with that because I didn't really want to sit in the theater for another hour to 90 minutes. The visual imagery if ROTK is everything we come to expect from this series. The view over Minas Tirith was breathtaking! You don't believe you're there, you are there! The battle fields are awesome, the confusion, the resolve, the nasty bits. Jackson pulled no punches, just condensed them because Tolkien's level of detail would have bogged it all down if on screen. There were a few departures from the book, but many are much less concerning than the ones in the previous movie. Book readers will cringe a little and get over it quickly as the movie moves forward with awesome scenes in Shelob's lair, the riding out to battle from Minas Morgul, the battle of the Pelennor Fields. I laughed. I cried. And I breathed a giant sigh of relief that this series didn't get muffed up like the Matrix! You can have love story AND action! I'm definitely going to see it again to digest it better. I had a really uncomfortable seat above the entrance with a too-tall, opaque safety wall in front of it. My butt is still asleep from sitting on the edge of my seat than the movie required. Also, I was with someone who knew nothing of the previous movies and hadn't read the books, so I now know, you CANNOT see this movie without seeing the first two. To those wait and see people...get to the store, buy the EXTENDED editions of this first two movies and spend the money this time, you may just enjoy yourself! Yes, this is the best one.
10.0~hail to the king yonchix Sign in Permalink The third and final installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to life bigger, and bolder than the first two. Director Peter Jackson and company held nothing back when it came to CGI, special effects, gorgeous landscapes, and breathtaking cinematography. Fans most familiar with Tolkien's famed novels would take note of changes made in the interest of keeping the film short (as with it's two prior films), but he stuck close enough the main story and brought it to its destined conclusion. He didn't water down the scene where Frodo finally gets to Mt. Doom in order to get rid of The One Ring once and for all—in fact it packs quite the punch. The way that scene was intermingled with the battle footage heightened the emotional level of the scene as well as the excitement. The actors deserve praise as well. Viggo Mortensen reminds us of what a hero truly is, with his performance as Aragorn, the man who would become King of Gondor. Sir Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf the White, bringing the Wizard to life as if he popped right out of the pages of Tolkien's novels. Elijah Wood draws us in with his portrayal as Frodo— Sorrowful, and weary of his travels and all of the trials he'd gone through along the way. Other noteworthy performances include those of Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchet, Miranda Otto, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Hugo Weaving, etc. I highly recommend this film (as well as it's predecessors) to anybody, regardless of whether or not you've read the novels. Of course the books are better—they always are—but the movies are an excellent adaptation of Tolkien's wonderful tale. This film is clearly worthy of the many Oscars it has won. I easily give it a 10/10.
10.0~An epic to end all epics kalin-4 Sign in Permalink Wow is the word that came out of my mouth as I sat there in the theater listening to the credit music. This has got to be my favorite trilogy since Star Wars. The Cast was beautifully done, the music was in a class by it's self,and the land scape was awesome to behold. There is not one thing I would change about this movie, and I am a devout Tolkien reader. This is a must see trilogy. I would highly recommend it to anyone over 12. Mainly because if you are under 12 the story line might be a bit to hard to follow, and I think the violence is a little to much for any one under 11 or 12. You should also view it in the wide screen format it is so much more breath taking that way. So if you haven't seen it go rent it today!
9.0~The greatest of the three burger1124 Sign in Permalink After viewing this picture, I realized it was one of the best ever made. It has the greatest battle scene ever filmed, the best computer-generated character of all time (yes, better than Yoda), and some of the best performances in recent years. This is the third and final film in the Rings trilogy, and it is the best of the three. If you haven't seen the first two films, here's a summary. A hobbit (little person with hairy feet) named Frodo inherits a ring from his uncle, not knowing that if this ring falls into the wrong hands, the world will be overthrown by evil. Frodo, his best friend and gardener, Sam; two Men; a wizard; an elf; a dwarf; and two other hobbits form the Fellowship of the Ring, also the title of the first film. This fellowship is dedicated to destroying the ring in the place it was created: a far-away kingdom called Mordor, the capital of the evil menace. This menace is Sauron, who used to have a body, but, after being killed, is resurrected as a huge eye of fire, which can see Frodo every time he dons the Ring. Also, doing his dirty work is wizard Saruman. In the first film, one of the Men, Boromir, dies, the wizard, Gandalf, falls down a chasm, and the two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, are captured. The second film, The Two Towers, picks up where the first left off, with Frodo and Sam continuing their journey to destroy the ring, and the elf, Man, and dwarf trying to find Merry and Pippin, and eventually ending up in the kingdom of Rohan, under attack by the enemy. They flee to the refuge of Helm's Deep, and become involved in the Battle of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, an Ent (walking, talking tree) and destroy Saruman's kingdom of Isengard. Frodo and Sam meet face-to-face with Gollum, a creature who used to be a hobbit named Smeagol, but because of his lengthy possession of the ring, was transformed into a hideous creature with split personalities. Faramir, brother of Boromir, the Man who dies in the first film, captures them. Eventually, they are released. Gollum leads the hobbits to Mordor, but eventually turns against them and says they must take another path into the kingdom, a path containing a giant, hungry spider named Shelob. Frodo and Sam eventually knock Gollum off of a cliff, and he is presumed dead. They get into Mordor, climb Mount Doom, and meet up with Gollum, still very alive and looking for revenge. Can't tell the ending, must see it yourself!
10.0~A brilliant masterpiece of modern film skylark727 Sign in Permalink After three long years of anticipation, it was finally over. Peter Jackson's nine hour trilogy had come to it's finale, and it was spectacular. Personally, the story needs to be emotionally compelling. FOTR was completely character driven (with the exception of a few well placed action sequences) but I felt that TTT did not deal with the character development as well as FOTR had done (Eowyn was my favourite character in the book, and I felt kind of like I had been cheated :( ). Beautiful to look at, however. The effects in both were amazing. Now to ROTK. It broke my heart. That doesn't sound good, but it was. This was the most emotionally heart-wrenching, tear-jerking piece of cinema I had ever seen. I couldn't watch Frodo and Sam without tearing up (if you haven't seen it yet, I won't give anything away, don't worry; but watch it with your best friend. It means so much more then). And yes, I cried. And yes, more than once. And no, I'm not the type of girl to cry, so to get me to was quite a feat, PJ ;) . The effects were spectacular. Gollum really comes to life when you see the eviller side of him more clearly (those glares at Sam? classic), and Shelob looked FANTASTIC! i was really disappointed when they cut her out of TTT and was wondering how effective her presence would be in ROTK, but she was effective indeed (good god, arachnophobia is NOT a good thing to have while watching that scene...). Props to Viggo for being the best damn leader I've ever seen, and to Elijah. Seeing the crumble of Frodo killed me in the best possible way. Pippin really comes into his own in this film. I loved seeing the cute little "fool of a Took" from the Shire maturing... (although I do lament for the old Pippin... :') bittersweet I guess). And props again to Viggo and Billy Boyd for singing. LOVED it. and I'm sorry to only focus on the acting, but it's what I focus on in the film. But the effects and the scenes were beautiful (even if the harbour at the end seemed a little TOO perfect... I guess it was supposed to be... gateway to Elysian Fields in a sense, no? ;) ) even mordor was beautiful in a twisted, evil sort of way... if that makes any sense :S anyways, decide for yourselves. I have a feeling that this will go down in history, if not as one of the best films ever made, then certainly as one of the most heart-felt and ambitious attempts ever. congratulations to all of the cast and crew, and you deserve every bit of praise you get.
10.0~Why is the average rating only 8.8 according to T-250? Guy_W Sign in Permalink This whole calculation of IMDb is driving me crazy. They publish an equation to calculate the exact rating average which affect its position on IMDb's top 250 which is: (v º (v+m)) ª R + (m º (v+m)) ª C where: R = average for the movie (mean) = (Rating) v = number of votes for the movie = (votes) m = minimum votes required to be listed in the top 250 (1250 for now) C = the mean vote across the whole report (6.9 for now) I tried to calculate it using the current votes and mean rating (which is for now (December 28th) 27778 votes and 9.4 rating average). And that's what I came up with: (27778:(27778+1250)) X 9.4 + (1250: 27778+1250) X 6.9 which is: 8.9952 + 0.2971 = 9.2923 = ~9.3 That means it's supposed to be #1 with 9.3 rating average. Nevertheless more than 70% of the users voted 10 comparing to the current #1 (Grandfather, The (1972)) which only 51.7% of the users voted 10 (note that close to 5000 users voted 1 and has only 8.5 Arithmetic mean rating). For your consideration.
10.0~the best film in the history lostandfound300 Sign in Permalink when I first seen this movie I was surprised... I never thought that there is a movie that good... I never knew what great acting-direction- means till I saw this movie no matter what I say I cannot tell you how great this movie is... these day there is not a lot of movies that would take you to an unforgettable journey a journey that would last in your mind 4 ever... I have seen this movie more than 300 hundred times each time i see it it gets better and better simply..this is the best movie ever made... this,is.a.must.see.movie
10.0~A brilliant and stunning movie JKJalporte Sign in Permalink A brilliant and stunning movie with special affect used to the maximum.Funny how Frodo is the main character burdened with ring,but Sam turns out to be real hero.I thought the Gollam character brilliant.The way his personality changes.One second sinister and the next all loveable,allbeit ugly.Generally all the characters acting was very good and believable.The battle scenes were slightly prolonged but all in all a excellent movie.
10.0~The end of a masterpiece filipemanuelneto Sign in Permalink This film marks the end of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, based on the epic novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. As in the other two films, it maintained the same cast and crew. In this film, the plot comes to an end with the arrival of Sam and Frodo to Mordor and the villain's defeat. But we can't analyze this movie with justice if we look at it without consider the two that preceded it. The trilogy managed to keep the sense of unity and cohesion. In practice, it functions as a single film, with many hours long and divided into three parts. So, speaking of one of them is, obligatorily, talk about the three in the same way that, to understand the action of this film, is necessary to watch first the two films that preceded it. And if the two previous films have delighted the audience with amazing and grand scenes, it will continue the work. I speak not only of huge battles (distinction for the siege of Minas Tirith), but also the amazing landscapes of New Zealand, where many of the outdoor scenes of the trilogy were shot. The abundant use of technological resources and computerization allowed scenes that seem truly impossible, such as the fight sequence at the Black Gate and the collapse of Barad Dur tower. The characterization of the characters also deserves a special care, and to prove it just watch the feet of the hobbit's or the ears of the elves. Tension, mystery, suspense and adrenaline run through the film from start to finish and holding the audience, that follows the characters in their fight against evil. The cast is impeccable, the performances were superb and the soundtrack became iconic. Into the hands of Howard Shore, it helped him to consecrate himself as one of the biggest names in music for film, along with Enio Morriconne or Hans Zimmer.
10.0~Almost perfect m_peloquin Sign in Permalink All I can say is For Frodo... deserves to have a 9.0+ rating
8.0~Great story; well adapted for enthusiasts but feels long for others. jesse-115 Sign in Permalink Let me say first that after seeing Fellowship of the Ring, I went out and read the LOTR trilogy for the first time. I enjoyed it immensely, but I only read it once and not before I saw the first movie. So I might not be what you'd consider a true enthusiast. From an Enthusiasts perspective: There were a few disappointing momemts: the fact that Gandalf *still* didn't break Sarumon's staff on screen, and the way a lot of things were glossed over a bit. Additionally, there was way too much Legolas jumping around during battles. I understand they cost $9 million to make and not showing them would be effectively "wasting" $9 million, but there are more important things to show. Finally, and this was known very early on so it wasn't a surprise, the conclusion of the trilogy was completely removed. This trilogy began and ended with the Hobbits. It began by exposing them as lovable but helpless characters, and ended showing them to be courageous and capable of addressing significant problems. The movies, however, focused a little more on the characters people love, and while I don't fault them for that, I do fault them for not trying to show the ending of the trilogy in any way whatsoever. As an enthusiast, I can't grade the movie on its own; I must rate it as a trilogy. And this trilogy would get 9.5 / 10. From Joe's perspective: Joe wouldn't be nearly as acquanted with the characters, and a lot of what this movie succeeds on for the enthusiasts plays off of that. This is still a good movie, if a bit broken up giving far too many "it's wrapping up" signals. Frodo spends far too much time crying (honestly, this dragged on), and the characters spend far too much time saying "farewell." Joe liked the movie, but gave it a 7.0 / 10 because there are movies he simply enjoys more.
10.0~The Return of the King is the a wonderful epic bessy_dacow Sign in Permalink The Return of the king left me stunned. Having not been allowed to see the movies when they came out, i was told to wait until i was 12 or read the the hobbit. My failed attempt to read the hobbit left me waiting for 5 years from when the first "rings" came out. Having watched it last Christmas, I have now seen all the movies at least 20 times (exteneded version). I loved the three movies so much, that i read the book, the hobbit, the silmarilion and a few other less famous books, leaving me with almost full knowledge of middle earth. The Return of the King is a great epic, having all the great criteria of a great movie (in my opinion): Adventure, Action, Friendship and love. The movie ( as well as the other two) is not the typical Hollywood stereotype, where the special effects take over the movie, and someone saves the day. In this movie, the special effects are just there for people to enjoy and to create a more lively picture, yet it never takes the attention away from any of the actors. The performance by the actors are amazing, each one bringing his or her character to life. In my opinion some of the best performances or done by Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Ian Mackellen and many of the others. Though the movie leaves out a part in the book, It is quite understandable that Peter Jackson would leave it out, since in the past movies an image gas been created that the Shire is untouchable and that no evil can ever touch it. I agree and like all the changes that Peter Jackson made, such as giving Arwen a bigger part, since in the book she is only mentions briefly and her love for Aragron only mentioned at the end of the book, and in the appendix. The friendships in the movies are very well portrayed, whether it is the great love Sam has for Frodo, never leaving his side, even when he is asked too. Sean Astin does a great Job playing the loving Sam, bringing his Kindness and unselfishness to the screen. Also the growing friendship between Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf, which starts out as a competition for who can kill most orcs, and end up with both of them fighting side by side. Now that I have seen this movie, I believe that it deserved the 11 Oscars that it received. When i watched the Oscars In 2004, i was very mad that it won Best Special effects and Best Picture, having wanted Pirates of the Caribbean to win them. I now see that it deserved every single Oscar is got and I myself give it ( as well as the other two) 10/10 Also for those of you who love Orlando Bloom, I suggest you watch it, it being the first movie to bring success and fame to this now so greatly known actor.
10.0~one of the greatest movies of all times SKYLARV3 Sign in Permalink I've seen a lot of movies, but this will go down as one of the best for me. The visual effects alone were breathtaking, but add in the writing, the actors, and the cinematography and you have a masterpiece. Peter Jackson should take a bow for this film, though each lotr was great, Return of the King had that extra oomph. And Viggo, Sean, Elijah, Orlando, etc... were nothing short of spectacular.
10.0~utterly satisfying jvframe Sign in Permalink Keeping the high standards set in the first two parts, and upping the ante in terms of detailed action sequences and effects - but never disappearing up it's own arse like those god-awful Matrix sequels. This is sheer stunning edge-of-your-seat cinema that demands to be experienced on a very big screen. I appreciated the gradual coming down as this film - and the epic series - concludes. It's button-pushingly emotional - but rightly so, we've been through one hell of an adventure. I stayed to listen to Annie Lennox sing and to view the names of all the cast and crew who've done their very best to make this tale a reality. They deserve utmost praise and sincere gratitude. Kudos too to Christopher Lee - who may not have made the initial theatre-release cut, but who was none the less there in spirit. I'm hoping the extended DVD will include his contributions.
3.0~Hmm Snabben Sign in Permalink Well, this was stunning to say the least, for i've never seen a movie filled with more gaps than this one, and i kid you not. IMHO P.Jackson should keep true to the story if hes actualy gonna use or even walk by the name Lord of the Rings, and not put in half-rubbish quests and tales, remove the most vital parts. Well, enough said about that, the movie has gaps, ok. However, there are some positive sides in the movie too, the camera angles, the light settings and the composision principles are followed up with great accuracy and care, Filmaticaly, id say this movie is the greatest ever made, but considering the story, its rather a show-off for the new technology lurking around. Hopefully the extended edition, or the "rumored" "Directors Uncut Edition" will be better and fill in the huge gaps in the story, but i have my doubhts. Imho, the movie should be called "Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings" [Based on Tolkien's master piece "Lord of the Rings"]
10.0~I wept... jani-lehtinen Sign in Permalink I was so emotionally moved during many scenes that I actually wept. Me! Hard as a rock Finnish man who don't usually talk nor kiss. :) Honestly, this was _the_ best movie experience I've had so far in my life and I've seen a few during my years on this clobe. This is a MUST SEE!
10.0~The Pinnacle of Film making Connuck22 Sign in Permalink I was never much into the Fantasy genre of films, specifically because of the lack of quality films. It wasn't until seeing The Fellowship of the Ring that I realized how difficult it really is to break into that genre. To be able to rip a world out of a 1000+ page book series and smear it onto film is one thing. But to make that story appeal to not only hardcore fans but to the greater populace was an endeavor. Peter Jackson, however, has pulled that off fruitfully and continues to in this third part of the series. Every scene has a wealth of dedication assigned to it. From the astoundingly detailed city of Minas Tirith to Theoden's Golden Hall, no shot or location is left free of artistic bliss. The film is quite simply eye candy. The battles are large and impressive. Shields break apart and swords spark on contact. There are catapults and Trebuchets which snap back, releasing house-sized boulders into crowds of frightened soldiers. Winged Nazgul shriek as they hurl unsuspecting victims into the air. Prior to making these films, Jackson made horror movies. The sheer terror exhibited during these battles are reminiscent of those early ventures. One disappointment I found was that Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) is portrayed as a crybaby. In the books he is the fearless one egging his companion on every part of the journey. Although Sam does show signs of heroism quite frequently, he is usually shown as weak afterward. I could look past some of the more obvious differences from the book, but that was one gripe I'll hold onto. Sound editing is top notch as is the emotional soundtrack that encompasses each scene. From valiant battle themes to soft orchestration, it's a treat to the ears. Quite simply, this is one of the finest films ever made and a perfect ending to a massive achievement in film making. Director Jackson has created a trilogy of films that will live on in the memories of both film appreciators and casual movie-goers for years to come.
10.0~the content will stand the test of time, the CGI not! dickbub@hotmail.com Sign in Permalink ************SPOILER FREE REVIEW**************** After having seen ROTK two times I felt the wish to say something about this film and the whole trilogy which I wanted to get rid off for a long time. One of my major complaints in the first two installments were about the blurred GCI where you could clearly see that it is not Middle Earth you are watching to, but it is the middle of a computer. And I clearly have to say that things don't have changed in the Return of the king. But what has changed is my point of view. I'm now no longer looking for photo realistic shots because it seems to have no sense. The time for that hasn't come yet. Maybe some day they will revise this stain like they tried to do for the to the Star Wars trilogy some years ago and thereby a little more successful. I'm looking forward to but I can wait. What is important now for me is what the story wants to tell us. I think the heart of the movie goes out from the Shire. I felt it when I saw it again at the end of the movie. It was for me like coming home after a long an hard journey. It felt as if it was MY home, so cosy and familiar. And that after the groundbreaking and oversized battle on the Pelennor Fields where there was no room left for personal feelings. That establishes a great contrast which is for me not only the heart of the movie but the pulse which keeps it all alive. Sometimes you must put aside your own feelings and interests and even your own freedom and hopes and in this case, like in our history of wars to risk your own life, only that some day it can be as it was and that maybe an other individual can survive. You see that clearly when our four heros sit in the green dragon and drink their well deserved beer. They have fought with the hope that some day they could live their lifes as they always did and they didn't deny their responsibilities. They knew that if they had not done anything, the fires of Isengard would have spread to the Shire and the whole Middle Earth and that everything that was once green and good would have died. And they did it even though they were small and weak. They didn't have more brawn nor did they have more brain than the elves, dwarves or men. But they have other qualities more subtle ones. They are not as easily to corrupt by power as men are and they know what true friendship means. Only with those virtues it was possible to defeat Sauron. I like that very much and I think that this is very well shown in the Return of the King. What I actually wanted to say is that if you don't mind the (sometimes) bad CGI (there are very well made computer effects as well, for example the Shelob or the duplicated riders of Rohan) this film is a sure bet! It was not perfect, there were to much omissions and some characters like Denethor were too much simplified into one dimensional emotion bearers but there must be reasons to legitimate the existence of the Extended Editions. As said above there were also very good special effects and the acting was the best of all three instalments. Especially Sean Astin and John Noble (it is not his guilt that his role was reduced to a simple black/white contrast) played very well. I definitely will go to see ROTK another couple of times because there was too much in this film to appreciate in one single turn. So don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this film to anyone that has seen and loved the previous films. Without having seen them it must be extremely hard to follow the plot but you can go to see it nevertheless only to be blown away from the sheer magnitude of this achievement. It will be worth the price 2 x!!! I'm very glad this trilogy exists. In a very cynic time we must have something honest to cling to. Yes, you have read right, the content of the books as the content of the films I think is very honest. (The merchandising strategies is an other question). I will leave you now alone and hope that you go to see this film as soon as possible and enjoy it! I rate it 10/10 because I'm a nerd!
9.0~Almost a masterpiece dromasca Sign in Permalink LOTR-3 is probably the most astonishing achievement in computerized effects in film history - a masterpiece in this field, and it will stay so for a long time. I is a great piece of visual arts, and a good film in many other respects - well acted and directed, complex plot, with many interesting threads. However, in my opinion it fails to be the masterpiece that some viewers see in it. For the many of us who did not read the book the plot is still not very much more than a legend, which fails to bear too deep meanings. And although the last series is a little bit more human and touching than the previous ones, many of the characters are still one-dimensional. The biggest failure is however the ending - very long and redundant. If the film ended 20 minutes earlier, it would have been better. Nevertheless, these minus points are small compared to the high level of the camera work, visual and sound effects and production. It is probably the best film of the year, and it gets 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.
9.0~Endings .... Under the NW arch Sign in Permalink So, we have come to the end of an amazing global story ...... Christmas will lack a certain expectation next year and it has been a thrill to have been a part of the LOTR Event. For those who have been so critical of the ending it's a pity that so many have become addicted to those artificial Hollywood endings. ROTK ends wonderfully ... we get the time to see our companions settle back into life - don't soldiers have to come home from war? (and we've devoted movies to that theme!)... and we see that some like Frodo can't assimilate back into their own life ........ so much a part of the human story. I saw ROTK in a theatre that gave us a welcome intermission. It's a long film, with a variety of pace and that was a strength of it ... slow, unfolding moments and then great action. CGI is there but it is the acting which carries the movie. Fine performances by all the key characters. No single star but a good number who carry the film. Thank you Peter Jackson .... you've created an event, and love or hate the movie, you can't ignore it.
10.0~Awesome Movie! craig-stick Sign in Permalink This movie is my favourite movie. Well actually 2nd favourite sorry Mr.Jackson I like Epic movie. Anyways off topic. This Movie Is Freaking Amasing!!!!! Don't just rent it but buy the extended trilogy. I did. I give infinite stars out of ten. I love every thing about the trilogy but this is my favourite. Also an amazing video game it is sooooo much fun to play with a friend. Viggo(Aragorn) is amazing in this piece. Haha and nice tongue lunge Mr.Son of Arathorn haha ;P Aragorns sword is so cool. Oh and a stunning performance by smeagul. I, personally, think Lego should of made Lord Of The Rings sets. Me and my friend made some. Its not that hard. Pipin is my favourite Character though. He is humorous, "charming" ( ;] ;] nudge nudge), and brave. And who could forget that Samwise Gamgee. Well me. This movie is amazing. See it! Love it! Buy it!
10.0~can't wait for the dvd rcallebout Sign in Permalink sadly this is the final chapter thanks mr. Jackson, you did a great job saw the three films one after the other and time flew by, 9hours gone in one glorious moment
10.0~Justice Was Done to the Big Silver Screen Mithrindir Sign in Permalink There is no better fantasy/adventure movie than the Lord of the Rings. All the elements of a good movie are placed in there fittingly to make a exceptional work of art. The action sweeps you off reality's base, the drama is beyond the level of some top drama movies, the emotions are well balanced and well acted out, the script is loyal to the book and everything works. The entire LOTR series in general, book and movie alike is my favorite fantasy work, and should be a favorite for many people who are fans of movies or books in general. If there is any movie that can compare to this work, it has not yet been shown on the big silver screen. The final outcome could truly be considered a classic.
10.0~Amazing eragonfan Sign in Permalink This movie was amazing! I loved it. I probably saw it 100 times! Peter Jackson did excellent work taking J.R.R Tolkien's work to the big screen. I loved all three of them, but this one was the best! The action was amazing, music was excellent, the graphics were extravagant, and the actors were great! I really want Peter Jackson to make the Hobbit, as that was also a great book. I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan and this movie is above all the best movie. Maybe in the future someone else will remake it and the graphics will be even better! The Two Towers was amazing as well. I liked the battle of Minas Tirith scene the best. When Theoden came with the Rohirrim was another great scene. Aragorn's speech at the battle of the black gates was really good. In conclusion i loved the Lord of the Rings The Return of the King!
10.0~Stunning neil-476 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to its epic conclusion in fine style: Frodo and Sam enter Mordor while the Battle of the Pelennor Fields begins, largely as a feint to draw Sauron's army away to allow the Ringbearer clear passage to Mount Doom. Following the Ring meeting its fate, all story lines are brought to their resolutions in a half hour or so of winding down. Jackson's visualisation of what happens inside Mount Doom is faithful to, and improves upon, Tolkien's source - once again, Tolkien threw away one of his set pieces in less than a page. The one false note is Gollum's final expression - I would have expected agony rather than "Blimey! That's a bit of a surprise!" There are at least five separate end-pieces - the Fellowship reunited, Aragorn's coronation, the return to the Shire, the Grey Havens, and Sam's return home (it is possible to argue at least a couple more). The film could have been ended on any of these, and there are those who argue that it should have been. But although the film could have ended there, the story could not, and credit to Jackson for adding a half hour capstone to a ten hour film in order to properly resolve all that should have been resolved. I feel this particularly strongly since this closing section contains two of my favourite moments. One is the moment in the tavern - the four Hobbits, traumatised by war, sit together in silence in stark contrast to the trivial carousing in the opposite bookend tavern scene in Fellowship. And the other is Frodo's final look back. If Elijah Wood never delivers another moment on screen as powerful as that one (and I'm sure he will), that is enough. A towering achievement in all respects.
10.0~Watch this zameerrizni Sign in Permalink My all time favorite trilogy. I have watched this trilogy more than 10 times. It's been my favorite movie sequence since my childhood. The war strategies they used in this trilogy was excellent. The reason for liking this was the way the way the movie runs. I've watched the Hobbit trilogy too after this. I've even read the books of these movies. an applaud to the Writer and the Director of these movies. I wish that another trilogy of this movie sequence would come one day. The most favorite character of mine in this movie was Legolas. I love the way he fights. There is are few humour too in this movie from the beginning till the end. I would recommend everyone to watch all the six movies in both the trilogies.
9.0~Peter Jackson did it right Dfredsparks Sign in Permalink well I guess Tolkien did it right first. Other directors/filmmakers should take note. This is a reason to make a trilogy, a story arc that is told over three films. In addition to enjoying the acting, the story, and the visual, the moviegoer gets to experience a personal sense of completion; after investing part of the last three years of our lives in this series..we have personally reached the end, as have the characters in the film. I found the picture to be very moving. And I dont really understand all the talk about multiple endings; there is only one ending..when the words THE END appear. There are a lot of stories here, and each deserves some sense of closure (including the ones that will have to wait for DVD). We should all have a friend like Sam...in a lot of ways he was the spirit of this film, and it appropriately ended with him
10.0~Fantastic Movie hectorandbarbara Sign in Permalink This is by far the best of the 3 sequels. I personally feel this has got to be the best movie of 2003. It is a must see. The fight scenes and the acting have truly culminated into one of the best cinema experiences I have ever experienced.
10.0~You should see this movie!! nidean Sign in Permalink Although the book is a bit different, I think it's the best screening! Actors are correctly chosen. Each of them plays amazing role. Looking to the Tolkien's world is astonishingly awesome. And the story and the course of the film itself is amazingly interesting. I think this is a film which you must see and see all this wonderful world, with all the amazing things and events.
10.0~The great Movie of all the Time radomir-matecak Sign in Permalink A think this is a great epic Movie.Its cannot be better!Great job to Peter Jackson and his crow! And afars,thanks to J.R.R Tolkien to great Book.I read now his new Book "Hurins Children".Its would bee great to see this movie directed by Peter Jackson.I cannot wait to see a Hobbit.I read the and its fantastic.I ask me,who should bee a Director of "Hobbit"?But let get to the case,The Lord of the Rings its the best Movie on all the Time.The box office of this film is Impressive! !1,180,000.000$Thats tel that this Movie have fans from whole World,and thats great.And not forget 11 Oscars.And the:One Ring to rule them all.One Ring ti find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
8.0~The 'Return' For A Third Time Is Long, But Well Enjoyed. * * * (Out Of Four) bondfan27 Sign in Permalink How time has passed. Three years ago people were being introduced to the series and it became a hit. The final act of the saga ends gracefully and with class. What is there not to say about 'The Return Of The King'? The film has taken such a dark path it's stunning. The world of Middle-Earth you knew is of no more, as the final moments of it's future is in the hands of one weary Hobbit, by the name of Frodo. The film's story is about as fast-paced as it was in 'The Two Towers' but this time around the action has climbed so high, you'll want to focus on the action more then the story. The main story of the film is simple: as the last moments of Middle-Earth rest in the hands of Frodo, those who fight alongside him against evil are finding it harder and harder to win. 'The Two Towers' introduced to us a little monster by the name of Gollum who's computer generations look so lifelike you disregarded him for a real life creature. This time around we're shown a new surprise: The King Of The Dead, who's ghostly green aura and chilling facial looks will give you chills. The funny thing is, he's a good guy. The film has so many expectations and tries hard to accomplish them but gives us more then needed. Whether that's a good thing or bad thing is your choice. Is 'Return Of The King' a bad film? No, it's an enjoyable ending and surprisingly doesn't posses the cold-shoulder wrap-up like recent trilogies have given (The Matrix: Revolutions for example). It's hard not to enjoy this film, because of the range of emotions you'll go through (Fear, joy, sadness are just a select few emotions you'll go through). Be warned to those who leave right when the film ends, you'll be teased around once or twice with the surprise new endings. Aside from that, 'The Return Of The King' rules over many films this year and there's no reason not to see it this year. * * * (Out Of Four) 8 (On IMDB's Scale Out Of 10) B (A+ Being The Best, F Being The Worst)
6.0~a let down songbird2882 Sign in Permalink This movie was way too long!!! That's simply all there is to say. I loved the first two Lord of the Rings, but this movie failed to culminate this trilogy. With its five possible endings, the audience was dying to get out of the theatre by the final end. I have never seen people jump up so quickly as soon as Peter Jackson's name flashed on the screen signaling the credits. All in all, good acting, and fabulous special effects but it strangled itself in its length. Furthermore, it felt like the character development fell after the second movie. If they're watched in a row, Aragorn's attitude and character changes dramatically between them, when there are supposedly a couple of days chronologically. Same can be said for the hobbits and the Rohan characters. See it by all means, but this movie failed to live up to everything I expected as an end to this fabulous series.
7.0~Solid End To A Fantastic Trilogy slokes Sign in Permalink **This review is for the 201-minute theatrical version.** "The Return Of The King" seems to divide audiences. There are those who love it, and those who really, really love it. I'm in the former camp. While I share the overall satisfaction with the way Peter Jackson wound up his epic adaptation of the J. R. R. Tolkien saga, I do find myself squirming a little more while sitting through this three-hour-plus entertainment than I did with the prior installments. After opening with a flashback on the origins of Gollum (Andy Serkis), we join the war for Middle Earth in a new phase, as the evil armies of Sauron move on the city of Minas Tirith. The surviving members of the Fellowship from the last two films have a two-fold mission: Save Minas Tirith, and buy time for their comrades Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) to get to Mordor and destroy the Ring that lies at the heart of Sauron's plans. "Things are now in motion that cannot be undone," warns the Fellowship's leader, Gandalf (Ian McKellen). The third time is seldom the charm for great franchises: Godfather; Star Wars; Matrix; heck, I didn't even like "Goldfinger" that much. Here, Jackson seems to finally get caught up in the snares of backstory he so deftly danced through in the first two films. But it's hardly a fatal flaw, and what's good-to-great here outweighs the rest. The storytelling is as immersive here as it was in the last two chapters. In terms of raw narrative flow, "Two Towers" was the best, but this is nearly as good. I love how effortlessly we are moved back and forth from the three major story arcs; something George Lucas in my opinion did not do nearly half as well in "Return Of The Jedi." There's plenty of humor and action, and precious little elves, all of which pleased me. The acting here is fine, too; this time more from the second-tier players who carry more of the burden with ability. Serkis sells you on Gollum's evilness even as he works your sympathies. David Wenham's Faramir and Miranda Otto's Éowyn dominate their scenes with a quiet authority that lingers after the film is over. Apparently their characters pair up in the extended cut; I'd happily sit through more of this film if it meant seeing more of them. The film does feel more CGI-driven than the others, and much more emotionally self-indulgent. The final 20 minutes are an endurance test for me; swelling music and slow-mo shots of various characters crying and hugging. The rest of the movie has moments, and at times, entire scenes, that run longer than necessary. The Minas Tirith battle is a high point here; but however well-crafted and imaginatively engineered, it plays for me like a lesser remake of the Helm's Deep battle we got in "Two Towers." I'm done carping. In the main, this is a fine film that grabs you and rewards you for time spent watching the other films. Even if it's not the film from the series I'd most happily watch again, I'm glad it won a Best Picture Oscar in recognition of the Lord Of The Rings series. Jackson gave us quite a ride, and here brings us a satisfying way of celebrating "the end of all things."
9.0~The Finale with awe rcutburth Sign in Permalink My favorite movie of the trilogy. Every character comes into their own, and kicks butt doing so. Seeing the rise of all the Hobbits and the fall of Denethor as well as Gollum is very satisfying. Everyone should already know, or assume that Gollum does not win in the end; he sort of does in his own morbid way, but not entirely. The beginning part, where it shows Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Gandalf, and Theoden wading through the forest to come upon the Hobbits sitting pretty in their field of victory is by far one my favorite scenes. Which is followed by the death Wormtongue and Sauron, but still, it's hilarious. The character progression of not only the Hobbits, but of Aragorn is wonderful. He's finally realized he cannot escape the his fate to be king, but he can most assuredly make it his own. Even the Hobbits become Esquires and Honorary Guards. Frodo is one of the characters who's path just keeps getting darker and going down hill. While Gollum is poisoning his mind and turning him against Sam, the ring is corrupting him even further. The movie over all is very well scripted, excellently acted, and wonderfully done. I give it 9 out 10 stars. It's lacking one star because of the way it ended, and then ended again, and again and again. It didn't need that many fade to black screens in it, come on Peter.
10.0~amazing! timstumbo Sign in Permalink I just saw this movie last night and it was absolutely awesome! The way they pulled everything together and its great resemblance to the book makes it all the better...... This movie should hands down win Movie of the year. The landscape will yet again blow u away as this movie features Minus Tirus and Mtn. pics.This movie is alot more violent which means alot more mighty fighting from Legolas, Gimli and Arragorn, Everything about this movie is amazing.... if u dont see it in theaters than it willl be the biggest thing u will have ever missed out on.
10.0~Best movie of the 20th Century! pandora-37 Sign in Permalink I have been a fan of the LOTR books for over 30 years. I use to long for a movie to be made but then realized that it would be impossible! Then Peter Jackson came along and "made all my dreams come true", as Samwise would say! The trilogy of movies are wonderful. Beautifully written, amazing to look at, cast perfectly! I do not understand the management of this site who think it is only worth 6 out of 10. And why is that the only person who can like the movie is a rabid fan? I think Peter Jackson took a much loved story and made movies that are now much loved themselves. Too long? Not for anyone who understands what is going on in the stories! Not long enough I say! I can't wait for the extended version to see what was left out! All in all, I say get to the theater before it is too late! A thing like this has not happened for an age, and will never happen again! Enjoy the magic! Don't let a few simple minded people stop you from experiencing something wonderful!
10.0~Three Words Fab-u-lous standuporshutup Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King truly demonstrates what film making can produce. it had action romance, drama, and a little bit of comedy. Not to mention a cast full of hot actors. i could not imagine this trilogy with any other actors, any other director, or any other production company. It was like they all were ment to be together. what will we expect next from the wonderful Peter Jackson? Mabey a pre-lude to the trilogy by creating the Hobbit. who knows all that we know is that Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King will Go down in history as an end to an epic trilogy but as the movie that ties the record with titanic and Ben-Hur for the most Academy Awards. This is Truly a film to remember!
10.0~The Last Hurrah forestengr Sign in Permalink What a movie! The Lord of the Rings trilogy will go down as the greatest in history and Return of the King was a fitting end. A Grand scale like no other. I would have to say, as a pure Tolkienist, I was a little disappointed more of the book was not in the movie, i.e. end of Saruman, Scouring of the Shire, Eowyn/Faramir hookup, more on the celebrations of the end of Sauron but the scale of the movie made up for it.
5.0~stay away from this movie gnosticgnome-1 Sign in Permalink I just had to write a comment, after reading a previous one. First, i've been reading J.R.R. regularly since i was 10, and this movie is one of the grossest adaptations possible. Hollywood stupidity at its best. I have to puke when i remember the lame, retarded character of Faramir, totally different from the one in the book, or the horrible wedding at the end of the movie,the fake smiles and shining white teeth, Sauron the lighthouse, haha, just too stupid, cretin dialogs between Frodo and Sam while dying in the Black Land, so unlike the book. Major discrepancies in the plot - Frodo being taken by Faramir back to Gondor, which depicts him in an utterly false light etc etc. This movie deserves a 5 only because it's been filmed in a technically superior way, but that's it. I hope i forget it as soon as i can. What a shame.
6.0~Exciting trminator-35198 Sign in Permalink Although it may not have the same level of story intrigue as its predescessors, and felt a little bit like something a 13 year old would write, the overall film quality is pretty well rounded. The movie is in esscence a big battle and does have some tearjerker moments.
10.0~Visually, the most stunning movie of all time! lmntathffan Sign in Permalink Simply put, the return of the King is a historic masterpiece, which outlines nearly a century of hard work, demonstrating the full potential of modern movies. When you see this movie, you will either be completely thrilled, or hate it. I personally found it to be the greatest technological accomplishment ever to be placed on the " Big screen", taking in to mind the full animations of such characters as Gollum, as well as Shelob the spider, without whom, the movie may not exist. However, many people may find this movie unentertaining, due to its " unrealisticness", as well as the incessant babble from certain characters, which makes it hard for the viewer to fully comprehend the movie. Also, I found many lines in the film that may cause a misunderstanding in the viewer, especially those who have not read the books, such as the people of Gondor's references to Gandalf ( played by Ian McKlellen) as " Mithrandir", otherwise known as "the gray pilgrim". However, these are only little drawbacks, which the true fan, or fanatic of the Lord of the Rings will be able to overlook. Over all, the Lord of the Rings : the Return of the King may very well be the greatest movie I have ever seen ( Other than the godfather), and I greatly look forward to the fall release of the apparently 5 hour long extended edition.
10.0~A Phenomenal Achievement! jdkraus Sign in Permalink The first two Lord of the Rings films were: enchanting, moving, astonishing, and above all spectacular. Peter Jackson delivers the third and final chapter to Lord of the Rings trilogy with a phenomenal closing! The film has it all from a great, believable story to the high film-making quality, and it contains a powerful cast. The story: The film picks up on the events from the second film. It follows the hobbits rodo and Sam, who are guided by the cursed creature Gollum, who leads them to either the depths of Mount doom to destroy the evil ring, or to their demise. During this expedition, Middle-earth may have won their first victory over evilness, but the armies of Mordor, beyond count, march to the last defense of middle-earth, the city of Gondor, in which the Wizard Gandalf the White must defend, and Aragorn the Dunedain Ranger must become the new king of his people, and lead them to salvation. These two prime stories are captured amazingly, showing who will be saved and who will be sacrificed, particularly the Frodo and Sam relationship, which is strained by the wickedness of the one ring. The film-making: Once again, Peter Jackson provides us with spectacular and unusual camera angles (the left to right technique), as well as bringing to life with eye-popping and "ahead of its time" visual effects. The CGI effects are used for both enhancement of the cities and structures of the settings, additional to the marvelous production and costume design and the epic battle sequences, in which armies, of thousands of both man and beast clash, astonishingly on the screen, giving ferocious intensity and thrills. Along with this, Howard Shore delivers another powerful and uplifting score. The acting: The acting was magnificent. Especially with Sir Ian McKellan is just well-suited and fabulous as Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen, Hugo Weaving, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, and John Noble to name a few are all likewise well-fitted and "believable" in their roles (most movies nowadays have very unbelievable actors). But the single best perofrmance is by Sean Astin. He gives a gripping performance as Frodo's friend Sam, who does anything and everything in his power to protect and help him destroy the wickedness that tears his friend apart. the line that he delivered that was tear-wrenching was "I can't carry it (the ring) for you, but I can carry you!" This movie, (as stated before) has everything. The director's cut only broadens the film and makes it even more enjoyable. Unfortunately the entertainment doesn't last forever, for when the film ends, you'll be begging for more. Although, some folk have criticized its length, but there is much covered in the three hour and twenty minute film. (it is pointless to complain about the pace) Overall rating 4/4 It deserved all the 11 academy awards it won, is the best of the trilogy, and is among my favorites of movies!

10.0~Its Awesome lilllorraine_007 Sign in Permalink I think this movie is the best!!!! It had the best special effects I've ever seen, also the best actors who played their role really well. It also had a great background music which I totally loved. This movie really deserved all the Oscars they have won :) All the scenes in the movie made a great representation of Tolkien's stories. I definitely was captured all the landscapes in the movie, New Zealand rules! If people haven't seen it, they should because its really entertaining. By now, I've seen it like 20 times or so. The dialogue in the movie are really complex, which made me think a little, at least for me, its good. Everyone must at least see one of the 3 because they all are great.
8.0~Great film.... though brought down by a muffled ending. ak2k Sign in Permalink But WHAT happened with the endings? Could they have made this any longer? I knew something was wrong when the good guys win and there is still 30 minutes left in the movie. Please - leave some out for our imagination, or as an incentive for those who haven't read the books to go back to JRRT's source. However, a great film all around and pretty true to the classic books.
10.0~An instant classic castmastr Sign in Permalink The final installation of Jackson's three part epic manages to steam forward with as much conviction and drama as the previous two. The acting is still superb, although there are admittedly, a few scenes that might have been removed for time and content. This film focuses on the region of Gondor, the last bastion of hope for the survival of mankind, and the final stage of the journey for Sam and Frodo as they are guided towards Mt. Doom by Gollum. Within the first five minutes of the film, there are clues that this will not be like the other two pictures. A sense of darkness and a feeling that hope is lost seem to overtake many of the characters. Aragorn's speech is starting to change from the rugged gruffness of the first two films, into the more refined diction that it associated with royalty in plays like Henry V. In fact, Aragorn's decision to cast off his kingly role as insinuated in all three films harkens to Shakespeare's young Harry, whether by coincidence or not. The relationship between Sam and Frodo becomes more strained in Return of the King as Gollum uses trickery in an attempt to gain control of the ring, and the character of Gollum becomes much more complex in Return of the King. Perhaps the greatest achievement of Return of the King, however, is its ability to show the massiveness of the scale of warfare while simultaneously emphasizing the value of human life, something many films about war fail to capture. Particularly, the relationship between Denethor and Faromir echoes this, and Jackson again uses splendid tactics to breathe life into a storyline that was all but absent from the previous two movies. The emotion investment in these characters is deeper than in any other film I have ever watched, as each player, good or evil, is a familiar face that the viewer is sad to see go. It is my observation that while the film is very long and the action and suspense sometimes unbearably hard to get through, this film could go on for much longer without losing my attention. This will likely go down as one of the greatest movies ever made, and it isn't even the best of the trilogy.
3.0~Sweet dreams, everyone. FilmSnobby Sign in Permalink Well, it's finally over: Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's mediocre epic concludes with *The Return of the King*, a 3-1/2-hour test of endurance. How many times can a movie show Elijah Wood's big blue eyes welling up with tragic tears? how many times do our heroes single-handedly dispatch thousands of evil creatures apiece during big battles? how many times do we have to endure the jokes from that hairy dwarf? how many times must Howard Shore's repetitive, sappy score rise to deafening levels whenever a minor character lies in a broken heap on the battlefield? how many times must director Jackson waste his wide screen photography with gigantic close-ups of the actors (I haven't seen so many BIG HEADS since the last Academy Awards broadcast)? how many times must we withstand grand, cartoon-animated armies? . . . and how many more times must we watch plot developments that contain virtually no suspense?? (What -- did you think the Dark Lord would win? that any of the main characters of the Fellowship would actually die?) Apparently, many MORE times, because this 3-1/2-hour trudge is but the appetizer to the main course of the "Extended Edition", New Line's continuing money-grab that will reveal perhaps a FIVE-HOUR version of this movie alone. (Taken all together, *The Lord of the Rings* -- The Extended Version -- approaches the length of 14 hours, give or take.) Well, as P. T. Barnum once observed, There's a sucker born every minute, and New Line has found the suckers, who are not only willing to pay at the movie theater, but are also only too willing to fork out exorbitant amounts for "special editions" of movies that ought to have stood on their own -- AS RELEASED. A simple standard should obtain in a movie theater: what you're seeing on the screen should be what a director wants you to see. "Extended-edition DVD's" don't count, and especially should not be taken in consideration in reviews by either professional critics or by amateur reviewers at places like IMDb. I can already hear the defenders of the films demur, "But these movies would've been too long if Jackson didn't cut them into shorter versions!" But that's precisely my point. *The Lord of the Rings* remains an unfilmable book: it's too long; it's too unwieldy. As far as an adaptation is concerned, none -- not less -- would be more. Which is not to say that there aren't any great filmic moments in *Return of the King*: the lighting of the watch-fires along the mountain ranges is pure cinema; the entire scene with Frodo and Sam fending off a giant spider in a cobwebby cave is terrific, providing the one suspenseful stretch in the entire movie; and Gollum remains a wonderful creation, a rare successful collaboration of technology and old-fashioned creative virtues. Taken as a whole, the movie is better than, say, *The Matrix* or other expensive Hollywood blockbusters of the "action-adventure" genre. But to say so is not to say much. The occasional high points don't constitute a comprehensive whole, or make Tolkien's saga any less silly. It's a book about magic rings, wizards, Dark Lords, and dwarfs, for God's sake. In *Return of the King*, there's a scene in Minas Tirith where the citizens watch a sad parade of soldiers go by: but it's comical, because everyone looks like refugees from a Renaissance Faire. It doesn't do to inflate this material to cosmic levels. Claims that Tolkien's fantasy was the greatest book of the 20th Century truly make my head spin: what, was *Ulysses* chopped liver? What was the second greatest book -- Stephen King's *The Stand*? Pardon my long-windedness, but the very subject inspires it. I'll wrap by lamenting that one of the better elements in the first two installments, Christopher Lee as Saruman, was a victim of the cutting room floor. Even fans of this material might agree with me that any number of the scenes with Frodo and Sam blubbering at each other would've been better replaced with a coda to the Saruman plot-line. While others may say, "Well, he'll be in the Extended-Edition version," I'm sure that will be cold comfort to Mr. Lee. At least Saruman was a villain we could sink our teeth into: in *Return*, we must instead settle for that damned Eyeball atop that tower. Granted, in this film the Eyeball has developed the power to sort of roll about, rather like a lighthouse lamp, but it's still a pretty lame villain. Here, perhaps more than anywhere, Jackson reveals the limitations of his source material. In the book, as I recall, Sauron's Eyeball was really more of a psychological entity. Grasping for any straw, Jackson has made the Eyeball a concrete reality, so that we would have SOMETHING to identify as a villain. But don't fret: Sauron's Nose will doubtless turn up in the Extended Edition. In the meantime, sweet dreams, everyone.
10.0~The best movie ever! city_writer Sign in Permalink This is the best movie I've ever seen in my whole entire life. This is the best movie of the whole trilogy. I loved it. The movie is simply wonderful and breathtaking. I love the scenary, special effects, strong acting and plot. I loved the battle scenes, those were awesome! I can't wait for the extended edition dvd. This movie just rocks. You've got to see it at a theatre NOW! You won't regret it. Don't miss this fine piece of cinema!
9.0~a long time ago in a land far far away Number 9 Sign in Permalink This film is by far the best of the trilogy. This could be the one that lands Mr. Jackson that coveted little golden statue. Also, am I alone in thinking the film industry needs to bring back intermission? I mean 3 and a half + hours is an awfully long time to sit without a toilette break.
2.0~Thank God it's over! aleator Sign in Permalink Like the others in the trilogy, ROTK may be awesome to look at but what on earth is the point of the whole thing? A lot of people with silly names speaking cod-Shakesperean dialogue fighting battles in equally silly-named places - the final part is more like an episode of Stars Wars than anything else. And they all take it so seriously!! What a shame that so much time, effort and cost could not have gone into producing something of genuine artistic merit and substance.
9.0~Worst of the three... nasta Sign in Permalink ...in fact, nothing in common with the holy book...even on the contrary - everything that i thought was inviolable was taken and torn to pieces...DON'T WATCH IT! DON'T DO THAT MISTAKE! I mean if you like the book...if you like nowadays commercial junk movies go and watch it - it's one of the best!
10.0~Long, but excellent matt21480 Sign in Permalink Few films can approach "Return of the King" in terms of scope, awe and sheer emotional storytelling. The acting by the entire crew from Viggo Mortensen to Christopher Lee to Elijah Wood is top notch. I also believe what separates "Return of the King" (and the trilogy in general)from all films of its type is the use of a serious (almost intense) cinematic approach to the material. Science-fiction, action and fantasy films often are almost always tongue-in-cheek because of the implausibility of the storyline. However Jackson and crew approach the material with the correct amount of humor, visual style and tone to create a unique fantasy adventure, which truly honors Tolkien's vision. Peter Jackson creates a terrific conclusion to Tolkien's novel and in the process created a trilogy by which all action and fantasy films and epics will be judged by for years to come. A 10 out of 10.
9.0~Great fun! I hope my memory fails so I can enjoy it all over again. crowley-4 Sign in Permalink I saw this in a big modern cinema in Melbourne and the sound was amazing. There were moments when my seat trembled so I hope you get to see it in a good theatre too. The film followed the book pretty closely, leaving out some singing (thank goodness), some Frodo-Sam moments (a shame) and the whole Saruman-in-the-Shire bit. The undead army storyline differed from the book but improved upon it, but the victory celebrations were a little weak, considering the 10 hours or so of conflict. My main criticism is with the blue screen night scenes where the actors were overlit. A small quibble in what is otherwise an exhilarating end to the trilogy.
10.0~This film just has it all stusullivan Sign in Permalink I don't normally write comments on website etc but i felt that i had to when I saw that some people have voted 1 for this film, they must either have seen a different film or taken some sort of mind-altering substance! This film has absolutely everything, non-stop action, I can't believe that people actually don't like this film! What a way to finish what has been an epic series of films. The first film (Fellowship of the Ring) was superb, led you into the characters brilliantly and made you feel like you were traveling with them. The second (Two Towers) was pretty good, but to me all it really did was make you look forward to the third installment (The Return of the King). I'm sure this film will stand the test of time and still be a classic piece of cinema history on 50 years time. All I can say is bring on "The Hobbit" please!
9.0~improves on the 2nd film the way two towers does to the 1st. johnnyfive Sign in Permalink Lord praise Peter Jackson not only for his effort for making the whole trilogy, but also for sticking so relatively close to the books. O.K. so we all know that there are some major discrepancies as well as minor ones throughout all three movies, however im sure we all should agree that these are so easily overlooked for what is such a great accomplishment. ROTK is inarguably the greatest of the three with some great battle scenes that make all previous ones (in any movie) seem like a schoolyard fight. The visual effects are also very worthy of a mention as is the much expected acting standard. I found certain scenes a little disturbing especially the Smeagol/Gollum scene, but these only convey the horror that goes on around the characters. To summarize, ROTK as well as the fellowship and the two towers will always have a special place in my heart and if Peter Jackson doesn't get his much deserved Oscar (tm) this year then someone should get booted out of the academy. GO SEE AND ENJOY!!!!!
10.0~The final movie of the spectacular trilogy abrafocus Sign in Permalink This is, by far, the best movie of the LOTR trilogy. It is very long, but it is worth every minute. I can think of only a precious few (no pun intended) movies, specifically, action movies, that are better than this movie. I love Andy Serkis's Gollum/Smeagol voice. I have a friend who can sound just like Gollum, although he is no match for Andy Serkis. ***WARNING!!! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE!!*** Frodo Baggins is nearing the end of his journey to destroy the evil Ring, along with Sam and Gollum. We find that, after "leaving" Smeagol in TTT, Gollum apparently is back in ROTK. He talks to himself a lot, and has an evil plan of getting rid of Sam. He poisons Frodo's mind, and Frodo sends Sam away. Later, however, Sam returns and injures Shelob, the humongous spider that lived in the cave that Gollum sent Frodo in. Later, it's Gollum, not Frodo, who destroys the Ring. Gollum, of course dies in the process. Sauron is destroyed as well. The explosion of his tower is excellent. The final battles, the acting, the music, and everything else in this movie is 100% perfect. My score: 10/10
10.0~Wow... thats all I have to say winged_loner Sign in Permalink Ah, Lord of the Rings... that breath of fresh air that totally clenses the soul of bad book-to-film movies that plague cinema... the refreshing, cool drink of ice-cold-water in a dry desert of mediocrely directed bore-fests of fantasy... the massive intake of breath after a long and suffering plunge of *arrow flies by my head* WHAT THE Christ WAS THAT?!?!? Yes... Lord of the Rings is a story about long and taken-for-granted peace... then thrown into this awful world of total HOLY SH** moments that steal the show in a mad rush of battles and torment. And it rocks... all the way from dramatic beginning, to multiple end.... Its an incredible 9 to 11 and a half hours of pure bliss and wonder. A masterful achievement of modern cinima and a blast for everyone; Lord of the Rings has captured the souls of many people... and, judging from how good the movies are... the numbers are just gonna keep growing. Long live Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, The Weta Workshop Team, the cast of unbelievably awesome actors, and of course... Andy Serkis (WHO DESERVED THAT F***IN Oscar!!!!). Best movie of the 21st century... and one of the best movies of all time.... And its official... anyone who didn't like this movie is going to hell.... Just kidding. Thats for those guys at the Oscars who didn't nominate Andy Serkis.
5.0~Style over substance grantss Sign in Permalink The conclusion to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. After many adventures in the previous two films, Froddo and Sam reach Mordor, at last. Meanwhile, the stage is set for a gigantic, fateful final battle between the forces of good and evil, as Aragorn's army prepares to fight Sauron's. After six hours of the previous two movies and much machinations with release dates to ensure higher DVD sales, the series finally ends. It goes out pretty much like it was all along - with a long, linear, rambling adventure filled with fantastical names and places to keep the nerds and kids enthralled.
10.0~An inspirational epic--Possibly the best of our time. tigersontop Sign in Permalink An epic movie that I feel should go down as one of the best in our time. A movie that takes you on an inspirational journey and touches your heart. Marvelous acting, directing, special effects--a proper conclusion and closure to a awesome 3 part epic. Words cannot describe this movie or do it justice, but surreal, inspirational, tear jerking, beautiful are some that comes to mind. When watching this movie, you go thru a range of emotions. Every one of them makes you feel a part of something special. A movie that transcends time, you wish it would never end. Thank you to all of the cast for making such a masterpiece. I feel honored to have viewed it and allowed to feel a part of it. You should be commended for all your hard work and every person in that film deserves an oscar Matt
10.0~The best of the three pitman76 Sign in Permalink A truly amazing movie with incredible scale; more packed with plot and action than the first two movies combined. The movie took some liberties with the plot from the book, but must be considered as a separate entity, and is a masterpiece in its own right. A little drawn out at the end as well, but, overall, one of the best movies of all time.
5.0~Too much CGI, redundancy, clichés and drawn out "looks of love" for my tastes Wuchakk Sign in Permalink RELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien's popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry. While I'm a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I've never read Tokien, likely because I'm not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien's writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of "Conan the Barbarian" (1982) and "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" (1991) with "The Wizard of Oz" (1939) sounds good, then you'll probably like these movies more than me. "The Return of the King" is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It's basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could've been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves. Like the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there's a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with "The Two Towers," there's excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you'll likely appreciate this installment more than me. There are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they're also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. Then there are WAY too many "looks of love" between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There's also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one's fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling cliché? Another problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There's Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit's wife. "Mythica: A Quest for Heroes" (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did "Conan the Barbarian" and "Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God" (2005). It's not rocket science. As noted above, the movie's needlessly overlong and things could've been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and "looks of love" are tacked on. Despite these honest quibbles, "The Return of the King," and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like. THE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. GRADE: C
1.0~Greatly over-hyped fantasy flick for RPG fans ONLY wabl Sign in Permalink Bad acting, ok story for the fans, but I don't fancy this "RPG trend" crap. I don't know how this movie ever entered the TOP250 movies of IMDB. Should be ranked #500 best movie of all time or less.. My real grade for this movie is 6.0, but I voted it a 1.0 because lot's of mindless people voted it a 10, and NO WAY this boring movie is a 10. SPECIAL EFFECTS DON'T MAKE A MOVIE A 10 out of 10. Go watch the other movies on TOP10 list like Godfather and shawshank redemption and then TRY to compare it with this piece of *
9.0~30 minutes too long dbr549 Sign in Permalink Great film overall. Has the best computer-generated work I've ever seen. Battle sequences were stunning. Sadly, it dragged on far too long at the end. Although there is no LOTR 4, the return to the Shire and departure of Frodo sequences were overly long after the climactic destruction of the ring.
9.0~It's so real, its unreal!!! mckillotd Sign in Permalink As someone who had read the books and was not a huge fan of Tolkien (the man waffled so much I thought I was back doing Ancient History in school again), I was seeking justification for the slating I was about give to the Oscar winning third installment of Tolkiens trilogy. Safe in the knowledge that the first 2 films, although filled with superb special effects and with locations unequalled in recent film memory, had failed to grip me. And with the knowledge that the end to the books hadn't been particularly inspiring to me, I felt sure I would leave the film and be able to talk about the latest overhyped and overrated Holywood blockbuster. WRONG!!! This was quite simply one of the greatest films ever made, a picture so good that I am tempted to reread the books and see what I was obviously missing. The acting is superb throughout and generally seems unforced, with the cast seeming totally at ease with their roles and lacking some of the overacting shown in the 1st film (although Aragorn's speech on the eve of battle is a little reminiscent of Mel Gibson's Braveheart "Freedom" speech). And the special effects are so seemless I actually heard one child asking his Dad "do they have them animals in the zoo?" (referring to the Oliphaunts, giant elephants turned into Middle Earths equivalent of tanks). And I could understand what the kid meant. Everyone knows Gollum is a great, landmark creation for cinema history, but every background, every creature, every epic battle scene are all created with such skill that you just take it for granted that its real. CGI has now made anything appear to be possible. And add to this the faster pace of the storyline and the fact that this film could almost be viewed as a stand-alone story, with no real need to sit through the first 2, and it all adds up to an epic adventure. The fact that it is 3 and a half hours long is negated by the pace of the adventure and it really didn't seem that long. Even my girlfriend, who hated, no, absolutely detested! the first two films, said this one was quite good and that is some recommendation in itself. Definitely go and see this film. If not you will be missing out on the biggest classic epic since the times of Ben Hur and The 10 Commandments.
8.0~A good conclusion snoopy-11 Sign in Permalink Having loved the first two, I eagerly awaited the concluding installment of LOTR - and wasn't disappointed. The sfx are awesome; in particular the aerial shots and, of course the battle scenes. The three and a half hours in the cinema sped by, a tribute to the engrossing nature that has been the feature of all three films. Cinematography has reached a new plateau.
8.0~It finally all comes down to this david-sarkies Sign in Permalink While not strictly related to the books, I must mention that earlier this year when I went to England one of my destinations was Oxford. While I Oxford I went and had a beer at Tolkien's pub, visited Tolkien's house (20 Northmoor Avenue, there is a plaque on the house that identifies it as his house) and paid a visit to his gravestone. Tolkien was a professor of English literature at Oxford and it shows in his writings. As mentioned previously, he borrowed as lot of ideas from the many books that he had read and incorporated it seamlessly into his epic. It is said that Tolkien hated Shakespeare and considered his writings unoriginal and contrived. One thing he points at is Macbeth where Macbeth is told that he cannot be killed by one of woman born. This meant that it was only McDuff, who was born by cesarean, that could kill him. This, Tolkien though, was rubbish, and wrote into The Lord of the Rings a concept that he thought was much better, that is that the Witchking of Agmar could not be killed by any man, and it was Eowyn, the daughter of Theodren, that ends up slaying him. Personally, I think this is just as contrived, but Tolkien's dispute with Shakespeare can be left for another day. As with the opening of the Two Towers we are introduced to Theodren, a king driven mad by the power of Saruman, in Return of the King we are introduced to another mad ruler, the Steward of Gondor. Gondor does not have a king, and has not had a king for a very long time. Instead the land is ruled by the Stewards, but there is an anticipation that a king will return and take the throne, and this is something that the Steward does not want happening. He has become corrupted by power, and the only way that he is able to let go is through death. In Lord of the Rings, power corrupts, and corruption leads to madness. We see this clearly with Gollum. He finds the ring and in finding the ring is immediately entrapped by its power. Bilbo has pity on Gollum, and in the end so do we. His life is corrupted by one desire and that is to possess 'his precious' the one ring. The ring dominates his entire life, and he ends up hiding in a dark cave staring at his precious. However when he loses it his life is destroyed. It is at this point that even we, the reader, pity him, because we know that his life has no meaning beyond possession of the ring. This drives him to then search for the ring, and this greed that has corrupted his heart pretty much makes him untrustworthy. The only reason he helps Frodo is to attempt to get back his precious. There is a point where Gollum appears to have beaten his demon, and truly understands Frodo as a friend, but this changes when Frodo is forced to betray Gollum, but what Gollum does not realise, and never realises, is that Frodo did this to save his life. However Gollum is an individual that is driven by one obsession and it is this obsession that drives him to separate Sam from Frodo. He knows that the only thing standing between him and his precious is Sam, and he does what he can to get rid of Sam. However, as mentioned previously, it is Sam's undying loyalty to Frodo that drives him, and even when Frodo sends him away, Sam always remains there, ready to step up and save his friend.
10.0~Fantasy for Everyone andermarvel12 Sign in Permalink You know what to expect. You've read all the reviews, you've heard how good it is from your friends, so you know what to expect. You already know that "Return of the King", the third and final film in the amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy, is an awesome and truly epic film experience. But for those who are still sceptical, since LOTR is such a "nerdy" enterprise, I'm here to convince you to take a chance on this great film. First and foremost, this movie is action-packed. Yes, the beginning is, besides some murder and frightening scenes, pretty peaceful. But when the armies of Evil and the armies of Men have fully gathered together at the awe-inspiring city of Minas Tirith, that's when the fun begins. Horses run over orks by the thousands, giant Mumakil elephants trample everybody, and an army of ghosts show up and slaughter everything. To top it all off, we have a showdown between warrior-princess Eowyn and the undead leader of the Nazgul, the Witch King (and heck be darned if he isn't seriously scary enough to make hell freeze over with his voice alone). We also have Legolas taking down an entire Mumak SINGLEHANDEDLY. All this makes "Return" truly entertaining to watch, since the intensity and suspense has already been setup. But this film isn't only about slaughtering orcs: there are several different genres mashed up here. The freaky scenes where the giant spider Shelob chases Frodo through her lair bring to mind the creepier horror films from the 80's, such as "The Thing". For any girls in the audience, there is obviously the romance between Aragorn and elven babe Arwen, and there is also Eowyn's feminist-style charge into the thick of battle. The point is,LOTR was not made for creepy little nerds to obsess about; it was made for anybody who loves a great story. J.R.R Tolkien knew that, and so did Peter Jackson. And that's why the "LOTR" trilogy is so marvellously good.
1.0~Very Entertaining Movie - Also VERY Overrated tuckerk02 Sign in Permalink I love the Lord of the Rings, all 3 included. I love the epic, extremely long nature (3 hrs+ each) that really allows the viewer to become immersed in the world. That being said, as much as a movie like Braveheart is extremely under-rated for its amazing acting, directing, etc, Lord of the Rings is conversely overrated exhibiting in many instances very poor acting (Gimli anyone?), a weak translation of the book (the books blow the movie away), and truly subpar directing regardless of what the academy or any one of you fools may think. LOTR could have been a truly epic masterpiece if directed and acted accordingly, however it still remains a very entertaining movie even with all of its flaws. Albeit, in ten years it may unfortunately only be remembered as the most overrated movie in history (4,5 all time!!!!, are you kidding me, that is absolutely rediculous!!) which is really a shame for such an ambitious fun to watch movie.
9.0~A monumental film dichvuxunau Sign in Permalink First of all: I liked this movie, and i could watch it an awful lot of times. But that is mostly due to the great special effects .
10.0~A magnificent ending to the series Thomas_Trance Sign in Permalink I was hoping this movie would be as good as the others or better, but I was wrong. It was better then I could ever dream of. It is not often you leave the cinema with a warm fussy feeling inside. The battles, the scenery, the filming, the actors, the happiness and sorrow. The list is long of the many fantastic moments this movie share with you. If you are a Tolkien fan, you will love this movie. If you dont know what Tolkien is - you will love it anyway because it is big enough to stand on its own (given you have seen the 2 first movies). I give it 10/10 without a doubt - My expectations were skyhigh, but this time the sky had no limit!
10.0~The best ever! ZapatraX Sign in Permalink It's not easy to make a movie from a great book! Expectations are high and everyone will compare. But Jackson has made it! Really great movie.
6.0~Technically outstanding, dramaturgically weak haegint Sign in Permalink I reckon it is because we know of the successful ending to the story that takes all the surprises from the script. I was disappointed nonetheless: Every word spoken is "heavy" and full of "meaning", the battle scene with the riders taking on the elephants is outright stupid-silly. No smart military leader would ever have ordered to attack such foe head-on (and still succeed...). You could bet that in each and every new scene, trouble was only about 30 seconds away. Very annoying. Did Aragon ever smile once? Always looked like having a big tummy ache. Any of the others smiling? OK, Gandalf did once, I think. The end was as kitchy as it could be - and incomprehensible, to me at least: Why would Frodo choose to leave the Shire?? It may be in the book or not, I don't care. This just didn't make any sense.^ Technically of course it was more than state of the art, but even this got me bored eventually. I was glad when this part and the whole series was finally over. This project would have been better served in a TV series of say 900 minutes or so. Of course, it would have lost the big-screen "oversize" which was nice most of the times. But the movies as long as they were did not do justice to the books. Probably no movie(s) could ever achieve this.
9.0~Best of the Rings brunodaniel-34054 Sign in Permalink For me the best of the Rings, all are very good but this is something......
10.0~OUTSTANDING! BRILLIANT! MOVING! Cracklinrosie Sign in Permalink I thought the last film in the trilogy was excellent. Everything about it was executed to the highest standard. I particularly liked Elijah Wood's and Sean Astin's performances. It is so moving at the end. I was choking for hours afterwards! The Pellinor Field Battle was amazing! Wasn't Aowyn brave? If Peter Jackson doesn't scoop Best Director Oscar this year, I'll want to know why! I wish them luck in both the Oscars and the BAFTA's. The film deserves to win loads! The music (Howard Shore) was outstanding too. It is worth seeing again and again and again - just take a cushion with you! A word to Peter - please please please film and direct "The Hobbit". I am reading it at the moment and it would make a wonderful film. I think the entire trilogy will live on in people's minds and hearts for a long time to come. There are wonderful messages throughout the films - courage, friendship and loyalty. Excellent!
10.0~Wow! The Best Was Saved For Last (possible spoilers) nadia1516 Sign in Permalink Last night, I went to the midnight premier of this movie, and I am so glad I did. It was truly a once in a lifetime experience. Honestly, I was at first a little worried about this film. Having read the books, I knew Peter Jackson had a lot of ground to cover, but he did it masterfully. Sure, as always things were omitted, but when the movie is over, you really feel that the story has concluded well. The performances from every single actor was simply breathtaking. ***possible spoiler*** You are also able to see some of the previous minor characters (i.e Pippin, Eowyn, etc) stepping into a larger role with influential consequences. Furthermore, if you have gotten the opportunity to see all three films in the trilogy, you can truly appreciate the full character development. If I got to choose Oscars though, I would give Lead Actor to Viggo Mortensen and Supporting Actor to either Sean Astin or Billy Boyd. I will be incredibly upset if Peter Jackson is not rewarded with an Oscar for this monumental achievement. His filmography techniques are practically perfect as we get one last chance to view Middle Earth. He also is able to balance the drama of this movie with all the action. The comedy is used with such subtlety that it lightens the mood of the film well. This is the darkest of the three films and it will pull at your heartstrings. I cannot think of a better way to leave this journey behind than with this film. That being said, there is one drawback ***possible spoiler***. There are several fake endings, and I found them quite simply annoying. I enjoyed the way the film ended, but allowing the audience to believe that it was ending before it actually did seemed unecessary. However, not even that can ruin my score for the film. It is by far the best of this trillogy. My score: a perfect 10 (I only wish I could score it higher)
10.0~Awesome, Astonishing, Incredible, etc. drbonkers Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson proved himself capable of bringing J.R.R. Tolkien's long, epic novels to life, twice. These two, almost 4 hour long, movies lead up to one thing, The Return of the King. So this movie had a lot to live up to, the first film set up this magical world and set all these people on a journey to destroy the ring. And the second movie built upon the story with great action sequences and by setting the scene for the third and final movie. It could have cracked under the pressure akin to films like The Matrix Revolutions, but instead it succeeded in almost every aspect. The story, action, and accuracy to the novels are all at their finest. The growing struggle between Frodo and Samwise reaches its climax when it comes to Gollum trying to frame the latter, and when they have to destroy the ring. But in the end, their friendship shines through. And, of course, the return of the king, the namesake of the movie/novel. There is a huge battle at the end of the movie resulting in Aragorn's return to the throne, uniting all of middle earth. And the ending, THE ENDING, one of the finest in cinematic history, great enough to satisfy anyone within a five mile radius and bring a grown man to tears. What's pretty clear is the actors are really into character and are obsessed with their roles, and Peter Jackson, if nothing else, can finely craft an action sequence and proves it with this movie. In my opinion this is the best of the trilogy of finely crafted, beautifully made, intricate, accurate movies. It's one of, if not, the finest movie ever. Peter Jackson definitely knocked it out of the park with these groundbreaking, fantasy blockbusters.
10.0~Concise tomsandlin Sign in Permalink The Return Of The King is a stunning cinematic Journey that takes us to the end of a marvelous story. The greatest trilogy ever written in my opinion and should be enjoyed in novel form as well as in cinema form. The cinematography and sets are breathtaking. the screenplay is as true to the novel as a screenplay can be, and the characters are so believable that you will swear that hobbits exist. the visual and special effects will leave you in awe. The actors were superb in their handling of the characters especially the actor who portrayed Gollum. His take on that character could not have been done more vividly If Tolkien himself had directed it. The entire trilogy is a must have for anyones collection who calls themselves a Tolkien fan or a fan of great cinema.
10.0~Marvellous nemanja-backovic-574-152539 Sign in Permalink Magnificient cinema classic. Made me feel like I'm a hobbit again.
10.0~Good, but nothing special adam-sim Sign in Permalink Im sick of seeing people comming out with all this non sense about the Return of The King being the best movie ever. It's by far and away the worst movie out of the three. If you look past how nice the movie is to look at, you realise how Ordinary they are. I know for a fact that if the movies had not of had so much money thrown at them then no-one would even bother seeing it. I dont see how any one can claim a movie which in parts, especially the ending is boring. All I could think when the first fade to black happened was finally, it's over. Just to find out a few seconds later that there was more and more and more. I managed to get roped into seeing again with my family and I actually fell asleep for atleast 2 hours of the movie. Now I have got the negative's out of the way I can move onto the positives. The special effects were quite good. But in most of the battle scenes I thought I was playing on the game. And that bit where legolas or should I say Neo manages to take down one of those elephant things, I couldnt believe my eyes, As it should never of even been in the movie. I have not read the books but I highly dought the Tolkien described Legolas doing that. Overall I feel the movie was probably the second biggest let down of the year, After Reloaded. I would give this movie 7/10. How ever I can't give it a fair score until next year when the 'Special Extended Edition' or The full movie comes out next year.
9.0~Wow!! teresa6 Sign in Permalink SPOILERS I have just seen the film for the second time and was just as overwhelmed as the first time. A grand piece of cinema both in conception and execution which I feel will never again be lived up to. Taken as a trilogy the Lord of the rings is I feel one of the great masterpieces of modern cinema which will live on after those involved are gone. This is not to say it is flawless. In fact as a big fan of the book I am not completely happy with all the changes, but this film I feel changed least, and in nearly all circumstances the changes are necessary. Set pieces/cinematography: breathtaking with painstaking attention to detail, much love went into these set pices. Minas Tirith blew me away. and the beacons being lit(altho seemed to go all the way across middle earth instead of the hundred odd miles ditances needed) was beautiful. and Mordor could have been darker dingier and more barren. Despite that however I feel it was almost Faultless. 9.5/10 Costume/props/make up: Perfect. 10/10 Special effects: Great to spellbinding in quality. Battle scenes were tremendous altho i feel that the tension in Helms deep was much stronger the actual battle is grander than anything seen on cinema before. Breathtaking. Shelob could have been hairier with redder eyes but was impressive none the less. The flying Nazgul were particularly terrifying when they picked men off and smashed them on the ground below. Mount Doom was splendid. and One of the scariest things were the people riding the massive "oliphunts"! And when the heads are catupalted over the wall(straight from the book) was so simple yet so gruesome and affected me more than looking at hundreds of orcs. And when Smeagol became Gollum was fantastic and he was much scarier when in between charactars I feel. And the charge of the Rohirrim!! WOW!!! 9/10 Script: On the whole a good strong script with some brilliant lines(from the book!). and Tolkiens tone was kept very well. There were also a few conrny lines but in a three hr 20 min film this is hardly a major flaw! 8/10 Direction: wonderful! Peter Jackosn has brought to life an entire world and epic for us on the cinema screen and his vison was amazing. Incredible, and this film I feel shows us particularly his strengths as a film maker. admittedly a few edits werent seamless, several moments could have been dealt with more subtlely and the film did seem to end a few times, but he deserves an Oscar. Conception: 10/10. Execution: 9.5/10 Acting: Hard to give a mark to overall acting it ranged from good(altho will come back to Orlandos performance) to fantastic. Most noteworthy were: Bernard Hill as Theoden who seemed ezact as in the book, Elijah Wood as Frodo who really came into his own and showed immense suffering, Sean Astin as Sam who was the hero in my opinion, Ian Mckellan as Gandalf as great as always, and David Wenham as Faramir who was brilliant showing great depth of emotion and perfect delivery. I really sympathesied with him and Sam most out of all the charactars. Also Miranda Otto was very good. Viggo Mortensen looked as handsome as ever but I must say I preferred him in the first film. He is A very intense thoughtful actor and turned in a good performance but his accent did waver(did anyone notice he sounded Irish in his speech before the black gate?). I liked the despair of Denethor and Pippin also(showed great charactar development). So many great performances! Dissapointments: The cutting of Saruman(in the EE) and the scouring of the shire are my biggest gripes but I can understand why they did it. Perhaps Shelob could be improved as I mentioned. No houses of healing(also EE) Oliphunt creatures too big friends Meeting at the end seemed forced and cheesy (until Sam came in. that was nice) THE ELVES: I feel Elrond and Arwen were changed from the book, and it wasnt the acting(which was pretty average) so much as the script and directing here. They weren't at all bad scenes(the reforging of the sword was great) i just feel it a shame that Aragorn ever doubted Arwen. But it did add some further interest for the audience and allowed a bigger part for Liv tyler. It doesnt bother me very much but I had to mention it! And Cate Blanchett made me laugh, when you least expect it she pops up!! Completely unnecessary that you see her in between Lothlorien and the grey havens. She got a good voice and looks fine but speaks too slow. Orlando Bloom...hmm. I think hes good looking but thats it really! If we're being honest hes very average - not awful but nothing special and he has so few lines. One of his lines was rubbish too which didnt help! But you did see the friendship between him and Gimli which was nice. Despite my few dissapointments I absolutely loved this film and cant wait for the EE next year!! I advise anyone to go see this film - one of the best of all time.
1.0~Long boring flick for dorks c_rodier Sign in Permalink This movie was terrible, long and boring. Both my wife and I hated it. I love Star Wars (the old ones). I am told I am just not a fantasy fan, but I think I am just not a fan of badly done commercialized fantasy. If I want to see a documentary on New Zeland landscape, I will rent it. The movie should tell a compelling story. With 20 characters, and none of them even close to well developed, I had no attachment to any of them. Yes, I did not read the books. I actually read "The Hobbit" as a kid and loved it, and remember it well. I think they were just too true to the books, and didn't realize that the books don't make a good movie unless you have read and loved the books. Call me the Grinch, I am not harsh on most movies. All my friends love this movie and are avid fans. I have no idea how it is anywhere in the top 250. Maybe I could say this is a decent flick if you have nothing mildly stimulating to watch some weekend, or need a decent rental. My wife walked out of this movie, I bared through it in the theaters just to give it a chance. I would never rent it, don't bother. Dragonslayer from back in the day does it much better, and with triple the drama and action.
10.0~my Children love all character of this movie specially georgestevenhulk Sign in Permalink We love all parts of this movie and waiting for upcoming movies
10.0~Time for an Oscar for Andy Serkis delldude87 Sign in Permalink Okay, can we finally acknowledge that Andy Serkis has crossed into a new area with his contribution the final two films of this trilogy and at least give him an Oscar nomination? Either something in a traditional category or some special recognition is certainly due.
6.0~Is it just me or are those Hobbits really tiny? rip1foru Sign in Permalink Let me first say i really am sorry for what I'm about to say because i truly know how much LOTR fans love their trilogy. Now, having said that, this movie was truly garbo and by garbo i mean garbage. I have to say that i liked the costumes, the music is great, and heck who doesn't love aragon, but please did i have to sit through that 7 hour ending between all of the little dudes and the boat trip? I don't think i should have been subjected to that. One of my friends lets call him angry mike actually thought that was the greatest ending to any movie since...well...since any movie that Bon Jovi has been in (dude loves Bon Jovi). Anyway he asked me why did i hate it so? Well thats easy. When i started the movie i was 20, when i left the movie i was 25. What is that all about? Did i gain anything in that last million hours of goodbye footage? No...well one thing...i learned that sam and froto...well they couldn't be cuter together. Wait...what? Froto and sam weren't together? Now i really hated the ending. Anyway do yourself a favor you want fantasy go and rent Krull.
1.0~The masterpiece of the century jaketemple Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is certainly this century's masterpiece. It has everything that a person could want in a film. It has an amazing story, impressive special effects, top quality acting, and some of the best cinematography of the past years. It will scare you, it will make you cry, it will make you laugh and jump with joy and gasp at the immense scale of the epic tale. This is the film that over ran films such as Star wars and Citizen Kane as. Everyone in the world should be made to watch it. It is a film that will be around for hundreds of years and will continue to amaze people even then. A truly amazing film.
10.0~Wonderful experience! cybert_AT Sign in Permalink Had a wonderful 3.5 hours ride. Got totally drawn into middleearth from the first minute to the end, never got bored, except... Arwen. Imho she could have been completely omitted, Aragorn doesn't at all need her support for his character. If Eowyn wouldn't have had a critical role in the books (and for dragging Merry along), the unnecessary emphazising of her emancipation role disturbing the story would have been unbearable. She didn't stand up to ANY other character. Every single (other) character was wonderful (real or Gollum..), they totally took me, had to cry once or twice. This film is extremely strong in every facet. Acting, Story, CGI, length, perfect. Can't wait for some complete-Extended-Version-DVD-'stoning'-sessions... Congratulation for a All-Time-Top 5 film! Good luck for the Oscars!
9.0~A moviegoers dream come true moonchildkiller Sign in Permalink Watching this beautiful creation was one of the most glorious things i have ever witnessed in my life. There is virtually nothing wrong with this masterpiece, literally everything has been pushed to its most absolute limit, the actors, the music, the script, the direction, costume design, cinematography, editing, everything is perfect, everything is beautiful, definitely one of the best films ever made, a colossus amongst films. The number of times i stood amassed with a tear in my eye while watching this beauty is astonishing, i'm sure everyone knows about the Lord of the rings by now, i'm only doing this review for s#!tt$ and giggles. Truly this is one of the most epic films ever in cinematic history.
10.0~A must-see action that will keep you watching the whole way through! socchik5 Sign in Permalink The third and final LOTR movie is by far the best. It fills almost every movie category there is. Action, Romance, Adventure. It is awesome. The storyline will keep you wanting to see what happens. My compliments go to J.R.R. Tolkien for writing such amazing books and to Peter Jackson and Co. for creating an awesome movie! This is one of my all time favorite movies that I could watch over and over again! I am also glad that use of language was very appropriate and accepting. There is not one bad word in this whole movie. It is a compelling and action-packed movie. Of course I strongly advise that you see the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers before enjoying this wonder of a movie. Also, congratulations to it for taking 9 acadamy awards. It is TOTALLY the best!!
9.0~If only all movies were this good, fantasy or otherwise. Rob_Taylor Sign in Permalink What everyone else says, goes double for me. This movie rocks! I won't bore people with a long and gushing praise-singing of the film. In fact, I'm going to do the exact opposite. I'm going to pick out the tiny faults that stopped me from giving the film a 10 and only a 9 in the ratings. Firstly, it was just TOO much! The battle scenes were SO busy, I'm expecting to have to watch them several times more just in order to see everything that was going on. A minor niggle, really, but it will make me watch the movie again, so that's no bad thing. Secondly, what happened to Saruman? Not a hair do we see of him in the theatrical version. I only hope his scenes are added to the extended DVD version which will no doubt be released next year. Somehow, Pippin finding the Palantir in the water at the foot of Orthanc isn't nearly as satisfying as having Grima throw it at the group. I hope they change that back for the DVD. Thirdly, really an extension of the above I suppose, there are a number of points in the movie where it was apparent that they had cut out bits to save on running time. I trust these will be restored in the DVD as well. Finally, <spoiler ahead>, at the end, was I the only one who felt that Gollum and Frodo's struggle for the Ring was just a little bit silly? I think they should have done that from both Sam's viewpoint (as in the movie) and also from Frodo's perspective in the Shadow-world, and inter-cut the two. That way they could have shown Gollum's solution to getting the Ring back in more detail and it wouldn't have looked quite so silly. But all of the above are really minor gripes, most of which I hope will be fixed in the extended DVD. All in all, the three movies are a fine set of films and I'm hoping they will revive interest in the fantasy genre amongst the movie studios. It would also be nice to see fantasy films being treated as story and character driven epics rather than excuses to overindulge in special effects at the expense of any plot or character development. Anyone remember the abyssmal "Dungeons and Dragon" movie? Yech! So here's hoping that the LOTR trilogy will bring about a renaissance in fantasy movie making. And even if they don't, we'll always have these three - well, I will, anyway, in my DVD collection.
10.0~Stunning Conclusion to an Epic Trilogy Agaric Sign in Permalink WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS "I'm glad you're here Sam, here at the end of all things" I found that this particular line near the conclusion of the film struck a note inside me. Not only as one of my favorite lines from Tolkien's work, but also as a sad reminder that the trilogy has drawn to a close. No more will the rush of anticipation fill me as another December approaches, heralding the arrival of another of Peter Jackson's masterworks. The most monumental of the three films, "The Return of the King" also evokes the strongest impact within me. It represents the culmination of years of the most careful work that brought one of the most epic stories into cinema history. I'll begin with the obvious strong points of the movie. The effects are absolutely stunning. As you have read countless times previous, the Battle of the Pelennor fields is one of the most exhilerating thrill rides and certainly one of the grandest film battles. My mouth was agape even the third time viewing the Rohirrim stare in horror amidst the low rumble of the charge of the gargantuan Mamukil, during the winged fell beasts diving into the white city of Minas Tirith, and the arrival of the Army of the Dead. In subtler aspects, CGI has been used masterfully to craft a thoroughly convincing and memorable performance of a key character. The marriage of Andy Serkis' acting and the impecable craft of WETA animators created a Gollum worthy of remembrance. The settings are dazzling, particularly the psychedelic green glow of the foreboding Minas Morgul, Minas Tirith itself, and the atmospheric horror of Shelob's lair. Mordor is the true hell of Middle Earth as the strongholds of men are the light. The acting, though starkly Shakespearean at times, is particularly effective. The relationship between Frodo and Sam is brought to the forefront, powerfully conveying that the most important thing driving these characters through the most evil of places is their friendship. Miranda Otto is given a chance to shine as Eowyn, the caged warrior who finally gets an opportunity to fight for those she cares for. Her confrontation with the Witch King, promulgated by the line "I will KILL you if you touch him!", never ceased to send a shiver down my spine. Though wooden at times, the acting successfully moves the gears of the film. Without the burden of having to establish many characters and settings as the first two films did, "The Return of the King" allows development of many characters who were initially marginalized. Billy Boyd is particularly effective this time around as Pippin. Howard Shore's musical score is once again stirring as ever, molding a grandness of scale with the closeness and conflict of relationships. The sound design is equally awe inspiring: the Nazgul shrieks and grinding stone of a collapsing city never fail to elicit a response. Yes, there are shortcomings. Many very interesting scenes from the book didn't make the final theatrical cut. The confrontation with Saruman and the Scouring of the Shire are two notable examples. However, although I have been a Tolkien enthusiast since I first read the books when I was 8 or 9 years old, I do not share the cynicism of many reviewers. Apart from the obvious reason that the film's run-time already exceeds 3 hours, there is a simple question of interpretation. Certain sacrifices needed to be made to craft a feasible film for the movie going public. Furthermore, This is merely a certain group of people's vision of the books. We all have different images of Middle Earth in our minds. The fact that a scene is left out of a movie does not necessarily make it a poor or insufficient telling of a story. I find it interesting for example that hardly any reviewers of Star Wars criticized the movie for having not contained scenes from Lucas' original book. It positively surprised me that so many people have read and enjoyed these fabulous books to offer such valid comments out of their love for the trilogy. I'm sure that the DVD extended edition will please the palate of anyone who was disappointed with the removal of certain scenes. In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that CGI can enhance a movie-going experience without sacrificing the human element of film. I am wholly satisfied with Peter Jackson's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of three of my favorite novels to the screen.
10.0~There and back again. GenMarkGrayson Sign in Permalink "Return of the King" proves conclusively that magic still exists in the world of filmmaking. Not only does this film "crown" Peter Jackson's incredible achievement, it does so in a way no sequel ever has, or likely ever will again. The perfect blend of director, screenwriters, production designers, and incomparable performances make this last installment something akin to Beethoven's 9th Symphony: a spirit inhabits the whole trilogy and it rises above the medium of the screen and takes us to places films seldom do. Thank God Hollywood didn't have its hands on this masterpiece. The only thing left now is for PJ and his colleagues to receive Oscars that are 3 times the normal size.
9.0~Oscar Nominations sjjediknight Sign in Permalink A quick note about some of the nominations that may come out from this that last film of the series. We expect a best picture and perhaps direction nomination, but what of the acting within the picture. I must say that I felt that S. Astin turned an amazing performance in for all three pictures. It is hard for one to pick one supporting actor out of this cast that is not perhaps deserving of a nomination but I believe that his performance was steller to the character he was playing and should be picked up during the nomination process.
10.0~Exceeds Expectations! Biggest Disappointment: No More Movies! yh132 Sign in Permalink This movie exceeded my expectations, and I had pretty high expectations! LOTR continues to put the new Star Wars to shame! It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I knew what was coming! And after seeing this movie, I am now underwhelmed by the vast majority of trailers for other movies. It's like being offered old Hershey's Kisses after you have had the greatest chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, molten chocolate souffle, chocolate truffles, and hot chocolate that you have ever tasted in your life. As a fan of the books, I was again amazed with how true the interpretation was to the spirit of Tolkien. Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh never get enough credit for how well they succeeded in adapting such a huge and complex book into a workable screenplay! Of course there were minor changes but nothing that sticks out like in FOTR (Arwen as Xena Warrior Princess) or in TT (Elves at Helms Deep). Weta Works has really outdone themselves. The battle scenes in ROTK make the battle for Helm's Deep look unremarkable! (It's not a spoiler to say there will be battles in this movie, is it??) Minas Tirinth was a sight to behold, more beautiful than anything I could have imagined myself. The panoramic shots of the battle absolutely were epic. I know the word is used a lot, but I can't think of a better word to describe this movie. The acting was great as well. I believe that Sean Astin gave the best performance of the movie as Sam. John Noble ruled the screen whenever he appeared as Lord Denethor and left me wishing for more scenes! I thought that Agent Smith - I mean Hugo Weaving - could have displayed deeper emotions as Elrond, but that is my only real (and somewhat minor) complaint. I can't believe I have to wait nearly a year for the extended version DVD. The biggest disappointment is that there are no more LOTR movies to wait for now. (Plea to Peter Jackson: what about another trilogy from Tolkien's The Silmarillion??) 11/10 -- this better win a bunch of academy awards!
10.0~A worthy ending dev0_2000 Sign in Permalink Yes, it absolutely lived up to my expectations. You get the big sweeping ending with all the heroics you wanted. And the bittersweet goodbyes to some of the better characters in film, ever. Hardcore LoTR fans will miss some scenes, let's hope they show up in the Extended Edition. But the film does great without them. And I at least left the theatre with a tear in my eye and good sense of fullfillment. 10 out of 10!
1.0~For illiterates only oovag Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations are all among the worst literary adaptations ever. For Tolkien fans they are a torment. People who say otherwise can either not read or get paid for it.
10.0~Well done Mr. Tolkien Martinfilms Sign in Permalink Fellowship of the Ring - Amazing Two Towers - Amazing Return of the King - Simply phenomenal The third part in the fantasy world of JRR Tolkien is the best of the bunch. Even though it's onebig movie the third part is clearly the best. TRotK has what I believe the best battle not only in LOTR history but one of the best in film history.
10.0~my precious pknox Sign in Permalink Just back from the midnight show and all I can say is wow. Manages to somehow surpass the 1st two in every way. If Andy Serkis doesn't win an oscar for his performance as Gollum/Smeagol it's a joke, oh wait those awards usually are. Sean Astin and Sir Ian also deserve recognition. I only hope there is truth to the rumors of Peter Jackson making "The Hobbit". It's rare that I deviate from my normal shut-in routine, but I will be seeing this in the theater again, the way it must be seen. Amazing
2.0~A Hatchet Job on Tolkien vidaltm Sign in Permalink Perfect? Give me a break--or at least let me qualify that statement. At best Jackson should state/warn viewers that the movie is "loosely based" on JRR Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" Trilogy. The second and third films progressively deviate from the story and Tolkien, so much so, that it renders the whole story trite, unpalatable and predictable (Hollywood's modus operandi); and it is this aspect of the film that makes it "perfect"--perfect for American audiences. Jackson did a hatchet-job to Tolkien's work. Even the battle scenes, the one area of the film that I hoped would visually flesh out parts of the books, were buried beneath the offal of cheap entertainment. Bloom sucks. Liv Tyler sucks. The dialogue sucks. The notion of Gondor being a bunch of inept lolly-gaggers (in the face of a seemingly new threat) is laughable--they had contained Saurun for decades. Denathor's character is reduced to its most laughable level. The whole movie is a joke. This is not a great film. It may be mildly entertaining for some, wildly entertaining for others, but for Tolkien aficionados and those who value quality in terms of human creativity, this is awful. I pray Jackson stays away from Tolkien's other works. Please don't encourage filmmakers with all this "best of all time" dribble. This movie is awful. Peter Jackson ought to be ashamed of the mess he made of Tolkien. This is one book where--in regard to adapting it to film--if you are not going to do it right, just leave it alone. Final appraisal: This film and the rave reviews it has received is indicative of the "dumbing down" of Western culture and especially American culture. Prepare the way for the New Dark Ages.
8.0~Return of the King isn't the best of the trilogy. daitran199980 Sign in Permalink I hoped that it is better than The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers although both of them are perfect. Why? Because it holds a 95% "Fresh" rating on the aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes and holds a score of 94 out of 100 on Metacritic, it is ranked #9 in IMDb with an average score of 8.9. And it won 11 Oscars in 2004, included Best Picture. But after I saw it, I thought it can't be better than the first two films. Example, when Aragorn refused Éowyn, she fell in love with Faramir without reason? It is a poor romantic comedy film? Don't make me laugh. I heard the song, it's very sad and it made me to sleep right now. The big problem is the length of the film, 4h23 minutes, too long! It's very hard to remember the plot of the film. But the point make me gave this film 8 out of 10 (Firstly I gave it from 5-7) is the main characters and the battles. I prefer Sam to Frodo. He is the bet performance of the trilogy. He try to help Frodo although he was removed of the journey by Frodo (exactly Smeagol). This is friendship, the most powerful treasure of the world. And Smeagol, he was killed by his ambition, the Ring. And the battles? It's very fantastic and perfect (but The Two Towers is better). By the time, I hope that I will look on the bright side. 8/10 ( sorry for my English because I'm Vietnamese and I'm 16)
8.0~No flabber has been left ungasted by Mr Jackson's mighty battle sequences, nor no gob unsmacked. karanbhallapmo Sign in Permalink Hours after watching the film, I can close my eyes and see those incredible battle scenes pulsing and throbbing in my skull. They are even more extravagant than his jaw-dropping siege of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers. They have giant elephants and swooping pterodactyls. After the second movie, I compared his epic military setpieces to Kurosawa, but it's a condescension he no longer deserves. His battles are a thing of wonder on their own account. Maybe Kurosawa's battles will one day be described as proto-Jacksonian. And for the first time in this series they are built on to a plot with some narrative force.
10.0~Will remain a classic nc-119 Sign in Permalink This movie brings back lots of great memories, so i'm biased anyway... Nevertheless a lot of People feel the same way about this piece. Im sure of that. 'The return of the King' sums the trilogy up more than nicely. So well done. With lot's of blood, sweat and tears put into it. You feel it by watching it. Lesnie's Cinematography is a perfect fit for the Epic Landscapes and the breathtaking Visual effects. I have to mention that i never read the book, but from a movie standpoint, the story works just fine for me. And even to i may have overseen some goofs here and there, it all makes sense in the end. For those that haven't had the pleasure to watch it in cinemas,i recommend getting the Extended Version DVD (The one with all three movies included). The included making of is one of the best made behind the scenes looks out there.
10.0~Tolkien would be proud lindsjac Sign in Permalink Bringing Tolkien's richly imagined world to life, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is a triumph of an adaptation. The detailed movies capture the rich visuals and artistic design that J. R. R. originally put into his books. They stay faithful to the original story while still remaining exciting to watch. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an example for all aspiring film adaptations. The first thing I noticed when watching the films is how true to the book they are, especially the extended editions. Frodo Baggins inherits a mysterious ring, the source of a dark lord's power. It takes him on a journey through the land of middle earth to destroy it. It's malevolent owner, Sauron, is seeking it to secure his dominion over the peoples of middle earth. Frodo sets out for Mordor, the black kingdom of Sauron to destroy it; accompanied by Aragorn the ranger (someone who is not who he seems), Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, A man named Boromir, A couple of his vertically challenged friends, and a mysterious wizard named Gandalf. Unlike other book adaptations that heavily change the story to fit its needs, the Lord of the Rings stays remarkably unmolested, with only a few modifications here and there. Clearly the director, Peter Jackson, understood that Tolkien's world works because of the detail that he put into the books. The movies balance dialogue with action, so it's not just mindless orc bashing, but orc bashing with purpose. It somehow finds room for Tolkien's witty humor that contrasts the grim situation the fellowship must endure; Legolas and Gimli count their kills with the same enthusiasm as a gamer playing counter- strike. The crew of artists and designers have done their job well; working with Tolkien's rich description and detailed world to bring the book to life. Minas Tirith is a sight to behold, the white rings spiraling up to a cathedral crowned with towers. The elegant, Gothic architecture of the elves contrasts the rough, black, and primitive towers of Mordor. The elves' clothes are silky and clean, while the costume of the dwarfs is furry and brown; the men's wardrobe is something in between. I enjoyed these movies not just for the story, but for the imagery; some scenes gave me chills. The separation of the various races gives a special realism to the world. The clothes, the architecture and culture of the elves, dwarfs, hobbits, and men are all different and unique. Their costumes complement the values of each race. The imagery of these movies is ever present when I return to Tolkien's books. The battles are epic and breathtaking; armies clash and war machines hurl rocks at the opposing side. The shooting location, New Zealand, is a majestic scene, it makes you want to book tickets immediately. Its blue peaks and gray rocks blanketed in lichen are perfect for the world of middle earth. The films do have their issues, however. The multiple endings at the end of the Return of the King are confusing to many. The theatrical editions are missing some details that should have been left in. But those are small matters compared with all the things these movies do right. Tolkien built the world of middle earth, and Peter Jackson brought it to life. Tolkien would be proud.
10.0~Outstanding dlsmilad Sign in Permalink This movie was full of beautiful scenery, action, music scores and fantastic actors. They made this film seem realistic. After watching the first film, I was hooked. Couldn't wait for the next two. Yes, it is long, but you get your monies worth!
1.0~One of the most overrated films of all time CSH9337 Sign in Permalink I don't know what the Academy was thinking when it gave The Return of the King those 11 awards. It did not deserve a single one, especially best picture. Lost in Translation, Mystic River, Cold Mountain, and even Seabiscuit were all far better. Those films actually had depth and meaning where as the Lord of the Rings is just like Titanic; a bunch of shotty acting and film making covered up with tons of high budget special effects. Neither film deserved their awards and both in my view, are among the most overrated, and crappiest films in history. I wish the academy would stop choosing the films that are the most popular or will give them the greatest approval rating.
10.0~Greatest film ever made kevs06 Sign in Permalink Amazing. Out of words. The return of the king is not just my favorite film of all time, its actually the best cinematic experience. The effects are amazing, the plot is catching, the actors are outstanding, Peter Jackson directing is brilliant. Its true, the film is way long and it has too many dramatic moment, nevertheless, it succeeds both in an entertaining film and one of the most decent films ever done. I will not recommend that you should see this movie, because you MUST see this movie, otherwise you don't deserve to watch any other movie in your life. 10/10 I am not exaggerating.
10.0~Beautiful and touching end of an awesome trilogy lkoricanac94 Sign in Permalink It faithfully showed all the best things from the books and brought middle earth to our TV and cinema screens which is awesome and legendary, all in all one of the best movies i'we ever watched and i strongly recommend for everyone to see it,the remorse will not be shown i guaranty you that.The movie can surely be watched by non fantasy fans because it's beautifully shot effects and the music were perfectly done and mixed...i just have one thing that bugs me:Peter should show the audience extended edition because it shows what happened to saruman,and that is a big minus to all book lovers.Aside from that everything else was more than satisfying for me and for most people...
10.0~great end thiu Sign in Permalink SPOILERS i just saw this movie today and i had mixed feelings because i really wanted to see the conclusion yet i was sad that it was finally ending. even though i sat at the front row it was still worth it. it had the right mix of everything comedy and drama. and by the way how come none of the cast is even nominated for a golden globe? they deserve it. sam (sean)was really a standout in this 3rd installment, not that viggo or elijah's wasn't, but sean astin's performance was great in that his portrayal of the character was so relatable. this movie is the only one i can think of that did not disappoint me. its everything i expected and more. No need to elaborate on the visual magnificence of rotk or the great battles of all time. first all what i liked about this is the climax really when frodo went to mt. doom and he didn't let go of the ring. i was really shocked that he didn't throw it, because what did it mean? when someone like frodo, a hobbit with no wish of power to begin with is corrupted by power, what will happen if it was a man who was put into that task. did it mean evil was always triumphant? what was so great about this was that frodo redeemed himself, when the ring fell into the lava, he hang on. he had a CHOICE to follow the ring like gollum did or live and reach out to sam. and he did. the message was so subtle and yet so significant. furthermore peter jackson made this film so real because of the range of human/elf/whatever emotions and relationships that was forged in this film. there was real depth in the characters. as well as the dynamic change of the character of frodo. i was sad to see that frodo couldn't go back to the way he was. even after a long time had passed. yet that was a reality. when something happens or when you see things differently, you can't go back and be with people who don't understand that light/darkness/truth you saw. just a great great end to a trilogy
10.0~Movie Magick Puttrick77 Sign in Permalink I wish i could show you how much this movie mean to me, for me words are not enough to describe the greatness of this work of "PURE ART" but i will try. I don't think there will ever be a movie or should i say trilogy like this...let me explain (takes a deep breath)cause this is as good as it get's and i think as good as it EVER will get. The hair on my body just stands up when i see it or talk about it cause it has everything i could ever ask for in a movie: Never have i seen such direction before, so much LOVE and PASSION been made in a movie, just look at the DETAILS here! I can't name ONE movie that made me feel like i did when i first saw this movie. (this happens every time i see it) What i felt: EMOTION, FRIENDSHIP, LOVE, HATE, FRIENDSHIP, THRILL, SUSPENSE, LAUGHTER....I have never cried so much in my LIFE!(tears of joy and sadness) (Just look at our own world and see this movie, think about it and you will LEARN a lesson for life...) When the movie was over i said to myself as i rubbed my eyes not quite believing what i had Seen and(Heard): Whhhhhhaaaaat....did i just see here???? Movie MAGICK!!! "My mouth was hanging open, jaw down to the floor) "HAHA" I remember it so well cause i forgot about my (own) world and i was "living" experiencing everything that happened in the movie i feel it was happening to ME. This had never happened to me before in my entire life and i am now 29 years old male. (i got this weird feeling) It was the best roller coaster of emotions i have ever felt. Yeeehhaaa! My world rocked! So much information to grasp...wooooowww, truly amazing. Everything was great and how often does that happen? Not very often and for me that is saying A lot, cause I'm a movie and a book "fanatic" Since my memory is almost photographical this was the greatest treasure ever! (STILL IS) Acting, Directing, Choreography,the Cast, Music, well it has everything and it is Top Of The Line. Why do some people like this "the movies" better than the books? Why do movies sometimes move us more than books? Cause of the Music, cause of the sound, books don't have that do they? Tell me, what would a movie be without SOUND??? It wouldn't be a movie at all, at least not for me.... I must say also that you NEED imagination to appreciate this "FANTASY" and these movies and you need to understand what true emotions really are, some that have criticized this movie lack some of it, most of it or are simply RETARDED. " you need people of intelligence for this sort of quest, ...thing... (well that rules YOU out pip)...uummm where are we going? BEST MOVIE IN HISTORY (at least in mine) BEST EVER 10 Stars! I looooove it
9.0~Not as good as the Fellowship but better than the Two Towers stevene20 Sign in Permalink Peter Jacksons' first major task was to make Lord of the Rings into one film. "Impossible", Peter Jackson said, there was no way he could fit all the information into one film. But one of the producers in New Line Cinema said why not make three films because there is three books. It was exactly what the crew making the film wanted to hear. So then the scripts were re-writ to fit three films. After the theatrical release, director Peter Jackson wanted to create an extended version for each film. This was because Peter Jackson wanted to capture it for posterity. The Lord of the Rings was a cinematic masterpiece, the greatest book of the 20th Century was made into the greatest film trilogy of the 21st Century. The end of the trilogy is here and what a way to end it. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King deserved an academy award, but it won 11 out of a possible 14, that's a phenomenal record. The journey ends as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry and Pippin fight to defend Gondor, the white city. And all journey's come to a successful conclusion, as all the survivors from the battle of the Pellanor Fields go to the Black Gate to give Frodo and Sam one last chance to destroy the One Ring. Great film, Peter Jackson has made a fantastic series, with the help of the film-making crew. the trilogy will be remembered for decades to come.
10.0~Theyll never make another movie like this one Poetic_Ammo Sign in Permalink As i read through the comments i see all sorts of people geeks, fantasy-haters, dumbasses who couldnt understand the plot, chick flick lovers and so forth. all i gots to say is this is the best movie ive seen in a long time for the first time ever i saw people give the movie a standing ovattion in the cinema at the ghettho area its isnt the perfect film but its the best ever
10.0~Great movie JoDarr Sign in Permalink As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street. We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise. That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created. The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words. If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out). As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.
10.0~Along with The Godfather, this is definitely the best movie ever made! xaleber Sign in Permalink I don't believe what I saw! This whole trilogy is astonishing and magnificent! But this particular one.....there is no word to describe it! Filmmaking never got better. No filmmaker has ever aimed higher or achieved more than Peter Jackson. From war scenes to the trickery of Gollum to the climb of the mountain, this movie takes hold of your heart and never let go. This is the first review i ever wrote on IMDb, but this movie deserves it. I didn't watch this movie when it was still brand new. I waited 11 years then opened the chest and i found treasure i never thought i would possess. I don't think we will see movies like this for a very very long time. Thank you Peter Jackson for this movie..for this....Gift
10.0~All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you. Get to the cinema! Soze-6 Sign in Permalink I was so enthused to see this movie, I wish I didn't have so much happiness riding on it, so as to allow me the blindsightedness as to how this movie truly is. My expectations were sky high, from all the publicity and the previous movies. For me at the moment Two Towers still has the cinematic genius moments with Gollums first monologue and Theoden's echoed rhetoric in Helms Deep. But I watched that movie many times, and need to see this one again, to truly appreciate it's obvious artistry and excitement without the overwhelming expectation. Just a quickie while I think if it, was anyone else reminded of the Empire Strikes Back rebel attack on the oncoming AT-AT's when we saw the battle amongst the Olyphaunts? People were weeping behind me at the end (mostly women), and I was touched. I think that Sean Astin as Samwise is outstanding. Andy Serkis' and Weta's Gollum gets you so emotionally driven toward hating his schizophrenic persona. You begin to wish you were Gandalf (a fabulous Sir Ian McKellen) or had the command of respect that he has. You see him and feel that he can resolve all problems laid before him. Truly funny moments, heart wrenching scenes, extraordinary action. These are first impressions, I'll no doubt feel even warmer after I go back to see it again tomorrow at another packed screening.
10.0~Brilliant. Simply brilliant kevin_crighton Sign in Permalink Where to start with this masterpiece? Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. A fitting end to a stunning trilogy. The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers. As I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum. By the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before. I could happily have sat through this again and again. Well done to everyone, both in front and behind the cameras for such a brilliant work, but of course special mention has to go to Peter Jackson. He deserves every award he's received for this. One last point. If you only seen the theatrical release, then go get the extended version of this film. It's even better!!
10.0~The Bar Has Been Raised... natelr-3 Sign in Permalink With so much Hollywood trash coming out on a weekly basis, I have come to dread going to the movies. I used to go every week and now its not even once a month. This movie proves, what without a doubt, what good film is. With so many other filmmakers ruining their films by giving in to the temptation of heavy special effects and little story (*cough* Matrix Revolutions); I am glad to see there is at least one filmmaker left who knows how to create a masterpiece in this day of age. I consider my self pretty critical when it comes to film. There are very few movies that I would ever consider giving a perfect 10. But I would have to say this is one of them. Now that I have seen what film can be, I feel I have raised the bar and will find it difficult to enjoy anything new to come. IÕm not going to get into all the elements that made this great, I donÕt feel like writing something that long. But all I can say is that if Peter Jackson, and the rest of his brilliant team, does not get an Oscar for this, something is very wrong- but then again, I stopped watching the Oscars years ago.
10.0~Satisfying *spoilers* lotherskandi Sign in Permalink Well, I finally saw the ending of the saga. It doesn't to any of the three films justice to see them as three separate films. It's one film, in three parts, and frankly I would have had nothing against a 9-hour film, but what can you do? *spoilers* The film picks up after the victory over Helm's Deep. The kingdom of Rohan is safe, but even though Saruman is defeated, Sauron continues his war against men and is preparing to attack Minas Tirith. Once again, men find themselves outnumbered and the chances of holding the defense, let alone a victory are extremely low. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue on their horrible journey to Mordor. Gollum turns Sam against his friend, and when things just can't possibly seem to get any worse, they do. I won't give you the whole story, those who are reading this have probably seen it already. What I'm trying to say is that it was the _perfect_ way to end the tale. I was doubtful of whether or not Jackson would stay true to the book and keep the Shire-ending and Valinor sailing as well, but he did. I think that's brilliant because it answers all the necessary questions, but on the other hand for people who haven't read the book, it might be a tad overstretched. The one who said this movie did not have anyintense moments must lack the skill to see emotion and intensity through anything else than action and suspense. If you wanted action, there was plenty in TTT. There was lots of suspense in FotR. IMO, The battle of Minas Tirith was breathtaking as well as intense, although I can see the difference between the suspense felt in Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith. Here, the point of the movie was to finish it all, to finally see Frodo destroy the ring. The battles were side-stories. And the destruction was a marvellous scene. All the scenes of Frodo and Sam leading to that moment were marvellous. You could so _feel_ the desperation of Frodo, the emotions Sam was going through when Gollum fooled Frodo. The intesity was overwhelming. So there it is, thats my opinion. The end of the story, with a climax (yes, there was a climax) and enough intensity leading to that climax, action, and no annoying one-liners (i hated those one-liners with Gimli in TTT). There was a deepening of the characters in this film, for example with Merry and Pippin. It may sound arrogant, but these sort of films are not meant for people who associate comic relief and pure action with the success of a well told saga. I mean come on, this _is_ Tolkien's work we're talking about. If it were up to him, he would have made a documentary rather than a film about it. These films are a (relatively) successful combination of good directing, breathtaking effects, (pretty) good acting on average, and Tolkien's great storytelling.
10.0~It is the best swimerchick444 Sign in Permalink I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I don't really care what they didn't put in its not perfect but its close! The acting was great the visual effects were amazing. I think that peter deserves an Oscar for this and the film should win as well. This could not have ended any other way. Superb.
6.0~Good but needed something new Poppycockevil Sign in Permalink Lord Of The Rings:Return Of The King was everything I expected it to be and no more. Don't get me wrong it was great and all but nothing special. It was the best by far but it just wasn't as special. I think that is because Peter Jackson used all the eye candy(special effects) in the first two so he had nothing new to show us and that is slightly disapointing. Overall I give this movie a 8.5(for pip being so cute) out of ten. I must thank the cast and crew for I enjoyed your journey on this mission...quest........thing
5.0~too long, I couldn't keep my mind with the movie io1043188 Sign in Permalink like I wrote in my summary: I didn't like the movie because it was too long-winded. if it would have a duration time of about 1 hour and 45 minutes I would have probably given it a 8 or higher. it's the same with the other parts of this trilogy, all were too long. I think I liked the first one the most because of the new characters and a relative fast storyline. I never read the book, maybe that's why I was bored watching this movie.... I have had a discussion with a friend once, he liked it very much, he gave it an 9 or 10 but he has read the book, he told me that it was a great translation to the big screen, I can't compare it in that way. action, atmosphere creation and characters were excellent though!
10.0~Waiting for this film was like a deep breath before the plunge! The-Wick Sign in Permalink Borrowing from Gandalf's line, my anticipation for seeing this movie was the strongest of the three. After taking the "plunge" and witnessing this epic unfold, I am left without adequate words to describe how fulfilling it was. Ever since I read The Hobbit and the trilogy in 1978 I was hopeful that someone would create a cinematic version of them. Though hopeful, I was also skeptical that anyone could do the novels justice. After a couple of weak animated attempts by other film makers, I think Peter Jackson and his wonderful crew have nailed it! When I first heard in 1999 that someone was going to make a serious attempt at LOTR, I prayed they would do a good job and meet my expectations. He did. ROTK is the climactic ending to the trilogy and definitely does not disappoint. It had everything: action, character realism, emotion, love, drama, comedy, heroism, despair, hope, triumph! The bad guys were REALLY BAD and the good guys were REALLY GOOD. For those of you who don't like spiders, you better cover your eyes during the Shelob scene. What a creepy beast! I will be pulling for PJ during the Oscars. When the extended DVD comes out next year I will purchase it and place it next to my other two cherished extended version DVD's of FOTR and TTT. Right now? I have the same feeling when I finished reading the trilogy for the first time: sad there wasn't more but a strong feeling of contentment and joy that I experienced it.
10.0~An epic film going into film history! meter-2 Sign in Permalink I think everything has been written that there is to write about this film. Upon seeing the film I realize and regret having being so generous in my voting history. This film trilogy stands alone with nothing to compare with. My dear reader, if you haven't seen the trilogy you surely have something to look forward to. Acting par excellence, an outstanding story etc. The trilogy appeals to grown children in all ages, but I think one should be at least 5-7 years for fully enjoy it. Having small children at home (3 and 1 year) I know that somewhere in the future I will be reliving the film with them and relive my childhood again.
10.0~creative filmmakers Mizz-Helena Sign in Permalink I loved this one. Of the all Lotr-movies, this one is the best. Peter Jackson is sure the best producer in the world. I liked all the scenes in this movie. The one with Gollum/Smeagol ended up like a creep, was scary though. Didn't know that Gollum was that evil. He had the chance to be good, caring and against The One Ring. But if he hadn't the conversations with himself he wouldn't ended up like a pointless loser who died because of one little thing. Didn't like him at all. The whole Gollum/Frodo/Sam storyline, scared the crap out of me. Especially when Gollum attacked Frodo at Mount Doom and bite his finger off(eeew).And Sam was a quite of a hero,i understand why he didn't trust at Smeagol at all, duh!!!And Shelob..oh my god, he was the scariest one, when he tricked frodo and was about to eat him.He was so ugly, the ugliest spider alive and twice as that big. Im glad that they destroyed the annoying ring at the end, glad that thing ended well for them, even when i was in doubt with it,he he.. The other fellowship did as twice as big great performance. I liked so much the Pelennor Fields-battle and Minas Tirith. And plus Aragorn became the king. He is my fave character in this whole story, he showed a lot of intelligence.I liked the connection between the dead ones and Aragorn, and when they showed up to fight in the last battle. Eowyn and Aragorn should have ended together, they had much in common, i only wished Aragorn could see that, but ended up with Arwen instead. Arwen isn't so good of a character, i didn't actually understand why she cried for. Eowyn showed more feelings actually and proved what she was meant for(when she was in that last-battle). I love Eowyn, and she rocks more than Arwen does. By the way her brother, Eomer is extremely hot, true hero that man, the most sexiest man i ever seen in a armour and in a battle, talking about a true hero I've got. And too bad Treebeard and other ents wasn't with them, they were so funny, liked them!! And too bad Sauron didn't show himself in any other form than just eye. again like he did at the first movie. When i first heard about Return of the King, i thougth it was Sauron who is supposed to be the evil king and that he should return in the last movie, but i guess i was wrong. The subject is about that Arogorn should be the king, and he become too. well this movie was very exiting and different than other movies and showed how good Lord of the Rings is. I rate 10/10.
10.0~And all the Oscars go to... rcstokkel Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson and his crew. And I'm not joking about it either. This trilogy leaves The Matrix in the shadows. Even more so when you look at the extras on the dvd's. Where the interviews on the Matrix dvd don't go any further than "wow", "fantastic" etc., the people on the LOTR dvd's do have something to say about the process of filming, the depth of the story etc.
10.0~Brilliant jalilisaman Sign in Permalink Fantastic classic movie,it took you into middle earth and you feel like you are part of its world
1.0~Read the book.... it`s much better.... maddesperado Sign in Permalink I hate when peoples don`t ever use advisors (e.g. Battle Orders) All the moneys gone to FX. And no one cares if battles looks just stupid... If you knows at least how the Bow works....
5.0~It was too long baseball_nose Sign in Permalink I haven't seen the first two Lord of the Rings, however my two nephews and I went to see ROTK and I found myself moving in my seat wondering when something interesting was going to happen. I really enjoyed Gollum when he was pretending to sleep, I found that to be the most exciting part of the movie. It was repetitious when Gollum was nice and then evil, too predictible for me. Also when everyone was fighting battles repeatedly, it was just too predictible and non-stimulating for me. However the sound effects were excellent, along with the make-up of the actors. I rate it a 5 out of 10.
10.0~All Good Things come to an End! OttoVonB Sign in Permalink All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury. "Return of the King" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt. The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect. Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for. A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some...
10.0~Totally Awesome! littlemac-1 Sign in Permalink This movie is definitely one of the best movies that I have ever seen! I'm also a huge fan of Tolkien's books, and though the movie doesn't exactly live up to the books, it is a pretty darn good job. All of the acting is wonderful, and Peter Jackson is by far one of the best directors of the modern day. It's amazing of how such a wonderful book can be brought to life. This movie is just amazing...I was blown away!
10.0~A perfect ending to the greatest movie series of all time coreycole Sign in Permalink One truly amazing thing about The Lord of the Rings is the consistency and quality of all three films. There are no weak links in the series. The Return of the King completes the legacy in wonderful fashion. Every critical scene (save "the scouring of the Shire") is included, and even that intentional omission makes total sense in the film adaptation. RotK kept my family and me in a constant state of wonder and suspension of disbelief. Even though we had read the books many times, the film kept surprising us with clever timing and subtle twists on the action of the story. Every member of the Fellowship has multiple moments to shine. The character development is expanded, and the battle scenes are awesome. Peter Jackson and his co-writers have managed a fantastic balance between the three entwined storylines of the novel. We watched Return of the King as part of the special "trilogy showing" of all three films. This is the first time we saw the extended version of The Two Towers. This was equally amazing -- Almost every flaw of the original film has been addressed and more than adequately fixed. While I originally thought Fellowship was a much better film, The Two Towers has now caught up with, and possibly surpassed, the first film. The Lord of the Rings has now become the greatest "series" film of all time.
9.0~Alternate Ending joris8 Sign in Permalink I will here reveal the upcoming director's cut so don't read of you don't wanna hear the new ending: Five minutes into the first movie, Gandalf realized all he had to do was to get on one of those eagles, FLY to Mount Doom and simply TOSS IN the ring. The Hobbits stayed home, got drunk and were banned from the Green Dragon for life. Aragorn opened up a Pizza Hutt. The Orks were adopted by Angelina Jolie (all of them). Sauron became the next elected president of the United States by becoming a Republican. He invaded Afghanistan, Iraq and Belgium and was impeached after they found a certain "stained dress" in Legolas' apartment.
3.0~3 hours and 21 minutes...seemed like twice that spammag Sign in Permalink This movie dragged on for what seemed like six hours. The primary battle scenes are fantastic and a worthy final chapter to the story. Of course, all three movies dragged on seemingly endlessly with uninteresting hobbit conversation and bickering. I rate this movie a "3" due to a 3 hr 21 minutes of mostly boredom for me. If it had been half that long...I'd rate it a "6" for being a very interesting story with great effects.
10.0~The film is transgressive, innovative, and not afraid to take over as the definitive work of recognized worldwide work of Tolkien fernandoschiavi Sign in Permalink The Return of the King comes to the big screens worldwide in 2003 evoking the most diverse types of feelings: sadness, joy, delight and satisfaction are some of them. After two adaptations that have shocked the world with its grandeur, director Peter Jackson presents fans around the world with a performance worthy of applause and bows certainly will miss and leave an empty feeling in the mind of anyone who likes movies. Peter Jackson had the challenge of overcoming the stigma that the end of trilogies are always inferior and never meet the expectations of fans. Thus, citing some examples, The Matrix Revolutions, also released in 2003, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and Back to the Future 3. The fear of not overcome the previous growing further because The Two Towers have been a landmark in special effects and maintained the same level of quality The Fellowship of the Ring. Fortunately, Jackson has not only surpassed their predecessors, they created probably the greatest fantasy film in cinema history, an epic beyond compare proportions and practically unattainable. In The Return of the King, the action is raised to four points that will interconnect in a spectacular finale. Frodo, Sam and Gollum are heading toward the mountain of doom. Gandalf and Pippin help in preparing the defense of Minas Tirith, Merry joins the army of the horsemen of Rohan who will prepare for the ultimate battle. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are in search of help that may be decisive in the battle against Sauron. The scenarios and events are magnified and more majestic. The various passages for those who read the books will come to life: Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, Aragorn entering the Paths of the Dead; battle where Faramir is seriously injured, the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the opening of the Black Gate, the Tower of Cirith Ungol, Mount Doom, the Chambers of Fire, to help the Eagles against Sauron's armies, the destruction of the Ring and the defeat of Sauron, the Return of the King of Gondor with Elvish name Elessar and his marriage to Arwen that preferred to live a mortal life alongside his love, The Grey Havens, etc. The Return of the King, however, has excesses in your script. Probably due to the pace and duration, Jackson decided to remove some passages from The Two Towers and insert them in The Return of the King, further increasing the duration of the latter film, leaving you with 201 min long version released in theaters. Apart from scene to increase the length of the already quite long film differs from other facts book and technically, the film is almost perfect and became the record holder by winning the Oscar 2004, 11 of the 11 nominations received statuettes at the awards, equaling in number of awards only to Titanic (1997) director James Cameron and Ben-Hur ( 1959) director William Wyler, who have the same amount of premiums. Won awards for best art direction, costume design, editing, makeup, soundtrack, original music for the song "Into the West", sound, visual effects, adapted screenplay, direction and best film. The visual effects are still tasteful and make a junction between actual filming practically perfect computer-generated. The scene of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, fought outside the walls of Minas Tirith, is the greatest example of this. Probably that's the longest streak of battles ever held in the cinema,The cast can once again have great performances. And when Peter Jackson said in interviews that the first two films were preparing for this end, he was not kidding. Its direction is the major difference and that is what makes movies differentiate themselves from other similar launched later worried only with the battles, and not with the feelings of the characters and their motivations. Again with beautiful general plans, stretches with use of slow motion and camera movements unthinkable, the director explores all too well the natural environment and which was built by art director for the shoot. The New Zealand ties all the stories parallel so that everything can be solved simultaneously. But The Return of the King is not just a fantasy film with effects, and he cares to enlarge tensions, hesitations, internal struggles, motivations of the protagonists involved. The key of this third part is mainly in the hands of Aragorn and Frodo. Aragorn have to return to Gondor and take the place it is right and lead the resistance against the enemy threat, including having to collect a debt from the past. Here it is Frodo, is increasingly tempted by the ring which carries this internal conflict and leads to the last moment when you are about to destroy it. But Jackson increases even more the importance of Sam, showing all his courage and fidelity to the hobbit friend so he can achieve his goal. Jackson still has other moments of pure wisdom and sensitivity amid such scenes of war exhaustive. For example, when Denethor sends Faramir (David Fenham) on a suicide mission, asking then to Pippin sing a song while you eat something. Jackson then makes the viewer watch the scene Squad Faramir being massacred while listening Pippin at the request of Denethor, sings a sad song. The Return of the King is a masterpiece of cinema magnanimous and impassable. Is beyond reproach and is practically a unanimous vote of the seventh art and has everything that an overproduction epoch must have. We have a script respectful of the original work, interpreters' unquestionable quality and revolutionary teams ahead of all technical teams. The film is transgressive, innovative, and not afraid to take over as the definitive work of recognized worldwide work of Tolkien. Is left longing and buy all the extended versions to always have a Middle-earth in our hands to be visited at any time.
9.0~We were probably the first to see this... musicnet Sign in Permalink 16 December, 23.59. We are waiting...00.00, the 17th of December has come. The Netherlands sees The Return of the King. And it was superb! Some remarks perhaps about the end and some not included pieces of the book, like the house of the healing, the mouth of Sauron, but it was worth it being there until this early moment.
9.0~With its diverse population of men, elves, hobbits, dwarfs and wizards, stands at a crossroads! usmanbanday-95174 Sign in Permalink A surprisingly faithful adaptation of the novel. What viewers take away from this legendary adventure will depend to some extent on whether they've read Tolkien's classic novels. Lacking the context of the entire trilogy, Fellowship leaves many questions unanswered. There's also uncomfortable ambiguity in the area of spiritual content. Much of that gets ironed out as the saga continues, but families who have read the books will benefit from an even richer view of Tolkien's fantasy.
8.0~J.R.R. Tolkein's finale and the best in the Series neosaintst Sign in Permalink If you ever wondered why we are drawn to the Mythical age of magic, patriarchal kingdoms, and fantasy role-playing? Well this is one of the finer fictional writers of this series. A truly epic and morally conscious tale of the Good versus the Evil, where even the smallest of creatures {i.e. Hobbits} play an integral role of saving the Kingdoms and the world of Modoor. Peter Jackson's lead as direction, along with a top caliber cast ranging from Cate Blanchett to Hugo Weaving. A cast of memorable rounded characters {The Heroic Hobbits, played by Sean Astin and Elijah Wood} and a most profound Gray wizard, Gandalf played by "Ian Mckellon." Together they bring rag-tag group of unsung heroes on a perilous journey to vanquish the villainous Sauron played by "Christopher Lee" and his horde of evil. This film definitely lives up to the fan-boy's wondrous adventures and the final installment of the LoTR brings a great finale to an already epic saga. Go watch the entire series without having to delve into the prologue series entitled "The Hobbit" Spend your time to enjoy this great flick as it soon as you can if you haven't already.

9.0~And so it won 11 Oscars Skeloboy Sign in Permalink Just saw the oscar last night, where ROTR was the big winner. And here it finally stops, and the LOTR-trilogy is finished with 11 oscars out of 11 nominees for ROTR. A fine conclusion to the most brilliant trilogy ever. I can't see what movies that could become bigger than this trilogy. People might not like the movies, but they can't deny the fact, that it has the most astonishing cinematography, art-direction and visual effects ever made. But I'm a little glad that its over. I'm a bit fed up with LOTR news Skeloboy
1.0~Awful movie figment111 Sign in Permalink The story was ruined, the ending was drawn-out, the whole movie was shot in this ridiculous - this story is so epic I will pan around and everything will seem really dramatic, even when there is no real action - way. It was like a parody of itself, I can hardly believe people could find any of the worth of the novels in this self-aggrandizing trilogy. I only paid $3 to see this film and was wishing for my money back. After what should've been the final scene of the movie there was this fake 10 minute ending where thousands of people simply cheered on screen. It was such a blatant way of telling people the fabulous movie, the tremendous trilogy is over let's all celebrate. It was terrible.
1.0~The third is the best of all konover Sign in Permalink I was not a huge fan of Fellowship of the Ring when I first saw it. The Two Towers was an improvement, though I still could not figure out why so many people were putting these films on such a pedestal. Since then, the two films have grown on me and I was actually psyched to see Return of the King. It proved to be the best of the lot. The movie was long, but it didn't feel long. The action, characters and storylines are now more familiar to me than when I first saw Fellowship and Return of the King proved to be an entertaining and rewarding experience. The acting, as with the previous entries, is excellent. The dialogue is crisp. The special effects, mindblowing. And the storytelling, though sometimes confusing, is for the most part captivating. Frodo's approach to the fiery pit of Mount Doom probably ranks as the trilogy's single best sequence. Much has been said about the movie's number of endings. I think they were appropriate and welcome groups of epilogues. Because a lot of the moviegoing public is on a Lord of the Rings high, not a whole lot is said about the trilogy's flaws. And just like in the previous entries, this film has its share. For one, there has been some talk about a homoerotic chemistry between Frodo and Sam in the previous films. Well, you ain't seen nothing yet. There were times where I thought Frodo and Sam were perfectly capable of planting a big wet one on each other's lips and declaring their love for one another. Imagine Han Solo stopping in the middle of the Death Star to proclaim his feelings for Luke Skywalker and you get the idea. Merry and Pippin have similar scenes. It was just too distracting. There's also a lot of crying in this film. But to the film's credit, Peter Jackson somehow makes it work. I was also disappointed there were not more scenes of wizardry and magic. A lot is said about how the Lord of the Rings trilogy blows away the Star Wars prequels with its use of special effects. I have to say that while that is true to a degree, some of what is up in Return of the King looks like CGI. Sometimes, though rarely, horribly so. Viggo Mortensen, for me, steals the show as Aragorn. He's kinda like the Lord of the Rings version of Han Solo, but more fleshed out. He's tough, cool and a lady's man, but there's room here for more human characteristics. Ian McKellan's performance as Gandalf ranks right up there as well. The other characters, like Gimli and Leogalas, have become loveable and kind of like old friends. We're glad to see them and glad to see their competitive friendship in the heat of battle. Finally, I was really concerned when I heard that Christopher Lee's scenes were deleted. I still say that was a mistake, but it was not nearly as distracting as I thought it would be. This was a great, satisfying way to end the trilogy and, for once, the third film is the best film.
7.0~Good but massively over-rated! A_Kind_Of_CineMagic Sign in Permalink A lot of people looking on this page will thoroughly disagree and disregard my comments but I feel justified in saying that the Lord of the Rings trilogy and this final part in particular are possibly some of the most over-rated films of all time! I hasten to add that I do like the films and rate them as very good 7 or 8 out of 10 but I just do not see them as the 10/10 all time greats that other people see them as. I love fantasy stories and films in general, I just find these films to be far less impressive than most people appear to think they are. The main thing in the trilogy I find absolutely impressive is Gollum (Andy Serkis). The motion capture performance by Serkis is genius and the CGI character was the best up to that time. Also Gollum is a great character, hilarious, sometimes creepy and fascinating. Also you cannot fault Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and there are other good performances too. Most people who loved the books or loves this kind of story understandably lap the films up enthusiastically. An epic, massive budget presentation of one of the most famous and loved fantasy stories is somewhat irresistible to anyone who likes fantasy stories at all. However, I was a little bit underwhelmed on my first viewing of the films and have remained so with each viewing. They are not bad films at all. They have great spectacle, have some epic action, some scenes with effective humour or emotion and some fine actors but there is a lot I find disappointing. LOTR would be extremely difficult to adapt to film for anybody and I don't think these films do it as well as they could. There is a lot of time wasted unnecessarily and important aspects of story and character are left out or underdeveloped. I find Peter Jackson generally a far from 100% successful director. His version of King Kong is poor and shows his faults even a lot more than the LOTR trilogy. All these Jackson made films are a bit overblown and a little pretentiously directed. Extremely long shots of characters gazing into camera, at each other or into the distance occur so often it is incredible. A great director does not need words to tell a story or convey emotion and the face and eyes of an actor can be used to huge effect. But most shots of characters without dialogue in this trilogy fail to make me feel anything other than they are wasting time! Frodo (Elijah Wood) especially just gazes or gawps for what seems like ages without making me connect with his feelings and without moving the character or story on at all. CGI is the real king in these films and as impressive as many scenes are, it never thrills as much as the real scenery or real action in some older epics. The epic spectacle is therefore not enough to carry me away on its own, it requires great storytelling. Some great storytelling does occur in these films but I do not feel Tolkein's story or characters are done full justice due to Jackson wasting time on 'pretty', glossy, showy film making. A real efficiency and supreme skill was needed to get the most from the source material and this is lacking. For instance, Return of the King misses out important aspects of Aragorn, Feramir and Saruman's stories and I find Frodo comes across as rather petulant, annoying and lacking heroism. Samwise comes across a lot better. A great villain completes a great story. Sauron appears a feeble 'villain' throughout the trilogy. A flaming eye is not exactly Darth Vader! Tolkein created a villain difficult to show effectively on screen and Jackson's presentation of Sauron fails to convey threat or menace at all. Saruman is a good villain and is brilliantly acted by Christopher Lee but has totally insufficient screen time, particularly in the final story where he goes straight to DVD! Overall The Return of the King is easily the weakest of the trilogy for my tastes featuring faults I have listed above, rather overblown CGI action and an extraordinarily dragged out ending. Yes these films are very good but for me they are nowhere near the classics they are reputed to be or that they could have been if perfectly directed.
10.0~Wow. jenmeg56 Sign in Permalink This is a very good movie. I waited a year for it, but it was definately worth the wait. The acting is great, the effects are great, and the locations are awesome. I enjoyed the special effects, they were realistic and they didn't take over the whole movie (Think the opposite of Matrix- Although i haven't seen the last one, i have heard all of the horrible reviews it got.) The story is great, it is well written by Tolkien; and Peter Jackson did a great job of bringing it to the big screen. Overall, I would give the movie a 9.7/10 (I missed the House of Healing- I can't wait untill the extended DVD comes out because i've heard it will be on it!)
10.0~My word, Amelie. hello_amie Sign in Permalink I love this movie, with it's scenery, music and story. I haven't read any of the books in the trilogy, but I love the movies, all of the them. It's a movie that I think is going to be a classic trilogy. It makes me feel warm when I've seen it. The only bad thing about it for me is that it's to short. When you see this movie, you forget everything but this story. One of the many things I love about this movie is that it isn't so many things that they made digitally. I love the characters in the movie, the elves, the dwarfs, the men and the hobbits. I also like the orcs, the uruk-hais and the ringwraiths. But it's hard to really explain why it's such a great movie, you have to see it to understand it's greatness.
8.0~Mast movie friendshipbandmovie Sign in Permalink I love the movie and effects are totally realistic which made this movie more interesting
8.0~Hollywood dinmuhammadkhan Sign in Permalink Well, then that would be the difference between subjectively rating things by opinion or objectively rating them by points, or in the case of movies by Sales or bums on seats. In sports, the "best" or better teams can often lose just as the better movies can get less bums on seats than the dross. Hence mediocre teams can win cups. The real rarity is great films that put bums on seats. The "Best team wins" scenario and that is what I believe you have here. A great film that people went to see. There will always be people who are so desperate to be noticed and to be different that they will say the best films (objectively or subjectively) are crap or "over-rated". But that says more about them than the millions who think otherwise.
10.0~The Only Film Where The Audience Clapped At The End! Joel_Reed_85 Sign in Permalink The Dark Lord Sauron's forces have laid siege to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, in their efforts to eliminate the race of men once and for all. The once-great kingdom, watched over by a fading steward, has never been in more desperate need of its king. The main bulk of the story features Aragorn (Mortensen) trying to answer the call of his heritage and become what he was born to be! In no small measure, the fate of Middle-earth rests on his very broad shoulders. With the final battle joined and the legions of darkness gathering, Gandalf perfectly played yet again by McKellen urgently tries to rally Gondor's broken army to action. He is aided by Rohan's King Theoden (Hill), who unites his warriors for history's biggest test. This film is certainly worthy of an Oscar for Director Peter Jackson, whose creativity and energy for 7 years finally paid off with one of the best trilogies since 'The Godfather'. As the film progresses hopes rest with Frodo (Wood), a tiny but determined hobbit making a perilous trip across treacherous enemy lands to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. The closer Frodo gets to his final destination, the heavier his burden becomes and the more he must rely on Samwise Gamgee (Astin). Gollum-and the Ring itself-will test Frodo's allegiances and, ultimately, his humanity. "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" concludes the epic story of these characters, their relationships and rivalries, and reveals how through courage, commitment and determination even the least of us can change the world forever. The film is the only one I have ever seen that got a round of applause from all as it concluded and to hear the appreciation made it even more magical.
10.0~The "moment" for me: Eowyn (Miranda Otto) destroys the Witch King! markangela Sign in Permalink Gollum is super, very "tricksy" indeed! Sean Astin is all heart as Samwise Gamgee. Viggo Mortensens's honest dedication to Aragorn's humble leadership role is worthy of the trilogy's intent. Kudos to all of the actors for remaining a cohesive ensemble and the writers for keeping the storyline smooth and seamless. Clearly an artisan approach was taken by all involved with this film.
10.0~Legolas is a sexy beast! tattooedteenager Sign in Permalink Well, being that I was never that big of a LotR fan when it first came out two years ago, I must say that my slight obsession with Orlando Bloom got me to finally sit down and watch the first two movies...now of course after those I absolutely HAD to see the third. THIS MOVIE ROCKED MY SOCKS FROM HERE TO ALBERQUERQUE! This was one of the best movies I've EVER seen, other than the fact, of course that the ending seemed like it kept going. But I mean the battle scenes, Gimili, the slight humor that they even got in there, Gollum arguing with himself...it was just jawdropping and astounding. Mad props to Peter Jackson, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Taylor, Orlando Bloom, Ian McKellen and all the other outstanding actors that were in this series of movies. Bravo!
9.0~Beautiful Film LightDiamond Sign in Permalink Uno dei migliori film del suo genere se non il migliore!
10.0~Honest:.... ella-warman Sign in Permalink This film along with all of the 'The Lord of the Rings' Trilogy, are the most amazing films I have ever seen!!! I have also read the book and the ending could have stuck to it more (Spoiler?: Saruman dies at Bag End in the hands of Grima Wormtongue(The Shire is burnt and turned bad because of them)- a great scene) But still entirely excellent. I especially love the fact that Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) sings, and Billy Boyd (Peregrin/ Pippin Took)... All the actors and actresses are terrific, the film deserves the 11 Oscars that it received. I am a Peter Jackson fan and Tolkienite, all the books are brilliant and the films match them... Such a fan that I have the soundtracks!!! I want to thank also Howard Shore, The London Philharmonic Orchestra, Ben del Maestro, Renee Fleming, Sir James Galaway and Annie Lennox for the soundtrack... And to Enya, Sheila Chandra, Elizabeth Fraser and Emiliana Torrini for The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers soundtrack. I cried....many a time... All I can say is watch it... see for yourself :)
8.0~Great Trilogy ends 90% great, 10% weak CelluloidDog Sign in Permalink If you love visual effects and Middle Earth fantasy, this film is excellent. Casting, soundtrack, effects is awesome (the first really set the stage for the GREATEST adventure). For me Ian McKellan (Gandalf), Viggo Mortensen (Aragon) and Andy Sirkis (Gollum) were exceptional! The visual effects are stunning and it's fun to see orcs get slashed. We all have to wait a year to see each film which builds up the drama so maybe I was a bit disappointed by the ending which was ddddrrraaaawwwwnnn out. Great movies don't need long closure. They simply stand on their own. The last 20 minutes could have been condensed to 5 minutes. Just end with the coronation and Gandalf departing. Watching the hobbits go home and Sam getting married is anti-climatic like seeing an old Scarlett O'Hara in a rebuilt Tara surrounded by grandchildren. Or seeing an arthritic Lawrence of Arabia riding around a jeep in the end (doesn't a horse look better?). I feel the first, the Fellowship of the Ring was the best since it took time to develop a plot and characters and special effects were still terrific. There was suspense to the first movie which was absent in the last. I would have rated this movie a 8.5 or 9 but the last 15 minutes is a 3. That explains my 8 overall. I still really like most of the movie: I was just left a bit flat by the ending.
10.0~Return of the hollywood magic liearn Sign in Permalink I watched the first film not knowing what I was getting into. However I came out of the theatre feeling absolutely amazed with the film. It simply touched me, and the first time in my life, I had felt such strong emotions for a film. And the 2nd film made me got addicted to the trilogy. It got me to read the book and find out more about the writings of Tolkien. The Return of The King is a wonderful film. Peter Jackson blended the emotions of the characters so well with the battles of middle earth that you don't feel lost at all. Unlike other fantasy films, LOTR evokes such strong feelings amongst the audiences that you would feel like you are one of them - an elf, orc, treebeard, human, wizard or hobbit. The music suits the theme of the movie so well that it helps to liven up the whole battle scenes. I must say that Peter Jackson has done a superb job as a storyteller and a film-maker. Elijah Wood did a great job as Frodo. He looked really exhausted throughout the journey...and it looks really real. Good work, hollywood!
10.0~LOTR: The world's greatest literary achievement becomes the world's greatest cinematic achievement. jimmyd-4 Sign in Permalink Since my first reading of "The Hobbit," and the LOTR Trilogy, it's been my continuing belief that Tolkien's story of Middle Earth and its inhabitants is the greatest accomplishment in the history of English literature. Now, after seeing Peter Jackson's cinematic rendering of Tolkien's literary genius, I've decided that the three LOTR flicks, taken as a whole, is the greatest accomplishment in the history of world cinema.
2.0~Peter did a bad, bad thing gastronfo-1 Sign in Permalink The worst of the three parts, and one of the most overrated films in the history. Peter Jackson spends a lot of time with no sense battles in a three hour film that can't finish all the plots of the Trilogy. The film includes very horrible scenes like one with one horse rider who kills an giant elephant only with his sword, and one when the floor falls down in all the ways except where the heroes are standing. A good film for those who like the FX more than the script, and for the video games programmers, and a awful movie for those who loved The Fellowship of the ring, the first film of the PJ's personal vision about The Lord of The Ring
9.0~In all honesty, this movie was nearly flawless... green-c Sign in Permalink In my personal opinion, I think that this movie was definitely the best I have ever seen in my life. Seriously. Now I won't exaggerate, and say that it was absolutely perfect, as some would, but it was pretty close. Just a few facial expressions were a bit overdone, a few scenes, (EX:Frodo's ballerina dance for those who know what i'm talking about lol) that weren't meant to be funny but were. I will also admit that even though my favorite actor would be Orlando Bloom, everyone in the movie was outshone by Ian McKellin, who was absolutely amazing as Gandalf. The only one who came close was Viggo Mortenson, who also did a wonderful job. (Note: All the others were wonderful too, but these 2 stand out) All in all, a wonderful movie, worth watching again and again and again........
10.0~A fitting climax to the trilogy, made by fans for everyone p-keane Sign in Permalink They were never going to get the books onto the screen, but the richness of what Peter Jackson has achieved means that the films stand up as first rate movie experiences in themselves. Lovers of the books have had their dreams realized and even Tolkien haters are hard put to deny the skill and artistry of the movie making. The effects are groundbreaking and breathtaking, as are the settings and costumes in unprecedented quantity and quality. The performances are good and in cases (McKellen, Mortensen, Bean) inspired, but beyond this the Lord of the Rings trilogy is a triumph of story, the power of the sort of tales that Tolkien studied from the oral traditions of ancient European cultures. It is in telling and sustaining a magnificent tale that the film makers most honour the work of Tolkien, even where they have cut and elided.
10.0~Excellent movie but.... Xparanoid Sign in Permalink but... in the end of the movie when the hobbits arrive to the shire in the original book they encounter to the shire ruled by Saruman.. in my opinion its a total offense to the book and their fans because the fight between the hobbits and saruman his very important to the hobbits. They leave the shire being a cowards but when return they are totally changed in the sense of warrior spirit and courage. Anyway the movie is excellent.
10.0~Incredible & visually stunning Cliff van Ooststroom Sign in Permalink I just came back from a special viewing of The trilogy (1st, 2nd & special premiere of the 3rd movie) in Rotterdam and it was incredible. I sat in awe for 3 hours and 20 minutes and my jaw literally dropped when the big battle started. Never could I have imagined that someone could produce a battle of this magnitude on the silver screen. The big orcs (or whatever they were), the oliphaunts, but especially the nazgul with their terrible screaming were awesome. But the most important thing is that Peter Jackson put the story about friendship and unselfish sacrifice perfectly on celluloid (with many, many thanks to the script-writers). What a movie!!!! Thank you Peter!!!
7.0~Not as good as people say, still a fine film. Norway1 Sign in Permalink Certainly not the best of the three. That place still belongs to "Fellowship". And as much as I hate to agree with nay-sayers, I believe there were a few too many endings for a theatrical version. However, the good FAR outweigh the bad - redeem them even. The effects are absolutely top-notch and perhaps the best of all the films. The battle sequences were astounding! Best I've ever seen. START MINOR SPOILERS My biggest gripe is with the opening sequence with Smeagel and Deagel. Andy Serkis just played him like a mindless grinning goon. Instead of making Smeagel a little bit more "hobbit-like" with a normal speaking voice (not exactly the same as Gollums) and a more melancholy and serious side (not all child-smiles). END SPOILERS While I certainly agree that the film deserves some Oscars (but not director or film), I strongly disagree that Sean Astin, Andy Serkis or Viggo Mortensen deserve them for their acting. If anybody has earned a nomination for acting, it would be Ian McKellen and perhaps Elijah Wood. It felt almost like Mr. Jackson ran out of time editing and left stuff in that would have better found place in the Extended version. Still, this is an absolutely AMAZING movie. Perhaps I was just expecting too much. After first viewing, I give it 7 out of 10.
7.0~"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" is a feast for the eyes, with some other good qualities, but falls short of amazing patrick_dunne Sign in Permalink "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" is the final installment of the famous trilogy. It picks up where the second left off, wherever that may be- and where it is is the group approaching Mount Doom. Gandalf, Legolas, and all those other guys wander and find themselves in a war against Sauron. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam struggle with the Ring guided by the creature Gollum. The film is quite similar to the original. It's still style-over-substance. Frodo and Sam still are close friends. Merry and Pippin are the same way too. The ring still has to be returned to the mountain. Gollum still looks like a non-muscular version of Tarzan with that tiny little cloth he has on his waist. Yet, the story seems a bit different. Instead of another adventure film, Return of the King has a war in it, and has Sam and Frodo testing their bonds of friendship more than ever. The little drama that is has is good. No, it probably won't make you cry (though it did for some people) but it is, welltouching. Remember the ending for the original Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring? (SPOILER!!!) I thought it was "sweet" when Frodo was leaving in the boat and Sam jumps into the water and says "Of course you are; and I'm coming with you!" (END OF SPOILERS!!!) The film's high point is the special effects. Of course, Peter Jackson had a BIG budget for this movie, and it was made up because it was the second highest-grossing movie so far. (Next to Titanic) The audience is given spectacular eye-candy with the armies of orcs, and goblins and other various fantasy creatures. We are also treated to breath-taking detail of mostly everything, from the beautiful costumes to the engraved writing on the swords. We are also treated to some very awesome scenes where the camera positions itself high up to see the detailed landscape below- which is full of trees, grass, armies, animals and much more detail. Like the previous films, "Return of the King" is very long. It's over 200 minutes, and even more for the extended version. The ending seems to be the longest part of them all; because it feels five minutes longer then we really wanted. It really annoyed me when I first saw it, because it just wouldn't end! The beginning seemed a bit slow too. It took a long time before we even got to out main characters. If you remember the previous films, the group split up for some reason I can't remember. It's good that the characters vary a lot from how they look, what weapons they carry and what kind of creature they are. It would be hard to remember them if they weren't varied. The action is pretty good. With lots of sword-fighting and some other cool stuff, like Legolas killing a giant elephant-like creature. Of course, it's nothing like Jackie Chan's flips and karate moves. But, we are treated to a couple sword fights, although I think the action in the first was much better. The story takes no major twists or turns, and can be watched if you haven't seen the first two. As I said earlier, "Return of the King" is special effects; 100% breath-taking, proportioned, amazing, spectacular special effects and costumes. However, special effects, costumes and CGI only go so far. It displays the effects through camera work and for a long period of time. I suppose this movie must have been a spectacular treat in theaters, but it won't quite blow you away if you are seeing it for the first time on television. You will enjoy; I did. You will say "wow" at the special effects, but you will realize that there ARE better movies out there that don't rely so heavily on a budget. 8/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.
10.0~I felt every emotions in this movie! sopadas Sign in Permalink I was sad,happy,amazed,terrified and etc.This is the best end of a Trilogy ever made,it's simply a mind blowing experience in cinema.Much better than the end of Matrix,here i felt that all the story really ended.And with the DVD Extended Edition much will be complete.I have to congratulate WETA for their work in FX,they really did a remarkabull new different world and believable.I aplaude all members of the movie, especially Peter Jackson.You did it!May your work continue for a long time,and i will be watching every new movie you make!
10.0~Actors said it was good and that it WAS! Is there a bestter grade than an A+? How about a TRIPLE A? Sykora259517 Sign in Permalink Two reasons I went to see this in the theater this time; 1. waited for the other 2 on dvd, being so long & so i braved the 3+ hours because 2. the Actors said it was the best of the 3. and that it was the best of the three! This installment has pretty much all of the movie genres in one! There's more drama, a little horror (the spider and aragorn sees dead people) and this one has definately more humor than the first two put together! also this one was alot more emotional. Right when you're up, next scene might be a little down. Cheers galore throught the movie from my viewing room. Only one problem.... DON'T get any drink from the snack bar! For the girls that ONLY go to the movie to see Orlando Bloom... he's not in this one as much as the Two Towers. but still has a cool part. and the end definately makes it worth not seeing him as much through the movie. my grade?.. mm is there anything better than an A+ ? maybe a triple A ? my only thing is.. bring your own porta pottie! What the critics say: * The cinematic Epic of our time, the one by wich all others will be judged. The one film to end it all. -Los Angeles Times * The Jewel in the crown; the final chapter of 'the lord of the rings ' trilogy is the best of all. A triumph of epic story telling. It has spectacular action scenes & is by far the most moving - Newsweek * Third film vaults the work into the straosphere of classic movies -Usa Today and has already been nominated for 4 Golden Globes (tune in Jan 25th) for Best Picture Director Peter Jackson Original Score Howard Shore Original Song Anne Lennox (mm I wonder if that's the song.......) LONG live the king!
5.0~Best picture/director/editing? Please.... azacamis Sign in Permalink I watched all three just to see what the fuss LOTR is all about. Also it is only fair then to give a review. After watching ROTK, I have to ask again, what is all the fuss about? I have to admit, I did not read the book but it does not make me any less credible to give an opinion as I am movie lover and this is a review of a movie, not a book. Storyline aside, which I actually have no problem with, even though I don't find that interesting either, the trilogy is a series of badly made films. Acting by the main characters was terrible. Name me one part of acting that burns permanently in your mind as mind blowing. Worse of all, continuity was practically not a priority, which it should. Obviously, editing was done haphazardly. That is why the acting quality suffered badly. From one scene where the characters were sad, in just a few seconds they were back to happy. I have no arguments that it may be a hard film to make, considering the backdrop of the storyline or maybe how closely it tried followed the book but Jackson received far too much credit to be awarded by director. The makeup and costumes, the cinematography etc were awesome. That I will give all due credits but to be considered a best film is too generous. It is simply entertaining at best. The CGI was not that good and I have seen much better fight scenes in other films within the same capacity. I'm sorry, I tried to like these films (I watched all three even though I already did not like Fellowship) but I simply can't. Bad continuity, editing and acting puts me off.
4.0~Mediocre. Spoiled. bluebean Sign in Permalink Sure, the burning guy has all the time to travel from the burial chambers to the front of the large balcony. Convienently placed there is a gap so that he can jump without having to climb a fence or wall first. Whom are they kidding? What happened to Tolkiens precious prosa? The dialogue reminded me of a better B movie. What happened to Tolkiens story at all? Distorted. Raped. Stomped into the ground. It's a shame that one of the best books in the world ends up this way, hollywoodized to the max (though it's not from hollywood, but it would like to be). I think one of the problems stems from the fact that the first two parts - which I did like a lot - omitted so much of the storyline that the third pic had to be just what it is: an empty shell. An action movie. ugh. Brilliant visuals though. Made it at least bearable. I'll give the extended DVD release a try, and I hope it makes more sense.
3.0~Can I just say 'ouch'? kale854 Sign in Permalink I have been an avid LOTR fan for almost ten years now. I love love love love the books, but I really hated this movie. What Jackson did (and I'm surprised Phillipa or Christopher didn't call him out on it) was cut all the really important ending bits for sake of having disgustingly overblown battle sequences that made me want to kill myself. An hour is too long to be in battle, in a movie, I'm sorry. The CGI was amazing, and the deaths were good and all, but it didn't really help the story along. All it did was sit there. And we aren't even going to get into how much I hate Orlando Bloom. The fact that the scenes in the houses of healing were cut just pisses me off. Faramire and Eowyn deserved more than a glance during Aragorn's OMG SPIFFY coronation. They were the the link between Gondor and Rohan. They were actually quite major characters, and they were totally glossed over for the sake of some Oliphants falling over. Butchery? Yes, yes it is. And the endings. The endings weren't long enough. I know what you're thinking, "but... the ending dragged on and on with no sign of an end in sight until it actually ended", but seriously folks, don't give me that BS unless you've read the books as many times as I have (if you have, then by all means, give me that BS many people have read them more times then I have, but those people would agree with me) when Peter Jackson decided to use his "artistic" license to completely forget about half of the stuff in the books, he cheated people out of some seriously amazing story telling. The scouring of the Shire is what the whole trilogy is supposed to be about. It's about how Frodo leaves hating how much the hobbits take for granted in life, and then coming back, and helping to save them from something they have never before had the displeasure of meeting, and that is slavery. And then when they won their freedom back, they loved their heroes, and they celebrated them, and they were happy again, and they (hopefully) wouldn't take so much for granted again in the future. Okay, I'm getting myself upset, and I'll shut up. But seriously, all this movie is for is watching people run around and stab things. Not interesting to me.
4.0~A mediocre film for the masses Pigbelly Sign in Permalink This movie only makes the top 250 because the average movie goer was wowed by the nice digital effects and the nice (if somewhat boring) cinematography. However, this movie had no story just as so many critics have stated about Tolkien's trilogy (please check the reception history of Tolkien's novels if you don't believe me-- I teach English). Tolkien was a mediocre writer at best and this trilogy translates into a mediocre bore-fest. I have never seen more effort put into such a boring story. Tolkien's 3 tomes could have been summed up in about five paragraphs but it seems that Peter Jackson is just as long winded as JRR. These three films have about enough story material to make an interesting short film. Jorge Luis Borges would have been horrified to see such a travesty of pointless, long-winded storytelling.
10.0~Simply Brilliant! TheDuke-2 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has restored my faith in filmmaking once again, and has officially removed George Lucas from my memory :) While I could nitpick about a few minor issues of choice in his final editing for the movie, the "Epic" battle scenes and closure to this grand literary work more then make up for it. I sat through all three movies at the all-day "geek fest" so I could soak them all in to get a sense of scope for the movies. As a student of film, I had minor issues with some of his choices, but the fact that he made me love my cinematic experience again was shades of Lucas 77' when I was 6 years old seeing Star Wars for the first time. He deserves an Oscar for director at least, if not also for Picture. If we learned anything from the Annie Hall vs Star Wars issue of 77, then the Academy will allow Peter Jackson to go into the History books with a Trilogy that not only surpasses Star Wars, but that will inevitably become legendary for all-time.
6.0~Read the books instead eric-junk Sign in Permalink I can't believe this movie won so many Oscars. Sure it was technically sound and all but damn was it boring. This is one of the few movies I have been tempted to walk out of. The last movie I walked out of was Spawn if that gives you any idea how little I enjoyed this movie. Its not that I don't have the attention span, some of my favorite movies are "7 Samurai" and "The Great Escape". I think we have all been brainwashed or maybe just starved for a good fantasy movie to come along. Anyways, for all the technical achievements and production value I give it 6/10. Please don't make "The Hobbit".
10.0~No more words...it's perfect korn31910 Sign in Permalink After seeing "the Return of the King", I'm consider that "the Lord of the Rings" will never fade. It will be the all-time classic. Peter Jack used to be regarded as a great director after "Heavenly Creature". Now he has been the greatest director in the world. "The Return of the King" is as good as the other two. I give it 10/10.
10.0~What a Movie - Peter jackson you are the new George Lucas ! scott-265 Sign in Permalink I would have to say without a doubt that this movie is up there with the first 3 star Wars movies (i.e 1977, 1980, 1983) as the best films of all time. My only critisism if any would be that the extended edition was not on general release first as it has showed the Fellowship and the Two Towers as work of art. Its a shame they had to be shortened for cimema. Scott.
10.0~the lord of the rings: The Return of the king bberry-1 Sign in Permalink It's a really great masterpieces has a great story.the other two were great too.Peter Jackson is a great director you would say.You, I mat him one year ago at Hollywood. He said about his feeling of the movie.And he said that he think that movie did great and everyone will like it for generations and forever.After that,I started to work at the east Brunswick library to broadcast the channel three news.Anyway, the movie is like a really great action,drama,and adventure movie to watch.It's not like the first two movies, It's better than the other. So, for all you movie fans out there, I hope you have a great time on IMDb.com.
9.0~Best of them all spatulacity Sign in Permalink Just came back from the 12:10AM showing of Return of the King and I was very impressed. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because the music score didn't quite seem as well as the 1st movie, everything else was excellent. I can't believe its all over now, I guess have to find something else to obsess about.
10.0~I thought this film was fab cat_starcatcher Sign in Permalink 'Win a Date with Tad Hamilton' is undoubtedly a chick-flick and, yes, it's fairly predictable, but I would recommend it to anyone because it's a fantastic way to spend an hour and a half. It's impossible not to get caught up in the cheeriness of it all and smile along with the characters. Plus, much of the comedy is hilarious, especially Topher Grace's semi-cynical one-liners and Sean Hayes' spoilt moments. Also, you get to see both Topher Grace and Josh Duhamel topless. And chopping wood. 'Win a Date with Tad Hamilton' doesn't have a huge message to put across, nor does it have multi-million dollar special effects or incredibly famous actors, but it's what I would call a 'happy film'. If you're expecting a piece of ground-breaking drama you'll be sadly disappointed, because that isn't what this film is supposed to be. It's entertainment in the purest form possible, because it simply entertains you. I can see why this film might be susceptible to criticism about the plot - boy-meets-girl, girl-meets-other-boy, etc. - but I don't think that the acting and the script can be faulted. The film is funny and well-paced, with both physical and verbal comedy, attractive and cheerful leads and an overwhelming sense of happiness throughout. And I don't mind admitting that I laughed all the way through and cried at the end.
7.0~not that great jalacea Sign in Permalink I can't believe how many people gave this movie a 10! Alright, this movie has got a great cast, very good special effects and it's filmed on great locations. But there are just so many cliche's (is that how you spell it?) in this movie, it just p***ed me off. Every time some hero is just about being killed, a friend turns up and kills the Orc. Every single time! In the last part alone this happened about five times. A lot of the dialoges are very crappy, predictable and cliche. Many things are just plain copied from Braveheart (a movie that is a lot better than the LOTR movies). The great casting and special effects alone could not give this movie a 10! I gave it a 7. There are other movies that are much much better and more original than the LOTR movies that should deserve a higher rating. Once this Lord Of The Rings hype is over, I hope people will come to their sences. When you watch it on TV it's not great at all.
3.0~How can such a bad movie be awarded any credit!!! fUSEbURNER Sign in Permalink I lost more than three hours in my life watching this crap I'm really STUNNED of the ratings, the Oscars, and the millions of dollars this movie generated. The story: It was clear from the first part what is going to happen! no need to waste your money on two towers and the return of the king. The acting, to be fair, most of the cast held their own, but the problem was that the worst actor got the biggest share: Elijah Wood! come on! that puppy face might have worked when you were three, but here, it is really over used and not at all convincing. Pace: at the beginning its good, then it slows down until it reaches the snail speed at about two hours left to the movie ending. I mean...COME ON! was the last 40 minutes even necessary? Special effects: they are the only reason why I didn't give the movie 1 star. Directing: AN Oscar!!!! I'm surprised he didn't get a razzie! I mean come on, the pace was totally unrealistic, one universe, people are gathering troops and fighting then gathering some more then running then doing all sorts of stuff and fighting some more, and in a a parallel universe, the stupid Frodo is only climbing a mountain from beginning of the movie till the end! Another stupid thing was when he brought in children in some takes and shoot them from behind to show that they are Frodo and his midget friends, then in the next take a frontal view of Frodo and his gang, the scenes appeared really stupid and challenged how much a viewer can numb his mind. The director was NOT convincing. To be fair, it is a hard film to direct, but that should have made the lame Peter Jackson leave the task with someone more capable. All in all: crap.
9.0~Long ending, which keeps the story alive tsd-anb Sign in Permalink Of course it doesn't match the books - however! Its a great movie - nothing more! Being a big fan of the trilogy, i was scared watching this in theaters. But the movie encounters me within minutes. After all, the endings seem to be a bit long - many find it faulty, that the film has three endings, but anyhow: I think this keeps the story alive! In some good films I thought "Oh, it's ended" and got sad, which the ROTK made a bit longer to withstand. *spoiler* The scene where Frodo and Sam do the last effort to the "mount of doom" is sure to be the best scene ever appeared in a movie. The music and sound effects behind it make it such overwhelming, that I can not forget it!
10.0~I love this movie! adrianzurkov13 Sign in Permalink One of the best movie I have watched ever! Not once stopped my breath when I watching all 3 parts for the first time. I could not wait to get herring and the next.. I like it because it has used imaginative and beautiful places. I really like movies made by words. Especially when it comes to humanity and its survival! The beauty of nature is very well shown, and the evil forces of darkness. Moments in which people come together and trust each other are ostentation of goodness! Soon I have not seen a film like this, and I think that it is not made yet! Why? Ima very good producers and I am sure that soon something will come very impressive as "The Lord of the Rings"!
9.0~Obsessed katiefilipowicz Sign in Permalink Best fandom. I love it! All the movies in the series.
10.0~Fantastic! Lunagoddess Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies ever. I gave it a 10. Absolute must-see!!! It was a good end to the trilogy, and let you know what really happened at the end, instead of having one of those lame endings where you are left not knowing what really happened. It answered all the questions that you had in your head about the film.
10.0~Waiting for the SEE rock23 Sign in Permalink Hi there! This movie is awesome! Cant wait to get the film next year, with a lot of extra scenes, which weren't in the movie! THE BEST TRILOGY EVER!
6.0~Did anyone else find this movie lacking avery011 Sign in Permalink I saw the movie and found that while it may have been a good book, (I didn't read it, but most that did had good things to say about it.) it definitely lacked many things that make a good movie. The point of a good movie based on a book is that the movie can stand alone without the knowledge of the actual book text. Return of the King in my opinion has a very hard time doing that. Return of the King basically lacked the same direction as The Two Towers. In The Two Towers Aragorn came forward as the leader and hero and by the end of the movie you are looking forward to the next one so that you can see him go into battle once more. Did this happen? Nope. In the Return of the King we see Froto and Sam 2/4 of the movie (1/4 would have been ok because Froto has to destroy the ring, but his character makes no new developments so it makes the movie a sleeper at parts). Then we see Meriadoc and Pippen along with Eowyn and a few other side characters. In the first and second movie these characters didn't even build to the climax of the movie. Eowyn seemed to be intrigued by Aragorn in the Two Towers, this disappears in the Return of the King and we are left with her and one of the halflings going into battle. So the should-be subplot characters take up another 1/4 of the movie. That leaves only 1/4 (very possibly less) of the movie dedicated to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. I don't know about the rest of you but I felt ripped off when I walked out of the movie expecting to see my heroes from The Two Towers fight again and instead get 2 and a half hours of halflings fighting for humanity instead of seeing Aragorn do it. I was disappointed.
10.0~Fantastic kabirasif Sign in Permalink Watched this so many times in the cinema. Now it's 2019 and I can still watch again and again. This is my favourite film of all time.
10.0~The greatest trilogy to-date Matrix99 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings is the greatest trilogy to date. IMDB is a very popular website which gather a large number of registered users voters. As of today, the vote of top 250 movies by the registered users are Top 4: Return of the King, Top 5: The Two Towers, Top 7: Fellowship of the Rings. All the trilogy for the LOTR are in the IMDB top 250 list. Against all odds, the rating is higher for every sequel and if you check on the list like Star Wars, GodFather trilogy. None of them reach that standard. Peter Jackson will have a hard act to follow after his success of the LOTR movies. All his following movies will always be compare to this benchmark. He must be honored with Oscars him for Best Picture and Best Director for the Return of the Kings (Not just for this movie, but for the trilogy). The effort to film all three films at one go in spite of the risk involved if the first film may flopped in the Box Office. This is indeed like the Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom.
10.0~Yay! DogbertIncarnate Sign in Permalink Saw a screening of the movie on the 15th, and it was incredible - 3 1/2 hours of payoff from the first two movies. It strayed a little from the book (No Scourign of the shire, no faramir and eowyn wedding, frodo sends sam away before they get to shelob's, etc.) but it just felt soo right. basically, if you liked the first two movies, you'll like this more. if you hated the first two movies, you probably won't like this, but you might like it a bit better. it has more and better action, but also more and better character development, mainly with eowyn, faramir, the hobbits (sam, pippin, and merry) and gollum.
10.0~Still Speechless impetenurnot Sign in Permalink This gives more than sufficient closure to a timeless epic. Imagery that is used to protray action from the book is nothing less than remarkable. With intensive dialog and dramatic and appropriate effects the movie is stunning and every minute is filled. It was well entertaining for both those who read the books and those that have not.
5.0~Too much of most of it mucronate Sign in Permalink I have the impression the LOTR trilogy is in the same category as Matrix and others like them. A first movie is made to set a standard, but subsequent movies are not able to live up to the first. Such was my impressions from watching this third installment of the LOTR trilogy. I really wanted to like this movie. This was when all would come to an end. When the story would be wrapped up, and all come to a conclusion. For me, this movie missed its mark with a couple of yards. But wait, there are nice things to say too. The scenery was good, and nature gave an overall impression of vastness and divergence of a country in turmoil. From the green fiends of Shire to the dark lands of Mordor. From there things started to go downhill. I have seen plenty of movies being able to tell twice the amount of feeling in merely half the time of LOTR. The pacing is uneven, and many many loose ends hang from the story. No, I do not want to wait for the four hour plus DVD edition to see what becomes of i.e Saruman, I wanted to see conclusions, but in many cases all I get is a bunch of question marks. All I can say about the acting was that it was meager, hidden behind layers upon layers of CGI. Today I hear people hail the detailing of Gollum as the best CGI ever, and he is quite impressive, but nevertheless obviously computer made. If not for the voicing of Serkins, Gollum would be long forgotten in a couple of weeks. The CGI way too often shades the underdevelopment of the story. For example, when the heat of the battle actually gets tense and interesting, and when we see reinforcements come to aid in still hopelessly outnumbered forces, all of a sudden the tension is gone. It is all wrapped up in the same way the battle of Helms Deep in The Two Towers, leaving me only with a "Hey, what happened!?". CGI can enhance elements in a movie, but it can never be all there is, as it does in the LOTR trilogy, escalating by each movie. Characters are quite two dimensional. No development takes place, and treating the royal son of Glóin as a slapstick-one-liner-sidekick only serves to disappoint me. Best movie ever? Well, no! It is an Ok action flick, but with better pacing, better acting, and better story telling, this could have been THE movie. As for epic battles, I would prefer Spartacus anytime, without even a touch of CGI, but still extremely tense and impressive. I feel robbed of an experience. In my book, this gets a 5 out of 10. In visuals it is astounding. In everything else it falls rather short of lots of other movies. Too bad. I really wanted to like this one.
8.0~Masterful effects and good direction saffell Sign in Permalink * May contain spoilers * After seeing this film, I was very pleased. The acting was decent enough, the effects were great, and the plot was well thought out. My only qualms were various discrepancies from the books, directorial decisions, and the occasional hokiness of the acting. After I while watching the Lord of the Rings movies, I've begun to feel that the only real men in the world have long hair, lots of facial hair, are about 6'3", and speak like prize-winning orators all the time. None of this detracted from the movie at all. In fact, it made it more somber in some ways. But for the amazing amount of people who haven't read the books (which I discovered was a very large amount indeed), the movies may seem darker than meant to be. For instance, Denethor and Faramir concerning Denethor's insanity, that seemed absolutely unexplained in the movie. The book would explain how Denethor's possession of a palantir had driven him mad after excessive viewings of Sauron's armies, etc. The footage needed to explain this would have been seconds at most with few cuts, and I felt that the directorial decision to cut it in order to add lengthy endings was a poor call. You can't win them all, I suppose, but it's nice to dream. Otherwise, the movie on its own was phenomenal and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I recommend it to all, but be prepared for some slight disappointments if you have read the books.
6.0~The quest concludes and is followed by an epic epilogue hadganraend Sign in Permalink After the victories at Helm's Deep and Isengard, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli reunite with Merry and Pippin. Pippin pulls a dumb and forces Gandalf to act before he is ready and takes Pippin to Minas Tirith while Theoden musters the Rohirrim to ride in defense of the city. There's a big battle, Theoden dies bravely, Denethor dies crazy, Eowyn stabs an ancient, unkillable ghost in the face and Aragorn goes full necromancer and summons an army of the undead. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam and Gollum make their way through the Morgul Vale and are narrowly missed by the residents of the dead city of Minas Morgul as they march to assault Minas Tirith. They then climb a nearly vertical staircase that goes up the side of a mountain and meet an arachnophobe's nightmare. Frodo gets captured, then rescued by Sam. Then the final push begins to end the quest in favor of the Free People of Middle Earth. This movie, in technical quality, lies between the previous two. The acting improved, but mainly because Elijah Wood and Sean Astin didn't talk as much. There was a lot to pack into this movie, but it was handled better than in Two Towers. The battle sequences were great and in a running theme of the series, the landscapes were stunning. Probably my biggest problem with the movie is the pacing. While the volume of information was presented better than Two Towers, it was still a lot to pack in and the movie had to move too fast to pack all the information in. Contrast to this, after the climax of the film, the pace slows to a crawl with a particular scene that comes off as somewhere between uncomfortably and comically creepy. The acting also suffered in this movie, but again, not nearly as bad as Two Towers. The accents and forced attitudes are there, but there's one point where Frodo "flops" so comically that it breaks suspension of disbelief badly. In all, the series is worth watching if you are uninterested in reading the massive book or you like fantasy in general.
10.0~The best trilogy ever. George199927 Sign in Permalink This trilogy feeds me . Excellent series of J.R.R Tolkien.
10.0~One of the best movies ever ahmadtahan94 Sign in Permalink This movie is one of the best movies I've ever watched. Since I watched it for the first time, I keep watching it again and again every three months or so. The director has made a great job although at the year 2000-2003 there was much less equipment and gear to use to film. The film is very smart,and thrilling! When I keep on re-watching it, I always have the same enthusiasm and the thrilling feeling despite that I know what's gonna happen. I like it how they use some technical stuff that made the experience of the movie much more better, without us noticing. The story is very interesting and it reflects what really happens deep within every person when s/he is submitted to such power; one can only use power for the good or the bad, and must know how to really not harm all the people around him while using it. It's not a simple thing to do.
10.0~Oh my God, what an awful film. I lost my will to live!!! alex-c-3 Sign in Permalink Oh my God! I can not believe someone vote high for this piece of junk . Return of the king is so boring and long. And long. And long. And Peter Jackson is a fat man (OK, not anymore) who can not make a decent movie under ten hours length. Please, if someone could explain me why this movie was worth seeing it, i will quit my job. Someone watched Clerks 2? Pretty good explanation was given by Randal."Three movies people walk through a volcano . Even the trees walked in those movies". The battle scenes were OK. Sort of. If there wasn't for Aragorn, Gimlie, a pretty girl called Legolas and the others creatures among "good" guys,there will be some action to watch. Because of all things i red about Lord 3,I'll give it the highest grade just because i don't want anyone to cry if the average grade went down.
10.0~a perfect end zak420 Sign in Permalink A perfect end to a perfect trilogy. Peter Jackson did the book every bit of justice, even when charged with the task of keeping the movie under 3.5hrs :) After seeing the Fellowship 3 years ago, I dove into the origional books, and wasn't even concerned with the missing scenes from the movie(s). What was shown fit in with the other two movies to a tee. I'm glad I'm not in the "star wars" generation. 'cause LoTR pwns luke skywalker and his freaky father.
10.0~Wow. aggie_knight Sign in Permalink Unlike previous letdowns this year, Return of the King was excellent. A perfect 10. Coming in at 3 and a half hours, the movie is really long...but until the last 20 minutes you really don't know. The plot, acting, effects, and story keep people glued to their seat the entire time. Sean Astin deserve atleast a nod, if the statue as Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Elijah Wood could recieve a nod for Best Actor. This movie will definately win Best Effects, Best Musical Score, and could win Best Movie this year at the Oscars. It was that good. You should go see it, right now. Stop staring at the computer screen and go. This movie is that good.
10.0~good movie Jiwakacau_4667 Sign in Permalink The best sci fic movie. good graphic. i want more movie like this.
10.0~Greatest movie of all time coolaznthaidude Sign in Permalink Some people are a bit hesitant to watch this movie due to the length of it and the tendency for the first movie to drag on a bit, but even if you found the first 2 movies to be a bit boring for your taste you should by no means hesitate to watch this movie. The Return of the King is the most beautifully made movie, every piece of the movie from the story, to the action, to the visual effects, to the acting is just absolutely stunning. I have personally been looking for movies that can provide the same experience that this movie provides, and there is clearly no match. The movie concludes the Lord of the Rings series showing everyone's final push to end the reign of Sauron. The movie starts off with the story of how Gollum came to be which if you ask me has been long overdue but a great addition. The movie then continues to show the struggle Frodo is having bearing the influence of the ring, and Sam continues to show his support for Frodo despite Gollum's attempts to undermine Sam and trick Frodo. The rest of the cast find out that Sauron has plans to destroy Gondor and each contribute a role to stop Sauron's army. The movie continues to drag you to the edge of your seat, when i first saw it I wished that the movie wouldn't end but when it did it left a satisfying bittersweet feeling for those who followed Frodo from the Shire in the beginning. If you haven't watched it put it on your list you won't regret it.
10.0~Peter Jackson, The Visionary windfireglory Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson definitely had the vision for the Lord of the Rings series. I can only hope and dream he'll continue the awesome work in no less than The Hobbit, and even better, a continuation into the unfinished works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Like many, I've seen way more movies than I could possibly recount, but these by far have been the most superb, most excellent, most life-impacting movies I've ever seen. Nobody in Hollywood brings Resolution like Peter Jackson brought it in Return of the King. I hope it supersedes EVERYTHING else to date in sales and that people pass it along to their children for generations to come. Bless YOU, Peter Jackson, for sparing not one ounce of blood, sweat, and tears to bring the vision to pass! Yes and Amen! Forget five stars. These movies together were a billion stars!!!!!
9.0~The Legend Movie Imdbproooooooo001111 Sign in Permalink One Of The Best Movie, this is a film that is very suitable to arouse curiosity
9.0~My impression after 3 viewings: nerettyksduredro Sign in Permalink After seeing this film three times, I think I am ready to write a thorough review of it. I will start by writing that the first time I saw it, was the best, as I didn´t know (exactly) what was going to happen. I had read the book, so I knew the basic story, but didn´t know what possible changes they had made. The first time, on an excitement level of 1 to 3, I had a clear 3 almost to the words THE END. The second time, it dropped to 1, as some of the films shortcomings became clear to me. On the third viewing, it stabilised on a 2. Now, the following contains *SPOILERS*: The film starts off with the New Line Cinema logo, accompanied by a few bars of beautiful music that reminded me of Swan Lake. Then there is a flashback of Smeagol killing his cousin Deagol when he finds The One Ring on a fishing trip, as depicted in the book. In part, this sequense sums up the whole film: There are some powerful moments about the power of The One Ring, some unnecessarily slow moments, it could have been edited more tightly, and in the end, it goes on for too long. It also has some overdone horror-film-like moments, as it depicts Smeagol deteriorating into Gollum, but that can´t be compared to the rest of the film. And the whole thing seems like a tribute to actor Andy Serkis, who gets to be in it with his everyday face. A tribute he truly deserves for his brilliant work to bring Gollum to life, voice, movement and all, but come on, this was the start of the big K, the final film of the Big Trilogy, the one we have all been waiting for. There was no way they could screw it up, was there? Oh yes they could, precious-s, yes they could. Then we are back with Frodo, Sam and Gollum, who are about to enter the secret path to Mordor, accompanied by some modified "walking out of the Shire"-music. The music throughout the film is excellent, although it sometimes sounds like a potpourri of tunes from the two previous films, but there are plenty of new music here, too. Howard Shore has finished his work on the trilogy with honours. As for the rest of the film, there are some scenes that seems to go on for too long, the way they are usually seen in the Extended DVD, but now they are here in the theatrical release. One example is an early scene in Edoras, with Merry and Pippin dancing and singing on a table. I thought Peter Jackson had learned from the first film that such scenes should be avoided like plague, because it is embarrassing sh**, or alternatively be left to the Extended Version. But here it is, in all its inglorious glory. Throughout the film, there are lots of scenes I think they should have edited more tightly, cheesy acting moments like Gandalf telling Pippin: - We are now entering the rhealm of Gondor, when they are crossing a river on Shadowfax. Instead they could have filled in the running time by adding scenes with Saruman, at least Gandalf casting from the Order of the Istari. I am beginning to learn Jacksons techniques now, and I bet that in the Extended Version, he will slip in something with Saruman, with the palantir being dropped and all, right before Pippin jumps into the water to pick it up at Isengard early on here. Also, they should have added something with Faramir after he was saved from being burned alive by Denethor. And maybe some more scenes between Faramir and Pippin to make me understand why he had to drag Gandalf away in the middle of a battle, why it was such a big deal. And worst of all, they didn´t keep the duel between Gandalf and the Witch King of Angmar. In my opinion that is unforgiveable, but worst of all, they should have left the following dialogue to the Extended Version, too: Gandalf: - The enemys worst weapon is yet to be seen blablabla the Witch King of Angmar, head of the Nazgul leads them in battle. Pig-faced orc who seems to be second in command to Witch King later: - What about the White Wizard? Witch King: - I will crush him! Something like that. But here it is in theatrical release, and nothing happens. In fact, the Witch King and the other Nazgul do no harm whatsoever during this film, that is left to the Fell Beasts they ride on. The only thing the Witch King crushes, is Eowyns shield. I don´t know why Jackson didn´t do anything about this, but here it is. I know that the duel scene has been filmed, because I have seen a production shot of Gandalf riding towards the Witch King inside Minas Tirith, with Pippin behind him, it will show up in the Extended Version, mark my words, BUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE! Another problem with this film, is that Jackson has said that this will be his trophy for all his hard work on the trilogy. Fair enough, he (sort of)deserves it, but it looks like parts of the film have been made for his own pleasure, rather than for the average moviegoer. Examples are his cameo as a hippie-like pirate on one of the pirate-ships, and the appearance of the Haradrim. The first time I saw it, the latter was absolutely awesome, but the two other times, it seemed more goofy. The main reason was the overly caricatured southrons who were guiding the Mumakil. I have seen other comments by people who were disgusted by that, and I agree. Also, the director seems to be afraid of letting the grandeur overshadow the fact that he was once a director of improvised, low-budget splatterfilms like Bad Taste. That pig-faced orc who is second in command to the Witch King and his gap-toothed friends look like one of the funny aliens in that film. The question is: Was Sauron short of personnel? It doesn´t look that way, but did he really make that idiotic orc a high_ranking officer, considering all the ghastly creatures on show here? Sauron himself died on post as a lighthousekeeper, so he can´t answer. Was that all that he was? All that is not to say that about 170 minutes of this film is not the definition of a grand epic, with battle-scenes of the never-before-seen kind, because it is. In my opinion, they could have cut the running-time with about 30 mins, added about 10 mins of details from the book (Gandalf finding Denethors palantir comes to mind), and they could have gotten a standard 180 minutes movie. About 15 minutes could have been chopped from the end, which Peter Jackson turns into a never-ending Hobbit Soap Opera. Seriously, this part of the film is the deadest piece of filmed material I have ever seen. They might as well have put a camera on the deserted plain of Gorgoroth, and filmed it for 15 mins. When Frodo does a voice over while in Bag End, I thought about that voice saying: - Blablablabla...so are the Days of Our (Hobbit?-) Lives. I was pleased when I read that The Scouring of the Shire-part had been cut from the film, because I knew it would be an anticlimax, but instead, Peter Jackson goes ahead and makes his own anticlimax. Anyone better? The whole deadness thing starts about when Saurons tower is destroyed, and Frodo and Sam ends up on a rock-island in the lava. Frodo then wakes up after they are taken away by eagles in a Garden of Eden-like place, and Samwise stands there, giving him a look that indicates that they had just taken part in the gay pride parade. The coronation sequense is a slight upturn, but then they are back in the good old Shire, and everything that happens gives watching paint dry competition in the boring stakes. Finally, after Frodo has sailed away with the elves, Sam walks into his hobbit-hole, and the pain is over. Lets check the title again: It was THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING, NOT: THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE HOBBIT TO HIS HOLE. I believe that it is a shame that such a great, final film of a trilogy should be ruined by such a dead end, because movies are judged as a whole. The worst disappointment is that the filmmakers had the resources - detailed source-material, big budget, good actors and SFX-people, to make a film that could keep you, the moviegoer thrilled from the first to the last minute on repetitive viewings, but they failed because of sloppy editing, bad choices and a self-indulgent director.
7.0~It's above average, but I just thought Two Towers was a better movie WakenPayne Sign in Permalink I have finally finished sitting down and watching all the Peter Jackson Lord Of The Rings movies. I think they're okay I mean my main problem with Fellowship was that Frodo did get himself into peril one too many times but for a movie to basically be set-up to plot, characters and also Middle-Earth... It's actually pretty good, even if I find it overrated. The second one, this one is in my opinion the best of the series, we saw more of Middle Earth and thus saw exactly what would happen if the heroes didn't win and also, I liked the story a lot more than I did with it and with this?... Is it okay if I say I didn't think it was deserving of 11 Oscars? The plot is that everything has come full circle, Frodo, Sam and Gollem are making their way into Mordor and Aragorn, Gandalf and the rest re-unite with the comedic relief elves and they go and find another human kingdom to defend called Gondor but the King doesn't want them to because his son died in the first movie (I didn't see his motivation nor was it made very clear). So he must be convinced to ally with the other human kingdom and after they fend off Sauron's army they must draw the Eye of Sauron away from gazing to Frodo and Sam finally climbing up the mountain and throwing the ring away. There are quite a few complaints with this one. I felt that Sauroman should have been on camera to get killed off at least in the opening scene or something - He was last seen having his army on the brink of defeat and... He's nowhere in this one. I also think (like most people) there is a half hours worth of scenes where you can just as easily cut to the credits. I counted around 6 of them. Point is, after 2½ hours devoting another half hour to the ending is a little bit much. Aside from that the King of Gondor in this movie... I'm really sorry but, I think he did a bad performance. He's meant to be grieving over his son's death which somehow turns him bad and he refuses to help his people from certain death... If the actor handled it correctly - That would have been a much more interesting character. But all the time he frowns while looking evil almost like I say to myself "gee! I wonder who the villain is". Okay, now onto what I liked, there is a lot to talk about with this, well the effects for their time hold up really well and the action scenes are a lot better than in the first 2. I also think that the acting is pretty good and at times I did find the plot to be interesting and I did find the characters to be interesting. And the design for Gondor, I know some people might have already said this but it is really good to look at especially fun to look at from a distance, seeing the entire City. So if you have seen the first 2 movies it would only make sense to see this one if you enjoyed them. I think at the end of the day it has a lot to offer people if they're die-hard fans or just people curious about what is considered to be the best fantasy movies of all time. I'd say if you aren't either one of those 2, just be on the safe side and watch Fellowship, see if you like that and continue on from there.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings nenas888 Sign in Permalink The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.
10.0~Extremely stimulating scenarios with superb behind the scenes technical effort. gastaoguedesfontes Sign in Permalink Extremely stimulating scenarios with superb behind the scenes technical effort. Undoubtedly one if the deepest approaches of an extraordinary collection of books. Almost to esoteric, but relatable to the masses.
10.0~Things I love... Nice_Purse Sign in Permalink I love cinema, I love Mr. Jackson, I love Extended DVDs and I love New Line. Now that the trilogy is over, I will at last be free to actively seek a girlfriend and rediscover the many faceted social life I've been patiently ignoring for the better part of this century...
10.0~An Achievement Worth Recognizing!!!!!!!! DartH-Hobbit Sign in Permalink Return of the King was INCREDIBLE!!!!!! I love it! I just got back from seeing it and it is the best of the three!! The Army of the Dead is awesome! I love the battle of Pellenor Fields. Gondor was just as I imagined it...breathtaking on a grand scale and I just couldn't bring myself to cry at the end. Shelob is FREAKY!!! She was perfect, a giant tarantula! Sam's fight with her was, like the definition of the word "Wow," loved it all the way to the end. Must see for die hards, and as a die hard, I was just, awe inspired. All my hopes were fulfilled, except no Scouring of the Shire and no Saruman, of course. The ending is so moving I won't tell you about it. Must see this immediately. I can't wait to go again!
8.0~Fantasy at its finest joeravioli Sign in Permalink The final chapter of Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a fitting, if overlong send-off to the characters and story that have by now become legendary works, both in literature and cinema. It encapsulates all that was good --and to a lesser extent, all that wasn't so good -- about the first two films and amplifies it with gleeful abandon. Although fans of the original two may be slightly bothered by the final film's extravagance, it is necessary given that any less would be seen as a step down from the mounting visual and technical brilliance embodied by the first two. One cannot deny that The Return of the King is a technical masterpiece, but some of its subplots unnecessarily supersede the more important plot: that of Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Many of them -- especially the Arwen/Aragorn subplot, which is as forgettable as can be -- reek with a pungent silliness, mostly due to their inability to tell a complete story without resorting to blunt dialogue. Although this spares us another hour or two tacked on the running time, it reduces the overall effect. This film shows a definite shift in focus from Frodo and Sam to Aragorn, Rohan, and Minas Tirith, morphing from an adventure film into a tense political drama of alliances, war, and of course, impending destruction. The first half of the film (not much unlike Jackson's Battle of the Five Armies, which I will not speak of again) is presented as buildup for the second. Preparations for war are made, alliances are formed, and then, WAR. Upon witnessing the first act of the Siege of Minas Tirith, I knew that I was in for an entirely new experience. In the Two Towers and The Fellowship of the Ring, death was treated with dignity and restraint, but as we see by the Orcs' initial fear-mongering tactic -- showering Minas Tirith with the body parts of prisoners (many of which are shown in bloody detail) -- this is to be no such war. It is a bloody, extremely long, extremely violent war, complete with flying bodies, decapitations, elephants which crush riders underfoot and burning bodies alive. Although it is pure and gleeful spectacle, it is up to the viewer to decide whether or not it is worth all the death they are forced to sit through. The climax of the film makes it all worth it. It was so triumphant, magnificent, and powerful that I could not help but shed a few hapless tears. You really get a sense of the scope of Frodo's quest, and his beautiful relationship with Sam. Tolkien excelled at interjecting violence, darkness and despair with brief moments of friendship, hope, and love. Jackson encapsulates this perfectly. Seldom have I seen a film that embraces its literary roots with such fervent admiration, and while that alone is admirable, it is amplified by the fact that the film is actually good. Sure, it's silly and filled with Deus Ex Machina, but it's a beautiful, rousing sort of silliness that will live on for decades to come.
10.0~Wonderful ending to the hobbit's journey(spoilers) Chibijoey Sign in Permalink If you want a movie that has love,war,comedy,and friendship, then this is the movie for you. This has everything. I would recommend for people like 12 and up. It got some violent scenes because of the battles and the fight scenes. But for all those romantics out there, Sam gets married and Arwin (Liv tyler) get together with her king. Sam also starts a family which is nice in bag end. Eowyn shows the audience that even a women can fight. It was nice to see the friendship between Eowyn and Merry. Don't depend on smegol to help the hobbits all the way to end. This movie ties up all loose ends. In ending, you have the typical ship sailing into the sunset but it is a beautiful ending. In less, you don't like movie with loud war scenes, you should go and see it. I give in four stars.
10.0~Incredible Dalna Sign in Permalink This movie, and indeed all the Lord of the Rings movies, is the best that I have ever seen. In fact, I wouldn't consider this a movie, because generally when I watch a movie it's just entertainment for me, not something to be remembered and thought of long after I've watched it. This masterpiece of film-making, this beautiful, moving, incredible conclusion to a trilogy which held me in amazement from the battle at the plains of Gorgoroth to the Ringbearers passing at the Grey Havens, is perhaps the best adaptation of a book, ever. If you are perhaps reading this comment having not seen the movies, buy them and watch them, now. The best way to watch them is not one after another, quickly, without time to reflect on each one, but one evening after another, with time to appreciate and understand Tolkien's masterpiece. I've seen the comments on this movie, few as they are, which nearly all say that they loved the books and hated the movies, giving various reasons as to why. I'll give you a few examples. 1. The characters weren't developed at all. I'm sorry? The actors and actresses from the movies were all incredible, doing what they were best at amazingly well. Ian McKellen, the actor who played Gandalf, does one of perhaps the best performances I've ever seen. Elijah Wood, as Frodo, understands the effect the Ring has on the hobbit and shows that knowledge to create a moving performance of an individual struggling against a power that is too great to bear. I could go on, but it's not necessary. Every single character in that film is as well developed as anyone would be in real life. 2. The Scouring of the Shire was not shown. I can give a completely logical explanation for this. In the book, near to the end of ROTK, Frodo and Sam destroy the Ring and Sauron and all evil is defeated. The hobbits, weary of all their adventures and sorrows, return home to find that Saruman and Wormtongue have taken over the Shire, and are forced to defeat them as well. Now, to me and most other people that have read the books, this is seen as a huge anticlimax. Think about it in movie form. The audience, having watched an amazing three hours of film, are now ready for the end. Then suddenly Saruman pops out of nowhere and has almost ruined the Shire. In the books this is acceptable, because it shows that evil can come to the most good of places. But this has already been shown many times in other parts of the book, like Lothlorien, Fangorn, and Ithilien, to some extent. 3. Too much CGI. I can answer this criticism fairly quickly. Imagine if there was little or no CGI in the Lord of the Rings movies. All it would be would be close up shots of the actors and places, with maybe a few actors in prosthetic makeup. This would never give the sense of scale necessary for the books. For the places and things Tolkien describes, you need CGI, and I cannot see how anyone could possibly criticise that. 4. Not true to the books SO WHAT? Any movie that you see that is based on a book is never, and I repeat never, completely and utterly true to the book. Peter Jackson took these masterpieces of literature and turned them into masterpieces of film-making, and people who say they weren't true to the books are sometimes right, but the films must be seen as works of art in their own right. Actually, the love story between Aragorn and Arwen is used in the movies and fitted in perfectly with the rest, whereas Tolkien put this in the appendices. There aren't other any major criticisms that I can find, apart from petty things like "they sucked" and "I walked out 30 minutes before the end". These comments are not worthy of argument mainly because they are made by people that probably have never seen the sun. Sorry about that, but it had to be said. Still, there are just some people who don't like fantasy, and don't like these films. Fine! I can respect that. But really these films aren't just fantasy. They're a story that has enchanted generations, a tale of war, peace, beauty, good, evil, friendship, hope, fear and love, that would work in any genre. I challenge any film-maker to surpass these films ever again, and I'm sure that in fifty years these films will still be popular, with people watching them in goggles in 3D blu-ray. Just speculating! Anyway, for me these films are incredible. Nothing more to be said.
10.0~Has anyone heard of the "Star Wars" trilogy? taylorann1 Sign in Permalink I went to the midnight showing. Despite being exhausted as I dealt with ninety 5th graders the following morning, I couldn't help but think that I was a part of something. Despite the ending, which I felt dragged a bit, the overall movie was a masterpiece. The trilogy was fantastic and I can't wait to watch all three in succession, but each movie stands on its own as a great story. Let's hope that Peter Jackson gets a crack at one of the Harry Potters. As for the "Star Wars" comment, I love those movies. But I will introduce my children to Tolkien and Jackson, in that order, as great books translated into great movies stand the test of time.
10.0~Fantastic film. A MUST SEE !! rheller401-2 Sign in Permalink I was throughly engrossed by this magnificent epic and was actually glued to my seat for the entire length of the film! Even though there were three endings, I didn't want to say good bye to the fantastic group of characters that I had come to care about. I look forward to seeing it again.
10.0~Truly the way to end the legend of the ring venom_369 Sign in Permalink I watched the Return of the King yesterday and have concluded that this is the best movie since probably the Godfather and Shawshank redemption... WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!! The Return of the King starts with a very serene flashback...of how Smeagol gets the Ring. From then on it goes back to the present story which is (if you live on the moon and don't know) a quest to destroy an ancient artifact that has the essence of the Ultimate baddie SAURON!...In this movie,the end of the series,our main character, Frodo,a hobbit(a small humanoid country bumpkin) tries to complete his quest to destroy the Ring and end evil for ever.Also the humans have to protect themselves from getting there asses kicked big time by our villain's army. Anyway, I must say Peter Jackson is a brilliant director. The lighting, the shades of colour..the battle scenes all unbelievable:exciting and involving...The music is enchanting;helping with indeed creating the atmosphere. Whether its hope,love or despair. The acting is top notch with you really seeing what the characters feel. Especially the scenes when they are fighting.You really despair.Despite being such a gem of a movie...there were some things that were left out at the end...READ THE BOOK TO FIND OUT WHAT I MEAN!...and I feel that ending sequences had 2 many false endings like when they fade out and come back with a different scene...And the very last scene was unnecessary perhaps a write up would have been nice. A totally engaging movie, The return of the king will keep you glued to screen. If this doesn't win at least 3 Oscars(best director,best actor(Andy Serkis:Gollum) and best picture), I'm putting an axe thru the television. 9.5/10 is my rating(the -0.5 for the endings and other mistakes)
1.0~how can THIS get 11 Oscars?? iwao Sign in Permalink i don't get the point with all that:11 Oscars, 9/10 on IMDb.. but WHAT? this is sensed to be something artistic? some postal card landscapes and ridiculous one liners, damn try-to-be intelligent scenes about loyalty and all... there is NOTHING in this movie nor in the two others that can let me say it is a good movie. no plot, no acting, no directing. there is nothing in this movie, and i don't post that to provoke reactions. i truly think it and i don't understand to be so isolated with this point of view. There are well done heroic fantasy movies, like Conan the barbarian, that are seen like average movies and THIS is put on a podium... i hope i'm not the only one it makes wanna puke...
1.0~Great views, few thoughts svetaaniston Sign in Permalink Well, this movie is not for people who like subtlety. Not for people who like good dialogues. Not for people who like interesting characters. It is for people who love action, action, and nothing much else. For people who love pompous battles on big screens, hollow words, rhetorics of of the kind great dictators are so fond of, big words like 'today mankind will not fail'. Sure, I can see why people like this movie. They are just easily pleased. They see a big battle-scene and they're happy. They see orcs, orcs, and still more orcs, and they think, 'wow, these orcs must be metaphors for all the bad bad people that are out there on this evil evil planet. How deep! What geniuses are Tolkien and Peter Jackson!' They see a helicopter-view of a battlefield, great graphics of a fictional city, a realistic monster-spider, and they're happy. They see good triumph over evil and they think that's the way it should be, because... well,..., uhm... because it's different from real life I guess? It gives them... uhm ... hope? It must be nice to not see that cheap emotions, the flat characters, some of the most stereotyped dialogues ever written in the history of film. It must be great to be able to love this movie!
10.0~LORD of the Rings! cragsby_kellogs Sign in Permalink Lord of all films-Better than Godfather and Shawshank Redemption. Oscar dominance-Level with Ben-Hur and Titanic but 11/11. Beat that! Reads like a book-Read the entire book collection especially the hobbit. Down to 'middle' earth-Brilliant structure and overall editing. Offers epic battles-Best fight scenes you'll ever see in a film. Features a brilliant cast-Bloom, Tyler, Blanchett, McKellen, Bean, etc. Teaches us all friendship-Sam and Frodo, Legolas and Gimli, etc. Heroic characters-Aragorn, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Eowyn, Faramir. Even better than first 2-Definetly the best of the trilogy. Reaches new heights in film-making-Best film crew ever established. Incredible visual effects-Move over Titanic, Star Wars, Matrix etc. New beginning for stars-Elijah Wood, Billy Boyd, Orlando Bloom etc. Great directing-Peter Jackson joins Lucas, Spielberg, Wyler, Lean etc. Seemingly awesome-The greatest film of its generation ever. Reads like a poem!
10.0~All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox veljavex Sign in Permalink All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox
5.0~Come on this movie is overrated. sebastianm19 Sign in Permalink Can't understand why people like this dull movie. It has boring predictable characters, pretty bad acting. Paper thin personalities, if your bad then your gonna do evil stuff all the time and if your good well u get the point. Even if u haven't't read the book u can figure out whats going to happen 10 min or so in to the movie. 3 hours long, nothing really going on except Frodo almost dying a few times but of course saved in the last minute. Sam having his little annoying speech thats suppose to be heartwarming or something. 3 hours? they could've cut it to 2 and that would be more then enough. I dread the directors cut. Sure it has its moments but come on people! Is this movie really better than Pulp Fiction, The Pianoist, American Beauty etc etc etc?.
10.0~Perfect marjannerozendal Sign in Permalink What else is there to say. This movie is just perfect. I could bore you with a lot of praise, but I'm not going to. Peter Jackson, make space for the Oscar at your mantlepiece. Cause if there's anyone who deserves it, it's you. And Sean Astin should get one as well for best supporting male part.
10.0~Greatest story ever told Champ992 Sign in Permalink Not only the greatest story ever told, but what and ending! Easily one of the best battle scenes to be seen, and I'm not talking about Minas Tirith either, I'm talking about at the gates of Mordor; Aragorn turns to his men and says 'For Frodo'....then little Merry and Pippin run full speed. I have seen this film easily by itself about 15 times, as a trilogy roughly 10 times. From Shelobs layer, to the battle of Minas Tirith, it doesn't leave much to be desired, JRR Tolkein did a fantastic job writing the book and Peter Jackson did an amazing job portraying it to the big screen. If you've yet to see LOTR, watch it from the start and really take notice of everything because it has a lot to offer if you like being told a story. Excellent! 10/10
10.0~One film to rule them all... Orbling Sign in Permalink One film to rule them all, One film to define them, One film to bring them all, and in the darkness spellbind them... Too long? No, captivated every minute. Cried? Yes, the emotional effect is astonishing. Amazed? Yes, redefines "epic", effects are amazing, as are all the props, costumes, the lot... Done the book justice? Hopefully, bits left out, but what is there is near perfect. Worth the cost of the ticket? If every penny was worth a days hard labour. Unsurpassable.
10.0~The best finale for any epic to date... Zephyr75 Sign in Permalink I really don't think there is any word I could choose that would best describe the finale for LOTR trilogy, except that it was the most spectacular piece of filmmaking i've ever seen. Granted i'm only 27 years old, and i've seen my fair share of exciting, and adventureous movies. But this takes the cake by far. Granted i'm no expert the film industry(as much as I want to be someday), but to be moved through so many emotions in one film. That in my book denotes filmmaking at its finest. I laughed, cheered,and as many others... cried. It was one of the most intense emotional roller coaster rides through a film i've ever seen. Of course there are a lot of people out there who will pick this movie apart. A lot of whom have read the books and will say it didn't live up to its true potential. Me... I haven't had a chance to read the books yet, but from what I hear from most of my friends is that it does live up to the way the books are portrayed. I personally think that Peter Jackson's imagination of it all was above and beyond what everyone expected. During the three years of this epic adventure, I feel as if I have lived every single minute of it. And I wouldn't take that feeling back for anything. Long live the King ( and Hobbits)
10.0~10/10 nonkydan Sign in Permalink There is nothing but thoroughness. If you want to leave this world for a while, then this is your chance. Stop doing what you do and watch the movie.
10.0~A must see movie for anyone! butlerjb969 Sign in Permalink Great animation, great acting, great special effects, great, great, great everything. I can not say enough about this movie. It has everything that you can imagine. I am not going to give away any part of the movie to you. If you have not seen it, you need to. I think you probably have anyway (1st week in box office, over $125,000,000), enough said about that. If you do not give this movie a 10, then your either jealous because you didn't get a part in the movie or you are a relative or spouse of someone that got turned down in the movie. Expect this movie to get lots of awards, just remember that this is the highest gross-money making movie of all time, so far. In one part of the movie, I yelled out "Surprise mother #&$*!(". I did not get kicked out of the movie Theatre, only because everyone else was thinking that too. I was 'getting into the movie', if you know what I mean. When I like a movie, I do not get up and use the restroom, I can hold it and that was a long movie.
10.0~There's only one return and that's of the King - Here We Are at the End of All Things a-games-136-715468 Sign in Permalink After two spectacular, mind-blowing and breathtaking installments of the epic Lord of the Rings Trilogy, we finally get to the most emotional and darkest chapter - The Return of the King. Packed with incredible and extraordinarily epic battle scenes with unforgettable, powerful performances and undeniably emotionally resonant with beautiful visuals, The Return of the King brings the epic and emotional conclusion to the greatest trilogy of all time. After triumphing against the fallen wizard Saruman at Helm's Deep and Isengard, Gandalf rallies the troops of Minas Tirith against the shadow of the Dark Lord Sauron's vast army of Orcs, Trolls and Mumakil that are setting off to conquer Gondor and Middle-earth. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas seek help from the cursed army of the dead in the haunted mountains to vanquish Sauron's outnumbering forces as King Theoden rallies his huge Rohirrim army to ride to Gondor's aid and Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue their journey to Mount Doom through a treacherous route. The Return of the King is the big pay-off to the monumental story that started in Fellowship and continued through the Two Towers and this film doesn't disappoint. Peter Jackson's direction is flawless - from directing strong, towering performances mixed with heartbreaking emotion to swooping and out-of-this-world, intense battles from Rohirrim clashing with Orcs to enormous elephants to the armies of Rohan and Gondor charging to Mordor's army at the Black Gates to give Frodo more time to destroy the Ring. The battle scenes are so much bigger in this film - from Ringwraiths swooping men on flying beasts to a gigantic army of Orcs and Trolls besieging Minas Tirith to giant elephants clashing with the Rohirrim to the stirring battle at the Black Gates - and the film has the most emotional moments in the entire trilogy - from the Rohirrim's charge, Frodo sending Sam away, Faramir's near-suicide charge, Theoden's heroic end, Aragorn's speech to the final shot in the film followed by 'The End'. The Lord of the Rings is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, an amazingly powerful visual experience and an unmissable phenomenon that should be watched by all film buffs and fantasy fans at least once just to experience the outstanding filmmaking and breathtaking battles. Unlike many trilogies (Godfather, Matrix, Star Wars), there are no disappointing chapters in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy as each film gets better and better and in many capacities outdoes what the other film achieved. As for the endings, I understand people's complaints - however in my opinion they were earned, but we also needed to see what happened to the other main characters such as Gimli, Eomer, Aragorn, Faramir and Legolas (I know they were filmed and will hopefully be present in a future edition of the film) and another problem that I have with this film which is the film's biggest blunder is the omitting Saruman. The two films perfectly built him up as the main active villain (while Sauron is the ultimate antagonist) and in the theatrical version, he's absent and it leaves a very big hole in the film (he is present in the extended edition, but he should have featured in the theatrical cut too). Pros: The unbelievably monumental epic battles (especially Pelennor Fields with the giant Mumakil), emotionally resonant, flawless direction, towering performances from an excellent ensemble cast, remarkable special effects, amazing characters, fantastic cinematography, the outstanding production & costume designs and the emotionally breathtaking story & script Cons: Cutting Saruman out of the theatrical cut, some parts of the action scenes could have been cut, we should have seen what happened to the other main characters like Legolas, Aragorn, Eomer and Gimli, the Easterlings (the bad-ass looking warriors at the Black Gates) were not utilised very well (we only get to see them very briefly when the Trolls breach the gates of Gondor), we could have found out the reason why Denethor dislikes his son Faramir and Eowyn's war-cry when she kills the Witch-King is cringey & cheesy
10.0~Excellent Movie!! maverick99999_99 Sign in Permalink This is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen. It is so different from most movies today, in that, it actually has some virtue in it! This story teaches what it means to be noble, good, and true. I just loved it and already want to see it again!

10.0~Perfect! carlos-grant Sign in Permalink This movie and the whole trilogy deserves all the praise it has received. I had been worried about seeing it because of how much Peter Jackson re-wrote "Two Towers" and presented scenes that undermined some of Tolkien's fundamental ideas. This time, Jackson followed Tolkien more closely and the worst that can be claimed are sins of omission. It's a real shame we didn't get to see Christopher Lee in this move; he totally rocked in the previous films. Telling us to wait for the "extended" version isn't right. Maybe Jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in ROTK to give Lee some film time. That said, all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. The one new thing that I would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great Tolkien artists Alan Lee and John Howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of FOTR to the final scenes of ROTK. This historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. The LOTR enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years, and this final installment was a crowning achievement.
10.0~The State of The Art uramad Sign in Permalink Just a visionary as Peter Jackson is, could have the chance to bring us an spectacular Masterpiece as The Return of The King, the unbelievable final chapter of the Lord of The Rings saga. It is the perfect example to describe how the talent of a few human beings is used to make this kind of gift. Thanks JRR Tolkien !! Thanks Peter Jackson, & all the crew !! Alvaro Morales, Valencia Venezuela
10.0~Superb Movie alikazimg Sign in Permalink With all the media hype preceded the movie, I was bit suspicious about ROTK's ability to meet the expectations but now I can safely say that it not only met my hyped expectations but exceeded those. War sequences are marvelous. All members of fellowship play an important role in this final chapter of the movie. All answers have been provided. In short, one of the best movie of our times. My Rating: 10/10
7.0~This is movie is what it is. Patuquitos Sign in Permalink My summary may be pedestrian, but it's the naked truth. This is the movie you make when you are given millions of dollars and almost two years. It's spectacular, but lacks charm. It's a must see if you are into popcorn cinema, but it shares the same aesthetic of the previous two movies, and it gets tiresome. As an adaptation, it's not perfect, but it's as good as it gets if you take into account how difficult is to make such a big movie. This the latest modern mammoth movie, so take it for what it is. It hasn't been the first, and it won't be the last. Sometimes your jaw will drop, but everybody knows that there is not much merit in making the film looks the way it does. The merit lies in having finished the movie at all. It's almost impossible to write a more complex review and not sound like an pretentious asshole. I had a lot of fun, but something was lacking. Apply this review to parts I & II. RATING: 7.1
6.0~The pieces are moving... rooee Sign in Permalink Antipodean director Peter Jackson here proves beyond doubt that he's picked up Spielberg's mantle as the director most competent at blending dazzling special effects with convincing emotional drama. The third part of Jackson's opus sees the One Ring return to Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit, while the hordes of Gorgoroth sweep into the realm of man in their tens of thousands. Bad Taste this ain't. This is the boldest of the three movies in that it necessarily must take the most risks in depicting Tolkien's universe. It's a delicate balancing act. For instance, some will love the Jackson of old re-emerging for the Paths of the Dead sequence, while others will resent its Temple of Doom comedy-horror stylings. Legolas skipping up the leg of an olyphaunt and then sliding down its trunk as it falls: fanboys loathe that stuff; the kids love it. But thankfully, due to Return of the King's structure - a series of action scenes built around Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) dreadful narration - one doesn't have to wait long until the next set-piece arrives. And we're spoiled for choice. Gandalf, for example, doesn't only narrate - he also, exhilaratingly, sweeps onto the plain of Pelennor to ward off the Nazgul with a blinding shaft of light. Shelob doesn't disappoint; Weta have created a memorable monster who tickles the neck-hairs of Tolkien devotees and unsuspecting arachnophobics alike (I had not yet read the novel at this point...). And the lighting of the beacons, erupting from far snow-capped peaks, calling to Gondor under the bellowing strains of Howard Shore's aptly triumphant score, might be the single most rousing sequence in movie history. It's the ignition of hope, a glimmer of unbridled joy before the darkness descends. The biggest omission from the novel is the Scouring of the Shire. I happen to agree with the screenwriters' decision. By that time, we've already had two or three endings. We've been stuffed with a veritable feast in the form of the Battle of Pelennor and the Fall of Sauron; the Scouring, I believe, would have been an unwanted dessert. Besides, Tolkien's epilogue was something of a matter of celebrity. Aragorn's final words to the hobbits, as all of Middle Earth kneels, says more about the height of their standing than any Shire-war would. Some minor flaws still remain. Legolas and Gimli's character arcs still reach no real resolution (but then, do we really need another two endings?). The position of the Battle of Pelennor in the story's narrative doesn't really lend itself to the classical Hollywood narrative very comfortably - there's a predictable, albeit only slight, feeling of 'winding down' in all that follows. Also, on this extended DVD, the point at which we are asked to change discs comes at a most inopportune time, as the drums of war are at their peak. But it seems strangely impertinent to sniff out the trilogy's few flaws; to do so is like picking at the hem of the Bayeux Tapestry. Will we ever see such a wholly satisfying series of films again? Not in my lifetime. (N.B. The score is for all three.) This is pure cinema. Jackson and his creative family just don't stop giving. He has successfully translated his love for his source material and created a body of work that will live on and become equally loved. The scope of his achievement is undeniable; as entertainment, this is about as close to perfection as cinema will get.
10.0~EPIC TRILOGY steliosknd Sign in Permalink The best movie!! Congrats Peter Jackson !! We want Silmarillion for the next!
7.0~Great Movie except for the last 30 min movieman-41 Sign in Permalink This is a great movie, except they could have cut out the last 20 to 30 min. and had a great move.

10.0~About The Movie michealfeningbenham Sign in Permalink This Movie really deserves to be #1 in the Top 250. It's just so cheerful. If you haven't seen it yet first, read the book or the whole trilogy, then you will understand the movie. Yes so I am not gonna tell you any spoilers. But if you read the book or saw the movie, congratulations, you understood the book and the movie at the same time. If you live in New Zealand, everyone and you really loves the movie and the book, and that is why New Zealand is famous because of The Lord of The Rings. The movie has great roles and characters like Frodo Baggins, Gollum, Sam, Gandalf The Grey. And the movie is declared one of the best movies ever in numerous countries. And that was my review of The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King.
10.0~Fantastic finish to the trilogy, but not flawless. Bring on the extended edition. Sabriane Sign in Permalink While I feel that most of the praise the final installment gets is deserving, I can't help feeling that of all the chapters it will benefit the most from the extended edition. Make no mistake, it is still an incredible achievement, it's just that there're so many things to be taken care of, so many stories to wrap up, that, for all its mammoth length, a theatrical cut feels rushed and choppy at times. As with all chapters in the trilogy, some characters get more screen time while others draw a short stick. I was very happy to see Merry and Pippin grow up into something more than comic relief couple. They're still mischievous, childlike, occasionally silly and fond of food, but they also finally have some fine and serious drama to sink their teeth into. The interactions between Eowyn and Merry, Gandalf and Pippin are simply wonderful, and it's great to see more of the White Wizard after he was absent for the most of TTT. On the down side, while Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn loses none of his quiet dignity and charisma, his part feels strangely downsized and one feels that a few crucial scenes are missing on his way of becoming a king. Saruman's story doesn't get a truly satisfying finish after he's been such a presence in the first two films. Faramir gets a fantastic scene with his father, the Steward of Gondor, but then has an unenviable task of spending the rest of the film as a near-corpse and appears only briefly at the end. Hopefully, the extended edition will flesh out all these stories a little bit better. Gollum is still brilliantly played by the WETA team and Andy Serskis, who we even get to glimpse in the opening scene of the film in which he plays Smeagol prior to his corruption by the ring. Gollum makes for a delicious villain, although by finally forsaking his good side he predictably doesn't have as much dramatic impact as in TTT, where his inner struggles were heartbreaking to watch. Still, there's enough dramatic tension between him, Frodo and Sam to make this triad's journey compulsively watchable. Needlessly to say, the special effects are amazing, incredible, etc. etc. Blended seamlessly together with the natural beauty of the landscape, they create an astonishingly realised imaginary world, to the point where it didn't even occur to me to think of them as special effects. The battle of Pelennor fields doesn't have the incredible build-up of Helms Deep, but in terms of scope and variety it is a sight to behold, and there are plenty of emotional moments during the battle. The one criticism I can make is that, after getting so much build-up, the sinister Witch King goes down a little bit too soon. Many people complained about the multiple endings, but they worked alright for me. I'm glad it finished on a bitter-sweet note rather than some happy Kodak moment a la Return of the Jedi. Overall, this trilogy is the one to beat and I don't think I've ever seen films that pulled me so strongly and completely into their world. Long may the story reign.
10.0~Destined to be a classic genesis157-1 Sign in Permalink There are certain films in cinematic history which dare not be re-made. "The Wizard of Oz", "Raisin in the Sun", "All about Eve", "Miracle on 34th Street"........Lord of the Rings' "The Return of the King" WILL BE AMONG THEM. It can only be described as a lengthy collaboration of the best: acting, action, special effects, cinematography and character development. If tears do not continually well in your eyes during the final hour of this film...one may argue..."humanity is damned ". Furthermore, if this film is not honored with more than nominations come this Spring...the Oscars are too.
6.0~wait for the extended edition DVD (possible spoilers) ALS-2 Sign in Permalink I know I'm in the EXTREME minority, but I was very disappointed with this movie, largely because I cared about (loved, actually!) characters other than Sam, Frodo, Gollum and Gandalf. I am absolutely in love with the character of Faramir, for example, and felt completely cheated by the way his character was treated in this movie. If Peter Jackson ultimately wasn't going to allow us to see any happiness or reward come to the very deserving and perpetually abused Faramir, why didn't he just eliminate the character completely from the trilogy? The same could be said for Eomer, who had one memorable line and that was about it. Eowyn, another character I love, appeared on screen quite a bit to suffer emotionally (and actually had a nice heroic scene), but then we are denied the chance to see her find happiness at last! I won't even discuss the anticlimactic let-down that constituted the "resolution" of the Saruman story. Sure, I care about Sam and Frodo, but there were a lot of other characters we love who deserved to have some closure -- or even to appear! As far as I'm concerned, the *real* "Return of the King" doesn't come out until the extended edition appears and we get a little more than Sam and Frodo.
10.0~This is THE movie of our time. sicurtis Sign in Permalink A perfect finale to a perfect trilogy. Perhaps one that will never be matched. This is a magical film of rare beauty; stunningly photographed, wonderfully acted and lovingly crafted. I can't believe Tolkien would not have been touched by such a fantastic tribute. If Peter Jackson doesn't win an Oscar for this then those responsible ought to live forever in shame. In fact they ought to invent a Nobel prize for Film and award it to him in perpetuity. A wonderful achievement - I'm itching to get back to the cinema to experience it all again. This is a cinematic event - you'd be crazy to miss it.
10.0~There are hardly words... nkimzey Sign in Permalink There are hardly words to describe the event of seeing this film. It is people fighting for freedom. They are honorable and dignified. They give speeches to motivate that not only motivate their fellow man, but brought most of the people on our row of the theater to tears. More than that, it gives hope to all in such a profound and touching way. I have never seen an audience so still and quite at the end of the movie. It was so moving that few even spoke, and those that did used hushed tones to preserve the mood. Is it long? YES! Some might say the end drags out a bit - I say NO! I am thankful Peter Jackson took the time to re-establish that there had been peace brought to the lands and lives of these characters we have come to love over the last three years. This film will go down in history. There are hardly words...
10.0~Amazing Turtle-7 Sign in Permalink I watched the trilogy yesterday at a theatre in Ontario, Canada yesterday and it was the most amazing experience. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire 'Return of the King' even though I have read the books multiple times and knew the ending it was amazing to watch it brought to life on the screen. If they do not give Jackson and Mortensen the Oscars it will be travesty. I still believe they should create some category where Andy Serkis (and the developers) could win for his amazing portrayal. I do realize that the developers brought him to the screen, but with Serkis I think Gollum might not have been such an amazing character. I just can't believe the waiting is over (until the extended version) it is somewhat of a letdown. It's over. It has been done and done well. Who ever would have thought it was possible. Apparently, Jackson. Kudos to you Mr. Jackson thank you for bringing this to the screen and doing such an amazing job. Viggo Mortensen, thank you so much for bringing my hopes of what Aragorn would be to the screen. You went above and beyond what ever could have hoped for for the character that I have been love with since I was eight years old. Amazing movie! Amazing trilogy! Can't wait to see all three in a theatre again.
10.0~A film of epic proportions. LadyOfSherwood Sign in Permalink Even those who have no read the books will enjoy this piece. Having been one who has read the entire trilogy written by J.R.R. Tolkien, I believe Peter Jackson has done this movie justice. It is the last installment of the trilogy, and a good one it is. It's filled with two great battles and some interesting twists that those who have not read the books will like. The only complaints I have with this is the firstly the length. Even though I knew it would have to be long because it began at the end of the book "The Two Towers", but I still hold that they did not need to show the leaving to the Grey Havens. Although I enjoyed it, it was superfluous. Also, I did not find that the decision to leave out Denethor's palantir a wise choice. For those of you who have not read the books, a palantir is a seeing stone which has appeared in the first two installments, under Saruman's (played by Christopher Lee) care. Without knowing that Denethor had one of these "crystal balls", his madness seems quite out of place. All in all, this movie was a brilliant work which made me want to see it again and again despite its length. I hope that the rumors of the making of "The Hobbit" are true, because then I would have something else to look forward to from Peter Jackson!
7.0~The end is bitter sweet tributarystu Sign in Permalink I have never loved the first two Lord of the Rings movies. I considered them nothing more than a fine fantasy story, with its smart and silly characteristics, too long and seriously overrated. The fact that these films were thoroughly enjoyed by loads of people I can comprehend easily: the movie's theme appeals to all and I can not deny that it is nicely all nicely put together. But it is still far too long as it lacks a certain...intelligence. Coming to the third installment, I sit and stare. Making fun of a movie is quite easy, what's hard is to understand it. I am not trying to say that this here film has left a mark upon me, but merely that some people are wrong and that I may be as well. Spoilers It's got some strong points, it's got some weak points and overall it's just what I expected it to be. After a rather pathetic beginning, the movie gets off from where the previous one let us. War, freedom, good and evil, love, trust, friendship, maturity, justice and peace. That's what will concern you once you're in this joint. Some impressive scenes, with sparkles of humor and shallow morality will add up into a massive fight. It's never about the outcome, it's about the way you do it, so I will accept the more shameful moments regarding the story. I might say I would want to admire it all, but it's just too much of a contrast between dark and bright. That's all in this movie but not in our hearts or in our world. Are the characters really complex? Is anyone really worth remembering? They are all weak faced with the power of the ring and none impress in this regard. I try to think of a weakness for us all and I can't find it. This fantasy world is supposed to have one evil which really concerns us, with minor "misunderstandings" between people. It's a call for unity, because only through this can we be able to outlive a fight. I fear just that I can not relate to it. I see no war for a common goal. And the problem does not lie around us, it lies within us. We can't find a ring and make all problems disappear after a tremendous quest. That's what makes me feel that The Lord of the Rings is just a story. A long, sporadically remarkable story. But I live in an era of naturalism and realism and I can not accept such a piece of art, as it is, just for the sake of being. I simply can't feel this as a great movie, because so many fates are involved and everything is too perfect. Perfection is bitter sweet, not this film. For me, LoTR is just bitter. But at least not as bitter as the Matrix. Fans will remain fans, detractors will remain detractors. Things don't usually change in life and for that you need to make a great effort. Linear and coherent storytelling adds up in a never ending experience. For most, I am somewhat convinced to say, a superb one. In my heart I feel both joy and pain, because it all means something. The fact that people dream of such a fantasy world, means something. This is not my fantasy world though. This is not my world. 7.5/10
10.0~Awesome Movie thelordisgr8 Sign in Permalink I thought the movie was the best one. The graphics were awesome as well and the acting too. My fav part in the movie was the fighting part near the end when Aragorn got all the ghosts to help fight, that was really cool.
10.0~The best one of the trilogy, and a great way to end it I_Love_Spielberg Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" concludes the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum to the fires of Mordor. But while they proceed to Mordor, Gollum has a nasty plan to get back at Frodo for supposedly betraying him. And while this is happening, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and the rest of the kingdom of Rohan learn of Sauron's plan: To attack the kingdom of Gondor, for he knows that the heir of Isildur (Aragorn) has come back. So begins one of the biggest battles you will see on the screen. I must say, this is a great way to end the series. Yes, it's over 3 hours long, but it's still very good. And this is a film, not a movie. A film. There is also much more emotion than in the other ones, and you see the deterioration of Frodo as the ring takes hold of him. Please see this movie, because if you think you thought that the first two were damn good, you ain't seen nothing yet.
10.0~The Fantasy Film of Our Time kaustin1067 Sign in Permalink Haven't read the books yet, but considering how good this movie was,I plan to get them. In this final chapter, Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee(Sean Astin) continue their quest to Mt. Mt. Doom in Mordor to Toss the one ring into the fire to destroy the dark lord Sauron. Meanwhile Aragorn(Viggo Mortenson), Legolas(Orlando Bloom),Gimli(John Rhys-Davies), and Gandalf(Ian McKellen) Prepare for war against Sauron's horde of Uruk-Hai in order to buy Frodo time to make it the Mt. Doom. This film had Action, Suspense, Heart, and a great story. The acting was certainly Oscar worthy. Speaking of the Oscars, this film deserved all eleven it was nominated for, but I don't need to say that because it did win all of them. The only thing I didn't like was the extended ending which kind of dragged a bit. One of the best films of the decade in my opinion.
6.0~Lord of The Bling ThatMonkey Sign in Permalink The images in this film were very powerful. It was quite slow at times, but was a pretty good end to the series. The Two Towers is far and away my favorite, but this really did a good job of tying it all together. I'm anxious for Mr. Jackson next project.
10.0~My Generation's Response to "Ben-Hur" Bishop832 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson and his teams of gifted actors, designers and special effects wizards deliver what can only be described as one of if not the greatest epic of our time. And it should be noted that he does not wimp out at the end, but gives the most extraordinary and pleasing conclusion. This entire saga, which now feels like one film, rivals Star Wars as the greatest trilogy in the history of film. Mr. Jackson - Good Job & Thank You from all of the fans.
10.0~the greatest movie in the history neo_meteora_mu Sign in Permalink i love this movie so much because it has every criteria of becoming a successful movie that i want in a single film.first,the movie has provided an excellent characters development.second, it has a very brilliant story plots.third, it represented an outstanding special effects.last but not less,the movie has a superb music score.
9.0~Scratches the surface: just not complete richjedi Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed it, and I have no doubt I'll enjoy it again in an hours time when I see it again. But we know the story and the characters so well now that the final product can't fail to disappoint. * Spoilers below * 3 hours 22 minutes is not too long: why cut Saruman? Why make Gollum more devious and calculating in creating the rift between Frodo and Sam? Why make Pippin even more foolish in the Palantir episode? Only to make him even greater near the end of the film! The changes I can forgive, but the omissions I couldn't. Jackson has created a splendid trilogy, but I'm not wholeheartedly behind it. I honestly think that those who haven't read the books won't be able to appreciate the films as deeply as one can read the books. You can say that's not necessary, that the subtext of the books is superfluous in a cinematic medium, but I disagree. Jackson took on an epic of fantastic scale and has delivered only in the spectacle, not the substance.
10.0~Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Series Ever LedZeppelin1114 Sign in Permalink There are very few sequels that live up to the original. Sure you have your Godfather Part 2s, your Empire Strikes Backs, your Terminator 2s, but it rarely happens. It is even more rare that the SECOND sequel will be the best out of the bunch. But in the case of Return of the King, it is absolutely true. Not only is this film by far the best Lord of the Rings film (though the other two are breathtaking), it is also one of the greatest films ever made. The film is on a grand scale in every conceivable way: the character development is phenomenal, the scenery is some of the best I've ever seen, the battles rival the classic opener to Saving Private Ryan, and the special effects are flawless. Most of all, it is a real accomplishment when a three and a half hour movie does not seem long enough. I actually felt saddened to see that the movie had ended. If you have not yet seen this film, you must see it at once. It is truly a work of art. Peter Jackson, you are a frickin genius. I was terrified you would destroy the classic trilogy, but you have made a devout fan ecstatic. You are truly a legend in the filmmaking business my friend.
9.0~Hands down the best one! nathanozee Sign in Permalink How they took the story from the the two towers to this film was amazing! I have nothing negative to say about this film. It has it all. Just do make sure to watch the first two otherwise you may be lost.
1.0~Terrible awpivec-1 Sign in Permalink Perhaps I can't lay all the blame on Peter Jackson. The story was dumb to begin with. For those that don't know, the idea of the ring originates from Plato's "The Republic", The Ring of Gyges. Basically this ring gives Gyges the power of invisibility, which he exploits to take over some kingdom and yada yada. Not a very interesting story on its own, but good within the context of "The Republic." Glaucon and Plato were arguing over the tendency of man to do good over evil and vice versa. LOTR does not intertwine philosophical explorations with a clever plot. Instead it merely takes this stupid ring story out of its origin and assumes that is insightful. Blah. This is why I rarely akin to fantasy. Its authors are prone to employing cheap fiction. Thanks for making America even dumber Peter Jackson. Never make another movie, please.
9.0~Capital Goof - an open appeal  Dear Peter (and NLC) . . ." HuskyEnzo Sign in Permalink ... thank you for your fine work on Lord...". You've done it right and well and about time. Many people had looked forward to what you finally accomplished and you didn't disappoint us. With basically one capital exception! It is obligatory that you do The Hobbit" and show how terrific dwarvens really are! An Elf may be one hell of a long-distance-fighter, an astonishing acrobat and a superior in strategic warfair. But NEVER EVER will an Elf compete against a Dwarf in close-combat and long-range-drinking! An Elf hits the bar-room floor after one cream-liquor, a dwarf parties on for nights. That goof between Gimli and Legolas at the end of ROTK" was unacceptable particularly after Legolas has already been shown as the generally superior fighter to Gimli almost all through the trilogy! Which kinda made me mad as well... I as much as many other Dwarven-fans- insist you to do The Hobbit" and put things right about our favourite fellows (or whoever may do it in the end). As soon as you did, I'll have you your tenth star here. Thank you, don't mind. ZWERGE  DAS EINZIG WAHRE!
10.0~A masterpiece. northwatuppa Sign in Permalink I rarely use the word masterpiece with reference to a film, or anything else, but I am sure that this film will someday be remembered as a masterpiece, if it has not already been declared such. The sheer intensity of inspiration and the quantity of creative energy apparent in every frame of the film was stunning. The loving attention to every aspect of film making, plot, dialogue, character, acting and special effects was outstanding and, I think, rarely equaled. As enjoyable as the first two films were, this film puts the trilogy in an entirely new light. You must see it and see it in a theater. An inspired and creatively generous film. I have not enjoyed a film so much, or been so impressed, since I saw David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia, first run, in a theater more than 40 years ago.
1.0~How can this be better than "The Godfather II?" NeoMyers Sign in Permalink Okay, I realize that this movie is considered by many to be a great film. I understand that they are extremely faithful to the novels and this pleases many fans. What I DO NOT understand is how anyone can say this film is better than "The Godfather II" and even one spot away from the first "Godfather." Go take a gander at the IMDB's top 250 and you'll see that this movie is only marginally below "The Shawshank Redemption." I mean, C'MON! Someone's gotta figure out a way to balance the rating system here. All that's going on is these movies' cult of scary and weird followers sit in their dank cold basements on the internet and vote these films a "10" when in the grand scheme of things, they're really more of a 6, 7 or maybe an 8. I'm sorry, but no matter how great these movies may seem, they're little more than a CGI fest of monsters, armies, and magical beams. This film can't hold a candle to the intense drama of Michael Corleone's criminal empire holding power in 1950s Las Vegas. C'mon, IMDB viewers, let's keep the ratings reasonable.
10.0~A perfect movie Usability Sign in Permalink The third installment in the trilogy is perfect. It is wonderful to see a movie get better over the three books. I believe the third one is 10 times better than the first two, and the first two were pretty good. The director has a wonderful blend of the epic, the persona, the evil, the good, real actors, CGI, it is well paced. Very nice. The difference between LotR #3 and Matrix #3 is that Tolkien was a professional storyteller/writer/philosopher who worked on his story for 12 years. That makes all of the difference. The director proportions the movie in service of Tolkien's story. The CGI is done with control and intelligence (if this were only true of Matrix #3). Lord of the Rings, especially the third installment is well worth seeing, many times.
10.0~My absolute favorite part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy mx_joe Sign in Permalink This part is the best of all three in my opinion. It's much more action packed than the first part and it seems like the visual effects got better compared to part one. I personally prefer the extended version of this movie I've read Lord of the Rings two times and watched Return of the King several times. While I embraced RotK as the third part of a dream come true, I was not totally happy, left wondering why so many things vital were missing. The 4-hour extended Blu-ray version explains a lot more so make sure to get it. It's sad that this trilogy wasn't filmed in HDR and High frame rate but you can't have anything, right?!
10.0~The perfect end to a perfect trilogy. matthew-maldonado41 Sign in Permalink Ah, The Return of the King. A true masterpiece by Peter Jackson. These films have not only inspired me as a young director, but as a person. The development of the characters was beyond anything I've seen in other films, particularly the Grey Havens scene at the end of the film. The scene just tears me apart, to see these characters depart. The emotion of the hobbits really got me because you see just how much each of them went through, and the effect it had on them. The music did the scene justice and amplified the emotion to an even greater effect. The scene was simple, yet empowering. Gandalf always has the greatest quotes and to hear his last quote just had me grasping for air. It was an amazing conclusion to the films and Jackson definitely did the films justice with that.
10.0~WOW! WOW! WOW! What a finale to the trilogy! Jackson has saved his best for last!!! jasontan Sign in Permalink This is the BEST trilogy ever put to film. Jackson has saved his best for last in The Return of the King. Simply sensational! If he doesn't get recognised for his works by the Academy, then the film industry is truly screwed. Can't wait for the extended edition!
7.0~A hugely satisfying movie, but the greatest? come on groundtwenty Sign in Permalink As a HUGE fan of the books of JRR Tolkien (IMHO some of the best pieces of literature to grace the world), I was immensely satisfied by the LotR trilogy in general as well as with the finale (Return of the King). It was a journey to Middle-Earth that lasted three years and now that's over I have to say I'm a little sad :( However, as much as I enjoyed the trilogy, I will NOT fall into the trap of irresponsibly naming this "the greatest movie ever", as many other have done. Come on people, you truly believe that ROTK is better than Citizen kane, Casablanca or Gone with the Wind? Why is that? Cause it has awesome effects and large battles? There was a time when I truly believed that if some brillant director (like Oliver Stone) filmed LotR and sticked to the book, making only the changes he had to while remaining TRUE to its spirit, the LotR trilogy could be in fact the greatest movies ever cause the background and story between them are simply legendary and classic. As it is however, Peter Jackson didn't avoid falling into the trap of commercialism, introducing cheesy or cheap scenes where he shouldn't. You know what I'm talking about... Legolas shieldboarding Helms Deep like a power ranger... how can a movie with an elven power ranger be the greatest? Batallions of elves showing up on Helms Deep to fight along with the Rohirrim, negating everything Tolkien had thought about the retreat of the elves and the age of men. Faramir and Theoden protrayed as weak and selfish, instead of the noble characters they were. Etc, etc. I did enjoy all the films as much as I could, despite being a little annoyed by the liberties the director and/or scriptwriters took with the books, liberties that were at times excessive. I think I can count the trilogy as one of my ten favourite films (since it's essentially one large film rather than three), but certainly not the GREATEST film ever made. Lets not confuse some things.
10.0~My impression armin_spahic_90 Sign in Permalink People who truly love the movie and enjoy it are divided into: 1. People who watched this movie (trilogy) and 2 people who will look. I watched this trilogy more than ten times and every time I watch over and over again I admire the beauty of what this movie is. So much imagination, so much positive energy value. On average I see one movie in two to three days, in the last 5-6 years. And for all that time and in compared to all the movies I've seen, this is on the one place, and all others on the other. Something extraordinary, something unique and something that is triggered in me something that no other film isn't. Well done, everyone those who have contributed to the film to be what it is and thanks a lot. Surely it would be good films, but like this, never
10.0~One of the best fantasy movies in history fegamer-17040 Sign in Permalink Return of the king is the last movie of the lord of the rings trilogy,the first one was a bit slow but very interesting,the second one was great in action sequences and presented more about the history,and boy oh boy,this movie has all of that and plus. About the action sequences,pretty well made,with some amazing lines of the characters,in two towers,there was some good action sequences but in this one they are really really bigger. The acting is amazing,Elijah wood doing a good job as Frodo,Andy Serkins is great as always,Orlando Bloom is okay,Viggo Mortensen is doing real good job here,but one we have to talk about here is Sean Astin,i liked Sam since the first movie but in this one he's just simply killing it,best acting of the movie,and my favorite character And the story is good as always,it's worth your 3 hours In overall it's an entertaining movie,pretty well made,with a good story and some amazing scenes,just my favorite fantasy movie
10.0~In many ways grander in scale than the first two installments of the trilogy. khanbaliq2 Sign in Permalink The hobbits approach the slopes of Mount Doom, preparing to dispose of the cursed Ring, while the forces of good and evil are rallied in anticipation of the ultimate battle. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the only time in history a fantasy film has done so. The Return Of The King is the longest of the three films, which suffers from having to cut between disparate story strands, and - in its final half-hour - stacks up endings one after the other, like jet planes waiting to land, the director visibly reluctant to let these characters go. Most audiences will forgive Peter Jackson for that, for this is a fitting conclusion to a series of films made with tremendous artistry and affection for their subject; thrilling spectacle is underscored with palpable human drama, and it finally becomes clear why J.R.R. Tolkien's books continue to ring such bells so loudly in the lives of so many.
10.0~The end of an epic, unforgettable adventure MaxBorg89 Sign in Permalink It took J.R.R. Tolkien twelve years to complete this epic trilogy. It took Peter Jackson almost ten years to complete the movie adaptation of that trilogy (he'd been working on it since 1997). It's been a long journey, but it was worth it. Every single step. So, this is the one where it all comes to an end: Frodo(Elijah Wood) must conquer his fears in order to fulfill his mission, the destruction of the One Ring; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), on the other hand, is supposed to accept and embrace his fate, which is to reclaim the throne of Gondor, while all the armies available are fighting against the Dark Lord Sauron's forces. The freedom of Middle Earth is at stake... Like in The Two Towers, character development is pretty much ignored in favor of the visually stunning combats (the 50-minute long battle of Pelennor Fields is breathtaking). Actually, that's the only defect of the theatrical version (rating:9/10) of The Return of the King: at 3 hours and 12 minutes it's, ironically, too short, mostly because of the biggest plot hole ever (what happened to Saruman), a scene which is gloriously restored in the extended edition, which is a must-see if you want the complete story. Now, let's talk about the best thing in the movie: Sean Astin. He already proved he was a great actor in the previous films, but in this one he really shines, giving us a tormented, angry, but loyal character, willing to do anything for his master (fans will never forget this line: "I can't carry it (the Ring) for you! But I can carry YOU!", probably the single most moving piece of dialogue in the entire trilogy). Shame the Academy overlooked his astounding performance. Well, at least they didn't overlook the entire movie, each one of its 11 Oscars being fully deserved. The Return of the King isn't just the best picture of 2003, it's among the absolutely best movies of all time. Peter Jackson has written a new, exciting page of cinema history, and we will always be grateful for that.
10.0~Return of excellence *spoilers* nixar55 Sign in Permalink Wow! I'm completely overwhelmed by this movie. There was so much to it that one viewing is simply not enough. Emotionally, it was intense and sad. Spiders and ghosts and Nazguls - it was gripping. The battle scenes here really did raise the bar for any epic battles put to film in the future. And in the past - Gladiator, Ran, Saving Private Ryan - those were realistic battles, but ROTK had a greater challenge - how to make the extraordinary feel real, to put a viewer in the middle of this truly epic fantasy battle. Nothing compares to the beautiful pagentry of swords, battering rams, spears, winged beasts, and oliphants. The oliphants! They were amazing. I can't stop thinking about how great they looked. Now, to address so griping...The Faramir/Eowyn love story will be on the DVD, as will Saruman, which makes me excited already. The "multiple ending" people keep talking about: the book continues after Mount Doom, simple as that. Also, the Eye of Sauron: How else can you show a disembodied eye focusing on other events surrounding it? It was an awkward device of Tolkien's, for such a climax. It's hard to portray your main baddie WITHOUT A BODY! Also, I'm sick of hearing fanboy griping about how much better the original Star Wars trilogy is over LOTR. It's pathetic. Simply recognize both films as achievements for their times and move on. It does nothing to lessen the sterotypical "geek" image. (Though I'd be the first to say, if pressed, that Lord of the Rings is more epic in scope, better acted by far, and features more impressive FX.)
10.0~best movie of all times lotrfan2810 Sign in Permalink This movie is the most inspiring piece of film-work I have seen in years. The beautiful movie-making by Mr. Peter Jackson was one worthy of robust applause and I salute him for his daring to be excellent and for give the Lord of the Rings books the best movie counterpart it could possibly have. When I first saw the movie in theaters, I felt slightly nervous at first to see what was going to appear on that screen, but it went beyond my expectations even though it still didn't contain all I wanted it too, I felt that Tolkien's masterpiece was payed the most proper respect with this movie. I love the complexities Jackson managed to weave into the story and how he really knows how to make a movie. I love the devotion and attention from all the people involved. You couldn't ask for anything better and the fact that they won all those Oscars makes me happy to see this marvelous movie recognized so wonderfully. When I watch this movie, it makes me feel awe and an overwhelming sense of hope for the next generation of movies. Any devoted Tolkien fan would be proud of this work.
10.0~Was that really 3 1/2 Hours? tgrosso Sign in Permalink Director Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece! A little over three years ago I was telling myself that I really hope that this trilogy would be done right. It has far exceeded my expectations. I had almost as much fun watching this as the many many times I read this trilogy. Were there portions that deviated from the book? Sure, but they were understandable. I was so wrapped up in this final chapter that I couldn't believe when the final credits were run that it was actually a 3 1/2 hour film. ****SPOILER WARNING****** I thought that the film was able to accomplish how horrible these orc creatures were when they used the decapitated men of Gondor's heads as their catapult weapon of choice. The only problems I had was with the lack of Palantir reference with Denethor (made him just look like a madman without explanation) and Frodo telling Sam to go home and believing Gollum instead. I really wish that they left this just like the book and went into the tunnel towards Shelob together. Otherwise, Eowyn's scene with Merry killing the Witch-King is exactly how I pictured in the book along with so much else. Very close to perfection!
5.0~Lets ask the dead guys prewreckwes8 Sign in Permalink Granted that it's in the book, asking dead guys to fight a war for you did not sit right with me. The intern king was an idiot, sing for me peck. After all the dumb things those little guys did Jackson should have killed one of them off. One of the other things that really irked me about this movie was when Gandalf left the soldiers holding the door to go save Faramir from his death while other people are dieing good save. I also loved the extra extra long ending could have been cut and put in the extended version DVD. Other than that this movie was OK. If you voted this move better than Star Wars 6 "The Return of the Jedi" the king of final battles, your thinking is flawed
2.0~When is this over? carnegis Sign in Permalink Is what I kept asking myself when watching this movie, it could have easily been 30 minutes shorter. Loved the first one, but didn't really care for the second two. In Part 3, we have many of the same scenarios repeated from earlier in the film or in the other films; good guys defending their city, outnumbered by the Orcs; looks like they're about to die, but then another group of good guys come to save them, yaay! How many times will we see Frodo having doubts or being tempted by the ring, and Sam comes to the rescue? How many times will we see someone dying and their friend there to comfort them? How many times will we see the same close up shot of Frodo with that same look on his face? Was there a point to Liv Tyler being in any of the movies? Her character did nothing. Sauron and his role was barely mentioned in this movie, therefor his defeat (the big eye falling over; lame) was very unsatisfying. This is another example of a big budget, over-hyped movie being filled with amazing graphics (and they are amazing) but little depth to the storyline. I felt no emotion while watching this movie, it did nothing to draw me in.
10.0~Lord of The Rings - A Remarkable Tale bkaustin Sign in Permalink Great!!! "SET" of Movies!!! I would say for the good and the bad comments the undertaking of the producers and Director to create a spectacular set of 3 seemless like films is more than we have seen in movie making in years... This Series has opened us up to new and wonderful futures in film making!!!
10.0~An excellent powerful experience... jermdown Sign in Permalink I saw this film for the first time last night and afterwards was unsure if I liked it or not. My expectations were huge. After watching it for a second time half an hour ago, I am deeply thrilled. IT WAS EXCELLENT! I think it was the best of the three. I stupidly thought I would not cry, and blubbered my way to the end. Definatly worth a third watch in the theatre. When you go to see it, don't expect another Fellowship of the Ring, or The Two Towers, expect a different film, and be prepared to be stunned.
4.0~Let's all just calm down with this 'best trilogy ever' talk.... lotus_chief Sign in Permalink ****SPOILERS AHEAD**** Okay, I see that the ultra die-hard LOTR fans didn't waste anytime pledging their feverish loyalty and almost mindlessly 'expressing' their utter amazement with ROTK here on IMDb; hence its #8 spot on the Top 250 with a 9.1/10 rating. But lets all just calm down with all this 'best movie ever' and 'greatest trilogy of all time' talk. I even read some people admit that they never even saw any of the Godfathers....therefore their claim of the LOTR being the greatest trilogy holds NO WEIGHT. This movie was pretty good, the visual effects were a sight to behold....they were amazing. The landscapes along with the battle scenes, particularly the different creatures, were astounding. With that said, without the loads and loads of CGI, what real substance would ROTK really have? The film is WAY TOO LONG, and the mere thought of an 'extended edition' actually existing makes me shiver. If that's the case, why was this movie STILL 3 hours and 30 minutes??? At times its simply a bore, as I caught myself looking away at the screen, looking at my friends to make sure that I wasn't the only one bored out of my mind. The 'ending' does a great job of disparaging whatever merit the past 3 hours had left. The film should have ended with Strider becoming King. That was main premise behind the story aside from Frodo destroying the ring. We DID NOT need to see Sam get married. We DID NOT need to see Frodo finishing his book. We DID NOT need to see Sam AGAIN with his new wife and kids. We DID NOT need to see everyone bidding farewell to Agent Smith (forgive me if I don't know his character's name), Gandalf and Frodo. We DID NOT need to see the four hobbits drinking at the local pub in The Shire. All of this was totally unnecessary and made the movie even more of a bore than it already was. The last 20 minutes were absolute TORTURE. Certain aspects of the story just didn't fit well with me. I just didn't get how throughout the 3 films, Frodo was billed as the one with sense and a level head...hence the reason HE was given the ring in the first place. The climax with the ring in Mordor on the cliff was just frustrating to watch. He suddenly gets his 'second wind' after Sam saves him yet AGAIN and practically carries him up the volcano. He runs inside, knowing what he has to do, with the ring over the cliff all he has to do is drop it. Now all of a sudden he doesn't? When EVERYBODY and their grandmother has tried to take the ring from him and he's always exercised (for the most part) common sense and responsibility, NOW he hasn't the willpower to do what's right when all he has to do is let go of the ring? Why didn't Sam just do it for him? But no, we need one last dramatic battle with Gollum before we destroy it. Pathetic. Other parts of the movie were just plain CHEESY....the dialogue was enough to make me gag. Somehow Fellowship of the Ring, with the sentimental nature of these fantasy-type stories, seemed to keep its edge while keeping the story going and being entertaining throughout. But ROTK is all a bunch of eye-candy and grand events with no real substance. I didn't give a damn about 99% of the characters in ROTK...I only hoped that Strider and Legolas didn't die (well Strider couldn't die because he had to become King) because those were my two favorite characters. Frodo has to be the lamest, dumbest 'hero' ever...all his whining and yelling and crying got tired in Two Towers. I wanted all of the hobbits to die; what was really their purpose? It just made everything more silly. Of course we had to have the 2 true idiots of the 4 go into battle, slaying Orcs...yea right. I could go on and on about how disappointed I was with ROTK, but I won't waste my time. But please, just stop with all this 'greatest movie ever' talk. There's opinion and then there's sheep. I doubt anyone will even be talking about these movies 20 years from now. It's a travesty for any of these films to be even mentioned with the great FILMS of the past. ROTK before Casablanca?????? The MADNESS!!! I understand the nature of the story is fantasy, which bears a certain level of cheesiness and sappiness. But please don't try to put LOTR on the level of the TRUE MASTERPIECES, especially if you haven't even seen them. The LOTR trilogy, with its talking trees, wizardry and scary-looking creatures, is just too silly to hold that type of rank, and it never will. It's the flavor of the month now, but it won't stand the test of time. With that said, this trilogy was a big letdown. In my opinion, Fellowship of the Ring is the best of the three, as it was the most cohesive and entertaining without all the slow spots. Two Towers and ROTK were big letdowns, each of them doing a good job of tainting what could have been a really great trilogy. Of course I'm in the minority here, but I'm one of the few that can see past the CGI and grand landscapes and see the silliness for what it is....SILLINESS. I rate ROTK on the same level as Two Towers, but it was even more boring than that, except for the much better battle scenes. A good movie and decent trilogy, but stop already with the overhype. I'd take the Matrix trilogy over this any day. **1/2 out of **** stars
2.0~boring modica Sign in Permalink can't believe this movie is even and the list. The movie was way too long and the battle scenes were very drawn out and way to bloody to be PG-13. Also the ending seemed like it would never end. I liked the one before this one, and really looked forward to seeing "The Return of the king. Why couldn't it have been more faithful to the book. The fight scenes took up too much of the movie. I can't believe this movie won best picture, because there were others that deserved the Oscar, but no movie since American Beauty has deserved to win and that was going back to 2000. I was so disappointed and they won't let Peter Jackson direct The Hobbit, although maybe it will be OK because I thought he did a good job with King Kong.
10.0~Truly Unforgetable! sweetrupturedlight Sign in Permalink I dont actually know why it as taken me so long to actually write my impressions of this, the last installment of the trilogy. I went to see this movie promptly in the week that it opened, this occuring after i had spent the day prior to seeing it in front of my TV in a marathon LOTR fest; i had hired the first two in prep for the last. it is therefore necessary for me to say that i had this unexplained excitement that churned inside me in expectation of seeing the last installment of this utterly amazing story. As with all expectations, i was extremely worried about how i will recieve the movie. Expectation, at least in my case, normally always leads to disasterous disappointment. How wrong i was! Just as in the past, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and finally the Return of the king, captivated me. I watched this movie with awe. every scene, every word, every character, evoked my emotions. i found myself unknowingly smiling and then crying along with Sam. it was beautifully made. The cast was superb, and will definitely live on in my mind for years to come. The highlights then... Viggo Mortessen - I will NEVER be able to love another man! :) He was amazing. He embodied Aragorn and brought him to life in a way that will make him a hero that will live in the hearts of many for years to come. My King. Liv Tyler - A trully beautiful actress who brought a softness and a kindness to Arwen that was painful to watch. Her scenes with Aragorn, in all the movies are the most emotionally provoking. If i never said it before, i say it now - much praise to LIV!!! Orlando Bloom - I thought i loved him in Pirates of the Caribbean. i did, but i love him more now. i read somewhere that he had initially auditioned for the part of Faramir, but got Legolas Greenleaf instead. Wonderful, what more can i say? His chemistry with Gimli the Dwarf was wonderful to watch, making me laugh before i started to cry - again...! The Hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and my personal favourite, Pippin - I find myself running out of adjectives! Elija was amazing, Sean was amazing, they all were. I cried for Frodo, then i cried for Sam. You cannot help but weep when you realise that although Frodo changed the course of all who lived in middle earth, he paid a price that was perhaps too high. he would never be the same. i bawled! Gandalf - Is there anything to say about Sir Ian? Lots, but nothing bad! Absolutely flawless Lastly, i add a special wow to the Elvin soldier who died in the battle at Helmsdeep in The Two Towers. Haldir of Lorian, Craig Parker, Much love!!! "We come to honour that allegence..." HELL yeah! :) to the cast, crew, directors, everyone involved in this project, i say thank you. it is not often when the written word if brought to life in a way that will make the author proud. In this case, there is no other opinion. Peter jackson, you are a genius. Im purchasing all three these movies, and keeping it forever! 10/10
10.0~Fantastic!!! No other words ArwenEvenstar68 Sign in Permalink I am saddened to learn that Sean Astin was not nomitated for Best Supporting Actor. This movie, in my opinion, was the best of the 3. Not to say the others were not good. It's just that this movie was everything I anticipated and more. Nothing I say would do this movie justice.
10.0~Any film that makes a grown man cry is very special!! robbo-30 Sign in Permalink I was always cynical of anyone filming "lord of the rings", I have read the book so many times and its magic seems way beyond anything cinema could achieve. WRONG!!! From the first image of Fellowship, I was sold! Yes changes were made, this was inevitable, but generally every image of middle earth matched almost all the images my mind had imagined. The scope of "fellowship" was amazing, and "the two towers" just piled in visual shock after shock, both stunning achievements. Onto Return of the King then. I am a 40 year old man, a Tolkien fan, who took time off from work to be at the first showing of Return of the King in Newcastle, England. From the Smeagol backstory onward, the film never let go of my emotions. The effects surpassed any in Two Towers, and the characterisations progressed way beyond the introduction of the Fellowship. The film constantly hammers at your heart, demanding that you genuinely care for these people. Pippin and Merry find paths way beyond what they ever dreamed they could achieve. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas powerhouse their way towards destiny. Gandalf again becomes all things to everyone, refusing to let anyone believe in the ultimate end, that Sauron may rule over all. As for Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, this is where the film took control of me. To see the friendship between Frodo and Sam manipulated by Smeagol/Gollum, Frodo always hoping that Smeagol will "come back" to the good of middle earth, the performances of Frodo, Sam, and "Smeagol" raise this film way above anything achieved before. Is the ending overextended? Probably , yes, but if Peter Jackson had anywhere near as much sadness saying goodbye to these characters as I did, then I cannot criticise such an ending. As I said in the title, I cried openly during this film, it genuinely moved me, and its theme of friendship reminded me of the importance of many of the key people in my life. The King has returned, and anyone who is still unsure as to whether they want to watch his journey, I say if you do not, then you will miss one of the great cinema or movie experiences that our lifetime is likely to contain.

10.0~Just an amazing epic which concludes the trilogy andrew-ski Sign in Permalink I love this movie almost as much as the second in the trilogy (my favorite movie). The one complaint (even though it goes with the book perfectly) is Aragorns saving of Gondor with the dead army. For some reason it just seems to easy for them to win like that but it is in the book. To make up for that battle just watch the extended edition of the final battle at the black gates of Mordor which I loved. The whole story is such a great rendering of the book that i cant vote anything but a ten. Some of my other favorite parts are when Frodo wakes up at the end, and when Bilbo goes to live with the elves. If you want to know more about this series check out a book called The Silmarilion which covers the making of the earth and the first and second ages. There are many references in the Lord of the rings to events which happened before most of the characters time (excepting the immortal elves of course). Best Trilogy Ever.
4.0~Boring mika_alasalmi Sign in Permalink The lord of the ring movies are the most overrated movies I have ever seen. I can't understand why there had to be three films instead of one. These films are extremely boring and they are even worse in the extended edition versions. I have seen both versions of the whole trilogy and I have also read the book which is a lot better than the films. When I had seen the first thirty minutes of this film it was already like When will this end?! Only the battle scenes where something that can be watched once and Peter Jackson ruined them with those stupid looking computer effects and -creatures which I hate. Why did the ending have to be so long? After Gollum fell to the volcano with the ring there was like thirty minutes of this really really boring stuff which included the "heartbreaking" separation of friends and wedding of Aragorn and Arwen. Those things were totally unnecessary but strengthened the image of childish movie. I would really recommend this film...for all who are under the age of 12. Don't get me wrong. I like The Lord of the rings...as a book.
10.0~The Best! UglyKidSem Sign in Permalink One of the best trilogy I've ever seen..This fiction is incredible. Characters and features are thought out.I can watch it without getting bored.
10.0~Great finish to a great trilogy! Endre-Syv Sign in Permalink I think they did a good job with the last movie. Often with in movie series, the quality just sinks with each movie that comes out, but with Lord of the Rings i really think they found a way to avoid that. I am a huge fan of the books and the films really was a good surprise, where movie adaption of books usually disappoints, i was really surprised. Everything was just great, not only with this movie, but with all of them. Music, locations, actors and dialog. Peter Jackson is a world class director and with these movies i really feels that he shows that. Everything was great. Recommend to check out the movies and would encourage everyone to try the books.
10.0~Awe inspring film making jeffchan Sign in Permalink Return of the King is surely one of the most spectacular films yet made. Excellent acting, photography, and effects used in the service of story. This dazzling display of filmaking includes hundreds of real horsemen, thousands of extras, and CGI creatures that are simply spellbinding and easily some of the best anyone has made so far. The tone of this film is remarkably light and gentle for one that partakes of such dense action sequences at times. It maintains its humanity even in the face of the barbaric hammering and destruction of battle. Perhaps it's only shortcoming is that the ending drags on a bit, but in the context of a 9.5 hour marathon, the multiple, consecutive endings could be perfect curtain calls for the cast and tender farewells to beloved characters.
10.0~best movie doll_9903 Sign in Permalink That was the best movie I have seen in my whole entire life. Beats Gone with the Wind. I cried, and I laughed, and I got p*ssed at Gollum and the Steward of Gondor. The acting was fabulous. SEan Astin's portrayl as Sam was awesome~ Sam was truly a hero in this movie, no doubt. Best movie ever. period.
10.0~Fabulous ending to the trilogy katzmiao Sign in Permalink Now that I've seen all three of the Lord of the Ring movies, I'd like to pass along thanks to all the people who came together to make the books a reality. It was nothing short of amazing. If Tolkien himself had been on the set, I don't think a better job could have been done. The attention to even the smallest detail paid off in making the visuals so incredibly realistic in all three movies. You could almost feel yourself there watching the struggle - but from a safe distance. The films do not in any way detract from reading the books. In fact, I find it rather nice to have actual faces and voices to put to the characters as I re-read the books again. The trilogy will always remain a favourite of mine, whether in book form or the movies. There were changes made to the original, but the story itself was told pretty much in its entirety. This will undoubtedly be the benchmark for all future movies of this type for many years to come. While the end of the movie differed greatly from the book, the story `ended' the same way. The book ending was actually covered in Galadriel's mirror so nothing was really left out or lost.
10.0~Beyond Magic dre-velation2012 Sign in Permalink The Lord of The Rings trilogy, is the greatest trilogy of all time! Each individual movie brought something new and amazing. These movies are absolutely flawless! This story, being about 50 years old i believe, is phenomenal. I remember being read the book the Hobbit when I was in fourth grade, I was a fan back then! J.r.r Tolken, obviously was a story telling genius, and this action packed, mystically aesthetic adventure, does great justice to the books. Brings fresh new vitality to the imagination. I do have a slight complaint though....why didn't Gandolf use more magic? He could have easily thrown lightning bolts or fire balls at the Orc army as he rode down the hill (forgot which movie). Or many other times he could have gave Froto a quick levatation boost when necessary. Or did his morality as a Wizard disallow him to tip the scales? Was it because he views Humans and Hobbits almost as children, and wants them to learn and achieve on their own? The world may never know.
10.0~A stupendous conclusion to a classic trilogy solandriel Sign in Permalink In summary, this movie rocked my world. In more detail, this was the movie moment of the century, and it will take something very special to beat this in my eyes (maybe Spidey 2, who knows?) The cast were uniformly superb, all of them giving everything to their performances, creating a level of emotion and empathy not normally seen in the fantasy genre. The visual effects were absolutely stunning, with Gollum once again stealing the show for realism. This will form the benchmark for virtual characters for years to come. Peter Jackson obviously loves his craft as well as his audience. Each shot created to further the story, not to try and push your brain out of the back of your head. The narrative was realized to perfection, and it certainly did not seem 3 hours 15 minutes long. I gave this movie 10 out of 10, but only because the score only went up to 10. Whatever it was out of, this movie would have got the maximum for me.
10.0~Superb! hidden4hidden Sign in Permalink Brilliant movie!! Just like the other 2, 'The lord of the rings, The return of the king' is a true masterpiece! Brilliant music, acting and everything else there is to mention in a movie. Though there is one thing that has annoyed me through all 3 films. Arwen! Being played by Liv Tyler has done the charakter of the Elven-lady no good. But that is of course only my opinion! Back to the actual point, I only have one comment left: If you haven't already, you should see this movie. It's worth every penny!
10.0~A great and powerful ending to a great and power story. robyn_mallia Sign in Permalink The ending to Lord of the Rings is not only great and powerful but it will become a movie that is remembered for ages. The actors portrayed the characters perfectly,their performances are memorable and the story is unforgetable. This movie and its actors deserve a nods at the Oscars this year.
9.0~Except for too many endings, the movie was fantastic arsars-33341 Sign in Permalink The conclusion we've all been waiting for does not fail to disappoint. Its a fantastic conclusion. The characters are even more well-developed and rounded than before. The action and fantasy elements are breathtaking without any dull moments. Also, the final battle is so epic, you'll be drooling with excitement. Its a perfect movie; and a great end to the best trilogy in cinema history.
10.0~Looses Nothing Rainey-Dawn Sign in Permalink The 3rd and final film of the LotR series. This one looses nothing it only continues the story. Picks up right where "Two Towers" leaves off. Grittier story, more foe & dirtier grittier battles - the worst is yet to come... The Witch King of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgul. This film has an air of horror to it... more frightening than the first two films. In the end, you whistle is wet for more. A wicked film well worth watching. High fantasy fans as well as those who love a lot of action and adventure will enjoy watching this one for the first time or again and again. 10/10
6.0~Disappointed. Wait for DVD. FlyingGMan Sign in Permalink I'm very much a fan of the books, but I feel the movie must stand on it's own. And in this case, I feel the movie didn't quite succeed. To make a movie based on a book, the writer/director must take liberties with the story. They must cut back drastically to fit the time constraints and sometimes will add to fill in gaps or to make the story more accessible for the current audience. I've no problem with either. The movie is not the book. The movie must be judged not by how it much it supplements or is faithful to the book but on it's own merit. And knowledge of the book should not be used to gloss over problems with the movie. My main problem with this movie is in the number of major storylines (according to the movie!) that are not sufficiently fleshed out. Some examples: ** BEGIN SPOILERS ** Denethor. Ok...he's crazy...I guess. But based upon what we learn FROM THE MOVIE we haven't a clue way. Maybe there was a line by Gandolf somewhere that hinted at it, but good story-telling provides stronger revelations than another character saying why things are they way they are. And what was with his love for Boromir instead of Faramir? The movie didn't explain it to me, so I never really got it. Faramir. We see a lot of him, and we actually are given reasons to care about him. So why doesn't the movie give us a more satisfying resolution to his story than a 1 second pan across him in a crowd with Eowyn...who also deserved a better resolution. We get 30 minutes of post-ring endings. Couldn't they get maybe 20-30 seconds? And did I miss something? When did they even meet? Eowyn. She gives Aragorn some food at an encampment and thinks they're dating? Maybe I forgot something from TTT, but I never really saw Aragorn give her much more than the time of day, so she must be delusional to think there's something between them. And Aragorn broke up with her even though he never really liked her? Huh? ** END SPOILERS ** My second problem with this movie is the ending. I blame Lucas for what I call "the Stars Wars ending". After the climax, show a group photo with everyone standing around smiling at each other without any dialog. And for greater impact, add a large mass of people who are watching! This is the cinematic equivalent to "...and they lived happily ever after". It's cheap and meaningless. It may work for Snow White and Cinderella (and even Stars Wars : A New Hope), but not for anything with more substance than that. Good storytelling doesn't resort to cheap tricks like this. ** BEGIN SPOILERS ** An epic of this magnitude requires a much more satisfying ending. We became involved with a number of characters and want to know how things ended for them. In response, it appears that RotK gives us at least three Stars Wars endings (the bed, the coronation, the bar) before giving us something real. Cut the sugar-sappy Star Wars endings and jump right to the Shire and the departure of Frodo and Bilbo and it'd clean up the movie tremendously. (Good storytelling can also choose to NOT resolve storylines...leaving it up to the viewer to ponder. For that, this movie would have ended with Frodo/Sam stranded on Mt Doom after destruction of the ring. I usually prefer endings like that, but it wouldn't work for this story.) ** END SPOILERS ** 30 minutes is a short period of time to give us closure on all the storylines, so use the time wisely. Maybe even cut 10 minutes out of the battle (GASP!) and resolve ALL the storylines for us. I rate the movie 6.5/10 : 1 point off for incomplete major storylines, 1 point for cheapening the movie with multiple Star Wars endings, half a point for the whole Agent Elrond character (ala Matrix), half a point for non-imaginative Stars Wars knock-off battle scenes (including the Daredevil/Legolas acrobatics), half a point for some other miscellaneous gaffs too numerous and varied to elaborate on each. Final conclusion: Eye-candy can't substitute for real story telling. Skip the theatrical release and wait for the Extended Edition DVD. Maybe then they'll get it right.
10.0~Fantasy world of brilliant make believe sawolaja Sign in Permalink This is a film from start to finish that takes you on an epic and beautiful journey. The scenery shots and locations are breath taking. The dialog spoken very cleverly done. The narrative of the film is never lost or dull. The acting is of the highest quality, the story line has all the ingredients put together in their right measures, its dramatic, exciting and full of unexpected twists and turns. A must see movie. You'll be enchanted.
10.0~Lack of superlatives pauldelery Sign in Permalink There are not enough superlatives to describe, for those of us that firmly believe in this film, the impact and depth of emotion wrought by this film. My sincerest thanks to all involved that have brought this story to film. Thank you for giving us this wondrous holiday gift!
10.0~Best. Movie. EVER!!! JustiNYork Sign in Permalink I saw ROTK on opening day. I knew I was going to love it, and my friends loved it too. If you want a good action/war film, see this, but see the Fellowship and The Two Towers first! The CGI effects were incredible, and the battle scenes were amazing.
10.0~Part 3: It's Not Really the Thought that Counts mstomaso Sign in Permalink Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit "Chronological" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat. Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers. Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come. The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films. The casting and acting are superb. The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown. Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films. Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.

7.0~Somewhat Lacking canuck4uall Sign in Permalink The third installment of the Lord of the Rings was a good movie, however, I had many problems with the character development and acting in the movie. Sean Astin and Elijah Wood, (the only two exceptions,) played the roles of Frodo and Samwise admirably. Even with some of the adaptations from Peter Jackson's interpretation of the books, the story is still intriguing. However, none of the other characters in the remaining part of the fellowship suffered no more than 3 seconds of any kind of acting at a time, as nearly all the dialogue from the book is erased. And at the ending sequence, when Frodo wakes up, the cheerful scenes drag on forever, when Peter Jackson could have saved it by cutting off half the slow motion and instead, showing the last parts of the book with the burning & enslavement of the shire, and the uprising that followed. All in all, it was a good movie. Cinematic, epic, and, above all, bloody.
5.0~Drama = Whispering? chowjoe Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson handles spectacle well but doesn't know when to stop. The homoerotic subtext of the Frodo-Sam plot line is kind of amusing if not so very repetitive. I keep waiting for them to kiss (or at least rub each other's grubby little feet) and get it over with. Viggo Mortenson seems to play a character in desperate need of a bath, especially when standing next to his comrade-in-arms Orlando Bloom, who looks like an Ivory Soap model. But aside from all that, since when has delivering dialog in a whisper become a shorthand for drama and intensity? Granted, Hitchcock and Welles had their actors whispering in moments of high drama as well, but they were usually justified by context. Maybe the likes of Viggo and Liv Tyler (and that barely comprehensible Gollum dude) just lack the vocal chops for high drama. That's probably why Ian McKellen is the standout actor in this whole mess. I enjoy the flick much more when he shows up. He speaks clearly and looks like he bathes regularly.
10.0~We'll never see the like again aeolianknight Sign in Permalink There is absolutely no question the this was a labor of love for Mr. Jackson and all who took part in it. A labor of love that all movie lovers are very grateful for. Even at such an extreme length when including the other two films. And even with all that was left out from the novels, especially Tom Bombadil. It is an achievement that should last forever. Even in my wildest dreams I never thought that it could look this good. Perhaps it doesn't pack the emotional wallop that the book does at times (see Eowyn's triumphant moment) but the visuals are so tremendous that you willingly overlook the minute negatives. All in all a tremendous achievement. I honestly believe that we'll never see the like again.
9.0~good overall leaferrer Sign in Permalink I don't usually watch things like this, but I must say I wasn't expecting something this good.
9.0~A Triumph, A Masterpiece Route 66 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is a triumph of filmmaking. From the acting, editing, cinematography to the CG effects. Everything fit together flawlessly. The Return of the King seals the truth that The Lord of the Rings is truly the best trilogy ever made in film. Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece, a lifetime achievement that few men ever achieve. The Lord of the Rings was a finely crafted trilogy of fantasy and fiction that was under appreciated by many, leaving it to a sub culture of Lord of the Rings fans. With the advent of The Fellowship of the Ring the amazing story and characters of the Lord of Rings were opened up to anyone and everyone who can go to the movies. Now in every dramatization of a movie there is a wide margin of space in which the movie can totally destroy the book, but Peter Jackson has taken the book and made a tribute and a shrine to the books. Instead of adapting the books, the films take the best, loving and feeling the true emotions contained in the book. I cannot describe the amazing triumph of emotion, action and drama the Lord of the Rings trilogy protrays, it's necessary to see the movie for yourself.
10.0~Exceeded My Greatest Expectations wilsona3mu Sign in Permalink It's rare to find a movie that lives-up to the hype made by critics. "Return of the King" does not disappoint--in fact, it is the first movie I have watched that completely went beyond my expectations. Some will say some scenes are dragged out. But those "dragged out" scenes make the other ones so spectacular. I won't go into detail about the movie. I hate reading spoilers. Do yourself a favor: watch this movie as soon as you can, if you haven't already. That way you can make your own decision on what you think of it. 10 out of 10
10.0~Great Material, Faithfully Filmed,and a great action film jsparacino Sign in Permalink I didn't get to see Return of the King on the silver screen, so I had to borrow from a friend. As soon as I got home,I watched it. WOW, I had never seen a movie with so much story to tell and action to carry that story. Aragorn, revealed as the heir to the throne of Gondor, receives Anduril from Elrond and takes the Paths of the Dead. Frodo and Sam, with their guide Gollum, move closer to Mordor. The Black Gate is shut and the only way into Mordor is the Pass of Cirith Ungol, the lair of Shelob the spider. Pippin, after having looked into the palantir, is taken to Minas Tirith. After having sworn service to the Steward, he can tell that Denethor's two sons were treated differently. Boromir, the oldest and favorite, and the one he wants to go to the Council of Elrond. At first, Boromir doesn't want to go, Faramir offers to go in his brother's place. If Denethor knew one of his sons was going to die, he would have sent Faramir, no questions asked. At the end, all the love stories(Namely the obvious love story that we see going on in Fellowship of the Ring),all those loose ends are tied. Overall, Return of the King was a magnificent end to a good trilogy. (And, Tolkien has stopped turning over in his grave).
10.0~A breathtaking fantasy epic. tyson-hunsaker Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings is was directed by Peter Jackson and features some of cinema's most iconic, epic, and incredible story elements in film history. It's grand, spectacular, and incredibly dense when one experiments with the extended versions. Adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's incredible book might go down as one of the most ambitious film projects of all time and it sure paid off. Considering the consistency in production of all three films, this review includes personal thoughts about the entire trilogy and will tackle the all three films from a more general standpoint since my opinion on all three are pretty much the same. Shooting in New Zealand might've been one of the best production decisions they had to make. Landscape shots in each film completely immerse you in this fantasy world which you completely believe is nothing but middle-earth. While CGI did have immense benefits during production. It's definitely apparent practical sets, props, and costumes were utilize to feel more authentic instead of obvious and generic green screen. Each film stands well alone as it's own independent story but when you watch all of them you see the entire story arc for each character from beginning to end which yields an incredibly satisfying ending for each character. Seeing how each one changes in their own and unique way is seeing how understanding of a writer Tolkien was and how genius the filmmakers were in expressing those stories and deeply thought-provoking themes explored in such an epic and thorough way. Each scene feels necessary and not a moment in the stories do we feel bored or wanting something else. Each section of the story whether it be brutal war sequences or character developing dialogue scenes, they feel fascinating and satisfying enough to engage the audience no matter who they are. While few can complain about minor plot flaws or changes made from the book (which are very few), no one can deny the cinematic brilliance of the Lord of the Rings trilogy or its impact on modern filmmaking. It will forever be remembered as one of the best movie trilogies of all time and a fantasy epic that will be damn near impossible to rival in scope, ambition, and appeal. If you haven't seen this marvelous trilogy yet, see it as soon as possible. The extended versions are well worth your time as well given the additional footage that provides clear context and further character motivations. This will be a long and time consuming endeavor but when it's over, it will change the viewer to some degree. Don't let these films go unseen.
10.0~Different from the book but perfect for the movie ss454327-1 Sign in Permalink It deviated from the book a bit and left out some stuff I was looking forward to but it was perfect for the movie. The first movie left out a lot from the book that I felt SHOULD have been left out. I think Peter Jackson did an excellent job with the whole series. I never even watched the first one until a week before the 2nd one came out because I thought for sure it was never going to live up to the books. Well it did! Almost all the changes were right on the money and the story and dialog follow the movie very well. For all the haters out there they need to look at The Cat in the Hat and see just how bad it could have been and thank PJ for something that I will be proud to show my children. They will still have to read the books first!
10.0~yes, as good as expected. existency Sign in Permalink I' m not going to go into too much details in respect for the few(I hope) who haven't seen this movie. First of all, ROTK is flawless. There is nothing to complain about and if there was, I would feel too guilty to even bring it up(maybe i'm just not a good reviewer). The thing is, ROTK isn't just flawless, being flawless(post-any lord of the rings movie) is not good enough, it's a masterpiece. It can't have been any better. The "bar" the Matrix sequels attempted to raise has been shot up to the sky. Yes - the story/directing/cinematography are all amazing.Yes - The acting is oscar-worthy for most performances.Yes - the special effects are groundbreaking.Yes - .... yes yes. I can't bring up anything negative. The few complaints I've heard are:1) Eowyn's acting not being good enough.2) Gandalf not using his magic enough.3) The special effects when Gollum jumps on Frodo while he's invisible ruining a scene. For me, these complaints are proof of how good ROTK really is. It's as if they tried desperately to try and find something wrong with the movie and came up with these sorry excuses for flaws. What the most important part about the LOTRs trilogy is, is the fact that, indirectly, it has improved movies. By raising the bar to such heights future directors (who are passionate about their work and not cash-ins) will want to surpass it and as a result work harder on offering quality and creativity. In fact, I believe LOTR is a first step towards a more American/European film standard which manages to incorporate the best of both worlds. Both deep and entertaining, philosophical and fun. I gave ROTK 10/10 not only because of how much I loved watching it but also because of how grateful I am that it has improved the standards and as a result the movies I will be seeing in the future. Thank you Peter Jackson.
10.0~no words available hansbearnl Sign in Permalink Well, being privileged to watch the movie in New zealand at the world premiere it feels bad I can't vote yet for the movie!!! 10 out of 10 for sure, and I have already invited as many friends who can't afford a ticket as possible to watch the 3rd and final episode of this trilogy. I do have a feeling overall however that somehow I feel as betrayed as Gandalf does when he meets Saruman. Peter Jackson's words about reading the books over and over again during the making off doesn't make much sense to me with so much left out, replaced or invented. However, two thumbs up. This third one is even better then 1 and 2, and I wish I could give 11 points instead of 10 (...). especially Ian who plays Gandalf and Viggo, grow even more in their caracters. Viggo is really the king of this movie, and does he deserve an Oscar? yes, he does! Not to mention the special effects and costumes. It is one of those rare movies where the special effects are lifelike, and you feel a part of this big event unfolding on screen. I agree with others: forget about the Matrix, Lord of the rings the trilogy,I hope to see them all as ONE long 9 or 10 hours long movie in the cinema. I'll make sure I bring breakfast, lunch and dinner (will be terrible though if I really got to leave for the toilet then...)
10.0~WAS WORTH NOT GETTING TO SLEEP TO SEE... thenatureboy Sign in Permalink Most times, events which are hyped up never measure up to the expectations (Star Wars Prequels; Godfather III; any of Costner's movies from the last 10 years), but the Return of the King was certainly worth having to go to work on 3 hours sleep to manage the midnight showing I went to on December 16th, 2003. Here are a few reasons the movie is a work of art: The Acting: 1) Sean Astin was great. Having seen all 3 movies, although Aragorn and Frodo are heroic, this story seems to be Sam's story. I found myself caring more about and for his character than any other. 2) Ian McKellen carried the middle portion of the movie. More than anything else, McKellen's Gandalf brought energy to the screen. As fantastical as the concept of a "Wizard" is, McKellen makes Gandalf a real person doing extraordinary things. 3) Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for best supporting actor. Period. The Directing: If David Lean is the benchmark for "old" Hollywood, then Peter Jackson is the new king of the CGI era. He kept the action moving and (other than an ending which lingered on a little) did not disappoint. The Story: Thank you J.R.R. Tolkien for your imagination and depth. I strongly urge people to see this movie. I am the proud owner of Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers DVD, extended editions. I am eagerly awaiting the third extended edition so that I can - in one day's sitting - see what Jackson's full vision is for this material. In the meantime, please catch this movie on the big screen.
7.0~A Different Take on Return of the King stealth4386 Sign in Permalink So many people are praising this movie and think it is amazing. While I agree that this movie is very good overall, I wanted to give a different review, showing the negatives. I think it's best to start with the main character, Frodo. While Frodo was a smart, strong character in The Fellowship of the Ring, he is suddenly weak throughout most of this movie. It's not good to make the main character weak all the time, because the movie loses its drive. Frodo is always tired and desperate. Every step is a mountain for him, and he barely does anything. After all his time spent with his best friend Sam, he is still too immature to trust Sam, ignore Gollum's lies, and resist the urge to keep the ring for himself. He and Sam are way too isolated in the movie, so much so that the viewers basically forget about them as they focus on the epic battle scenes with all the other characters. Instead of Frodo conquering himself as he should have, Sam has to help him along the whole time, even to the point of carrying him. Frodo's finger is bitten off at the end. It just doesn't seem right to leave the main character with part of his limb gone. Frodo's reaction to Gandalf near the end is creepy more than happy. At the end, Frodo is taken off with Gandalf to some far away place. We have no idea where he is going or why he is taken. Sam is way too dominating and emotional. The movie ends with Sam strangely, as if the director is completely obsessed with him for some reason. Sam marries a woman who has not been mentioned in the entire trilogy, and he looks too young to even get married. Also, Sam finds Frodo suffocating in a web completely covering him, yet he only unbinds his head and then decides that Frodo is dead. Gandalf loses his sense of humor. He sleeps with his eyes open. He charges through a city on horseback without hesitation, and no one seems to get run over. Aragorn's huge kiss with Arwen is way too much at the end of the movie. His singing is not needed after he becomes king. His bowing to the hobbits is also out of place. Saruman completely disappears. I honestly can't remember what happened to him. It's not right to take one of the main villains out of the picture with no explanation. Gollum appears in the first scene and fights with his cousin over the ring. The scene is a flashback to an earlier time. Those who are not watching the Lord of the Rings films back to back may be confused. Pippin is too prevalent. I think he is supposed to provide comedy relief, but he ends up being an annoying, dopey distraction in the battle scenes. In the scene with Denethor, his cheesy kissing of the ring is not needed. Also, his singing during the battle led by Faramir is not needed. Legolas barely has any parts. He is mostly nonexistent for the first part of the movie. He later explodes on the scene by killing the elephant. More character development was needed with Legolas in this film, and, quite frankly, throughout the entire trilogy. Eowen doesn't fit in the battle scenes. She is the only woman in the battle, too. Why didn't other women fight? Eowen especially doesn't fit killing the Lord of the Nazgul. She isn't a major character. I honestly think Frodo should have killed him because Frodo was the one who was stabbed by him in Fellowship of the Ring. Also, Eowen took way too much time to react to Theodin's death. And what is the point of Eowen's romance with Aragorn? It never leads to anything. The Lord of the Nazgul appears out of nowhere. He was never mentioned in the first two films. He says that no one can defeat him. Let's imagine that he did indeed stab Frodo in Fellowship of the Ring, as Gandalf said. Well, Aragorn chased the Nazgul attacker away. Thus, the Lord of the Nazgul must have been defeated. Faramir is wounded and trapped by the enemy, yet we later seem him alive and helpless in the palace shortly before his mad father tries to burn him to death. Shortly after Faramir is rescued, he disappears. It defeats the point of rescue if the character disappears shortly after. Grima Wormtongue, a major villain in The Two Towers, is not shown. In Two Towers, he was sent away. He disappears along with his master, Saruman. Theodin is the only memorable character that dies. Why don't more characters die? There are too many battles and too many Orcs for so many on the good side to remain alive. The movie doesn't have enough comedy relief as the first two films did. A movie that long and loaded needs that relief. Finally, the end is way too long and left me feeling very disappointed with the film. Why does it go on way after the ring is destroyed? I began to forget the wonderful scenes earlier and get very bored with the emotional, drawn out goodbye scenes and the odd return to the Shire. The Shire wasn't really needed to end out such a strong movie. The movie should have ended with Aragorn's new kingship at Minas Tirith. Frodo's uncle, unusually aged in the past four years, is suddenly brought back and he joins Frodo and Gandalf in their unexplainable journey. I think the producers didn't know how to end the movie. Therefore, they decided to make it epic by adding thirty minutes of fluff. They then begin the credits with a casual, modern-sounding song that doesn't fit with a medieval/fantasy movie like Return of the King.
10.0~now we can see the world through tolkien's eyes bir_ka Sign in Permalink About three years ago, i just hated the idea of watching this trilogy, now i love it. personally, i think, FOTR was the most interesting part of the trilogy, with its explanation of the story and background, with the introduction of the main characters, but the most touching part is this - the return of the king. i laughed (not to often, ok), i cried, and i was afraid of all the danger around our heroes. the way, tolkien described their way, was perfectly brought to screen by jackson, we are able to feel their pain, feel the little hope, the sadness. i've never been touched by a movie in that way, and i'm afraid, i will never be again. A lot of people aren't satisfied with the different endings, this movie has got, but i think, every closing has its right to be. after this journey of about 9 or even 10 hours, it's impossible to let this movie end at just one point. every step in the future live of all of them is necessary, and i enjoyed every ending as much as i felt with them during their fights and sadness. So, the journey is over, with a perfect ending. if you haven't seen this movie (and FOTR + TTT), go and see it. you haven't to be a fantasy-fan nor you have to know tolkien's story. it's a perfect movie about friendship, love, war, and about the fact, that even the brave little man can change the world! 10/10
10.0~Wow! clarinets Sign in Permalink I don't know what I can say about this movie that has not already been said. This movie was very profound, and one that I look forward to seeing again many times at the theatres, and owning the DVD. It's an incredible story of adventure, fantasy, and love. It's a perfect climactic ending to a story told in three parts. 10/10
1.0~Spectacular special effects, and script defects. doug7347 Sign in Permalink If you are a Tolkien fan, I guess this is as good as it gets. For the rest of us, it's just another movie, and a fairly peculiar one. Imagine Star Wars "Return of the Jedi" without an appearance by Darth Vader or the Evil Emperor. That's what you get here. A struggle between good and evil, with the leaders of the evil hordes conspicuously absent. It's quite strange! Then there's the consistent theme that the better looking you are, the better your character is. Dr. King convinced me that it was the content of my character that counted, not my appearance. But in all three movies of this trilogy the two go together quite closely. It's an old Hollywood theme, but not particularly to be admired. As for Aragorn preferring Arwen to Eowen, I suppose there is just no accounting for taste; and I'm sure it is faithful to the author. And what can one say about the seemingly endless multiple endings? Not very dramatic, but perhaps more interesting than the usual single climactic ending. So on the whole I find the "Return of the King" a watchable film, but hardly one of the greatest of all time. Eleven Oscars? I guess it must have been a bad year for movies. Now that you mention it, there's been a lot of those in recent years.
10.0~Give 'em the trophy! Skattershot Sign in Permalink I could go on about the awesome scope of the battles, but why bother? I could gush about some incredible performances, but why bother? I could mention all the moments when I wanted to cheer, shout, cry, but you've heard it already, so why bother? I could quibble about the ending, Saruman's absence, any of the tiny flaws, but why bother? Simply put, movies don't get much better than this. Give 'em the trophy!
10.0~Brilliant conclusion to trilogy SPOILERS Bottlebrush Sign in Permalink I like this film very much, though FOTR for me is the best. The cast was superb, as ever, as were the visuals and the emotional elements of the film - I felt they went back to what we saw in FOTR in their intensity. I loved the Faramir/Denethor/Pippin sequences; Gandalf's ride up to Minas Tirith and his 'white shores' speech; the ride of the Rohirrim; the lighting of the beacons; the screeching Nazgul and the beacon thing that shot up from Minas Morgul; 'I'm glad to be with you Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things'; 'I do not say do not weep . . .' among many other things. Actors who really stood out for their fine performances in this film include Ian McKellen, David Wenham, Bernard Hill, John Noble and Elijah Wood. I did feel that ROTK suffered from the changes that were made to Tolkien's story in TTT - the filmmakers had to catch up on ground lost in that film, which really bore little resemblance to Tolkien's story, despite brilliant casting, acting and visuals (Where was Eomer? Gandalf? Faramir? Why the weak Theoden? Why the Warg fights, dream sequences and unnecessary expansion of Arwen's role at the expense of crucial elements of the story?). I felt that the Gollum/Smeagol sequence should have been in TTT not ROTK, and that it is a great shame that Saruman was not seen in ROTK - apart from anything else, it's too bad that he wasn't given credit for his sterling work on and enthusiasm for the trilogy. His apparent ill treatment by the filmmakers left me feeling rather bad for him. I am really looking forward to the Extended Edition of the film - the cinema edition was incomplete, in my view, with some very obvious cuts, for instance the Houses of Healing/resolution of Faramir and his talks with Aragorn, which would have affirmed the latter as the rightful king of Gondor, the Black Gate/ MOS, Gandalf's confrontation with the Witch-King, etc. I also think it would have been good to include a proper representation of Denethor, and to have seen Gandalf show the White Tree seedling to Aragorn. Lots of things have not been explained in the film. Despite all this, the film is incredible - as is the whole trilogy. They are the only films I've seen (much) more than once in the cinema, and I really appreciate the huge effort made by PJ and other people involved in the films. IMHO appreciation of the films will grow with the passage of time, and we will not see their like for many years to come. The end of each year in future is going to seem rather bleak . . .
10.0~Compelling, Inspiring, Comforting...Excellent! hikree Sign in Permalink On my way to the theater I decided that Return of the King would be excelllent. On the way home I tried to effectively describe what I saw and what was most excellent about a movie going experience like none other I've had. The following may contain a dreaded SPOILER although I won't completely dissect the entire film. The background of Gollum was a welcomed introduction to the festivities. It was frightening how he became evil so quickly to gain his precious birthday gift. Quite a nice way to immediately remind us of the power of The One Ring. The character development was compelling in the first part of the movie. The heroism was inspiring in the middle and the bow neatly tied on this grand present by Peter Jackson was comforting in it's ending. Just some of the highlights without a lot of detail. I'll leave the award donning to the Oscar committee, but this film is truly worthy of many winners. The "great" Black Rider who claimed no man could kill him found out that he was right. The battle at Minis Tirith does make the battle at Helm's Deep seem like a skirmish. The "dead army" was only disappointing in that they were simply so destructive they overcame their foes too quickly. Pippin and Merry perform every way you would dream they would. Faramir does show his "quality", albeit resignedly, but hey, who is going to get excited about leading his troops into the shortest battle in the history of war. Gandalf truly displays a White Wizard as "Saruman should have been". Aragorn becomes kingly in a kingly way. Frodo and Sam are simply as determined as anyone could possibly be. A gentleman walked out of the theater during the attack of Shelob, please don't make that mistake! Gimli and Leoglas provide solid performances with timely humor and who cares if Legolas' stunt in battle is a hint too obviously computer generated at points, it was too cool for me to care. Sure we don't see Saruman, but that's life in the movies when huge books are adapted to film as some other scenes that would have been nice to see. Peter Jackson's direction was on the mark and I don't envy his having to make those tough decisions with all of the passion he obviously had for this project. The ending completes the book. Sure it seemed over and then started up again, but the pace of telling 3 story lines became the telling of 1 story line. The only full black screen was prior to Sam and Frodo's arrival of transporation back to Minis Tirith and it certainly wouldn't have done for a quick cut when one of the rescuers was just seen standing in the ruins of Mordor. The movie ends exactly as the story of the first hobbit adventure began, in a hole in the ground...and that means comfort! 10/10
10.0~Absolute Masterpiece RolandDeschain Sign in Permalink When I went and saw the first LOTR at a midnight showing my hopes were high. After having read the books countless times the movie was something I was dieing to see. Three hours later, I was wishing that the 2nd two parts could be shown then as well. The 2nd film was amazing, the battle of Helm's Deep alone was something worth spending the money to see. The third film however was breathtaking all the way through. The costumes and effects were astonishing in all three films, but the final films battle scenes and everything were completely unmatched. Very deserving of every award this movie received. I could stand to watch the unedited (rumored 5 hours) version of this without any break. I was afraid that a movie could ruin an incredible story and book, like so many often have but what Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew of these movies did was just outstanding.
7.0~Falls short in the end. potter-4 Sign in Permalink Although I felt this movie was great on a lot of levels (great acting, great scenic vistas, great battles, etc.), the problem of the overblown ending took the wind out of it sails. I guess trying to be as true to the book as possible did it in for me, otherwise I would have rated this much higher.
10.0~Amazing warcraftbattleox Sign in Permalink The books were amazin The films were amazin 10/10 Anyone who votes for under 4 is just retarded - i expect personal opinion, but you got to see the incredible effects and filming. For example i would give titanic 5/10 - it's the most boring crap movie i have ever seen in my opinion HOWEVER it's filmed well for its time. The visual effects are impresive and the acting is good. My granma would give it higher than 5 Some apply a little common sense and less stupidity (these doesn't apply to all you not totally retarted voter)
10.0~A Masterpiece Drychtnath Sign in Permalink The third movie is set to be a classic and rightfully so. Being a huge fantasy reader and admirer of the rare Fantasy films we see that are good, I would have took kindly to Lord Of The Rings had it been a mediocre trilogy. It however is not. This movie in particular stands out when thinking of Lord Of The Rings, although slow at the start it quickly speeds up and stays at that pace until the end. The directing was quality and the special effects made it worth watching all on their own. Spectacular. I've never been so impressed with a movie and never so excited to see it. After The Matrix: Revolutions I thought that this last part may have been a let down and another great trilogy would have been run down at the end. Possibly the hardest film to pull off as a success has done so, and done so with style. It exceeded my expectations with gripping parts and mind blowing battles. The shivers ran right down my back as I was watching. The movie was not just about hundreds of thousands of warriors going into battle, it had much emotion in it some movies of this type miss. It is not completely accurate as there never has been a movie of this type. We can categorize it and put it into a genre but it stands out on its own. It is by far the best trilogy made with each film just increasing in its glory. The best movie out of the three Lord Of The Ring films. The best fantasy movie ever made. Possibly the best movie ever made. In my opinion it is. I hope it knocks off Titanic and breaks new records. I hope it becomes rated amongst The Godfather and Citizen Kane. It is mind blowing and as once said (on television) 'Everyone on the planet should see this movie' Truly Awesome
10.0~simply the best humbleness Sign in Permalink this film is simply the best, both of the trilogy and of this type of epic film making. before the LOTR films people had stopped making this type of epic. not only is the film a technical masterpiece, it also has a heart to it due to the quality of writing and the excellent performances from the actors, especially, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortenson, and Ian Mckellen. This is the only film that has caused me to leave the cinema speechless. Return of the king fully deserved all of the Oscars it won and should also have had nominations in the acting categories. i can't wait to see the extended version on DVD which i have got on order. the parts involving Christopher Lee will be very interesting to see.
6.0~Still black and white. But the spider's cool. kiwikwi Sign in Permalink Not surprisingly, a lot of good plot had been removed from the story, and a lot of bad plot inserted. This is hardly news; the same happened to the two predecessors. Much was lost by skipping "The Scouring of the Shire". The computer graphics are well-done but rarely convincing, and Gollum's only task is to provide comic relief. Most of the audience seemed to find him quite funny. I was just bored. Tolkien's books told a great story basically about the weakness of men (and other races), and the importance of not fighting alone. The best example being the events on the edge of Mount Doom. Tolkien made a strong point in that nobody is perfect, neither perfectly good nor perfectly evil. The film completely ignores this and simplifies things to pure black and white. There's good, and there's evil, with nothing in-between , no shades of grey. And that I think is sad. All that being said, the film has a few but important qualities, and that's the great camera work, the excellent acting and the stunning scenery - CG-scenery too. The rest of the CG is not that interesting, except for Shelob the spider who really makes up for it. The sound of a whole cinema audience simultaneously gasping in horror as ... Well, I won't spoil for those who haven't read the books. But wow. So, in the end, despite all its flaws, I recommend seeing this film. But go see it now, on the big screen. It won't be worth your time on TV.
10.0~Simple a Masterpiece thewillt08 Sign in Permalink Now I'm aware the Lord of The Rings is three movies but in my eyes it is one giant movie and story. They next one also picks up right where the other left off. Here we go the review of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy, The Lord of The Rings. Lord of the Rings is a trilogy of books written a long time ago by J.R.R. Tolkien and it is the most cliché story of good vs. evil. The story is stereotypical, but it works. Tolkien created his own world of Middle-Earth and it is filled with different races and languages. In the beginning magic rings were made but there was one ring made of pure evil, "one ring to rule them all." The maker of this ring was named Sauron and long story short, he was defeated but survived through the ring. The ring passed from person to person and it ended up in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. He has been chosen to destroy the one ring before the armies of Sauron destroy Middle-Earth. The storyline is very cliché. It is a good vs. evil story of epic proportions. If you think you have seen this before, you have, but this is completely different. The little guy saves the day and nobody expected the hobbit with hairy feet to defeat the dark lord. One of the major aspects of this movie is the relationships between characters. Gandalf's relationship with Frodo and the ring. Frodo's relationship with Sam, Gollum, and the Ring. Gollum's relationship with the ring. Merry's relationship with Pippin. All of these relationships drive this movie. Nothing is more powerful then the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Samwise Gamgee is more than Frodo's best friend, he is basically his protector. Sam acts as a barrier between the evil of the ring. Frodo could not have survived without Sam and the roots of this trilogy are the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Sauron has all the power of persuasion, power of armies, fear, and all the power in the world. The only thing more powerful is the love and friendship between two young hobbits who take on this evil power. Coming in second with relationships is between Gollum and the Ring. Think about it, Gollum spent more time with the Ring than anybody else, excluding its master Sauron. Gollum lived with this ring for 500 years. It literally poisoned his mind and turned him into a gangly creature that you can't help but pity. He is easily my favorite character with his complexity and how it isn't his fault that he is the way he is. He is obsessed with the ring and calls it his precious. Any fan of these movies knows what I'm talking about. Over the span of three movies the audience gets their favorite characters and sees them develop. Gimli and Legolas didn't like each other at first because one was a dwarf and the other an elf. "I never thought I'd die side by side with an elf," Gimli says in the final battle. "How about side by side with a friend?" Legolas answers. These two against all odds became friends and were inseparable. You also see Merry and Pippin evolve into something I know I did not expect. In the first movie they were silly and naïve but in the second movie Merry begins to understand the dangers of the world and that it needs saving. Pippin matures a bit late but nevertheless they are two of my favorite characters. These three movies are filled with incredible action scenes and special effects. From Hobbiton to Rivendell to Helms Deep and all the way to the Crack of Doom, every place in Middle-Earth comes to life. The designers of these sets and CGI went into extreme detail and any fan of the movie should check out the six discs of special features. You learn how Hobbiton was actually dug out in a hill in the ground in New Zealand. My favorite battle has to be the battle of Helms Deep. It was 10,000 Uruk-hai vs. around 500 men and elves fighting at a castle that has defended the country of Rohan for centuries. Aragorn falls into his place as a leader and he develops into the man he needs to be in the third movie. These movies are made with incredible detail with every movie being made at once. Peter Jackson and his cast and crew spent 15 months in New Zealand and filmed this masterpiece. Costumes were made and WETA Workshop made all of the sets they needed and used miniatures and made the world of Middle-Earth come alive. Actors took the books and looked for details fans would look for from the books. The only real problem with these movies is that if you don't know the story you cannot really enjoy the full experience. I saw the first movie when I was really young and I had no idea what it was about and I had to see the movies many, many times before I knew what was going on. As soon as I did, I was hooked and now I know almost everything there is to know about these movies. Overall, The Lord of the Rings is possibly the best trilogy ever made. The way the filmmakers dove into the world of Middle-Earth with such detail is commendable. This movie won so many awards, made a bunch of money, and it deserves everything it got. These are movie that need to be seen by anybody who even remotely likes the books and even if you don't, go in, pay attention, and join the experience. Lord of The Rings is my favorite movie, next to Titanic, and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.
10.0~Incredible pacing; incredible emotion gmnstrunr37 Sign in Permalink *Possible Spoliers* I'm a big Lord of the Rings afficionado. I love Tolkien's work and was afraid the last big installment -- The Return of the King -- wouldn't be quite the way Tolkien envisioned his work would end. After all, I had heard all the rumors that claimed that Saruman's fate would be avoided in the movie, and of course there wasn't a scouring of the shire. But just as TTT proved to me that Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" had merit, his RotK proved to be an incredible movie, absolutely the best movie I have seen thus far. I'll try to avoid large details and the such -- and I'll definitely try to stay away from "my opinion of this is so and so..." phrases because they don't convey anything. The emotion I felt during the film was that I was part of the film; looking at a theatrical poster today, I just realized how much I felt like I was there with Frodo, Sam, the Fellowship, or even with the Orcs. Sméagol, as usual, has an excellent role, and is definitely a worthy adversary -- and yet, necessity -- the the story line. In any case, the movie was a monumental work of extreme genius, excellent graphics, and perhaps above all else, it engendered raw emotion. This wasn't a movie where crying came in fits, or at just the end. As early as halfway through the movie, there was applause throughout the theater -- perhaps aggravating to some, but it surely revealed the intensity of the movie. In this regard, much credit should be given to the way Peter Jackson took the plot. Rather than film two separate plotlines, as Tolkien used, or even three (one for Minas Tirith; one for Aragorn and his companions; another for Frodo, Sam, and Sméagol), Jackson decided to blend all the plots together to give a better idea of the flow of time. The way he did present it turned out to be similar to the plot in TTT, and set up the stage for all the emotions to come. They came in one massive, grandiose style conclusion that revealed both the full implications of having carried the ring and the fate of Middle Earth. I appreciated the film. Of the three, it perhaps best followed Tolkien's words and was arguably the most moving. I thought I had seen the best film in 2002 when I watched TTT -- RotK merely one-upped it, and took the concept of incredible passion to another yet. To the directors, actors, and anyone else who put in seven years of their life to see this own quest done, congratulations. You've done it. For the third time in a row.
9.0~An incredible film Eowyn715 Sign in Permalink I've rarely been in movie theaters, and never have I seen any film twice except on video -- but I went to Return of the King three times. It is one of my favorite movies, and I'm counting the days until the extended DVD release. Every actor (with the exception of Liv Tyler and Hugo Weaving, who should never have been cast in their roles) does his or her best work. Gollum continues to be a tour de force, while Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Sean Astin (Samwise) are amazing. Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) really comes into his own, as does the character. Miranda Otto has one of the best sequences during the Battle of Pelennor Fields when she faces off with the Witch King of Angmar. I really can only use superlatives to describe any aspect of RotK. As a Faramir fan I liked David Wenham's work better in RotK than in TTT. Billy Boyd (Pippin) and Dom Monaghan (Merry) stepped beyond "comic-relief" banter and gave touching, heartfelt performances (there's still humor, though :-) ). Orlando Bloom (Legolas) wasn't as good, but he and John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) had a really goo exchange near the end. The editing is awesome. During the battle before the Black Gates, film gives us what Tolkien couldn't in establishing the relationship of events at Mount Doom and in the battle. I'm so sorry that Sean Astin didn't get an Oscar for his performance. The ending is terrific; I've heard it called "slow" and "drawn-out" but it is compelling and quite a tear-jerker. A review called the ending some of the best filmaking ever done. The only problem with the film is the Arwen-Aragorn relationship which is overplayed and poorly written. It resembles nothing that was ever conceived by Tolkien, and takes time that could have been given to the real romance in RotK -- that between Faramir and Eowyn. Hope some of that gets on the DVD!
9.0~Satisfying Conclusion! bazwilkinson85 Sign in Permalink If you've read my review of the FOTR, you'll probably remember that I don't praise the film as much as everyone else, however gave it 8 out of 10. The Two Towers was, in my opinion, much better. Last night i saw Return of the King. I really enjoyed it! I now find it hard to rate the films individually, as they need to be watched together as one big film to be truly appreciated. ROTK had some amazing battle sequences, and the part with the spider really had me on the edge of my seat! There were many things I enjoyed in the film, much more than in FOTR, and still more than TT. There didn't seem to be a 'boring' moment in the film, and it was entertaining throughout. However, its not perfect, there were a few things i didn't really like about the film, such as whenever there was a battle or something bad happening it was really dark, and when the 'good guys' stepped onto the scene the sun rose from behind them, and the sun behind the eagles at the end felt a bit OTT. I also felt that the film could have ended a few times. There were actually twice where it faded out, and i thought 'that was a hell of an ending!', and people in the cinema were getting ready to leave, satisfied, then it faded back in for another 10 minutes! I haven't read the books, and appreciate that this sticks to the story of the book completely, in which case i cannot criticize the film for doing this, as it is what it set out to do! Overall, a damn good film despite some VERY minor flaws! 9 out of 10 (overall, treating the trilogy as one film - 10 out of 10!)
10.0~Absolutely... scott00 Sign in Permalink Absolutely Positively Undeniably marvelous. there's really nothing else to be said.
10.0~worth it dazedandbemused Sign in Permalink was very good. stayed fairly true to the book. very entertaining, the hours flew by :) special effects were amazing, would almost believe all the places were real. was a fitting ending to the filmed trilogy and a tribute to tolkien's work. hopefully the films will bring more people to the books. if you've not seen it, GO.
10.0~At this point, it's all about the payoff and "Return of the King'" delivers Movie_Muse_Reviews Sign in Permalink When a film series or trilogy receives as impeccable a treatment a J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings," its nearly impossible for its grand finale to falter. Such is the case of "The Return of the King," an absolutely colossal conclusion to Peter Jackson's epic vision. Considering a majority of "Return of the King" is payoff for being patient in the previous two chapters, the film is the most fun of the three and the biggest crowd pleaser. If you loved the previous films, you can't not love this one more. It's not necessarily that the film is better. Rather, it's so tonally and structurally consistent with the other films that by virtue of being the end, it stands out as an incredible experience, hence its winning of the Oscar for Best Picture. After the Battle of Helm's Deep and the defeat of Isengard, the armies of Mordor move on Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith. With King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of Rohan wary of giving all his muscle to the men of Gondor, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) ride there to convince the steward of Gondor, Denethor (John Noble), the mourning father of Boromir, to extend his hand to Rohan and in effect, to Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) heir to the throne and rightful king of Gondor, a title the ranger struggles with. The War of the Ring is something to behold, even though it's interrupted by Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam's (Sean Astin) quest to cast the Ring back into the fires of Mt. Doom. Rather than having the forces of Sauron and the armies of Gondor and Rohan clash in a tense battle in which the victor remains unclear, the story sets the battle up to have two extreme sides, namely that we spend a majority of the battle scenes watching Minas Tirith get torn to pieces wondering how good can possibly triumph. On the other end, we know that Gollum (Andy Serkis) has plans to betray Frodo and Sam in order to repossess his one and only Precious. The debate between the two hobbits on whether Gollum can be trusted reaches its zenith in a heartbreaking way seeing as we are aware of Gollum's intentions, and by this point, with the Ring reaching Mordor, it calls out for its master and consequently has a horrible effect on Frodo. The story pushes certain failure to the brink in both the War of the Ring and in Frodo and Sam's quest to destroy the Ring, and it's easy enough to buy every ounce of it despite knowing it can't possibly end in a horrible way. That's testament to the power of the storytelling going on here. How "Return of the King" really one ups "The Two Towers" is that it doesn't feel as though its bouncing around nearly as much between the different story lines even though it is. The momentum of the impending battle and Frodo and Sam inching closer and closer to Mt. Doom keep things on edge and driving forward at all times. No scene feels obligatory or like its stalling, and even some creative scene juxtaposition such as Pippin singing to Denethor as Faramir charges into battle only makes the script appear even stronger. From an action and visual spectacle standpoint, "Return of the King" completely outdoes the previous chapters. A battle sequence in which Legolas (Orlando Bloom) takes down an entire oliphant on his own sums up the quality of the film in the most basic entertainment sense. Even with all the doom and gloom, there's still plenty of humor in this one as well. The resolution of the many subplots also helps to improve the overall quality of "Two Towers" in the context of the trilogy just by providing payoff to all the story lines that film built yet to which it gave no resolution. Everything that Eowyn (Miranda Otto) does in "Two Towers" feel for naught by the end of that film, but she gets her shining moment in "Return of the King" that brings her character full circle. "Return of the King" works well on its own, but it also proves that "The Lord of the Rings" was meant to be watched together as a trilogy, as lots of small details in the first two films pay bigger dividends in the finale. Jackson certainly proved why the entire trilogy needed to be filmed together as a complete entity; you couldn't just hold off on the rest of the series if "The Fellowship of the Ring" didn't pan out financially. The emotional payoff of the film is testament to the work on all ends of production, for everything from the script to the on-screen talent to the set decorators to the sound designers creates the aura of authenticity that makes this fantasy feel so real and convincing, while also pulling us along on an emotional journey in which we feel so heavily invested by the time Frodo and Sam reach the summit of Mt. Doom. As with their journey in the story, once you've gone this far as a viewer, you're incredibly committed to the outcome, and what an outcome. Bravo. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

9.0~Immensely good conclusion adam_evans14 Sign in Permalink Having re-watched this on the sofa just the other day i might have been forgiven for thinking my father would perhaps with nothing else to do, sit down and watch it with me and see if he became hooked. His gripe with the lord of the rings is 'its too much fantasy to the point where you can just make any old nonsense up'. I sort of see his point, since the army of the undead in this film was pushing it as far as what i was willing to accept was concerned. That said its possibly the only thing that tests my patience in this brilliant brilliant film. The pacing was perfect, the narrative flowed back and forth from each character so smoothly in the previous instalment that we sort of took it for granted here and knew what to expect. All the same kudos to Jackson for giving each character enough screen time for us to continue our emotional investment in them. As much as i loved the scenes with Aragon etc, the film is all about frodo and sam to me and i remember in the cinema just being on tender hooks wanting to see how gollums plan would unfold. I think it would have been cool to have a few extra scenes with frodo sam and gollum just showing how gollum is manipulating frodo against sam. Sam asks for the ring but there's no guarantee this would have happened. It would have been cool to see gollum putting sam up to it rather craftily beforehand. The acting is great and some of the playfulness that the previous instalment had going for it (mostly from Gimli) is not lost, despite a darker film all round. The effects as ever from weta are perfect. For anybody who hasn't seen this film, it's obviously part of a trilogy so don't watch it without having seen the other two. I recently watched the Hobbit and i just don't see it anywhere near the quality of these films. I really hate the obviousness of the CGI in it compared with these films and the fact that the plot feels little and not so important. To conclude my father didn't stay and watch the film having got bored, but still it was worth a go.
10.0~One of my Top Ten Films to date Keyska2004 Sign in Permalink J. R. R. Tolkien was one of my first fantasy writers that I have ever read. I have read this book many times, so when this film came out, it was like a birthday present to me. The 1978 animated Lord of the Rings at least gave me something to visualize, but with Peter Jackson's version I felt like Dorothy waking up in the land of OZ for the first time. The filming was great even with all of the CGI content. Great actors will make this film a long-time favorite for fans of the books, and those who have only seen the films. A great movie has details, and in The Return of the King you can appreciate the details and history that is brought out by the characters in their words and actions. I absolutely love the scene when the Witch King is defeated, I remember the audience in the theater cheering when this took place. Even at the end when the Hobbits are honored, it still brings a tear to my eyes. I have watched these movies over 100 times already and I am always ready to watch it again. I use these three films every time we play games as background music.
9.0~A very impressive film ccm043 Sign in Permalink I suppose I'm just adding my voice to the chorus when I say that this was a stupendous film. Great acting. Amazing special effects. Wonderful directing. One of the best films I've ever seen. It's still not the greatest movie of all time, though. There are those that are greater: Schindler's List, The Godfather, Citizen Kane. But it's up there. This is one of the few movies I've ever seen more than once in the theater. I was actually glad that Jackson included Shelob's Lair in this version. It gave more screen time to the Frodo/Sam/Gollum storyline. Throughout the whole scene, I was on the edge of my seat. Even though all of the main characters are split up throughout the film, Jackson still manages to keep it as a cohesive whole. The final climactic scene will keep you bolted to what's happening. There are some flaws in the film. The fate of Arwen is rather confusing. (Sure, the average person visiting the LotR message board on a daily basis might understand it, but for the average person in the theater, I don't think there was enough background info to completely understand). Also, the post climactic ending is rather long, although that's more to wrapping up the film than Mr. Jackson's mistake. A fine film. 9 stars.
10.0~best movie ever. longbeachbadfish Sign in Permalink ROTK, one of the most anticipated, and hyped, movies of all time is finally here. Was it worth the wait? Does it live up to the hype? In every way imaginable. Usually when a movie has this much expectation there is no way for it to live up to what we have already envisioned in our minds. Incredibly, ROTK exceeds those expectations. When all is said and done, the LOTR trilogy will likely go down in history as the greatest ever made. A perfect 10.
10.0~Absolutely Phenomenal! stardetective88 Sign in Permalink This is the best ending to the best trilogy ever!!! The whole movie is a piece of cinematic greatness. The battle scenes are wonderful and the adventure is genuine. The only problem this movie has is the very ending. I personally believe there is too much closure. I know Peter Jackson is trying to be more faithful to the books, but it is too much. We have already been sitting in the theater for 3.5 hours, we don't need another 15 minutes of closure. I think after Aragorn is crowned king and they all bow to the hobbits the movie should end. Even with the endings, this is the BEST movie of all time. I know I will be crushed if it does not win best picture at the Oscars, it totally deserves it over Lost in Translation.
9.0~EDGE OF THE SEAT ENTERTAINMENT sevoc Sign in Permalink This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. All in all, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one the most fine-tuned, cinematically perfect films ever made, it's absolutely flawless in every aspect. The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole is a spectacular achievement in film making history, and all three movies are together, without a doubt, the greatest epic ever made. 9/10
9.0~Best of the trilogy bernicestockstill Sign in Permalink The characters were very well chosen, some moments were obvious, but for the emotions that the film conveys you need to rate 15, you came up with 2 versions very well, but I prefer the long one, where we can observe much more interesting details. The account is well described character stories.
10.0~Amazing danburnsdance Sign in Permalink My favorite all time movie. Grew up wanting to be Legolas and have treasured that childhood thrill throughout my on screen career. The mix between the characters suit all and all can relate. In my eyes as a child I was relatable to Legolas, nowadays more like Aragorn. The only problem with this trilogy is that they have finished, the entire story has been one I have adored throughout my life.
10.0~Wonderful movie by all standards king-for-love-806-37375 Sign in Permalink Wonderful movie by all standards I did not find any faults worth mentioning Cast: wonderful Output: terrific Production: Excellent Everything perfectly I loved all the actors and the roles that they Performed ----------------------------------------------- Battles: The last thing ..... frankly I did not watch the epic movie to such a degree Battles give you a real sense of performance The story in general is very beautiful and not where any faults worth mentioning The course of the story as well as a very very same story Excellent cutting scenes Excellent graphics Filming of Professional. I do not know what to say more than one piece only ... Thanks to everyone who contributed to this wonderful work
10.0~The Epic Ends... funnydayze Sign in Permalink I was a bit scared to see the trilogy, because I have read the books and loved them. I didn't want my own view dashed because of it. And after the Harry Potter incident... I wasn't too thrilled about another 'book into movie' thing. But, after much pushing, I saw it, and it was lovely! The views were amazing, the actors were magnificent, I could go on. I was a bit sad with what they left out, and changed, etc, but that was to be expected. And I am much happier with how Peter Jackson showed Elves. I had a different view, but this is much, much better. Overall, THIS movie was superb. The music, mixed with colourful costumes, brilliant images, and the fantastic script... I loved it. A must see! But, don't bring the kiddies. I don't think you want them coming to you at about 2 in the morning talking about ghosts and spiders. I'm being attacked now by my brother, who's son has seen it. If the must see it, you should go first, then you can see if it's fit for them. If you want to see it again. I know I did. Leona
10.0~Great Book Adaptation gonzalezbryan-75572 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson final adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy takes us to an epic battle and conclusion to the past films that continue off. The two Hobbits ( Frodo and Sam) still on their journey to deliver the one ring into Mordor in order to drop the ring into mount doom. In order to defeat Sauron. Meanwhile their is an all out war going on with the combined races of high elves, humans, etc, and the cursed Army of the Dead that Aragon leads towards the Battle of Pelennor Fields against the Orcs for a swift victory. A very thrilling, immersive experience brought by Peter Jackson for the Art of Cinema with its great story telling and its great character building, this trilogy is one for the history books of great films.
9.0~marvellous mostafa_eraqi Sign in Permalink Cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.
10.0~LOTR ROTK: Oscar Worthy FlamingTable Sign in Permalink In all my years I have never experienced anything quite like the LOTR Saga. I am not even interested in Wizards and Hobbits and Evil Monsters. But I love LOTR movies and I love ROTK the best. This movie tops all others due to its intense screenplay, amazing writing and directing, and superb special effects. The acting is outstanding as well. Anyone who might think this move is a little childish for them, like I did, you owe it to yourself to see this film.
9.0~ALL TIME FAVE FANTASY MOVIE. andrewchristianjr Sign in Permalink Many of u would agree with this choice. Superb film. The acting, the story, everything is awesome. They saved the best for last. Well done Mr. Peter Jackson!!
10.0~Best Movie I've Ever Seen haadurin Sign in Permalink This is simply the best movie I have ever seen. There is no other way to put it. It's incredible beyond all expectations, and after reading the books and watching the movies you bond with the characters and when one passes away or leaves middle earth you feel as if you've lost a friend. At the point on Mount Doom where Samwise says "I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!" is the best and most emotional part (excepting maybe the Grey Havens) and I nearly cried. The story is perfect, the actors are magnificent, and the music is the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I sobbed at the Havens (and I'm a teenage boy!) and I believe that really says how great this movie is. Ten out of ten stars is a complete understatement. This is the only movie that exists that deserves an Eleven star award.
10.0~(Tear) I am so upset thegregstir Sign in Permalink Why God? Why, oh why is the journey over!? I have got to pull myself together. Its just a movie. Its just a really good movie. Its just an incredibly superior film. Its just one of the greatest motion pictures of the last hundred years. Its just one of the most wonderful story ever conjured up by the human race. Yeah, its not that big a deal.
10.0~Part 3 of the most epic trilogy of all time. wwe7961 Sign in Permalink Now here we are with the big one. The film that is often called the best film of the decade. The gigantic mass of epic known as The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Everyone looks at this film as the best. In fact not only the best but the best by far is what people consider this film to be. It was nominated for 11 Oscars including best picture, and won every Oscar it was nominated for. It was a huge success, and yes this film is fantastic. It is one of the biggest adventures I have ever seen. Everything that was great in the first two are great here also. The writing, visuals, acting are all top notch stuff. So is it the best in the trilogy? Well I consider all 3 to stand together as one huge film experience. If any one of them didn't exist the others wouldn't be as good. All of them standing together give us a complete, and epic adventure. 4 stars out of 4
10.0~Best trilogy of all time crittersitca Sign in Permalink The beautiful cinematography enriched with state-of-the-art CGI, ginormous sets and a universe which was immense in its scale of depiction, makes it one of most amazing trilogies ever to be created.
10.0~Best Fantasy Epic of All Time jonswordsman Sign in Permalink As a child growing up in the mid to late 8o's and early 90's, my family never had a great deal of money to spend on extravagant toys and such, but I was given plenty of books to let my childish mind go wild. I grew up with dreams of becoming Beowulf, or Arthur and his knights, or Odysseus the Greek hero. Bt it was not until my mid teenage years that I picked up the Lord of the Rings trilogy. After that, I was set for life. I always wondered what a film version of these classic tales would be like; however I thought that it would be impossible to film these and make them live up to the expectations of movie-goers and fans alike. I have never been happier to be so stubborn. Under the guidance/direction of Peter Jackson, the Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, has given a gift to the audiences of the world. That gift lies deep within the pages of the original story about friendship, loyalty, courage in the face of great evil, and hope in your fellow man. This film embodies these timeless themes and gives them a new voice for us to hear in our present day lives. The direction is beautiful; the adapted screenplay is purely golden; the actors live up to the expectations placed on them and succeed in every moment of the film; the sets and visual effects are flawless, and the score composed by Howard Shore is brilliant. Together, these elements conjured an extraordinary fantasy epic that sweep audiences away and took them to a place that few movies have dared to go, the heart. The final installment of this epic trilogy captured not only the true essence of the books, but gave the audience things to believe in. It is only then that a film deserves as much recognition as this film has been given. I give this film my highest recommendation and hope you treat yourself to one of the greatest achievements in cinema history.
9.0~The End Of The Epic zkonedog Sign in Permalink The intensely satisfying emotions stirred by the writing of J.R.R. Tolkien are delivered via an epic quest by all creatures (men, hobbits, elves, orcs, and the like) of Middle Earth. Well, every quest must have a conclusion, and director Peter Jackson adapts Tolkien's final chapter of the trilogy onto the big screen just as triumphantly as the first two installments. For a basic plot summary, "Return of the King" sees the two primary plot-lines of the entire trilogy reach their apex: -On one front, Frodo, Sam, & Gollum/Smeagle finally reach Mordor, but not before a significant detour along the way and a gut-wrenching decision at their journey's end. -In the world of men, Aragorn (with Gandalf's help) reclaims his kingly birthright and leads the denizens of Middle Earth in a final battle with Sauron's minions. Along for the ride again is the feisty dwarf Gimli, Legolas the marksman Elf, & hobbits Merry & Pippin doing the best they can to contribute to the cause. Simply put, "Return of the King" is no better or worse than the preceding movies. It is just the continuation of perhaps the most incredible fantasy fiction (translated here to the big screen) series of all-time, and incredibly well-done at that. What really stands out with this particular third chapter, however, is the last half hour or so of run-time, where the visuals, music, direction, & acting meld together to create some emotionally rousing scenes. Because the characters are so real, so full of life, and have been through so much, you will feel as if it has been your quest all along, making those parting emotions feel all the more raw/real. Let's just say the eyes might get a little misty on more than one occasion. Thus, "Return of the King" is a regal ending to Jackson's masterful book-to-film translation. It has everything that a movie-goer could possibly want: action, adventure, drama, humor, and most of all...heart.
1.0~One of the Worst Movies of All Time!! cshep Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's reach exceeded his grasp!!! In what can only be described as one of the greatest Gay fests of all time, LOTR 3 delivers more repetition than all of the disco records combined!! If you've seen one battle seen, you've seen them all!! Mindless subplots,where a corrupt ruler usurps a kingdom, and mercifully jumps over a cliff in flames, describes how many viewers felt , after the first hour and a half of this mess!!! The Academy was one film too late !! Where LOTR 2 delivers a film of considerable achievement, LOTR 3 is the complete opposite !!! Not since "The Greatest Show on Earth" has a film been this overrated!!! J.R.R. Tolkein must be turning over in his grave, with this double edged sword !!! In what is becoming a trend, the computers are receiving Academy Awards, for carrying movies , that have little merit of their own!!!
10.0~Each to their own kevandeb Sign in Permalink There are three (OK maybe more?) groups of people where these films are dealing with: 1. LOTR fanatics 2. LOTR fans 3. LOTR Couldnt care less....show me the movie I am in group 2, have read the book about 8 times, but do not remember every name in it or every scene from the book. In my (humble) opinion you are never going to please all of the people all of the time, but this trilogy comes pretty damn close. the first apparent thing is it is made/directed with an great love/appreciation of the novel. To appeal to group 1 you would have to make 10 films each 4 hours long, to appeal to group 3 you would need to condense the three films into two 90 minute slice and dice movies, i really do believe these could not be better done, i could have a few needless niggles, but why bother when the overall effect is so stunning. the only sour taste left in ones mouth is what a charade, fix and outright disgrace the awards ceremonies are, as when the Two Towers 'towered' above any film that year it failed, and when it did win all before it, there was some VERY good competition, which was made to appear weak.....c'est la vie
10.0~A wonderful ending to a wonderful trilogy joaqoholic Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson ends the trilogy with the 200 minute Return of the King. And in the ending, you'll find a lot of action, even more characterization, humor, suspense and so many tears. The movie immediately begins where it left off, starting with Gollum, Sam, and Frodo (Andy Serkis, Sean Astin, and Elijah Wood). The tension builds as Frodo must decide who his true companion is--Gollum or Sam? Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, John-Rhys Davies, and Ian McKellan) meet up with Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) at the ruined Isengard. Very quickly the fellowship must break again though. Pippin and Gandalf ride to Gondor. The rest of the fellowship and the Rohirrim quickly follow to aide Gondor as this is the next realm under attack from Sauron. The movie takes a while to build up the stories, but once it has it doesn't let go. The momentum is amazing, and the time passes quickly. Although many feel that the ending is too long (the third act is over 20 minutes long) I feel that everything in the end was necessary. People have spent 3 years with these characters and want to know what happens to them in the end. Peter Jackson has done it again, and the rest of the cast and crew has helped him to make this whole thing possible. Thank you to all of you for the amazing movie experience you have given to the world. 10/10
10.0~A great wrap to a great trilogy Falco Sign in Permalink This was a truly stupendous piece of cinema. Despite some other comments, I found the pacing perfect, although (and I'm in a minority here) some of the battle scenes could have been tighter. I thought the first and last hours were both entrancing. OK, Peter, here's my top five wishlist for the Extended Version (**spoiler warning**): 1) The Eowyn and Faramir romance in the Houses of Healing, 2) The Rohirrim on the road to Dunharrow, along with their guide, 3) Eowyn's powerful speech before she slays the nazgul lord, 4) The Voice of Saruman (with some exposition on the palantirs), and 5) Frodo and Sam's "Forced march" through Morrrrdorrrr. Oh, and I will buy a Director's Uncut version, if you release one.
10.0~Production design is mind blowing shbartcreation Sign in Permalink This is the most beautiful history fantasy fiction, all character is awesome.
10.0~the most important thing about the movie VPayne Sign in Permalink To fully appreciate the greatness of this movie particularly and the trilogy as a whole, you have to watch the extended version of it. I saw it on TV first and then got the extended version and since that, every time I watch the standard version it seems like a compact version of the real thing. The regular version is amazing but the addition of some important (at least for me) scenes makes it the best movie of all times. This is by far the best of the three because of the fact that it had to tie all the ends and finish the story and at the same time be bigger and more intense that it's predecessors. While I still think that the last 15 minutes of two towers is one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of mankind, you'll never be disappointed in this one. The trilogy itself is just so deep and so perfect, that it's one of those things that make you think about the beautiful things humanity is capable of.
10.0~Breathtaking Mountain-Storm Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is one of the rare defining moments in movie making history. A breathtaking masterpiece and stunning culmination to a truly wonderful trilogy. To go on too much about this movie is a little pointless really, it is as damn near perfect as you can get. Enough said.
9.0~Very good, but not excellent gizmo_O Sign in Permalink I think the third and last part of "The Lord of the Rings" differs from the other ones, in a positive way. There were many parts in it which I pretty enjoyed. For example Jackson finally brought in some "singing" into the movie. The battle-scenes were also more thrilling in my opinion. The acting again was great, as in the other parts. I very liked Gollum till the end. Serkis highly deserves a nomination at the Academy Awards. When the movie ended, I First had to think about the ending: "Was it too long, couldn't he have left this and that out?" But when I saw the movie for the second time, the end appeared to me very poetic, even picturesque. What made me kind of sour was again Gimli. His "I try to bring some fun in here" comments were unnecessary, as in "The Two Towers". I don't want to mention that some important facts from the book were left out. But nevertheless "The Return of the King" completes the trilogy very well. Respect to Peter Jackson! 9/10
2.0~Wagner might do better coarsevoice Sign in Permalink Many people commented that more than three hours passed by when the movie finished. It's not hard to explain: just note how slow the people speak, always rendered in a Hollywood-heroic form; or otherwise it seems that they are acting under influence. Other moments, they just gaze at each other, or the landscape, and then the epic-ish (Irish?) music starts. The movie could be compressed to 90 minutes. And still, three hours aren't enough for a decent portrait of the personalities: the good guys talk like saints, the evil ones like worms. The plot is the same old one: people run around to fight the evil and save the world, with every episode looking like the end of the world. The visual effects of the fighting scenes are exceptional, but it is not dissimilar to a combination of Jurassic Park & Last Samurai & The Eruption of Mt St Helen. Probably a good preparation step to the Ring Cycles.
10.0~The perfect movie rudi_mentaer Sign in Permalink There's only one word which could describe this movie better than any ones else: perfect! The score is perfect, the directing is perfect, the script is perfect, the story is perfect, the actors and the visual effects are perfect!!!
10.0~Superb Dalla- Sign in Permalink This movie is awesome... Its some of the best I've ever seen. I've never seen a movie as good as this, I couldn't keep my tears back, and so could not 4000 others in the cinema, Oslo Spektrum, at the before-premiere... In five words: As all movies should be!
10.0~Best of the Trilogy DoctorSkyTower Sign in Permalink I won't give a detailed review on this film, as there are over 1650 reviews already (!!) but this one has definitely become my favorite of the Trilogy. Everyone will know the story by now... so all I have to add is I was very impressed with the battles, Frodo's encounter with Shelob, the journey through Mordor and Gollum's 'ending'. The orc commander was cool and ugly, he reminded me of the alien leader from Peter Jackson's earlier movie Bad Taste. I enjoy long movies, you get your $15 worth! The only problem I had was the absence of an intermission (really the fault of the theaters rather than the film!) Movies this long need a break in the middle. Also it didn't quite know where to finish, so went on a wee bit at the end. 10/10
10.0~One of the greats that will stand the test of time. jeffw3000 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has taken one of the great trilogies, and beautifully transferred it to the big screen. Return of the King is the conclusion of the trilogy. The trilogy ends on a very high note. It is beautifully shot, and the casting is one of the best jobs of casting I ever scene. Even when you look at some characters who are cast a little differently than in the books, it still works in Peter Jackson's interpretation. The art direction is also first rate. Peter Jackson has given this literary classic the epic feel it deserves. Return of the King is the fastest moving and best of the three, though all three are destined to be classics that will stand the test of time.
10.0~best movie ever boobin024 Sign in Permalink seriously....best movie ever....if Peter Jackson doesn't win an Oscar for this i will be very angry.....go see it. its really really good...... I love the books and am a devoted fan but they handled the movies extremely well. I wish that they would have left in the battle for the shire but i understand. the movie was fantastic..
10.0~In a Line - the Return was the best of the Three and beyond words. bboyce-1 Sign in Permalink Throughout the movie I sat spellbound waiting to see if Jackson continued to see the book as I had invisioned it and he certainly did. Shelob was absolutely believeable and fantastic. If I was to say anything negative and this is minor is that I thought he could have done without the history of Gollum for there were several more important areas that were left out and unless you followed the book closely this wouldn't have been missed by many I'm sure. None-the-less it was absolutely fantastic.
7.0~Perplexed, in a good way indie_rocks Sign in Permalink It's amazing how hard it is to compile your thoughts about something that you love so much. I witnessed The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in theaters at 12:01 A.M. this morning and in no way was I disappointed. If I could see it again now I would, and then again and again and again and so on and so forth. It is being released today, and I'm waiting for the extended edition to see everything that couldn't be brought to the theatrical version. It's an amazing film, and it has an amazing cast, crew and everything is just amazing. I noticed more lines taken from the book in this film than I noticed from the other films, and I have no idea what I'm trying to say. The movie is so wicked, and groovy and an epic. The battle scene is phenomenal, the ending is well, I won't spoil it, and everything in between ranging from The Fellowship of the Ring to The Two Towers to The Return of the King is the greatest thing I have ever seen come to life on the big screen.
10.0~A very welcome Return to Form armo_852 Sign in Permalink This final film was all I could have hoped for and more. Let me just briefly state my opinions on the previous two. I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring. It was fantastic entertainment and a significant milestone in film history. The Two Towers was vastly overrated. I simply could not become involved with what was going on (because basically there was not a hell of a lot going on) and it was a real let down for me. The Return Of the King is also a return to the brilliance of the first film. It is captivating from the offset, with a very intriguing but well realised set piece where Smeagol becomes first acquainted with the all powerful ring. Unlike 'Two Towers' this film never loses track of what it is working towards and it really fills you with anticipation of a grand finale. The complete cutting out of Christopher Lee's Saruman was immensely brave as he was the main source of evil in all we had seen before. However his absence did not detract from the enjoyment of the film so it has to go down as a correct decision. There are so many truly awe-inspiring moments that I simply have no room to give them all full justice. The spider section is the best in the film and is only rivalled in the trilogy by the cave sequences in the first film. The creation of the spider may even be more impressive than the creation of Gollum as she was totally convincing and fear-inducing. Oh yeah and the battle of Minas Tirith was far more engrossing than that of Helm's Deep. Very few weaknesses. Like Two Towers I felt the Liv Tyler character was not really that necessary, or maybe she just needed to be portrayed as a more vital part of the narrative. There was a half-hearted attempt at this by saying failure to succeed in the quest would mean her death, but this could easily be applyed to everyone else as evil would rule the world. If I was Aragorn the blond Eowyn would have been my choice for a woman hands down. My final point will probably be picked up on by many others. The sentimental ending definitely went too far. After such an epic trilogy it obviously needed to be rounded off well with this tearful feel good ending but there was really no need for so much of it. Why on middle-earth did we need to see Sam settling down with his wife and kids? I don't like saying this but I was begging the final credits roll at this point before it got so ridiculous that Gandalf gets it together with a lady wizard! No, I apologise for that last remark because this was an incredible feat in film-making and undoubtedly will go down as such.
8.0~Great film but my least favorite of the lotr series collinfmayo Sign in Permalink This movie being visually incredible lacks a true ending. The whole film is great and sad but the end has like 5 endings just pick one
10.0~This is the One cojiro Sign in Permalink Since I'm not Tolkien himself, I don't know the words to describe just how great this movie is. I give a standing ovation to every actor, crew member, and of course, to Peter Jackson for such an outstanding job on this film (not to mention the other two). The actors outdid themselves, every one of them. Viggo Mortensen displays a fine hero, Ian McKellen commands a flawless performance as Gandalf the White, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin tell perfect stories as Frodo and Sam, and the list goes on and on. You believe in the characters you see. I did miss Christopher Lee, but we'll be seeing him in the extended cut of the movie. Hats off to all of them. Gollum was even more fun in this film than he was in The Two Towers. The skillful direction of Peter Jackson was breathtaking, from the awe-inspiring camera sweeps and panoramic views to the portrayals of the people we see. I applaud Jackson for this piece of art. Last, the story carries you away with it, and packs an uncommonly powerful emotional punch. I'm a grown up macho guy, and I was crying like a baby. I can't remember a movie that tugged on my heartstrings more. The action doesn't let up, the emotion doesn't let up--the whole movie doesn't let up. Best thing you'll see this holiday season, I promise. 10 out of 10.
7.0~Misses it's reason for being Jonas1969 Sign in Permalink All that can be said about the gorgeous effects in LOTR has already been mentioned: it's a pinnacle of film technology and shows that everything is now possible to portray (with enough funding). Yet I left first the Cinema & then the extended DVD version feeling cheated out of the emotions I had felt from the books. Jackson's 2nd film leaves too much to tell in the third, yet he still squanders time on strange scenes that were not in the book instead of focusing on the journey for the Hobbits. For me the books have their flaws: (1) The prose is unnecessarily flowery and expansive (2) the characters are about as black or white as the world is according to George W Bush, no nuance there but it was a product of WW2 so it's not hard to see why. To me the central theme is that of a journey, not only to Mordor & back but a mental journey for characters. Frodo grows beyond the confines of the Shire. Sam the boy finds the 'man' within him. Merry & Pippin the pranksters become powerful and can easily overthrow the somewhat diminished Saruman. We still get Frodo's & to an extent Sam's story, but Merry & Pippin are left out. I can take (with a touch of rancor) turning dwarfs into comic characters & that there is not enough room for everything, but for me the central 4 Hobbits needed more of their story told. This movie is still a 7 or 8 and a must see, and although I am very aware that wishing more from this simple fairly tale probably doesn't reflect well on my life, still I feel it could have been much more and I can't help yearning for that missing bit.
10.0~THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE!! masterkmarques Sign in Permalink The trilogy comes to an end with a superb climax at the end. After the phenomenal successes of the Fellowship and Two Towers, The Return Of The King pushes both asside and establishes itself as one of the most entertaining and visually stunning films ever made. The fellowship finally breaks, with Aragorn leading an alliance of gondor and rohan to battle the armies of Mordor attacking the city of Minas Tirith. This battle is to remain as the largest ever seen on film, and the most stunning. Frodo and Sam reach a compelling end to their journey to destroy the ring. The climax of the film is truly the central point of all three films, Gollum, being the one responsible for the fate of the ring. No film ever made, can surpass this film. A benchmark in cinema history!!!!
6.0~return of the king eh? tdbaker Sign in Permalink This movie was by far the worst of the trilogy in my humble opinion. Bad acting throughout by the majority of the cast, especially Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, made their scenes near intolerable to watch. The script might as well have been nonexistent, as every line was cliched melodramatic crap. Finally, my biggest pet peeve of the film, the last 30 minutes or so of this movie is painfully hard to watch. Not because the viewer is being challenged, like in 'The Passion', but because I nearly fell asleep because it was so boring. 11 Oscars? Please. That only proves one thing. The Oscars are no longer an important award that stands above the rest of the crappy hundreds of awards show that are out the now, but rather, they are just another one of these bland, repetitive, mass appeal shows that are just there so everybody can see what their favorite star or most hated stars will look like. 5/10
10.0~One of the most ambitious projects of the movie history. hcicia Sign in Permalink A story where the most important subjects of the humanity are present. A story full of mythology, mysticism, sacrifice, the strength of destiny, friendship, goodness and evil. One of the most ambitious projects of the movie history. A saga whose destination is to pass the test of the time. Like often occur with the greatest landmarks in the history or arts.
10.0~The best movie ever made. WritergirlAD Sign in Permalink If there was a rating higher than ten, this is the only movie in the world that deserves it. I say this with all seriousness. I loved this movie. This movie has everything anyone could ever want. Tolkien fans {I am one myself} and everyone else, will not be disappointed. For the very few people left by now who haven't seen this movie, DO SO IMMEDIATELY! :] Lord of the Rings is a beautiful work of literature, and the movie comes near to matching its brilliance. In the short documentary entitled "Ringers, Lord of the Fans," someone says that the power of Lord of The Rings is almost spiritual, and I agree. Pete Jackson definitely captured the magic of the books, and you don't want to miss it.
1.0~epic filmaking but not a "great" movie odonne88 Sign in Permalink you people are so comic it makes me batty. is it a good movie.....yes. was it a brilliantly imagined and epic series of films.......yes. was it one of the best 50 films of all time.......NOT A CHANCE IN HELL. i don't care if you 15 year olds want to live in fantasy land the rest of your lives but spare us from this "LOTR are the best movies ever crap" we don't need to hear it and it makes us laugh. it was a great series to watch but when you come on here and disrespect the film greats of all time and have any of these LOTR movies in the top 100 it disrespects the entire film industry. if you want to play fantasy time then go on a Disney board and post away. but do us all a favor and leave the IMDb for real movies.
7.0~Better than Two Towers, not as good as Fellowship Fat Dragon Sign in Permalink Well, the trilogy has ended, and it's time for some conclusions. First of all, Return of the King is, IMO, not as good as Fellowship of the Ring. On the other hand, it's definitely better than The Two Towers, which I think is by far the weakest of the three films. All in all Return of the King is certainly a good film, but it's too long, the battle scenes somewhat lack intensity and when it's all over you're left with this lingering "was that it?". Don't get me wrong, I like the film, but it does feel as something of an anti-climax. Perhaps it's simply not possible to transfer the enormity and intensity of what's meant to take place to film. The battle scenes are a bit dull, they lack intensity and realism, which is too bad because the battle scenes are in many ways the most important part of the film. To make it all worse (at least as I see it), they try to make up for it with slapstick, kill count and silly comments from Gimli, who is again reduced to comic relief, as well as a tendency to focus on the "really big stuff" (TM); oliphants, various trolls and the big siege weapons, instead of really following the battle. Also, I find the constant switching between Frodo and Sam and the battles annoying because it breaks up the battle scenes, jerking you out of the action just as it's starting to pull you in. RotK simply doesn't do a good enough job of making you "feel" the intensity of battle. Some movies can almost make you smell the blood, RotK doesn't achieve that, in fact there's hardly any blood at all and often just a lot of CGI (I guess the PG13 rating didn't help in that department). CGI has come far, but battle scenes are still vastly better with real people. Anyway, most of the movie is pretty good, but it never quite achieves "lift off" before it touches down on the ground again. As with the Matrix trilogy, the sequels just don't quite live up to the first, although I will say again that I think RotK is a good, although not brilliant, movie, and definitely better than Two Towers. There's no reason not to watch this film and I'm almost certain it won't be as good on DVD as it is on the big screen (mostly because the CGI and FX are so important), so go see it in a cinema while you have the chance. If you say this is the best movie you've ever seen, however (and it's almost a law of nature that some people will whenever a new LotR flick is out), I suggest you see some more movies. (Yes, I find all the LotR fanboys, and -girls, who uncritically love the movies with a zeal unmatched even by the most die-hard religious fundamentalists, extremely annoying)
10.0~Perfection of the rings. Read this for the truth about the negatives. rchosen Sign in Permalink I loved this movie. This was the best movie ive ever seen. Its nearly perfect and never gets boring. Now im not one of those simply die hard fans that sees every showing and dresses up in LOTR stuff and buys every LOTR item but i am a fan non the less. And i have seen this movie 3 times. To me the 1st movie was good and the second one was slow. But this one is the best move ever by far. When you first sit down your expecting maybe like in The Two Towers where it drags on and on. And most people would because its nearly 4 hours. But it goes by so fast that youll want more when its over. I think Peter Jackson did an amazing job. I think any company that gives this movie a bad rating should try making a better version adn then maybe they can appreciate all the work and time put into these movies! The battle scenes were perfect to say the least, the charecters have a awsome build up and interaction and the detail in the movie is overwhelming. Youll cry, youll laugh then at the very end when its over youll die because there nothing else to do in life after seeing this movie! I dont see what people are saying about this "multiple Ending" Thing. The movie only ends once!Maybe it feels like its going to end mutiple times but i think if it just ended with just the ring and what happens(all ill say or it will be a spoiler) then no one would like the ending, because you it would be like the wonderful COUGH-CRAP-COUGH Matrix Revolutions where it leave you asking more questions. Another thing is alot of people dont like this movie to much because it isnt like the book. If your basing how good it is compared to the book then you shouldnt be rating this movie. Besides the fact the length of the book as a movie would be very long the money needed is impossible to have. IMO go see the movie and forget what any reviews say. Just remember if your going to rate it dont judge it on how accurate it is to the book.
10.0~Simply and unequivocally, THEY NAILED IT! djecatepec Sign in Permalink The third flick in a series is rarely the best. This one is! The film is rarely better than the book. This one is! I found that of the three books in the trilogy, Return of the King was the least clear and the least satisfying. In the movie version, the reverse is true. Its simply a really fun, really great roller coaster ride from start to finish. I have nothing more to say except if you've already seen it, nothing I could say could possibly match the film itself and if you haven't, you simply must. I would just like to say to the cast and crew, in the words of so many Olympic sports, Congratulations, you nailed it! (And to anyone who could possibly give this film less than a 10, you must have had the flu that day!)
10.0~Quite Simply The Best Film of All Time aidanmonks Sign in Permalink Many were aware of the inaccuracies that would be produced and the story that would fade away slightly from the books, even Peter Jackson new this, when bringing to life the complexity, symbolism and brilliance that is Tolkien's world - of Middle-earth, Valinor and the once great realm of Numenor. Tolkien forged histories and wrought countries and continents geographically and to the utmost accuracy, devising languages and alphabets for each of these countries' inhabitants: Elves, Men, Dwarfs, Hobbits... etc. I am a Tolkien Scholar and it is very rare that I ever come across another, of my extent of knowledge and love of his work, that actually do not resent the film adaptions in the slightest! I went to the cinema in 2001 expecting an action-packed misuse of CGI but... You know the rest: the movies (Fellowship and Two Towers) remained as loyal to the novels as any Director/Screenwriter would be willing to be, without trying to open the immense story - of friendship, love, sacrifice and darkness - to a wider audience - which I took into account as I sat on the front row, about to witness a masterwork in movie history. 2003 came and the final installment was about to open. Again I say on the front row and awaited The Return of the King - they DID save best for last!!! WHAT A MOVIE!!!!! And, if I may say so, Peter Jackson's additions - including Pippin's Song and the Eye of Sauron - are improvements to the film. It expresses the deep emotion that lies beneath all the torment of the War of the Ring so well that it is undoubtedly one of the greatest war movies ever (even though it is a fantasy) standing, side by side, with Saving Private Ryan and Paths of Glory. The Return of the King is the best LOTR movie (no matter what any critic will say about its extreme run time - I only watch the 4 hour extended edition, when I watch it at home) and The Lord of the Rings, as a whole, is - for me - quite simply the best movie of all time, based on the best book of all time.
10.0~The Best of Jackson Fred_Tavares Sign in Permalink There it is, just like Jackson had stated, this film would be the greatest of them all as he said that the return of the king was his favourite trilogy book. I would say that this time, unlike in the other LOTRs, Peter Jackson made the best movie and most based on the book. When I walked in the cinema I was thinking that this would leave so many important parts like two towers or fellowship of the ring did, but no... Of course some parts were not putten in the film, but they were so few... I can remember they didn't include Saruman's last appearance and neither the war for the shire. Instead there was a bright and peaceful shire waiting Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry. Looking back at the movie, these were the most left out parts of the book, only 2 parts. The story-line maintained, the concept of the book maintained!! That is amazing, Jackson did go by the book and deserves the best director Oscar. The cast once more was amazing, I'm glad Jackson finally decided to leave out Arwen/Aragorn boring love scenes from Two Towers, instead their meet up is only at Minas Tirith which follows the story a lot better. A lot more convincing Merry and Pippin singing hobbit tales and also their accent and their lines improved according to the book. Frodo, Sam and Gollum's way through Mordor was the best improve from Two Towers, as for this one, we could really witness the madness Frodo was going by and I could say that last part when Frodo is holding the ring over Mount Doom and finally decides after some seconds to have it for himself is oscar worth (no I don't think Elijah Wood will win an oscar, neither does he deserve it). Amazing war scene, once again, Peter Jackson can't stop surprising us with a bit more of the best massive wars EVER. Good interpretation of Aragorn, the King, who finally given up his Ranger heart to be what he was born to be. Gimli and Legolas keep their funny dwarf/elf rivalry moments. Other characters like Faramir, Denethor, and specially Theoden and Eowyn were very convincing acting. A brilliant movie, the best I've seen of Peter Jackson, this one deserves many oscars and many prizes as this movie is finally the masterpiece of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I give it 10/10.
10.0~The problem with imagination OboeSaxIII Sign in Permalink Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the "true" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures. The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction, Fantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence, and faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what Tolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence, and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us. Therefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for "mediocre writing" or "atrocious film-making" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions. Tolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man, one whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed "genius." Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot incongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a lack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous dialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien, despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for taking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the richness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic "niggling" would have prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films. I do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great evils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of creation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it. This movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature of war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another world and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish. One final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World.
10.0~unbelievable... this may very well be, the greatest epic of all time musicgod500 Sign in Permalink I am a moviegoer that doesn't walk into a theater and say i am here to watch a movie, i go to experience them. some people go in just to kill time or because they saw a good preview and said "hey that looks pretty good lets go see it". thats not me, i walked into return of the king after watching all the interviews, all of the makings of specials and reading all of the books, saying to myself "i am about to witness movie making history. i sat in my seat and waited... the theater got dark and the opening music began... and the crowd went ballistic, hoots and hollers and cheers and the atmosphere just took the whole experience to another level. This movie was a masterpiece, to quote many others "this is the movie by which all others should be measured". if more Hollywood movie-makers spent a tenth of the time that Peter Jackson and his crew spent meticulously making this movie then maybe Hollywood wouldnt be releasing so much garbage into theaters.. maybe people wouldn't be wasting their money when they see a cool preview and the movie isn't even worth opening your eyes to watch. What the makers of this movie have done essentially is raise the bar for all others in the business, and the ones with limited vision who make a big named movie (no matter what the quality) because they know people will flock just because of the title ( i.e the matrix) will fall way short of the mark. The score, the acting, the directing, every fiber of this movie is almost completely flawless, when Sam cries you want to cry, when the armies rejoice you want to jump out of your seat and cheer, when there is a feeling of despair it makes you wish that for just three and a half hours you could be in the battle with the soldiers desperately fighting for yours and every one else's lives, that you were the one scaling mount doom to destroy the one ring, for glory and the salvation of the world. it is the ultimate story of overcoming your fears and winning the day. I neglected to put in many details about what made this movie the joy that it was, but i figured that anyone that reads this might be inclined to take look at this movie and if you have any passion in your lives the details will be as clear as day and speak for themselves
9.0~Immaculate! rwross Sign in Permalink Immaculate! Yes this film earns a coveted spot next to Fellowship and Two Towers on my list of Immaculate Movies. Of note, at least to me, is the fact that by being added to my list, LotR, eclipses "The Godfather" by being the only trilogy to have all parts represented. "The Godfather III" fell short... "Return of the King" did not!
10.0~Flawed, yes, but 10 out of 10? YES! moondog548 Sign in Permalink Yes this movie could have been better, the begining 20 minutes or so are a little dissappointing, cinematically. But the rest of the film is so phenomenal and so captures the drama of Tolkien's nearly perfect story that you completely forget that there was ever anything less than spectacular about any of these films. Flat out, PJ gets it done in the end, and only utter perfection could have been better. A+ By the way. If you haven't... READ THE BOOKS! They are even better, once you get to the forming of the fellowship, you won't be able to put any of them down.
8.0~Nothing new Sivesind Sign in Permalink Let me start this comment by saying that this is a great movie. Probably in my top 20 all time. However, I was not satisfied when I left the theater. Although a worthy conclusion to the movie, which was very much according to the book, there was very little new to this movie. Where "Fellowship" had the freshness about it that came from being the first movie, and "Two towers" added a lot in the development of the relationship between Frodo and Gollum, the new Gandalf and the battle at Helmsdeep, most of the scenes in "Return" have been seen before. The stupidity of the orcs are starting to get boring now. The battle, although a great scene, was not that different from the battle at Helmsdeep, and even the beautiful scenery is getting a little bit boring now. That said, there are still a lot of great parts, especially with the efforts of Frodo. We're discovering new sides of Sam and the scene with the destruction of the Ring is overwhelming. Some of my more enthusiastic friends have said that the only negative they could come up with was that the movie had too many endings. However, I don't agree with this criticism, as this is according to the book, and everything that goes on after the destruction of the ring, are necessary to wrap up and bring a worthy conclusion to the epic. We're talking about about 9 hours of film here! I can't help but wonder what this movie would have been if the scenes with Saruman had still been included. I'm very much looking forward to the directors cut DVD.
10.0~The Greatest Epic Trilogy nhngoc_1701 Sign in Permalink First of all, The Lord of the Rings (L.O.T.R) trilogy should always be appreciated as a whole rather than 3 separate movies (despite the fact that each of them, alone, is already a beautiful piece of art). It's also the reason why you will find the exact same post on each movie's topic (10/10 for each and 100/10 for the TRILOGY!). The series has everything needed to be a masterpiece : Great cinematography: thanks to the exceptional common works of Andrew Lesnie and Peter Jackson, we could experience all theses monumental battle scenes throughout the series (in magnificent landscapes of Jackson's native New Zealand). Some of them are the most epic battle scenes ever made! Great script: excellent adapted screenplay for the legendary novel of J. R. R. Tolkien. Great ensemble cast: in one sentence, they were just perfect for the series. In such a large screenplay, each one has precisely done what is needed to develop their character, not too few nor too much, for the common great goal : the global plot development. Great directing: respect to Jackson for putting all those great elements together so that we now could live Tolkien's splendid fantasy world on big screen. The TRILOGY has also engraved Peter Jackson's name on the wall of the Directors hall of fame alongside with Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola... I've been re-watching the whole series from time to time for the last 15 years since the release of The Return of the King, and it's kept me enjoyed every single time! For me, the L.O.T.R is the greatest epic movie of the cinema history and will remain for the next decades. And I have no doubt that many will agree with me on this.
8.0~Great movie mweller Sign in Permalink A worthy conclusion to the greatest trilogy of movies ever made. I mean, how many times does the third movie live up to the first two? Superman III? Return of the Jedi? Godfather III? I might be willing to grant Police Academy III... anyway - great movie!
10.0~Masterpiece of the ages TheEntarion Sign in Permalink Once again, Peter Jackson proofed that he's one of the best visionary directors of his time. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is yet another masterpiece. Frodo and Sam tight their bonds, so they can together cast the One Ring into the Mountain of Doom. With a lot of pathos, action and emotional scenes, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King combines every feature that movie should have. Excellent music from Howard Shore only suits this movie up - great brasses, violins and other string sections will make you cry, even after tenth showing. It's long. In extended edition it has over 4 hours of watching, but believe me, you won't even blink an eye. Peter Jackson doesn't make a mistake, like other directors, that are basing on books. Some moments are mixed, like PJ wanted, but the movie grip strong to the book. In my last words, I want to say, that The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a must-see position on your watchlist. It's an incredible masterpiece, that take my breath after almost ten years of watching.
10.0~The finest film experience ever made mu77ley Sign in Permalink Return of the King is the best film I have ever seen. All other film classics pale into insignificance next to it. Peter Jackson manages to make a 3hr 20min film feel like 1hr long and leaves you wanting more. In fact, I'm going to see it again as soon as I find a cinema that actually has tickets available in the next week or so.
10.0~Why are not all movies like this one ? ghorin Sign in Permalink I've seen The Return of the King twice and I got more tears the second time than the first. From the beginning of the Rohirrim cavalry charge to Sam's "I'm back", I was astounded. A special applause for Pippin's song while Faramir was riding to death, another one for the Rohirrim charge, for, Sam carrying Frodo, for Frodo's reclaiming the Ring in the volcano, for Gollum's happyness when he get the Ring back, for the eagles, for the crowd bowing in front of the hobbits, for the poignant last 20 minutes (Shire, Grey Heavens). At many times, people were applausing and at the end, I heard the most powerful applausing I never heard in a theater. Incredible.
10.0~Does anyone else agree? ***Spoilers*** jeffn21 Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Does anyone else agree that the scene at the end when Frodo wakes up in the bed was kinda goofy? Everyone walks into the room one at a time and everybody just kinda smiles and laughs. Personally I think that if they would have either done this scene differently or removed it entirely, then they would win the Oscar for sure. It reminded me of some lame 80's TV show, where it would end by someone saying a really lame joke and everyone over-laughing at it, then it just freeze-frames. The scene was pretty bad, and I was surprised because the other 99% of the movie was incredibly great. I can't wait for the extended version.
10.0~If the World Were to Be Black and White myleskenny-41348 Sign in Permalink This movie or even better this trilogy made me feel so sad because this world is not like the one in the movie. I really wished that everything was just black and white. The good guys are the good guys and you clearly see who is evil. The actors really made those characters alive and gave them epic faces. Nobody had that modern-look. I also liked the music which brings the whole action to life. The soundtrack really gives me goosebumps. The scenes are so magnificent, even though they were filmed on Earth it seems like that is a whole other world. I will never get bored with the whole good versus evil fight, but I also don't like superheroes. And this movie has heroes who are not superheroes. Fights are depicted so realistically that I never once thought 'that would be impossible'. This is definitely a movie that falls into my top 5 favorite movies of all time and I believe I will be watching it time and time again.
10.0~The Best Movie I Ever Saw Drachenfuer Sign in Permalink First of all, I would like to state I am not a Tolkien Fan. (Please don't kill me) I read the books years ago and thought they rambled without meaning in some parts and that the character's voices did not differ from one another and poorly written (IE a dorf sounded like a high elf) So I went into the movies expecting them to be similar. With each movie I was liking it more and more. With Return of the King, I was blown away. This is by far, the best put together, all around movie I have ever seen. Yes it is long, but it needs to be. Yes the ending could be have been cropped, but it's the end so just turn it off early! The acting is superb, but the directing and scenery is what really shines. Some scenes brought tears to my eyes where others made me want to stand and cheer. I will not get into specifics so as not to ruin the movie for those who have not seen it, but all around, this is the most well-made movie ever to hit the screen.
2.0~Return of the Turd ebolabrahmin Sign in Permalink My lord, what a mawkish slab of overwrought merde. No medium shots here, just washed out and incoherent long shots of battle and close up after close up of meaningful lip quivering as the music deafens all theater goers with the more dramatic strains of what seems to have been borrowed from Stargate. And what is with the weepers in the audience? This is worse than the previous two films.
10.0~Awesome. Brilliant. Spectacular! mcqueso Sign in Permalink I was simply overwhelmed by "THE RETURN OF THE KING". It took me over three hours (after leaving the theater) before I could even speak. I cannot wait to see it again - however, it will take me a few days to recover from WHAT I have just seen. This may be the-best movie I have ever 'experienced'. Still 'dazed and dazzled' - sleep will come difficult tonight... The ONLY criticism: There IS a moment when the movie 'could-have' ended (about the 3-hour mark) - and I would have been TRULY satisfied - but it continues on for another 15 minutes (or so). It is like the film is going for a MULTIPLE orgasm from the audience - when that one BIG orgasm was enough! Michael Carr, Director: Key West IndieFest and Telluride IndieFest
10.0~simply stated, there is a reason why everybody is giving it 10/10 wayneamurphy Sign in Permalink It is just that good. I didn't read the books, and that hampered me raving about the first of this series, but I have to top my hat to the director on the Return of the Kings. As Alison noted, it now makes the original Star Wars trilogy second rate, and the latest trilogy (episodes 1-3) even more of a joke.
9.0~An end to the best fantasy trilogy of all time(?) Leray97 Sign in Permalink With the four hour conclusion that is The Return of the King, the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to a close. When it comes to film franchises, this fantasy series easily takes the cake for being the best one out there. The visual effects aren't the best, nor is the acting, but the story makes for such an experience that is so easy to become emotionally invested in. Part of the success that the story achieves comes from its execution as the writing caters to the whimsical side of adventuring as well as the more darker themes that involve Sauron and the One Ring. Another aspect of the story's successful execution has to do with how much care is given into each of the characters. There's obviously one overarching plot that involves everyone, but that itself is not the sole focus of the story. In the end, the LOTR trilogy feels like a big journey due to the audience gradually learning more and more about all the relevant characters and their motives. With their long runtimes, each film in the trilogy takes its time to fully establish the setting and flesh out its characters, as they should for being epics. I honestly can't imagine watching the theatrical versions now, seeing as the extended versions put in the much needed additional time to develop secondary characters. Though the more I think about it, I'm not too sure exactly how much this particular film benefits from having an extra 30 minutes in its runtime. Where Fellowship of the Ring benefited from the extra minutes in world building and the extended version of Two Towers slightly faltered in its pacing, The Return of the King is already going to be charged with wrapping everything up so I don't know what scenes the filmmakers would have prioritized over others. Either way, the tone of this film is so fitting for this grand adventure that I won't think about it too much. There's a lot of closure in the film, the character arcs that have been developed throughout the three films all come to a close and I can safely say that every minute I spent watching these movies were worth it. I really enjoyed Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) arc; seeing him develop as a leader and a reliable person made him my favorite character overall. Besides Frodo and Sam, I think Aragorn also has the most screen time out of all the films. Anyone who reveres the LOTR trilogy for its masterful storytelling and world-building is right to do so. It's probably the only set of films to tell such a story in all the right ways. Experiencing this trilogy in the theaters must have been a life changing point in many people's lives; I'm sure that if I was part of the fandom back then, my love for movies would have grown much sooner.
10.0~The most beautiful fantasy movie gandalfkaza Sign in Permalink At the lord of the rings movie Peter Jackson has chosen the best places to film it, the most suitable way to make it, and (the most serious) the most suitable cast for it. With his work not only he has made the best movie ever, but also he gave a Chance to the unknown members of the cast for a better future. an other good thing in this movie is that everything is real (because of Peter).For example: the Shire is one real village somewhere in new Zealand made from the lord of the rings crew. After trying for one year to make the village the result was the best. Also, all the things made for the movie such as swords, helmets,building miniatures, and other little things are selling to many movie shops. I am the fun no.:1000000345

10.0~AMAZING, WOW, PETER JACKSON AT HIS BEST!!! Iverson2001 Sign in Permalink This movie is...INCREDIBLE, I went into the movie theatre having pretty high expectations but this movie went about these expectations. Return of the King is an amazing story, very action packed and always keeping you on the edge of your seat. Peter Jackson did a amazing job finishing the trilogy like the novel. If you haven't seen this movie then you should see all the other people that saw it at the box office or even better go see it NOW! Put this movie up for Best Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography, NOT best actor or actress or screenplay but it will beat Master and Commander in Art Direction. This movie is very powerful in fight scenes, seeing this movie makes you feel like you are in it. The spirit of the army screaming and throwing there hearts out at the orks is amazing although the bad screenplay kills it at points. I liked the humor in it of Gimlee but at points it through me off since the end of middle earth is at stake and yet they are laughing and making jokes but other than that PUT THIS MOVIE UP FOR #1 ON THE YEAR BABY!!!
10.0~Happy End! nutu-p Sign in Permalink If you are a movies lover, you must have watched TLOR, its an incredible movie, you must watch this, its kinda old but you have no idea how wonderful is to watch this, i love all series and i love to see the same characters over and over again!
10.0~A brilliant conclusion to a great adventure. larsgjerlowjorgensen Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** LotR was the best book I ever read (about once a year) FotR was the best movie I ever saw TTT was the second best movie I ever saw RotK was the best movie I ever saw (better than FotR) LotR was the best (3*)movie experience I ever had - thanks PJ & co. I went to see a marathon show (with the theatrical releases) on Scandinavia's biggest screen. This was by no means a mistake. I was blown away by this movie. After watching FotR and TTT and then RotK at midnight I still had no trouble keeping awake - RotK doesn't let go for a minute. And when there was an intermission after about 80 minutes I was shocked - how could they interrupt right now? But anyway - the story fits perfectly together with only a few things missing from the extended editions (elven cloaks, lembas bread, pipe-weed etc.) Pros: Almost everything. The adaption from book to script was very successful. I, as a huge fan of Tolkien since my early childhood, believe that this is close to exactly as I have always imagined the story inside my head. The fighting scenes are absolutely awesome. - Cave trolls and Mumakil in battle - cgi to the people :))) The actors (esp. Sean Astin) do a great job in the more "emotional" scenes - without overacting. Not to forget Gollum _and_ Andy Serkis - good job! Howard Shores great score keeps the great feeling and contact with the movie. The path of the dead - cool! So many other nice things to say - go see it - but remember to see FotR and TTT first - and make sure to read the book - it is even better! Cons: The editing is a bit rough with very fast shifts from one place to another - but maybe we'll see a better flow in the ext. ed. But if one has to put such a big story into "just" 200 minutes - how else could they have done it? I for my part can not see how. Now I just can't wait for the extended dvd edition :) <SPOILER> The story about Smeagol and Deagol - what a great thing to include! It is a shame that The Scouring of the Shire is missing. I think that it is very important to the story. But I trust that the guys (incl PJ) who made the movie are the pro's here and that the movie really is better without this ending. The catch about wars not only being fought abroad but also in the local is very interesting - especially in these times with terrorism etc., but maybe this is also a reason to exclude it from the movie - they don't want anyone to get the idea that it is political. </SPOILER>
10.0~Army of the Dead, Army of the Dead, my god Army of the Dead! kveltri Sign in Permalink So, this movie was insane. Physically draining. I was sitting so close to the screen (silly traffic) that I felt like I was inside of the movie. While not flawless, Return of the King was an amazing end to an incredible trilogy. Filled with Oscar- or at least Golden Globe-worthy performances, it deserves every ounce of praise it's getting. Best stuff: Army of the Dead. Absolutely incredible. Interaction with Aragorn, taking down the Oliphant...don't have to say anything else. Close second: Eowyn's fight scene with the Witch King. a.k.a. Miranda Otto kicks ass. Peter Jackson rocks. He has done what no one before him ever has: come from relative obscurity to film not one but THREE epic films at once, satisfied both critics and die hard fans of one of the most popular series of all time, and refused to do it Hollywood's way. If you doubt this, I urge you to watch all the extras on the Extended Edition DVDs. As for the actors: Sean Astin has broken free of Rudy and The Goonies, Viggo Mortensen has escaped B action films, and Ian McKellan, far from concluding his career, has become the coolest senior citizen on the planet. I even love Elijah Wood, who did a great job looking disgusting, evil and confused by turns. But to me, the standout in this film is Billy Boyd. We see his character grow up and really understand the world in this film. He is the deepest character of the Fellowship. Oh, and thanks to Peter for bringing venerable British actors like Bernard Hill and John Noble to American audiences who had previously never heard of them, and also for Miranda Otto, who puts new Aussies like Naomi Watts to shame. My votes for the Oscars? Ian McKellan deserves one this time, since they denied him two years ago. He might score the Golden Globe too. Viggo? Maybe...but he'll be beaten by Ben Kingsley. Sean Astin? Golden Globe I think. And Ian, Viggo, Sean, Billy, Bernard and Elijah should all be nominated for the Globes, regardless of who wins. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Give Andy Serkis an Oscar/Golden Globe. Since he's actually in this movie in the flesh, you can skirt the CGI objection and give it to him. He deserves recognition from someone besides MTV. That's my two cents. Maybe I'll say more after I've seen it another 5 times...
4.0~3 movies of repetitive nonsense and where the feck is Sauron? rilascent Sign in Permalink Everything done throughout 3 massive movies could have easily been crammed into one single movie. I'll admit that the second part was slightly different but the third movie was pure, unrelenting garbage for the most part, simply because it had nothing new. I thought that the reason RoTK was so popular was because Sauron made a return and kicked everyone's ass and was the greatest villain every conceived. But the fact is that he does'nt even ever show up during the entire movie and remains nothing more than a virtual villain throughout the series. All you get to see is the stupidass eye of sauron. If thats what they were planning from the beginning, why the hell do they keep on and on going on about how evil and badass Sauron is? Can you imagine how Harry Potter would be if Voldemort never ever showed up during the entire series? The ending of the LoTR series is just predictable and nothing major happens. Ring falls into lava and everything goes back to normal. The reason this series is so popular is because Tolkien's fans enjoy seeing their readings transit into the cinematic experience. Otherwise, this is nothing but a large scale farce that has nothing new (wars, monsters, swords, medieval themes).
9.0~The film is great, though not perfect kelvinhole Sign in Permalink The LoTR trilogy is perhaps the best trilogy I've ever seen. The films have an epic feel to them that not even Star Wars can begin to rival. The scenes are breathtaking (Rohan, ruins of Osgiliath, Minas Tirith, desolation of Gorgoroth) and the characters are played brilliantly by all the actors and actresses (Sam, Eowyn, Gandalf, Saruman, Elrond etc). The movie recreates the splendor and beauty of Middle-Earth and its corruption under the Dark Lord, and that is its biggest strength. Being a nitpicker, I must point out that the movies don't agree with the book in many places, and being a fan of the book first and foremost, that disappoints me. I would also have liked the film to touch a bit on the heroic deeds of the First Age of Middle Earth that many of the characters talked about in the book. A sense of history is sadly missing, which detracts from the epicness. Overall it's a great movie, one that you'll enjoy watching the one hundredth time as much as the first time. No doubt you will, for almost all of us are touched in some way by Tolkien's story, though we are not sure what. I myself have watched it three times, and I dare say many have watched it more than I have! If you're new to Tolkien's Universe, I suggest you pick up all three movies and watch them from start to end, like the unfolding of a great tapestry. Then read the book. Then watch the movies again. And again. And still you will have much to learn and ponder, a never ending poem of the eternal fight between good and evil.
10.0~It was a Big Task... m_case99 Sign in Permalink Wow, just back from it yesterday and I must say that Peter and his crew wrapped up a Big Task pretty ok. It was nice to surprize us with the complexity of the fellowship (with some big changes to the book), very difficult to bridge the first and third movie (...book...) with the amount of action Peter showed and the changes in the storylines compared to the book. But then the third: full action, emotion, and I swear almost true to the book. The thing that pleased me the most is that he took the true nature of the book and let us feel that in this movie. The despair of war, the uglyness of it, the greed for power (in the steward and in wanting the Ring) and the beauty of what life is. Even without the destruction of the Shire (although in the book it did wrap up Saruman's story pretty nicely, and gave the hobbits a hero's welcome...) and even without the healing of Frodo. Peter and his crew showed it as close as possible. Impressing good ending to a 10+ hour movie!!! Love to see the Hobbit now!!!
8.0~A LOVELY PRESENT, BUT TOOK A WHILE TO UPWRAP IT fallyhag Sign in Permalink 1st film: Enjoyed 2nd film: Was ok 3rd film: Much better The film started off really well with a great insight into one of the characters dark past, which did make the little kid next to me squirm a little. This film does manage to provide a little bit of everything of everyones film tastes. It has humour, action and some girlie luv stuff. The one thing that did "kinda ruin" it for me was the prolonged ending. I thought I was the only one whose bum was aching for the last scene but a couple next to me had the same sigh of relief when it finally came. Not wanting to spoil it for you but just when the film seems to come to a natural end....well it just keeps going....and going......etc... In summary, well worth the visit to the cinema! Little scary in places for the young ones so watch the parental age recommendation. Eight out of Ten! PS: The special effects: Outstanding!!! Second to none.
10.0~Great Movie Great Story moisismaged Sign in Permalink Over the years, I've read Lord of the Rings four times. During the holiday season of 2003/4, I watched Return of the King four times. While I embraced ROTK as the third part of a dream come true, I was not totally happy, left wondering why so many things vital were missing. The 4-hour extended DVD version explains a lot. My biggest beef was on so much missing about Aragon, and I found most of them in the DVD. One of the vital elements in the Fellowship's strategy is to draw Sauron's eye away from Frodo, and here Aragon's role is crucial. The "last debate" in the movie is totally inadequate in explaining the suicidal march to the Black gate but the DVD makes it very clear, with the additional scene of Aragon revealing himself to Sauron though the Palantir. He is the bait that Sauron cannot resist. Another important aspect is that Aragon comes into the city of Minas Tirith first and foremost as a HEALER, not as a king. The kingship comes afterwards. This is again brought out in the additional scenes in the DVD, although still missing a lot of details from the book. Still disappointing, even for the DVD, is that so little is given to the story of Eowyn and Faramir. The dialogue through which they come to accept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire book. The few shots in the DVD that trace the development of their relationship are far from adequate, although that's a least a slight improvement from the film version. Another disappointment is Aragon's arrival at the Pelennor Fields, which is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the book: amidst the despair of the Rohan and Gondor soldiers in witnessing the approaching black ships, Aragon's standard suddenly unfurls at the main mast: "There flowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but seven stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought of mithril gold." The treatment of Gandalf's confrontation of the Witch King in the DVD departs from the book, in which the two are locked in a face off, then Rohan's horns are heard and the Witch King swings around and leaves. What in heaven's name is in Peter Jackson's mind when he had Gandalf's staff broken by the Witch King. But this did explain a mystery that has been bugging me for a year – why Gandalf had to snatch a spear from the guard when he saved Faramir from the pyre of Denethor. Enough on the DVD.I shall be remiss if I do not pay tribute to Peter Jackson for the wonderful film he and his dedicated crew have created. Most inspired is the lighting of the beacons to summon help from Rohan. In the book, this is observed by Pippin in the ride to Minas Tirith. To satisfy Pippin's curiosity, Gandalf explains the background to him in a somewhat factual manner. Jackson turns this into one of the most exciting moments in the film, with aesthetically superb shots of the 13 beacons (yes, I counted them) being lit up in succession, accompanied by beautifully rousing music score, culminating in Theoden's heroic utterance of "Rohan will answer". Watching this has to be among the most uplifting moments one can experience in a cinema. Most poignant is the Faramir's suicidal attempt to retake Osgilaith, under the orders of an unloving father. Starting from the soldiers of Gondor filing out of Minas Tirith in what looks almost like a funeral march to the letting loose of the swarm of arrows by the orcs in Osgilaith, every image of this scene is so hauntingly heartrending. It reminds me of John Woo's favourite scenes, although here, the music is Pipppin's actual singing rather than adapted background music, rendering the tragic mood even more devastating. Directly opposite in mood is Rohan's charge in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. Even if this mission is, in a way, equally suicidal, the spirit is sky high, radiating dauntless heroism and lust for battle. This scene also reminds me of the legendary battle scene in Spartacus (1960) which is universally recognised as the model in depiction of battle strategies. Rohan's charge in Pelennor Field, no the other hand, exemplifies heroism unsurpassed. Although ROTK is first and foremost the King's story, we should not forget, in the overall scheme of things, the ring bearers (no typo here because Frodo did acknowledge Sam as a fellow ring bearer in the end of the book). Elijah Wood and Sean Astin (particularly Astin) have played their roles to perfection. Towards the end of the quest, when Frodo's strength was almost fully spent, to hear Sam say "I cannot carry it (the ring) for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you" and not be moved, one will have to be a hopelessly and irreversibly hardened cynic. The background music, incidentally, is "Into the west". It is certainly a good sign that the general audience worldwide has reacted favourably to the long aftermath following the destruction of the ring, indicated that their capacity to appreciate has not been impaired by the proliferation of Hollywood style slam-bang endings. Viggo Mortensen's line to the Hobbits "My friends, you bow to no one" is delivered with sincerity and conviction. The final scene at the Grey Havens is graceful, touching, stylish. However, there is one shot that I must mention: Galadriel's final enigmatic, alluring, half-smiling glance at Frodo before she disappears into the ship. Cate Blanchett is among the most versatile actresses around today and in LOTR, she is Galadriel incarnate.
10.0~Good movie kevemorris Sign in Permalink I love all the lord of the rings. Very original, I love the action scenes.
7.0~Good but overrated user-5863 Sign in Permalink This movie was good if not very good but in my mind is vastly overrated. why is this number 4 in the chart? LOTR had epic fight scenes a strong plot a satisfying ending (that went on far to long but still left lots of questions unanswered) But overall seems like I'd seen it all in the first and second movie. It was like it was all done before. One of the many last scenes contained the part where aragon bowed to the hobbits but really they quite frankly the hobbits did a bad job carrying the ring and any of the other characters would have done a better job. The Gollom story was entertaining but played too small a part in the movie they should have focused on the hobbits and personally I think should have cut all the parts with the two twin hobbits. Also the part with the spider was dull. why did they not kill the spider, spill it's guts. Don't get me wrong this was a good movie but is overrated to what it actually achieved.
10.0~Perfect Conclusion to the Perfect Trilogy ugadawg501 Sign in Permalink Return of the King was everything I had hoped for and more. It is so nice to have a trilogy where there are no negative sentiments between the characters. It just leaves you with a good feeling when you leave the theater. The computer renderings of the characters, from Gollum to the giant eagles, are incredibly lifelike. I cannot wait until I have kids and they are old enough to enjoy these instant-classics. I will just have to make sure not to tarnish the films for them by telling them about all the goofballs that dress up for these movies. Please get a life guys.
6.0~Bit disappointed Azrifel Sign in Permalink After the first two films I expected more from this last episode. There are a lot of boring parts, then it becomes interesting for a while to finish boringly. The great battle wasn't that great at all, the fight with Shelob uninspiring, the fight against the Nazgul not that heroic, etc. I even fell asleep when I watched it the second time. Perhaps it is also because I've read the third book again a month before watching it. There is just too much unfinished business and too much stuff that doesn't go right. Perhaps the extended DVD will be better. (I've already got the first two extended DVD's, those were pretty good)
10.0~The Perfect Culmination of A Perfect Trilogy cdjh-81125 Sign in Permalink Lord of The Rings Return of The King is one of the most universally beloved movies of all time at all the praise it receives could not be more deserved this is an incredible movie that is the definition of how to conclude a trilogy. Lord of The Rings has never been about the battle sequences they are all about the characters and their interactions. Frodo and Sam have some of the best chemistry I've ever seen in a movie they just feel like they are meant to be each other and feel like brothers every time they are on screen. Aragon, Legolas and Gimili are also amazing together not only are they great for producing laughs but they also have a great connection with one and other you see how well they work together and how they have come to trust and love one and other. The constant physiological warfare between Sam and Gollum is made all the more thriller through the opening of this movie which reveals his finding the one ring and in a very disturbing sequence his mental deterioration afterwards. Faramir and his relationship with Theoden is thrilling you always feel for him. The rather odd pairing of Pippin and Gandalf in this movie is also amazing they just feel like each others crutches during their experiences. Though these films have never relied on the battle sequences they've always benefited from them and here they are incredible you feel the stakes because of how well these characters have been developed, you feel the scale of the enemies they are facing and the grittiness of the close quarters combat. This movie contains one of the greatest third acts ever put to film you just know that it's all been building to this and your heart cannot stop beating. The final showdown between Middle-Earth and Saurons army is extremely satisfying especially to see Aragon take his rightful place as king and to see all these different species truly come together as one. Another inspiring sequence is when Sam and Frodo finally arrive at Mount Doom it feels like the perfect culmination of the story arc and seeing these characters succeed despite being all but broken because of it shows us that they're flesh and blood characters with everything to lose. Now I know it's popular to complain about the long ending but it really works it helps to put the events of the entire trilogy into perspective and the final scene with the Hobbits and Gandalf leaves me in tears every single time again because of how feel we have come to know these characters but also let's you know that they have further adventures ahead of them after the credits roll. Return of The King truly is one of the greatest movies ever made there is not one single flaw with it and is the definition of not only how to conclude a trilogy but how to do a movie as a whole.

10.0~If you saw it, you only wished it wasn't all over, a tribute of me and LOTR -Peter- Sign in Permalink I've always been a fan of deep realistic, and for-the-mind-movies. I still remember it, three years ago, LOTR:fellowship of the ring came in theatres across the world, a movie, incredibly hyped by everyone around me, I couldn't find any interest in such a movie, and the hype around it put me even father away from liking it or going to watch it. Then 6 months later or so I decided to give the movie a try, because of the high ranking at imdb, my mate from school gave me the dvd and that evening I started watching it. I knew nothing of it, I started watching, I like it at the start, but as the movie continued I almost felt asleep because of the nonsens playing at the screen in front of me, I forced myself to keep watching, because it must be good, everyone loves it! So the movie went on, About an half hour before the end it even grabbed me for a moment, I was at the point of 'liking' it. Then an half hour later the movie ended, I didn't find a plot in it, I left my sofa with a very dissapointing feeling, what a waste of three hours from my precious life! I argued with everyone that this movie isn't any good at all. All I did was proving the movie sucked. It was visually stunning okay, but all in all, it just sucked for me as film. A year and a half later I met this very nice girl who I felt in love with, and sharing your life with someone is sharing your interests, guess what, she loved LOTR! :D She even has the books! After a while I said to myself, let's give it a try, so I borrowed the book from my gf (the first one) and I started reading (notice:I maybe have read 4 books in my entire life) I rapidly started to like the story, which I completely missed in the first movie :p Guess now! 6 months or so later I finished the book! :D, I finished reading a full 490 pages of a book, this was a victory on his own for me. Then the day I waited for for a couple of weeks, the LOTR marathon! 3 films, 10 hours watching movies, with in mind the first movie blowed bigtime for me. But I had more background now. So I woke up and me and my gf, packed with a few donuts which we picked up at our bakery to survive the day moved on to the theatre. We arrived, we went in, we picked our seats and here is where my whole view on this whole trilogy completely changed direction. The first movie began, never I had been sucked more into a movie like this one, and yes reading the book adds so much more to it then I could ever imagine, the movie blew me away, and the best thing was that it just all started, (10/10). The second movie the two towers left me a bit confused at the start, I wished I had read the second book too when the movie started, I had a hard time following the story and getting into the movie, I was left with a lot of questions during the movie, which remain unanswered, good luck my gf helped me out at times, but I finished the second movie with a less satisfying feeling the the first one, although the action scenes and mass fights, the soundtrack, the environgment completely put me off guard, I loved it! Still I wished I had read the second book too when I finished the second one. The return of the king was the strawberry on the cake, there where I left the two towers with a rather unsatisfied feeling, this movie completely stole my heart, and since the beginning I was hooked for a long journey to Doom mountain, omg was all I could say at the end, I almost cried because it was all over, my one-day-journey into the unimaginable, the unknown world of middle earth was over, I'm still enjoying the movie 24 hours after I left the theatre. What an amazing day, what a journey, what a movie!! Completely blown away! It's not a good movie, it's an experience. I wished I hadn't seen it. I wish I would watch it in theatre again, and I mean the whole trilogy at once! I wish I read the second and third book too before watching it! I wish there was more, I don't think they will make something like this again in my life. I know this doesnt all belong to return of the king, but I just had to share my story. On thing before you head to see it. READ THE BOOK! Amazing masterpiece!
10.0~brilliant film charlie_smith89 Sign in Permalink the fighting scenes are fantastic. Orlando bloom the best as usual. much better than the first and second films made. The film is as good as the third book. i have rated it 10/10 and all ways will. Peter is a brilliant film maker and can't wait to see more from him if they are as good as theses films. i found all the characters in the films played incredible well. all the characters in the fighting scenes were brilliant especially during the fighting scenes with Orlando's tricks with the elephant and horse and shield were really exciting adds a lot to the film. really enjoyed it and all ways will Brilliant film, great action and great story.
8.0~great chaz143 Sign in Permalink I remember first watching the fellowship of the ring,it was hard to sit through. I reluctantly saw the two towers which was a lot better but still hard to through. I was pleasantly surprised however when i saw the last film. The battles were terrific and it showed superb effects. UIts unfortunate that you have to watch the first two to see the greatness of the return of the king but boy is it a great film. You probably won't watch it as much as your other historical favorites but thats only because of a length and if you enjoy a film with length then that means the director has at least done something right and he seems to have hit the spot.
7.0~best movie advanterus movie shree-00000 Sign in Permalink Great movie ita advantures movie and magic so far i see 10 time
10.0~Tolkien's Treasures... unnamedpp_42 Sign in Permalink Everything I thought would be good about this film was 50 times better than expected. The extensive 3 hours 20 minutes running time seemed to pass by as if I were watching a television sitcom. From the title scroll across the screen to the last ending credit was I mesmerized. The visual effects in the Pellenor Fields battle, the encounter with Shelob, the Army of the Dead, and the final battle at the Black Gate of Mordor were fantastic, along with Frodo's last struggle with Gollum (a perfect performance by Andy Serkis in the film's beginning, by the way). The movie ended in such a great way, with the Fellowship finally meeting again after 13 months, the crowning of King Aragorn, the hobbits' return to their beloved Shire, and Frodo's journey to the Grey Havens along with the elves, Bilbo, and Gandalf. This movie was perfect in every way, and thank you Peter Jackson for creating the best trilogy in film history! The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King-10/10
9.0~Excellent movie, but left significant parts out... Patman007 Sign in Permalink The movie overall was very well done. In my opinion, this movie is the best of the trilogy, and it atones for the sins of Lord of the Rings: Two Towers. I noticed a few mistakes, however, one of them being pretty obvious. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** When Samwise Gamgee was heading up towards where Shelob had just webbed Frodo. Orcs were very close, and yet Sting (he was carrying Sting) did not glow blue, then the camera went away from him. When the camera came back to Sam, his sword was glowing blue, even though he had hardly moved. Did anybody else notice this? A part I considered important that they left out was the period of time between Sam getting the ring, and him rescuing Frodo. The movie didn't explain how he got the ring, so that would likely confuse anybody who had never read the books. I'd like to congratulate Peter Jackson for his dedication to the films, and I hope he decides to direct The Hobbit.
9.0~Epic! juanantoniopefe Sign in Permalink The best of film history. The three amazing movies. There are many and great movies that you can liken this magnificent trilogy. But somehow, Middle Earth has something special, something that grabs you in it and there are no words to describe it. I feel like a part of it, and at the end of the day, that should be the goal of every writer and Mr. Tolkien was not going to be less. A penalty is not assessed at the Oscars to "The Hobitt" as it deserves, but hey, we all know these "big prizes". The best of film history. The three amazing movies.

10.0~Very entertaining and enthralling, a magnificent movie. unicorns-2 Sign in Permalink To even try to hold this movie or the other two in this trilogy up to the standards set by the books is a fool's folly. No one alive can ever make these books into a movie while following the books exactly. Nor would the dare do so because to do so would be a career ender. Why, one main reason, no one would sit through the 20+ hours it would take because it would be so boring therefore making it a complete box office failure. So Peter Jackson did the only thing he could, adapt them to movie form. And taken as an adaptation this movie is magnificent in all respects. 3 hours and 20 minutes went by for me with barely a notice of the passage of time. The movie was both very entertaining (which is why one goes to see a movie in the first place) and enthralling (which is what one hopes a movie is when chosen out of all the possibilities on any given night). Knowing the ending in no way spoiled this movie for me because seeing my minds eye realized on screen so magnificently was pure joy. I was very careful not to read or hear any ones else's opinion before hand, which allowed me to see it untainted plus or minus and I was rewarded for it. Peter Jackson took on the daunting task of taking one this era's most prized and revered set of books and turning them into movies and IMHO succeeded. It must be hard being a purist, these movies our excellent unto themselves.
10.0~The Greatest Film Ever Made Workin_Man Sign in Permalink When I went to see this movie, I had high expectations because I saw the other two Lord of the Rings movies and thought they were both amazing. But when I saw this movie I was in awe. This film went way beyond my expectations. There aren't enough words in the English language that could describe how good this movie is. It's just incredible!! This also marks the first time that I have ever cried in a movie theater. And I am not a person who usually cries during a movie. Out of the three Lord of the Rings movies, this one is the best by far. It is currently sitting at #4 on the top 250 here at IMDb. However, I think this movie should be #1 by a few miles. It is just so good. I can't understand how any other movie could be better. This is definitely a movie that everybody on Earth should see at some point in their lifetime. Yeah it's that good!! 10/10
9.0~Grade: A- slap_n00ts Sign in Permalink December 19th, 2001 The day that the first installment of the wildly popular Lord Of The Rings Trilogy was delivered to us from New Zealand born director Peter Jackson, The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. It was also on that day that a jumpstart to a whole new generation of rabid fan boys was unleashed, and a whole new meaning to the word epic was born. One year soon passed, marking the arrival of the second part of the epic trilogy, The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers. While not as good as FoTR, TTT was a very good installment that introduced us to a whole new world of CGI characters - Gollum. Finally, after another agonizing yearlong wait; The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King arrived, setting the standard on how to properly release (and end) a trilogy. Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 3 years, the whole plot of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy is about a Hobbit named Frodo Baggins who is sent on an agonizing and rough journey to destroy `the one ring' that holds the power to all Middle Earth. After creating a fellowship of the ring, Frodo and the newly found fellowship continue the journey to Mount Doom - the one place where the ring can be destroyed. The fellowship soon gets split up, leaving Sam and Frodo all alone. Both Sam and Frodo then have a run in with Gollum, the former possessor of the ring. After a brief fight, Gollum then reluctantly agrees to help Frodo on his quest. However, during the painstaking journey, Gollum soon becomes entranced by the ring's power once again, secretly turning his back on Frodo. All right, so that was FoTR and TTT. RoTK is where we finally see Frodo destroy the ring (If you did not know this, then I have pity on your poor soul. It's how they get there that matters) and finish his book (Also titled The Lord Of The Rings) Regarding the Oscars, I'd say RoTK is a shoe-in for Best Picture. Out of the all the other possible nominees, this one is most deserving, as both its technical merit and entertainment value deliver like no other Best Picture nominee I've seen. So now that Best Picture is taken care of, what's left? The stunning direction by Peter Jackson? Of course! The beautiful and poetic score by Howard Shore? Without a doubt. The dazzling New Zealand cinematography? Flawless. Or how about the special effects used to create Gollum and the rest of the movie? Oh heck, every technical aspect of this movie is perfect. I believe Elvis Mitchell from the New York Times summed it up when he said, ' King is the product of impressive craft and energy.' Remember Helms Deep from The Two Towers? Ha! The battle on Pellenor Fields ups the ante and absolutely CRUSHES Helm's Deep. It is quite possibly the best fight scene I have ever witnessed. Not once did I get bored or want it to end. In short, it's breathtaking. There will most likely be countless studios trying to duplicate and make a better fight scene than this one, but quite frankly, I don't think it will ever be beaten. See this in theatres, folks. Not even a big screen TV and surround sound system can match this theatrical experience. Technical details aside, allow me to mention the acting. How I loved the acting here (Well, all but one performance which will be mentioned later) There is not a doubt in my mind that someone here will win an acting award - particularly Sean Astin as Sam, Elijah Wood as Frodo and Ian McKellen as Gandalf. I have not yet had the chance to read the highly acclaimed books, but I'm sure the performances are worthy and ones that would make JRR Tolkien happy if he were alive today. I also just want to take time and mention a performance that I'm sure is going to get overlooked. Billy Boyd as Pippin. I quite liked the guy here. He added something special to the third installment, with his appearances being high up on my list of favorite moments. His song playing in the background to when the Orcs arrived on land was beautiful. When it comes to complaints, I have only one, but it is enough to bring down the overall score. That one minor complaint involves the very stupid and pointless role of Arwen. Why Peter Jackson decided to keep her in this movie is beyond me. She added nothing at all. Also, it didn't really bother me, but I know it will for some - and that's the butt numbing runtime of 201 minutes, nearly the length of FoTR's Extended Edition. In conclusion, I am still undecided as to with LoTR is better. A re-watch on FoTR might be in order, but for now I think I'll give the slight edge to RoTK. Regardless of who gets top spot, it's really hard to believe that the journey of Frodo Baggins is over. A spectacular finale to a wonderful trilogy that is sure to be remembered for years to come. Take that Matrix Revolutions.
10.0~Greatest Movie of . . .ever! WildwoodFlower08 Sign in Permalink The Return Of The King has been my favorite movie, ever, since I saw it in December 2003. After the Helms Deep battle of The Two Towers, I was wondering how the heck PEter Jackson would top it. But he did, and with flying colors. The reason this movie is so amazing is the focus not only on the epic battles and awe-inspiring special effects, but the emotion going on in each of the characters. It is one of the most emotional movies I've seen. You can see the wear-and-tear of Frodo, the internal battle of Aragorn, the angst of Eowyn, the hope of Gandalf . . .its all there. The Frodo/Sam/Gollum scenes become a bit boring after a while, they never seem to get any closer, and Frodo tires out many times. But this can be overlooked by the journey the rest of the characters take, and the amazing finale. This movie caused me to cry more than once, six different scenes in all. But the highlight of this movie is my favorite of all parts of all 3 LOTR movies- the Rohirrim march at Pelennor Fields. It brings tears to my eyes every time. This movie is so amazing because of its ability to be an epic battle story, while still having elements of comedy, romance, emotion, and everything good that goes into a movie. In 2 words: watch it.
9.0~Great movie but wasn't a 10 mattgking Sign in Permalink First, on behalf of my family who are LOTR fans, thanks to Peter Jackson and his crew for making our dream come true. Your tremendous efforts in staying true with the books, creativities and the special effects are beyond the Tolkien fans' expectation. (Spoilers ahead!!!) I especially like the following: the lighting of the beacons scene, the artistic scene of Denethor eating intertwined with Faramir riding into battle with Pippin singing. It's beautiful and heartening! The horse riding and the background scenes were 'picture-perfect'. Minas Tirith is every bit real as I have imagined it. Frodo and Sam's struggle to reach Mount Doom was realistic and we could feel the power of the ring which dramatically deteriorated the hobbit. The fight between Frodo and Golum in Mt. Doom was much better in the movie than in the book. My 9 year old son loves the speeches, especially the one Aragorn made at the Black Gate. However, I have a bone or two to pick with PJ: The movie was lack of the emotional relationship and bonding of other characters such as Eowyn and Faramir or Legolas and Gimli. While the movie showed the internal struggles that Faramir and Eowyn faced individually, their love with one another was never developed and no closures were done for both of them except for the 1 second flip at the crowning of the king; The battle scenes were too long! Let's face it, how many oliphaunts can you kill! The paths of death and the arrival of the ships to rescue Minas Tirith were weak; Whatever happened to the Mouth of Sauron showing Frodo's Mithril shirt to the fellowship? It was a powerful message in the book! The reunion of the fellowship was too much like the first movie. Legolas and Gimli didn't have much to say in the movie while their bond was much strengthened in the book. That said, I gave it a 9 after my third viewing. I can't wait for the extended version and hope there will be more.
4.0~Good? smorris200 Sign in Permalink I know I am in a minority but I did not think this was a truly great film. It was good and I liked it but not great. I thought the story was painfully predictable and just could not get use to the guy playing Frodo. He just seemed so weak, there was nothing about the character that made me care about him. I thought Ian Holm did an excellent job as Bilbo and perhaps that was the problem. Frodo compared to Bilbo was pretty pathetic!!! The special effects are very good, and Andy Serkis who did the gollum bit deserves applaud but I recently watched Braveheart again and The Last Samurai and I thought the battle scenes in those films were far better. OK, they were not on such a grand scale, but they are more "realistic". Now, I know this is a fantasy film and was aimed at a much younger audience but I preferred the more realistic battles in the films already mentioned. To see "orlando" sliding all over that big battle elephant thing just looked poor. But anyway, no doubt the film will win a whole host of oscars and other accolades. I just wonder if it will still be so revered in years to come? 7/10
1.0~Can you say "Overkill?" jupiter2-6 Sign in Permalink There's nothing deep or important going on here, so a critique of this film is almost unnecessary. What passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced, loud, stunning "Imax" experiment in eye-candy that masks, once again, a slowly moving, thin story line. Obviously, the members of SAG have dispensed with background checks on film editors. There's enough slow-motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice. Many people will be amazed by the neverending, in-your-face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also, you'd better search elsewhere. It's like trying to read the Latin version of "War And Peace" while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender. And if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasn't enough, just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine-glazed, overlit endings. And there are at least 5 of them. For a while, I was expectin Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost to show up and smile goodbye. And Cate Blanchett never looked so vapid. It's brass, tacky, loud, long, obvious schlock and thus hugely popular. Beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example. Giving so many awards to this fillibuster is just a waste of gold-plating.
10.0~Tolkien would be proud! Kyntara_Thelarus Sign in Permalink I said it before and I shall venture to say it again, Peter Jackson, thank you for making my fantasy a reality. I have never seen any film so visually stunning, a cast so immensely beautiful, nor a director as captivating. Peter Jackson is the Lord of the Cinema! Ronald would be proud to know his books have been turned into a cinematic dynasty. As a loyal reader of Tolkien for the past 15 years, I can say that these films have touched me very deeply. I can honestly say that I have never been so delighted to see the world of Middle-Earth brought to life in this manner. I have seen the animated versions of "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" and was vehemently disappointed at both of them. However, the Peter Jackson live-action version is the only version there needs to be. To the following people: Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic Monaghan, Miranda Otto, Brad Dourif, Sir Ian McKellen, Sir Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Marton Csokas, Craig Parker, Elijah Wood, Karl Urban, David Wenham, Hugo Weaving, Bernard Hill, John Noble, Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Phillipa Boyens, The WETA team, and New Line Cinema thank you for making Middle-Earth a reality. And to the family of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, I cannot express my gratitude enough for letting these films be made. Thank you...
10.0~The Best Trilogy Ever rotsac Sign in Permalink The trilogy of the Lord of The Rings is the best trilogy ever made and it is amazing... Of course that don't have everything that are in the books like: -Tom Bombadil -Barrow Wights -Erkenbrand -The Grey Company -The Gondor reinforcements in ships from other cities -The Lords of Gondor like Elphir, Hirluin... -Dol Amroth and Prince Imrahil and their charge to help the Rohirrim -Battle in the Shire -The Scout of Gondor that send the Red Arrow -Ghan-buri-Ghan and his people -Sam use the ring And other things but the movies aren't the book, is not because of that that the movie is better or worse, the movie is an adaptation not the book... My advice 1st of all is to you see the extended versions, have some more and cool details that make the trilogy better :) The scenarios are amazing the mountains and all this, the backgrounds are amazing I think it was a great production :) So my congratulations to the all people that act indirect or direct in the movie and all the fans of Tolkien that make possible all this huge success... Now wait for the Hobbit :) In short words: LOTR -> Epic! :) (Sy for my English, Portuguese here) Regards Rodolfo Fernandes Costa
7.0~It was good, but too long Smells_Like_Cheese Sign in Permalink Now, this was a brillantly made film. I will give the director a lot of credit for that. But the only problem I had was, this film was just too long. I remember in the theater the audience kept sighing in frustration when a scene would fade and then go into another scene. It was a good movie, my favorite is still "The Two Towers". "The Return of the King" is my least favorite. Sorry, LOTR fans. 7/10
10.0~Wonderful Film manda317 Sign in Permalink I think that the Lord of the Rings: The Reutrn of the King was the perfect finish to a wonderful trilogy. The movie was long but I do not believe that affected the greatness of the film. The graphics were once again spectacular and the acting was tremendous. The actors really dedicated themselves to their roles and it shows on the screen. They effectively show their characters change from the first movie to the last. The was a lot more humor in this movie and is good for a good laugh. There is also a lot of scenes that will make the audience cry. Like I said before, the perfect end. I recommend this movie to anyone. LOTR fan or not.
10.0~Great film! Follows the book almost exactly! jskiles1 Sign in Permalink Great all around film. Nice action, nice CGI, nice drama, all that is Lord of the Rings. See this film as many times as you can to support the great team that brought you this awesome trilogy! I would recommend this film to people above 16 or mature younger children because the plot is hard to understand if you are stupid.
10.0~Everything the critics said and more! PompeyV Sign in Permalink Amidst the eagerness and anticipation I had going in there was a little niggling voice that said, "But is it going to be everything you hoped? The critics loved it but can the reviews be trusted?" The answer is: yes. This movie is anything but slow. It is fast-paced but never loses you (even at 2 in the morning, and I mean that literally.) Some scenes felt a bit disjointed but that will probably be remedied in the obligatory Special Edition Extended DVD. The scenery was fantastic, especially Minas Tirith and Mount Doom, and the CGI critters like the oliphants were less "fake" than they were in FOTR and TTT. Even Arwen's intrusions were not out of place and helped move the plot along in some cases. Be warned: the ending is a tear-jerker, just like the book. PJ may have penchant for gore and a dislike for magic but he has the eye of an artist and the mind of a poet. But keep an eye out for his little jokes (like that old guy in the Shire.)
10.0~The best of the three andkuhn Sign in Permalink I fell in love with LTR when the first one came out. I had no desire to see Fellowship, but was talked into it anyway. I thought I'd hate the movie. I never read any of the books chalking them to some geeky swords, and wizards thing. I was wrong. Fellowship was amazing. I ran out and got the books, and became a huge fan of Tolkien and his writing. The toughest part of the series of books for me was Return of the King. Not because it was bad, but because it was the end. I had vested alot of time in reading the series of books, and felt like in a weird way like they were friends. I really cared about these people in the books. So instead of taking me a month to read it took me 4 months to finish simply because I didn't want they journey to end and for me to have to say goodbye to them. So, when the last movie came out it had alot to live up to in my mind. The final installment lives up to all the hype that most movies do not. It ties up everything very nicely. Some have criticized it for being too long or too short, but I think this is what we all go to the movies for. To get vested in the lives of the characters. To care what happens to them, and when its over we may even feel a little sad. This is the best movie of the year. No other movie comes close to the scope, the work, or the love this movie has behind it and in it.
10.0~The Most Epic Conclusion to a Fantasy Franchise Ever! Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 Sign in Permalink Where do I even begin with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? It is one of the finest film trilogies to ever make it to the big screen. Peter Jackson was admittedly an unexpected choice of director for the trilogy. Before Lord of the Rings, he made The Frighteners, Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, and Heavenly Creatures. Heavenly Creatures was his first step out of absurd cinema, and then after The Frighteners came out in 1996, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released in 2001 and became a critical, commercial and prestigious success. The Two Towers had the same success in 2002, and finally The Return of the King came and was the greatest of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and the first ever fantasy movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and went on to win the BAFTA for Best Film and The Golden Globe for Best Picture - Drama. The Return of the King won all these awards for the right reasons. It was epic, gorgeous, a story that has been told consistently great from start to finish, and everything works. Lord of the Rings is one of those tales that will live on forever and ever. J.R.R. Tolkien would be extremely proud, even if his son, Christopher, isn't proud of the movies. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King will be remembered and still be considered one of the finest movies ever made. An achievement on an epic cinematic level and a cultural milestone.
10.0~The Grand Finale Konie Sign in Permalink I am a nerd when it comes to Lord of the Rings, (probably not as big as others), but being a nerd I have to say that this is my favorite movie of the amazing trilogy. I just love how well the movie was made and the action sequences always make my heart start pumping. The music is glorious to listen to and the movie as a whole is enchanting. Plus it has amazing actors doing amazing things. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seem it...but only if you have seen the first two! you have to see the first two in order for parts to make sense and click. It is one of those movies that you can practically can watch with anyone, anytime.
9.0~A great banger to end the series ethanborrows-82288 Sign in Permalink To end one of the great series of all time this film make sure not to forget it. Taking all of the great traits and things from the first and second one it is a satisfying conclusion to this series
9.0~LOTR Return of The King extended edition theodoremartin Sign in Permalink This movie was riveting I thought the first 2 were good but this last film of this epic adventure was amazing, peter Jackson has surpassed himself. Frodo's character played by Elijah Wood was phenomenal laying bear all the raw emotions of one so young and facing all that life could throw at him with his ever faithful friend Samwise Gamgee by his side to both witness and bear his friends struggle with the Evil hanging both around his neck and infront of him in the shape of the clearly demented Gollum, who was waiting to destroy them all at any given time. The others Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and friends also on there own colision courses with destiny and danger battling the Orcs and Saruman, Aragorn doing inner battle with his undying love for Arwen and what is right for his people and all others depending on the defeat of Sauron. A superb cast all greatly suited to there roles and characters doing much justice to a great film trilogy. A big shame non of them were ever nominated for Oscars although very worthy all of them in my opinion.
9.0~An Overview of one of the greatest films in motion picture history... krishnaraj613 Sign in Permalink Note: The following is an overview of The Return Of The King. Though there are no blunt spoilers, there are brief references to the scenes in the film. Those who have not watched the film CAN read this review as there are no open references to notable events in the movie. I went in to watch The Fellowship Of The Ring when it was released in cinema with low expectations. I had watched Harry Potter prior to LOTR's release, and I found HP to be an extremely bad film. Fantasy films just don't work, I told myself. But when I left the theatre after The Fellowship Of The Ring, I was awed. The film was SO BEAUTIFUL. To this day, I find 'Fellowship' to be the most beautiful of the three, but that is beside the point. I read the LOTR books in three weeks, and watched 'Fellowship' two more times. Needless to say, at this point, I was a Ring-Nut-- something I never thought could happen, because I am not an avid fan of movies in general. The following year, The Two Towers was released. I found it rather disappointing (mostly due to the severe modifications to Tolkien's initial story)... but when the Extended Version was released, I graded The Two Towers better than 'Fellowship' itself. This film was MASTERFUL in every detail. The anticipation for The Return Of The King was at boiling point. Late in 2003, I entered the cinema for the ride of my life- Peter Jackson's third installment to the franchise. Avid now though I may be, I left the theatre with mixed feelings. ROTK is basically about the last step to destroy the One Ring, and the Free Peoples' final effort to battle the forces of Mordor. For a complete synopsis, you can check it out in IMDB's ROTK page under 'Synopsis'. Anyway, back to the overview: On the downside, the film had too many endings (not a very nice touch from PJ). It was disorientating to sit through the last part due to the constant fades. Next, the film seemed chopped. This was really, really disappointing. It seemed as though the film had been brutally censored (and indeed, it had to be edited tediously to fit the 3-1/2 hour time frame). The film seemed to lack certain key scenes which were clearly cut from the theatrical release. Even though these problems will be rectified in the much anticipated Extended Version, it was still sad to see PJ being forced to cut his work down to size due to the movie executives' demands. Saruman (Christopher Lee) does not appear at all, and a scene where he takes over the Shire has been scrapped. So, I left the cinema feeling I had not watched the entire film. Now for the plus side (What would a Ring-Nut be if he did not comment on his favourite film?)... Let me just start by saying ( apart from the severe editing ), that The Return Of The King is the EPIC that the Lord Of The Rings was meant to be. The heart and soul of Tolkien's legendary adventure is wholly captured in this very film. It was BRILLIANT to the finest detail (except the editing). Here is a list of why you MUST watch this movie: (1)Performances-- The actors' performances in ROTK was simply excellent. Though characters like Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom,& J.R. Davies) barely get any screen time (the Three Hunters only get a few lines in this film), these characters have already had a taste of glory in the previous two installments. ROTK is the time for previously dormant characters to shine. The best acting, undeniably, came from Sean Astin as Sam Gamgee. His performance was remarkable and so heartfelt. For the first time in my life, tears rolled down my face while watching a movie. I have watched many,many films, but this was the first time that I actually got tearful-- because of Astin's ferociously loyal performance. The unforgettable scene where a sore and weather-beaten Sam carries his master up the jagged mountain-side was more than I could bear-- Astin was excellent. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen, as before, are stoically masterful in their respective roles; Wood being the weary and burdened Frodo, McKellen being the powerful wizard Gandalf. In this film, hobbits Merry and Pippin (Dom Monaghan and Billy Boyd) prove their worth and solidify their part in the fellowship. Pippin is sworn into the ranks of the Gondorian army, whereas Merry takes an oath to join the Rohirrim(this scene was cut, but it can be seen briefly in the trailer). Both hobbits do extraordinary things--one slays a vicious minion, while the other rescues a dying hero (I will not spoil the movie for those that have not seen it). Merry and Pippin come across as heroic and tougher than they first seemed in this film, and I loved that. Eowyn (Miranda Otto) was splendid in her breakthrough role, but Eomer(karl Urban) does not improve much from the previous film. Disappointingly, Faramir (David Wenham) is even worse off than he was in Two Towers as he does not do any fighting, though his potrayal of the neglected son was good. John Lone does a good job of playing Steward Denethor, the bad father. Gollum is now all-evil, yet he is not as touching as he was in Two Towers (Andy Serkis gets a chance to play Smeagol before the corruption of the Ring in ROTK). I found myself hating Gollum to the max in this film, particularly in the scene where he frames Sam and turns Frodo against him. Overall, with respect to performances, the non-heroes of the previous two films--Sam, Merry, Pippin, Eowyn,and to some extent Denethor & Theoden-- are really the stars of this film. (2)Visual Effects(obviously)-- By now, everyone should know that the visual and special effects of the LOTR trilogy is the best in any film so far (to date). In ROTK, the visual effects and sets are wonderfully designed and awesome. From the chilling lair of Shelob to the bloody fields of Pellenor, the special effects are top-notch. WETA has come up with some truly superb effects which make the huge battle sequences unforgettable (example: the terrifying besiegers- consisting of armored trolls and war elephants). Though they are remarkable, the editing does interfere with the feel of the film (example: for anyone who has already seen the film-- We see Gandalf talking to Pippin about death while the door is being rammed by trolls tring to break it down, and the next time we see Gandalf is when he is walking across a corpse-strewn field towards Aragorn; Have you ever wondered what happened in between? What happened when that door broke and the trolls came through? Questions which will be answered in the Extended Edition) (3)Musical score- I am NOT a fan of musical scores from movies, but Howard Shore's music for the Lord Of The Rings was fantastic. It even brought me to tears on several occassions--like when the King and the people of Gondor bow down to the hobbits in the end, the unbearably innocent 'Shire' theme plays for the first time in the film since the end of Two Towers. Be sure to listen out for Shore's brilliant theme music while watching any of the three films again--Personally, The Fellowship Of The Ring's music was the best. Songs of hope and courage like Enya's 'May It Be' and Annie Lennox's 'Into The West' make the Lord Of The Rings one of the most colourful films of all time. I could go on, for there are many other great reasons for viewing this film, but that would just take forever. Simple advice: WATCH THIS MOVIE! EVERYONE IN THE WORLD ALREADY HAS! The greatness of these films cannot be denied. The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King was the FIRST fantasy film to win an Oscar for Best Picture, and it has 11 (ELEVEN) Academy Award wins--a clean sweep, since it WON in ALL the categories it was nominated for. Historic for a film. The trilogy shares I think over 25 Oscar nominations between them, and is undeniably majestic. As for the savage editing in ROTK, I am eagerly awaiting the Extended Version, which is reportedly over 4 hours long. One should not regard the trilogy as three seperate films, but as one long film. The films were shot continuously, and Peter Jackson himself calls LOTR his '12-hour movie'. 'Fellowship' held the beauty and innocence of the three,'Towers' had the peril and action, and 'King' has the courage and hope of the trilogy. I conclude this overview by stating that this is a great film by any standard, and everyone should watch it. The Lord Of The Rings was a lovely book written by Prof. J.R.R. Tolkien, and it was brought to life by the genius of Peter Jackson. It will always stand in the halls of motion picture excellence as a timeless classic...
10.0~Stop comparing the trilogy to Star Wars - the idea is LUDICROUS! tony-clifton Sign in Permalink 1) the Lord of the Rings was written in the 1950s 2) George Lucas is a huge fan of Tolkien 3) George Lucas likes the Lord of the Rings so much, he made a clone movie (good pun right?) called "Willow" - remember? 4) a lot of the themes and plot elements of the Star Wars trilogy are in fact BASED on the the Lord of the Rings: a) old teacher "dies" in first movie but doesn't really b) second installment ends in a cliff-hanger (the original "Two Towers" novel ends in a big cliff-hanger") c) last installment surrounds the "Return" of something - I mean COME ON - Return of the Jedi:Return of the King!!! So to compare the two series is ridiculous, especially by some who think Star Wars is actually better! To think that is to insult Tolkien and his influence he had over George Lucas. By the way The Return of the King rocks! I will give a more detailed review later.
10.0~Magnificent jeremiedelaboudiniere Sign in Permalink I'm so glad Peter Jackson adapted these brilliant books from JRR Tolkien... A world in which we can escape as spectator and as actor too... Thank you Mr Jackson ! We can travel in Middle Earth through the beautiful work of the whole crew and those Oscars were widely deserved. The Hobbit Trilogy is different, but I trust Peter Jackson to finish it with wits and through the whole experience of those ten last years. I'm waiting to see There and Back Again though, cause the end won't be easy to adapt. Hopefully, it should blow everyone's mind ! A Mellon, hobbit in modern times.
10.0~movie of the millennia cf_scorpio Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has definitely done it again and hasn't let his fans down in any way shape or form. ROTK keeps you at the edge of the seat throughout the movie, while tugging at your heart in several places. All characters are more developed and you really can see how each of them have grown - this is especially true of Sam, Aragorn and Frodo. The action scenes leave you in awe and wanting more. (I am aware some people may think this is geeky, but...) After seeing the movie 5 times, i still cried at each moving part and still needed my Kleenex as "The End" popped up in the familiar font that we all know and love...ah well...I'm just looking forward to the extended edition now which will be 10 times better because more emotion will be seen.
10.0~The greatest movie ever made! Rounding off a perfect trilogy! supertom-3 Sign in Permalink The final instalment in what has been the greatest cinematic feat that I can imagine. How Peter Jackson could have taken the reigns of such a titanic beast of three movies, of the same story, is beyond me. The sheer scale is flabbergasting. We have been enthralled since the Fellowship commenced their quest 2 years ago. It's so sad now that this has ended. The films of Tolkien's marvellous fable have given Christmas a new excitement for many who had lost any excitement over the Christmas period, that's certainly how I felt. For three years however LOTR has been an event for me and my family and friends. I love the LOTR. I love everything the film stands for, everything about these films. I love the way they combine the best of old fashioned skill and labour to build all the sets and every aspect of the mise en-scene. I love the fact that for the year of the photography of this movie, Hobbiton was built, and Theodon's town was built, and Gondors stronghold was built. I love the fact that this film is a labour of love, and that it shows. I love the fact that CGI is used alongside these old fashioned techniques and the scale of the film isn't entirely down to a computer like the Star wars prequels are. This is 300million dollars of blood and sweat on the screen, filmed lovingly and created lovingly by all involved, none more so than Peter Jackson, who has to get an academy award for this instalment, having missed out unfairly for the last two. ROTK Is my favourite part, followed by the Fellowship, I just loved the beginning segment, but the final third is so amazing, it genuinely feels that as an audience member you have been on a really massive journey. It feels far more than the 9 and a half hours it has all been, It feels like we have been on a 3 year journey. This closing of the saga is jaw dropping, engrossing stuff. Everything that made the first 2 movies excellent is once again evident, but like Two Towers was compared to the first, there is a massive jump in scale. The scale of this movie, from the sets, to the effects is so huge it's scary at times, and Peter Jackson is an amazing director to have harnessed all of this together. It goes beyond my imagination to think how someone could direct all of this. The cast once again are first rate, but this movie belongs to Viggo Mortenson and Sean Astin, who should both get Oscar nominations. All the actors involved have peaked with these movies, because they have on the most part risen to a level no one would have guessed of them before these movies. Viggo is a good example. He has never been a leading man, sad as it is because I have always thought he was a good actor, I only thought he was good though before this. Now I see him as an excellent actor and a leading man. LOTR is by far and away his finest work and his finest performances and he has now taken his place in the A-list. Sean Astin also really surprised me, he stepped it up to a level no one would have guessed, particularly in ROTK when his character is integral to the plot and he gets far more focus and depth and he rises to the challenge. The audience really feel endeared to Sam and that is down to Astin. Viggo Mortenson was great in the first two and became a lead in the Two Towers, and once again he is a lead in this one, but this is the most important movie in Aragon's saga and Mortenson is outstanding. He makes for a great action man, because he looks tough, he performs most of his own stunts but feels more like a true hero, which is what LOTR is all about, real heroes, true courage, the epitomy of which is the four Hobbits. Like I said Astin is excellent and steals the movie jointly with Viggo, but the other Hobbits are excellent and there are larger roles for Merry and Pippin played excellently by Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan. Billy Boyd is superb in this. The rest of the cast are all great. There's not one bad performance. Ian Mckellen is excellent as Gandalf but we already knew he was top class. Also more outstanding work from, Bernard Hill, John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Karl Urban, John Noble, Andy Serkis, and David Wenhem. Absolutely fantastic cast full of moving performances. The action of the film is amazing. Massive battles that dwarf the previous films and also thrilling scenes with the Hobbits, including Frodo's encounter with the Shelob, a giant Spider intent on eating him. It's really just pure excitement and tension throughout, the tension of the battles, the tension that comes from Gollum's presence around Frodo and Sam. The Orc invasion of Gondor is amazing, particularly when the giant Elephants come into play. The film also has the best score of the three, it is sweeping and massive and epic. Even more so than the first two. The key to this film is the likeable characters, who all seem real, all human with emotion and weakness but they still drive forward to help others and this film is really about what courage is. Courage isn't about Schwarzenegger taking on an army single handed, it's four little Hobbits out of their depth, in the face of real adversity who show real courage to carry on when all hope is lost. Real courage is about the tens of thousands of men who follow their leaders into battle knowing the are fighting a battle they have little chance of winning. That's why we love these people and this story, it touches everyone in some way, from people who have been in real life war situations feeling how the Hobbits felt, to people respecting the bravery these Hobbits show. All in all it saddens me to be commenting on the final LOTR movie, I'll keep my fingers crossed for The Hobbit by Peter Jackson, but I get the feeling there will never be a series of movies like these again with such passion in them and such an epic scope, and such a fantastic group of characters. I hope to see a couple of re-launched careers going where they obviously should be, on the up. Particularly Viggo Mortenson, it's about time he had some more leading roles, and some juicier roles like this was. Also Sean Astin, who I only remember from films like The Goonies and California Man. I also expect good things from Elijah Wood as well. Things have already gone excellently for Orlando Bloom, who is the hottest property in Hollywood at the moment. Anyway, well done Mr Jackson, we all salute you! *****
10.0~The Greatest Trilogy Of All Time Kraush Sign in Permalink Extremely Minor Spoilers Wow and wow. 2003 has seen the endings of two very successful trilogies, The Matrix Revolutions and The Return Of The King. However where as the Matrix ended in dissapointing fashion, The Lord Of The Rings brings it's story to an exciting and satisfying close, crowning itself one of the greatest endings to a trilogy ever. Of course you probably already knew that. The main reason that the last two movies in the trilogy didn't slip into mediocrity would be the fact that this was one entire story broken into three parts. Not the usual trilogy where one is written and then others are made after to capitalize on it's success. This is one movie, one story, broken into three parts. And since Tolkien has created such an amazing world and array of characters these films virtually couldn't and shouldn't have dissappointed. Never has such an amazing story been shown in films, an imagination so great and a vision so fully realized.The third installment in the saga, The Return Of The King, brings the long journey to an end. Frodo and Sam are on the verge of reaching Mount Doom and Aragorn will fullfill his destiny in becoming king. The acting in this movie is simply wonderful. You've all seen the first two unless you've been living in a hole, and the same quality, same character is evident in ROTK. The visuals themselves are unbelievable. The battles in ROTK make Helms Deep seem as though it was a minor bar brawl. Peter Jackson is an amazing director who knows how to blend the wonderful computer effects with the live actors. Seeing the Riders Of Rohan flank the army of Sauron and then do battle with the monstrous Elephonts is quite a site, and the visuals manage to make everything real and convincing and bear no sense of looking fake. Scenes such as Gandalf riding through Minas Tirith beautifully blend the CG and the real as I mentioned above. Considering Peter Jackson only really directed comedic horror movies before taking the the helm in directing LOTR makes him that much more impressive. The landscapes continue to be visually stunning, the great city of Minas Tirith is extremely impressive. And even the real landscapes are beautiful, a tribute to New Zealand. Never has a movie before made me want to travel to the place where it was filmed as ROTK has. Some may say with a running time of 3 hours and 30 minutes that you'll be squirming in your seat, but that's false. This movie needed to be that length and none of it's sequences ever slip into boredom. Even with it's long running time I found myself wishing it would never end. Of course fans of the book will be a little dissapointed about some aspects that have been changed. Such as Sauramon not even being in the movie, but all this can and should be forgiven. The final fact is that the Return of The King and the Lord Of The Rings trilogy are a cinematic acheivement that brings a classic story to the screen with satisfying results. I myself will not choose a favorite of the trilogy because I enjoyed them all and like to think of them as part of the story more then individual films. But I will say this The Return of the King is unmatched by any other films that have come out this year, and The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy is possibly the greatest of all time. Verdict: ***** Can't wait for the 4 hour + extended edition
8.0~Okay, it's good, but the CG and length are excessive. - 8 of 10 deadsenator Sign in Permalink I have enjoyed the LOTR trilogy as much as anyone, but the computer graphics got a bit out of hand for my tastes in this one. The sets are fantastic, but they could've worked a little harder on the special effects to make them seem a bit more real. Aside from that, I wonder how someone can easily breath sulfur gas, wonder why stories must be so tidy, and remember that intermissions are a good thing. I loved the film, but a few things make it less powerful than the first (which I rank the best of the three), but a magnificent film and story, nonetheless. Bring dinner and a pillow. 8 of 10
1.0~Terrible adaptation. eruiluvatar001 Sign in Permalink Many people justify Jackson's drivel by saying that "everyone interprets the books differently." Jackson, however, not only "adapted" Tolkien's story, but created his own. He removed Tolkien's dialogue and replaced it with hackneyed banter; he replaced scenes of drama and suspense with slapstick and hamboning. The majesty and dignity of characters such as Gimli, Aragorn, Sam, Frodo, Gollum and Theoden (almost all the characters, really) are reduced to snivelling, whimpering and slapstick jokes. Arwen, Elrond and Galadriel, the most noble characters in the series, are reduced to whimpering fools. The disrespect that Jackson shows for the characters makes clear the lack of interest he has in faithfully presenting Tolkien's work. Tolkien, after all, related to his characters so closely that he had their names engraved on his own tombstone. It is insulting to Tolkien's memory to deal with his characters with such irreverence, considering how much he cared about them. It's insulting to Tolkien's memory. While many dispute this, I find the movies to be amateurish, and the special effects are mediocre (considering the heights of computer generated effects that other studios have reached)despite the rave reviews it gets. Making a mediocre movie isn't really a sin in itself; making a bad movie and claiming that it has any relationship to Tolkien's work, however, is. Movie gets one star out of ten, but it's more deserving of zero. That people have read Tolkien's book and yet find any similarity or value in Jackson's movies baffles me. They are without merit, being poorly made and completely disrespectfully adapted from the books. Jackson has not merely spit on Tolkien's grave, he has forever tainted his legacy with his awful "interpretation" of his work.
5.0~I'm exhausted! jrfranklin01 Sign in Permalink Whew! Gotta catch my breath before I start this writeup! ......Okay, I'm alright now. Sorry, but I just watched Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and I feel as if I just ran 50 miles (whatever that feels like). Anyway, I'm tired man! This movie is a Die-Hardest film, where no matter how fast it goes or beaten up it gets, it just doesn't die. You think it's just about whipped and done for, but it keeps on going. If you've seen the movie A.I. you know exactly what I'm talking about. You think the movie is going to end or has ended (and rightfully you should), it instead goes on another round or two. The intermission which they cruelly deprive us from in these marathon movies is removed as your mind takes on an endurance contest with a visual barrage of elements and then a ride on a turbo-charged merry-go-round. All of this to expel each....fading......breath....with.......another...............ending.
9.0~I don't regret the journey kiwiie_fraise Sign in Permalink I probably didn't give a 10. If possible I would have given a 9,5. At some point during the movie, I actually told myself : this is not logical, this could be done like that, etc. These are only small details, don't bear much importance. How hard is it to find a trilogy where the last movie is actually even better than the previous ones ? However LoTR is one of those movies where each movies get more exciting and sublime than the previous. I fell in love with all the characters and there's no denying the cast was absolutely out of ordinary. Not once I thought they were actors. There was no Orlando Bloom, no Elijah Wood, no Ian Mckellen, etc. It was simply Frodo, Samwise, Pippin, etc. That's what made them so moving and lovable. I used to be one these who would spit on LoTR because of my lack of interest for fantasy movies with tons of special effects, but this one was way beyond my expectations. Every scene was perfect, the decor was incredible, special effects almost undetectable (it's just as if the Middle-Earth was really part of the map). I can't believe I waited 11 years since the release of The Return of the King to actually watch this whole masterpiece. But in the end, it was so captivating that I completed the extended version in one weekend. Briefly what I have to say is : If you haven't seen it yet, please do it ! If you didn't like it, you must have missed a point ! If you liked it, watch it once again.
1.0~What a load of rubbish! smgtreker Sign in Permalink I thought LOTRs couldn't get any more drawn out, with pointless scenes, I was wrong! Plus, is Gandalf actually a wizard? If so, I must have the same powers as him, because I can also point a flashlight at things that fly in the sky!
8.0~Superelf to the rescue... BA_Harrison Sign in Permalink I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but strangely enough I don't mind too much that liberties have been taken with the original story to suit Peter Jackson's cinematic rendering: I understand and accept that changes are inevitable when adapting such an epic work for the big screen. What I cannot forgive, however, is giving Legolas' superpowers during the Battle of Pelennor Fields and cutting out one of my favourite parts the book—Saruman's fate (I know Christopher Lee feels the same way!). Watching a poorly rendered elf leaping around with impossible ease on a CGI 'oliphaunt' before killing all on board and sliding down the trunk (allowing Gimli to make another wisecrack) is going a step too far in my book, reminding me of the awful digital excesses that were to follow in Jackson's next film, King Kong (shudder); rounding off the film without showing us what happens to Lee's evil white wizard and his slimy pal Grima Wormtongue is an even worse decision, one that leaves fans of the book wondering whether they fell asleep before the end and missed an entire chunk (yeah, yeah, I know this bit is in the extended edition, but I'm talking about the version I paid to see at the cinema!). The Return of the King is still a very impressive effort, with stunning battle scenes, a genuinely creepy giant spider, an army of ghosts, and a thrilling climax that takes place inside an erupting volcano, and I'm grateful to all involved for realising what many considered to be totally un-filmable, but I really wanted the last chapter to be the best of the lot. And it isn't. Oh well, fingers crossed for The Hobbit...
1.0~What a Mess! bb3-1 Sign in Permalink This flick was about 1.5 hours too long! There was more wasted time and film in this installment, and none of it added anything to the production. This film certainly did not deserve any of the awards that it received. Thankfully, Elijah Wood only has about 25 minutes of screen time total for the entire film. I'm so glad this "trilogy" is over. I am also glad that I didn't go see this flick at the theater. I would have felt even worse had I spent 9 bucks on a ticket for this extended play boredom fest. Even at 2.99 the DVD rental was too much! At least I was able to make my own intermissions! NO film should be this long! I can't recommend this flick for anything but an aid for when you can't get to sleep. This was a three and a half hour passing of a gall stone! Shame on the academy for showering this tragic effort with so much gold.
10.0~No Comments!! akoul Sign in Permalink I think that anyone who wants to comment this legendary movie would sin! Who is capable to comment it? You cannot comment history as you comment a piece of art. In the theatre where i saw it for the second time, when the movie was reaching the end, i was praying that there will be some more! That the myth would continue! I was trying to figure out where this ship was heading so i could go and meet Gandalf, Elrod and the others! No way. That, WAS not a movie at all. It was real! Somehow, Peter Jackson went back in time with his camera and shooted FACTS! Please, do not comment this documentary any more; there are many other movies to do so...
10.0~"Return of the King" is a bittersweet conclusion to the greatest trilogy ever put to film. manonfire_jer209 Sign in Permalink I was one of the people who waited to reserve judgment on these movies until I had seen them all. I was inclined to rave about them as each one came out but with major disappointments like the the Star Wars prequels and Matrix sequels, I realized that you couldn't just take one installments quality for granted. Well suffice it to say that now that I have seen all three the sit on the number two spot on my top ten only beat by "The Shawshank Redemption". Peter Jackson deserves a thunderclap of applause for pulling these movies off so effortlessly. It's hard to imagine a time when I was actually skeptical on whether or not these films would be good. It seemed like a project doomed to failure from the start, especially when you look at Jackson's past resume. Making your name in cheap splatter films doesn't exact sell a person on you ability to handle one of the most epic undertakings in Hollywood history. I was utterly shocked when against all odds he pulled it off. Of course you can't give Pete all the praise. He was added immensely by a extremely talented cast. They all delivered memorable performances and made the most out of a story that doesn't really have much for character development. When I walked away from these movies I felt like I knew all of these characters well and was extremely sad to see their story end. That is this trilogy's greatest accomplishment. It rejuvenated my faith that Hollywood could pull off a great movie such as this and no matter how crappy everything else was throughout the year we always had the new Rings film to look forward to. I'm sad I can't feel that way anymore. 2005 has many films coming out with great potential but I have a hard time getting my hopes up as I have been let down so many times before. "Rings" eliminate those fears as I always had that one ray of sunshine waiting for me at the end of each year. These movies made me feel like a kid again as I gazed in awe at the cinema screen like I hadn't done since I first saw dinosaurs walk the Earth in "Jurrasic Park". I will cherish these movies for years to come and I look forward to being able to introduce my children to them when they get old enough. I only hope they can appreciate them as I do. Cheers!
2.0~Entended disappointment poikkeus Sign in Permalink How can a well-made adventure like RETURN OF THE KING be so numbingly dull? It's hard to fault the production design and special effects -- every inch of the widescreen palate is filled with colorful imagery. In addition, the cast acquits itself well, even though they're stuck with stilted and annoying faux Middle English dialog. Ultimately, the whole thing is so stiff and scripted that it comes off as lifeless, even as castles fall to the ground and thousands of creatures die. Maybe its least forgiving fault is the ending. Well, it's not quite an ending, because it never ends; it's one coda after another, and snickers could be heard from my otherwise reverent first day audience as the film refused to die. A great cinematic achievement? Peter Jackson's achievement is only technical, and I'm relieved that there aren't any more volumes in the trilogy.
1.0~Sorry again... benturkalj Sign in Permalink Okay, this is a pretty good movie, but I just find it hard to see it in the top five, thus the low score. Although it certainly has a lot of great things about it, there is a great deal wrong with it as well, which I suppose must be expected from a film that is trying to condense 500 pages of literature into over three hours. It must first be said that this clearly too long, or at least there are points in the film were it does seem to lumber along. It also seems that Jackson's choice in which parts of the film were to remain in the final cut left out a great deal of interesting stories from the books, and the ending is completely different to that of the book and unnecessary. That said, it is still an incredible achievement overall, with excellent battle scenes and amazing effects surrounding an already lovable story, but I still wish Jackson had made more use of the characters. It's a great film to watch for sure, much better then a lot of the stuff were seeing now, but it still could have been a great deal better.
9.0~Strongest of the trilogy sanispectraedu Sign in Permalink This is definitely the strongest of the trilogy. Visually appealing and the music is outstanding. The team did excellent job. Must watch.
10.0~Just incredible. RikWriter Sign in Permalink I went into this movie expecting something on the level of the Two Towers...very good, visually impressive, but not on the same spiritual and emotional level of the first movie, Fellowship of the Rings. I was surprised and totally awed by a movie that surpassed the first and that I can honestly say is, perhaps, one of the best movies ever made. Visually, it was awe-inspiring to the point where it has to honestly be considered as having the best special effects ever put to film. But the real impact is the emotional one...the acting, the characterization, the pacing were all simply perfect. I am humbled by the indescribably beautiful work of film that Peter Jackson has delivered to us in his rendition of the Lord of the Rings.
10.0~Fantastic Classic!!!! coinster610 Sign in Permalink This is the way all books should make their way to cinema! Cudos to Lord of The Rings! It surely deserved to sweep the academy awards as it did! Outrageously wonderful trio of films! Congratulations to Peter Jackson for bringing my favorite book to life in such a splendid way! The actors were fantastic as were the set designs, costuming, cgi, and everything else. Imagine...we put a man on the moon before this epic tome was able to make it to cinema. That just shows the scope of this awesome undertaking! And what a fantastic job they did. Never in my life did I think anyone would ever be able to do justice to the books. But they did! These movies are destined to become classics. They are movies to watch over and over again...
10.0~An epic movie that will last forever ! Kinvizer Sign in Permalink What can I say about this third opus of one of the most memorable trilogy of all time ? Everything, really. I remember seeing this movie in the theaters, in 2003 (already, time flies). This film hasn't aged a bit. OK maybe a little for the special effects but I'm just quibbling. It's more than that. The Return of the King concludes an epic journey for the Trilogy but also for movies in general. Peter Jackson's directing is stunning from A to Z. Howard Shore's music is just timeless. Everything is synced perfectly. The actors, the story, the action, all those epic battles. Everything put together is just a global and magnificent mix. This film and this trilogy have literally everything someone would want in it. I can't get enough of The Lord of The Rings. Even 15 years later. It's still my number 1 movie. If you are still one of the few people who hasn't yet seen this trilogy or this third movie, just go now !
10.0~BRILLIANT. sourapple Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is a magnificent movie, all on its own. Peter Jackson is a brilliant director. How he managed to put all of Tolkien's words into the screen is wonderful. I actually finished the Lord of the Rings books (including the Hobbit) 3 years ago. It was painstakingly difficult to read through intricate descriptions and words but all in all, it was a good (though some parts were snoozeville) read. And the movie is even better than the books. Great movie with great actors... truly a film to be remembered. Way cool.
10.0~WOW!! SLAYER1210 Sign in Permalink Hearing all the great reviews about the movie was enough for me. I went to the theater yesterday, anticipating the most amazing movie I'd ever seen- and I can say with assurance- that it was the closest I'd ever get to seeing a "perfect" movie. Everything on screen, from Shelob, to Pellenor, to the Paths of the Dead, I kept gasping and covering my mouth as to not release a scream! Although I had read most of the trilogy and researched much of it, I had a smile stuck on my face for three hours and twenty minutes. Everything I witnessed made me smile :) The ONE complaint I had was the missing scenes. Not so much Saruman at the beginning or the scouring of the shire but more of the Eowyn-Faramir story as well as Eomer- especially when he finds Eowyn after defeating the Witch King and even Faramir. With Eomer and Eowyn I had previously read how brilliant Karl Urban was and seeing a quick glimpse of it in the trailer, it had personally been one of the most anticipated scenes in the movie for me. Although I was slightly diappointed by the missing scenes- it is still the most AMAZING movie or even movies I have ever scene. No movie will ever top this- ever- It is the single most amazing film i have ever seen. I have to say, I have seen it twice and it has gotten better each time. Though people complain about the length, it goes very quickly and is wondeful to watch. I honestly cant put into words how amazing this movie is- everyone should go see it!
9.0~Wraps Up The Trilogy Perfectly, lesleyharris30 Sign in Permalink The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King is a fantastic movie with an amazing story,terrific cast,great characters,amazing effects that wraps up the Lord Of The Rings trilogy perfectly,one of the best trilogies ever made,Peter Jackson puts so much work into all of his movies and is so inspired in what he does.The characters of the series are amazing,my favorites being Frodo,Gandalf and of course Gollum and Smeagol,they make the movie for me,everything he says is gold. Frodo and Sam are nearly finished there nine month journey,they have reached Mount Doom with the Ring,but Gollum gets in the way and convinces Frodo that Sam wants to ring for himself.Meanwhile,Gandalf leads the World of Men against Saurons army.
4.0~vastly overdone and overrated s264445 Sign in Permalink This is a review of all three movies, because really, they are all the same movie. Each movie is about 4 hours long which totals up for about 12 hours, so basically this is a 12 hour long movie. When watching this I am amazed that people can stand to watch this that long. The movie was really well done up, had above average acting, and had some cool fight scene, but in all, it was 12 hours of a couple of midgets walking to a mountain to pitch a ring in a pit of lava. Now a storyline like that isn't bad, the idea of going to a journey for one task (Saving Private Ryan was that, that movie was great) but when it is 12 hours long, the movie goes from being great to be crap. When watching the first one I thought the movie was great, a small story line that was going somewhere and had amazing scenes and creativity that impressed me, I thought "this movie is great, simple story line but it is interesting." But the problem is that this movie didn't end, I had to watch the next two. When watching the second (Two Towers) and the third (Return of the King) I got to the point, really about an hour in the second one, on thinking if this movie is going anywhere at all. I am watching a group of people walk, fight, ponder over what just happen, then walk again. Like for example, a scene that is so vivid in my mind because it was the point that about made me go crazy, the two midgets (Frodo and his little buddy) are laying there and there is this group of some weird creatures arguing on if they should eat them or not, then a bunch of horsemen come and another battle breaks out, then Frodo gets kicked in the head (which by then I was hoping that he died and the movie really changed course, but it didn't) then we found out later he got away, he runs into a talking tree, then blah blah blah, etc. etc. etc., the movie just went on with a bunch of crap, I got sick of it. They eventually get rid of the ring, but after that, the movie wouldn't end, there is more fighting, very annoying. So in all, if you enjoy watching 12 hours of people walk, fight, walk, fight, dramatize over everything, then so be it, but I would stick to my movies that get to the point, say what needs to be said, then ends without a bunch of crap in the end. 4 out of 10 for the whole series.
10.0~ROTK Rules! AshAngelAk Sign in Permalink The heroic quest of frodo and the ring continues. Gollum plots even deeper to get his *precious* back. Pippin does something foolish (yet again) and ends up becoming the target of the enemy. Gandalf must bring him to the safest place left in Middle Earth, the city of Minas Tirith, but evil dwells there as well, denethor's mind is corrupted and his mind is overtaken. Faramir trys still to get his fathers love and attention. Rohan prepares for battle at minas tirith against the evergrowing armies of Mordor. Frodo abandones Sam and falls yet again into another one of Gollums schemes. Will Frodo complete his quest? Will Rohan and Gondor be able withhold the armies of Mordor long enough? Well You Will See In The Return Of The King... Ok everyone knows that Peter Jackson has made the best film in the world here! (though I must admit I am a little disappointed about the scouring of the shire) But anyways! It should be number one! So cmon people and vote because we want to show everyone that nothing can beat ROTK! Thank you so much to J.R.R. Tolkien, Peter Jackson, and the cast and crew of the Lord Of The Rings Series. They definately Deserve the number one spot from all the hard work and efforts they have put into these movies. If you haven't seen any of the movies in this wonderfully made trilogy then I absoloutly advise that you do, and also if you haven't read the books by Proffessor Tolkien then I absoloutly reccommend that too!
10.0~Why Did It Win Eleven Oscars? sportyrider Sign in Permalink LOTR have been the best movies I have ever seen. The books were great and could not be entirely duplicated on the big screen, but Peter Jackson did a wonderful job! If you haven't seen it, go today! Pretty soon the entire trilogy will be available on DVD and you will be able to watch it in the privacy of your own home. Note that it was the film that won the Oscars and not the actors. That says volumes in itself. Most of the actors were unknown prior to this movie, but they all did a wonderful job. The special effects and animations were terrific and Tolkien's story line is just great. I would suggest that you read the books even if you won't watch the movie. I read them a long time ago and was enthralled by them. You will see Middle Earth in an entirely new way. Also, read The Hobbit.
1.0~Only 200 minutes? marvint Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed this movie -- well about 45 minutes of it. Unless you are a die-hard fanatic for the LOTR books (and maybe even then) you'll want to watch this with one finger on the fast forward button. Some scenes were excellent, but not enough when diluted by so much "filler." The special effects may have been masterful, but they didn't make it a great movie. The movie simply takes itself far too seriously; how else could the director possibly justify being almost 3.5 hours long!?! Similarly to voters here -- this is rated as #3 in the top 250 of all time. That is *SO ASTOUNDINGLY OVERRATED* that I cannot understand it (this with 65,000+ votes). It probably belongs in the top 1000, perhaps about #800. [How has the studio managed to create 45k+ IMDB accounts to skew the voting?] The basic flaw of the entire trilogy is that it's based on a long-winded, violently racists set of books. Starting from that, you end up with.... well, you know. Truthfully, this is a 7/10 -- but it could have been a 7.5 if they'd actually done some editing down to ~1.5 hours.
10.0~Truly moving film ajv-imdb Sign in Permalink No movie should be allowed to manipulate you like this film does. It does it without guile and without effort. The time seems to fly - there are no dull moments. Without exception, including the little girl at the end, the acting is superb. It draws you in, and makes you part of the Fellowship. Andy Serkis' performance is unbelievable as Gollum. Gollum just "is" in any scene he was in, and you couldn't tell if he was real or CG during the transition at the beginning of the film. Truly awesome. I read the negative comments and wonder if these same people would think the Godfather too long, or the horse head scene unnecessarily gross, or if they think Rick Blaine and Ilsa should have got on the plane together at the end of Casablanca and why isn't it in color? These comments are by morons who need to hand in their cinema tickets now. I feel terribly sorry for those who don't have the imagination or wit to see the film and its predecessors for what they are: a masterwork of majestic proportions. You owe it to yourself to find a decent cinema, like our Gold Class Cinemas here in Australia, which have reclining armchairs and they bring booze and food to you, so that you can recline comfortably and enjoy the film as if you were at home.
8.0~Tolkien fans, this is what we feared shattenjager777 Sign in Permalink "The Return of the King" is certainly not the strongest of Tolkien's trilogy, "The Fellowship of the Ring" blows both of the others away, but it is, in the novels, a considerable step up from the slop of "The Two Towers." This film series is different--"The Return of the King" is the worst. There are two gigantic, absolutely unforgivable and completely and utterly wrong changes made from the novel that absolutely kill this film: 1. Frodo's madness ends when Golem takes the ring and then Golem falls into the fire, but the film forces Frodo to continue his madness and push Golem in. WRONG. 2. Samwise would NEVER leave Frodo, but the film has him head back down the mountain. WRONG. Not only are they differences from Tolkien, but these are changes that work against the story in which they fit and that is why they are so egregious. The production is mostly the same as the previous two in other aspects, with the exceptions that Ian McKellen's performance of Gandalf the White is annoying and nowhere near as good as Gandalf the Grey and that as he is given more to do, Sean Astin completely outshines the rest of the cast. It's also notable that this film has no appearances by Saruman, which cuts out the wonderful, charismatic performance that Christopher Lee has otherwise given--he was, in my opinion, the best casting choice of the entire series, with the only possible exception of Viggo Mortensen's perfect Aragorn. It's still a fantastic film, because Tolkien on a less-than-perfect day wrote a novel far beyond what most writers will even dream of being capable of writing, but this production's changes are absolutely unforgivable. The worst of the series, contrary to what the Oscars said. And how in the world can Howard Shore deserve two Oscars for one score that really wasn't all that impressive to begin with? And how can Peter Weir be denied AGAIN?
10.0~Best movie... period. christianbest Sign in Permalink I saw this and my perspective on cinema has changed. This is by far the most respectful and greatly done movie. Number 1 of all time, all the way. I remember when it all began, and seeing this conclusion it has been one heck of a ride.
10.0~A perfect ending to a perfect trilogy madstevie01 Sign in Permalink ****Spoilers**** When I discovered there was going to be a Lord of the Rings trilogy,I was absolutely delighted.The Lord of the Rings has always been one of my favourite stories since I was a kid.There was always a chance of failure but it has never been a doubt in my mind.The Lord of the Rings trilogy is up there with The Godfather trilogy,Star Wars series,The Shawshank Redemption,Schindlers List and the other great movies of all time. It began with 'Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring'.This movie mostly deals with getting to know the characters such as Frodo,Sam,Gandalf,Aragorn etc.It also deals with the finding of the ring.T 'Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers' is where the battle for Middle-Earth begins.It starts with the battle for Helms Deep where the people of Rohan are under attack from 10,000 uruk-hai.Meanwhile,Frodo and Sam get acquainted with the creature Gollum.This is when I realized that this was going to be a fantastic trilogy. There was great anticipation for the release of The Return of the King.This is where Aragorn must decide whether to become King of Gondor.Frodo and Sam are approaching a dangerous path as they approach Mount Doom. The film begins where the last movie left off.Members of the fellowship meet at Isengaard where the Ents have destroyed.Saruman lost his power.However when they return to Edoras,Pippins curiosity gets the better of him and he sees that Sauron is planning to attack the city of Minas Tirith.Gandalf rides to Minas Tirith to warn them. As Gondors prepares for war,Frodo and Sam pass the city of Minas Morgul - The home of the Witch King (the lord of the Nazgul).This is where Saurons army begins its attack.Gollum then leads them up the stairs of Cirith Ungol and then Shelobs tunnel. The Battle of the Pelannor Fields is the greatest battle scene of all time. There is so many great aspects of the battle.The enemies included Orcs,Men of Haradrim on their massive mumakils/oliphants,Mercenaries from the coast on the black ships,The Witch King and the other 8 Nazgul,Trolls. The good guys included the Riders of Rohan,The Soldiers of Gondor and the Dead Army. But it is not just the battle scenes that are great in this movie.The whole relationship between Frodo and Sam is what the film is all about.It is a very emotional movie and is very sad. This movie is absolutely amazing. Peter Jackson,who was'nt the most popular choice for director of this film, has created a masterpiece.This movie fully deserved its 11 Oscars.This is nearly perfect. I would recommend this film to everyone. My rating is 9 out of 10.
10.0~Oh, yeah thesnowleopard Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson wasn't lying--this really is one big movie cut into three parts, rather than three different movies. If you liked the first two movies, you will like this one. If you didn't like the first two movies, go see something else. This one won't bother to bring you up to speed. It's got lots of other things on its mind. Like other fans of the books, I was disappointed to see some of the quieter grace notes get cut. RotK is a huge book, even leaving out the appendices, so that didn't surprise me much. However, I was very pleased to see some of Tolkien's telling get shown. Those mummakîl are stunning, for example. Even if Jackson seems to be having a bit of fun at George Lucas' expense in that case, who cares? It works. And the Ride of Rohirrim is really well done. I was more than a bit worried about what they'd do with that piece. I thought the changes worked in the context of Jackson's version of the trilogy--they make sense as he's been telling the story so far and they shake up the plot just enough that even someone who knows the book by heart would be wondering what's next. But fear not, the movie is faithful to the end of the books.
10.0~Superb Conclusion. steve-collis Sign in Permalink The only complaint I can think if is why wasn't it longer. Superbly told story with an excellent cast who clearly wanted to make this something special. If you enjoyed the other 2 films and wondered if they could finish on a high then you'll not be disappointed. My wife's comment was that it can't have been over 3 hours long because it didn't feel like it. Also managed to keep an 8 year old quiet which deserves an oscar in itself. If Peter Jackson doesn't get best picture this time then it's a joke. This film should sweep the board.
8.0~great visuals BUT... pearljammer79 Sign in Permalink Let me start of by saying that i've been reading the books every year for the past 6 years. That being said, i'm a huge fan of the books. If you're going to see this finale in hopes of great artistic value and stunning visuals...you won't be disapointed. Actually, you will adore this film if that's what you seek. But if you're looking for accurate storytelling, you might be let down like i was. And i understand that the transition from book to script is a daunting task - especially with these books, so i knew that some editing was unavoidable. So here's my list of critisism: 1) The beginning. What were they thinking? Instead of wasting those first ten minutes with that scene, they could have correctly made the scene where Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff and casts him out of the order. Instead they COMPLETELY disregards Saruman in this movie and Gandalf simply states "he has no power"...not exactly what i was hoping. 2) Shelob's scene. Instead of staying true to the books, Peter Jackson decides to reinvent the relationship between Frodo and Sam, and creates a scene where Frodo decides (with the counsel of Gollum) that he doesn't need Sam anymore...so he leaves just long enough to save Frodo from Shelob at the last minute. Those are my major grievances. There's more, however i'm sure that it will be explained when the extended version comes out. Like i mentioned earlier, the visuals are AMAZING. Minas Tirith was better than i would have imagined, the Paths of the Dead scene was probably one of my favorites, The beacon fires were suprisingly touching. And there's more...so go see this film...it's well worth it in the end.
9.0~Mixed Emotions mcschnoor Sign in Permalink Just look at the multitudes of fan sites on the web and you'll see that this movie series, culminating with Return of the King, has completely shaken the way we view movies, the movie-going experience, the production experience, among other things. It is my belief that ROTK finally finishes just what Fellowship set out to do: Take the ring and destroy it... but it isn't that simple, and Tolkien himself knew that his book was well-nigh impossible to film. That said, given the constraints that had to be placed upon it, ROTK succeeds amazingly, presenting us with the rich, deep, and subtle plot complexities that have endeared the books to so many readers. True, the longing glances between Sam and Frodo have not escaped the gaze of postmodern critics who wish to read more into the themes of friendship than Tolkien intended, but the movie remains unspoiled, never once winking towards the audience and breaking the realism. While not perfect, this movie certainly sets the bar higher for all that will follow.
10.0~okey ahmetfuat87 Sign in Permalink Ted was a geek in high school, who was going to go to the prom with one of the most popular girls in school, Mary. The prom date never happened, because Ted had a very unusual accident. Thirteen years later he realizes he is still in love with Mary, so he hires a private investigator to track her down. That investigator discovers he too may be in love with Mary, so he gives Ted some false information to keep him away from her. But soon Ted finds himself back into Marys life, as we watch one funny scene after another.Ted and Mary were high school sweet hearts who haunt seen each other since their senior prom. Thirteen years later Ted hires Pat, a private eye, to find his long lost love. Pat finds Mary and himself becomes infatuated. Wackiness ensues.Having never fully recovered from a prom date that became a total disaster, a man finally gets a chance to reunite with his old prom date, only to run up against other suitors including the sleazy detective he hired to find her.
4.0~overwrought does not equal epic vincent-27 Sign in Permalink I just saw this movie and I must say that I have mixed reactions to it. While there were moments that I was on the edge of my seat, including powerful charge of the Rohirim (as chill inducing as it was is in the books) and the precarious hobbits dangling high above the Morgul Vale, for the most part I was quite annoyed by either the overwrought, drawn out facial expressions of the actors or the unnecessary changes to the plot. Unlike other die hard fans of the book, I did not miss the Scouring of the Shire scene, which I always felt was unecessary in the books, and certainly didn't need to be on the screen (which would have only added to the multiple endings, all of which, I might add, are in the books). Also, the change with the whole Gollum/Sam framing thing makes Frodo look stupid and Sam a blubbering baby, which the books definitely do not portray. Frodo keeps Gollum with them because he knows that Gollum knows the way better than they do and would never let Sauron get the ring. He shrewdly uses Gollums lust for the ring and desire to keep it for himself as well has his trust in Sam to protect him from Gollum. He also shares Gandalf's wisdom in being able to see Gollums fate woven into the fate of the ring, therefore woven with his as well. On top of this is his honest desire to attempt to reform Gollum and save him from his misery. This is a key point in the book and yet Jackson somehow managed to mangle it into some simplistic Gollum brainwashing trick. And yet I now understand these plot changes, because they start with Jackson saying "well, we can't have that scene what if this character did this instead?" and then all of a sudden you need to change some other bit, to make that change make sense, and then you need to change another bit ... etc until pretty soon the character's motivations are complelely different. Note to Jackson: don't mess with a masterpiece, Tolkien had a few thousand more IQ points and a whole lot more time to perfect his story, don't go astray because you think a particular shot would be "cool". Once you start unravelling such a intricate ball of yarn, it's hard to knit the thing all back together again (err, something like that, you get the idea). Now having said that, the movie could have been much worse, which is something all the naysayers have to remember, a hollywoodised version of this movie would have been The Matrix or some such drivel. Luckily for Jackson though, he had such solid material to go on, and a litle skill, that it would have taken some serious incompetence to completely botch it. At times in the movie I am reminded that Jackson is a relatively inexperienced director, having directed mostly low budget B-movies (Dead Alive anyone?) and so I would give him an A for effort, but what would have happened if he would have teamed up with a more seasoned director to add some weight to many scenes which obviously lacked it (that final shot of Frodo waking up in the bed was downright painful). Please no more slow motion facial expressions, we get the idea, they're sad/angry/happy, you don't have to "light it up in neon" as one critic said. A fine effort, and it will gross billions, but far from the masterpiece people claim it to be.
10.0~Now THAT'S the way to make a Trilogy! kondor69 Sign in Permalink Was that movie 3.5 hours? I didn't even notice. Peter Jackson not only successfully brought the Rings Trilogy to the screen, he put together three movies in such a way that all future directors should take note. King offered the complete development of all the LOTR characters, without compromising the integrity of the books, and without losing the audience in the process. Middle Earth was entrusted to Mr. Jackson and he delivered perfectly! The placement of comic relief was PERFECT. And he presented all the loyalty, action, drama and romance, while still retaining the underlying dark and insidious spirit that prevailed in all three movies. Three Cheers for the Three Ring Movies. The greatest trilogy of movies ever presented. Bar none. This, even more so than the first two, is Oscar worthy material all around.
1.0~couldn't be worse donald-braman Sign in Permalink I feel like I'm on another planet when I hear people talk about this movie. It is probably the worst movie that I have ever seen. Its only rivals are the two previous LOR movies. Was there some weird subliminal suggestion that I'm immune to? Were they serving some drugged cool-aid that I missed?
9.0~Even better than expected. Too bad it's over... EddyOne Sign in Permalink I'm not going to tell you about the story. I'm not going to tell you about the special f/x either. I'm just telling you, that Peter Jackson did it. He did an almos perfect trilogy, that can easily be compared with the great ones, like "Indiana Jones", "Star Wars" or "The Godfather" (although the third one kinda sucked, but well...). The Return of the King is not only the best part of the trilogy, no, it also proves, how much a trilogy can become a legend or die painfully, with the last part. The Matrix Revolutions was not a bad movie, but it still was a disapointment. The Return of the Kings is quite the opposite. It makes the whole trilogy "shine", because everything is well balanced. All the characters have their part. The action is amazing. The ending, and thats very important, is long! Not too long, but long enough to satisfy you. It's not like: The ring is destroyed. Great. Thanks. Good Bye! No, it's perfectly balanced, without getting to annoying and boring. The only bad thing about the final chapter is, that now it's over. If you liked the first two movies, you will love this one. This is definitely movie history! Well done P.J. And now make that damn Hobbit movie! 9/10 (not the ten, because that's what the extended will get)
5.0~ONCE THE RING DISAPPEARS, YOU SHOULD TOO! theeviltritone Sign in Permalink This movie was a decent piece of entertainment for the most part, right up until the ring gets destroyed... then we have to sit through seemingly endless series of "goodbye" vignettes. the most offensive of these is the scene on the dock where everyone is looking at one another for 10 friggin minutes. to people who go see this movie: ONCE THE RING DISAPPEARS, YOU SHOULD TOO! -- you can leave after the ring sinks into the lava, 'cause there's not much worth watching after that. 6/10 'cause the ending made me really cranky!
10.0~Fantasy at It's Best wafstet Sign in Permalink When I got out of college, books of fantasy were what my friends and I were fascinated with. The number one book was JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit. We read and discussed this book as well as the Trilogy over coffee and tea, arguing and challenging one another about the truth of the story. Fast forward 30 years and word came out that a movie, or actually a trilogy of movies about the books would be coming out. Excitement increased as the time for the first movie to be unveiled. My husband could hardly wait for this, he was such a Tolkien fan, he named his dog, Frodo. Would the movie do justice to the book? Would it stay true to the story? In my opinion, it not only did both, but enhanced my vision of how the story should be told. The characters were more real, the scenery incredibly vivid. The only problem I had with the movies was how strong the images of the nasty creatures were. I wanted to go back to the cozy hobbit holes in the Shire. While my husband enjoyed all three movies, I found I liked the first one better than the second. But when the third one came out, I was in tears at the end. The emotions I felt surprised me. Peter Jackson accomplished something everyone said could never happen.. translating Tolkien's world of Middle Earth on to film. What was a dream world became reality.
8.0~Not Quite Perfect shiftyeyeddog Sign in Permalink Do ya like 3-hour battle scenes? You'll love this flick. No, it's not really one battle, but it sure seems that way. Massive battle scene, ten minutes of landscape shots and dialogue. Massive battle scene, ten minutes of landscape shots and dialogue. Repeat. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just think that is what keeps it from being the perfect film that a lot of people are claiming it to be. I know I may get annihilated for actually saying anything less than praise about the Rings trilogy, but I do have a few observations in the negative column: * These films have more sweeping"ooh, look how pretty" landscape shots than a Travel Channel documentary. A good half-hour could be trimmed from each movie right there. * Speaking of trimming, Return of the King takes about half an hour to end... way too much epilogue. And this is after they apparently cut another whole sequence with Saruman at the shire. * More slo-mo than John Woo - which is saying a lot * Why is it orcs and other baddies will fall with one tap of the sword, but the films major characters can run through entire armies without getting the slightest injury? * There's an awful lot of killing of innocent animals here. Those oliphaunts and such are just enslaved! * A lot of people criticize the newer Star Wars films for being nothing but a collection of digital effects. Return of the King is just as guilty as any, with a lot of obvious blue/green screen scenes, and whole battles composed of CGI. I have no problem with that, just want the critics to realize their precious LOTR is just as guilty. * Suddenly raising up an army of the dead, with thousands of soldiers who can't be killed, is a total cop-out. You've suddenly negated all the fighting and deaths the mortals have done. Why didn't someone mention summoning these armies back in the first film!? * The Gollum/Frodo ending was a bit anti-climactic, in my humble opinion. Okay that's enough. Don't get me wrong, I really do like these films, and Return of the King was a good finale. The battles were cool, the acting great across the board, the effects, the music, etc for the most part amazing. As a whole it works pretty well. But I don't think there is a best film in the series. None of them work without the others. But again, that's not a bad thing. I didn't really intend for this review to sound negative. I liked it...really. But every other review in the world is all praise for all the great things about it, so I thought I'd bring up a couple from the "con" side.
3.0~Shocked by disappointment Rosabel Sign in Permalink I loved the first two LOTR films, and was keyed up almost beyond endurance to see ROTK the first week it opened. When the film was over, I was stunned by the depth of disappointment I was feeling. In fact, I went back and watched the movie again a few days later; I could not believe that it really had been as bad as I'd experienced. The fault must have been mine, I thought; I'd been too wound up to really take it in. With a cooler head, I'd be able to enjoy it and the magic would work again, as it had with the previous two movies. Alas, no. The movie was just as bad as I'd thought, and it somehow managed to posthumously poison my pleasure in the other two movies as well. I've never been able to enjoy any of them since. I came to really hate Peter Jackson, especially after watching all the "making of" interviews on the dvds. I believe he is an undisciplined, self-indulgent egomaniac, and these characteristics progressively took over as the film series continued. Fellowship of the Ring was the best of the lot, and I feel it's because it was a gamble. Now that the series is over, people forget that before FOTR premiered, there was no guarantee that the film would be a success. LOTR was a notoriously difficult book to adapt, and many worried that it couldn't be done. In that atmosphere, Jackson and his co-writers were at their most deferential to the original Tolkien text, and almost humble in their approach to such a daunting task. After FOTR was a big success, they became more confident in their own skills, and felt bold enough to try a little rewriting for The Two Towers, even while assuring fans that it was only a little strategic reorganizing, and the original story would be preserved in ROTK. By that point, however, Jackson was so deluded by the sycophantic flattery that surrounded him on all sides, he was convinced that the fans would adoringly accept anything he filmed, simply because it was the product of such a genius. ROTK could not contain both Tolkien's story and Jackson's ego, and guess which won in the end? The story flopped all over the place, with Saruman's storyline simply chopped off and left unresolved, while Jackson wasted time indulging in invented scenes back in Rohan, when the story should have moved decisively to Gondor. That, however, was not the part of the story that interested him, so we had to have more loving photography of carved dark wood beams and animal-skin rugs, plus a vastly overdrawn love connection between Eowyn and Aragorn. When Jackson finally had to tear himself away from this romantic Viking paradise and turn to Gondor, he revenged himself on the story by turning Gondor into a sterile, dead cement city, full of cowards and idiots. Worst of all, I felt that by ROTK Jackson was even getting sloppy on what had been a trademark of the films until then - set design and scale. For a scene where Gandalf and Pippin are on a balcony, looking towards Minas Morgul, he had both actors on the same set, with Pippin merely kneeling at the balcony, while Gandalf towered over him. However, the brain can quite clearly calculate that the scale of the balcony in relation to the bodies of both characters is wrong - in FOTR, Jackson would have built a larger-scale model of the balcony for Pippin, to keep up the illusion that he was a smaller figure in a setting made for people of Gandalf's size. This time, he couldn't be bothered, as if he felt that he'd paid his dues being accurate in the first two movies, and now he should be free to play around and have fun. That was amply demonstrated with the stupid green goblins, the endless battle scenes, the noise, the shaking camera, and the labored "humour" in every Gimli scene. What annoyed me the most, however, was that Jackson seemed to have no grasp of what Tolkien thought was important. In the movie, only the "stars" are able to act (and yes, that includes the Hobbits), whereas Tolkien showed that nobility, courage and heroism are EVERYONE's business. In the books, the individual soldiers of Gondor had personalities, felt connected to the greater cause, and debated how best they could do their duty. In Jackson's movies, Aragorn and Gandalf do all the fighting, while crowds of women blubber helplessly and soldiers blunder about uselessly. This is why his removal of the Scouring of the Shire was both execrable and inevitable. Jackson can't recognize any drama in ordinary people in ordinary settings facing crisis and either failing or rising to the occasion - to him, the Shire is just dumb peasants who were too stupid not to leave home for adventure, and there's nothing more to be expected of them. Tolkien's whole theme was that adventure and crisis are NOT the sole property of noble heroes, but that it can touch anyone, and how we react when it does is as important as Aragorn's struggle with Sauron or Denethor's descent into madness.
10.0~wow...don't know how to feel groliver Sign in Permalink I knew going into the movie that many people, myself included, would leave feeling very torn. On the one hand, you've just left one of the most masterful films in history (you have to be pretty pumped about what you've seen for the past 3:20), and on the other you know that what started exactly two years ago and has been the "can't believe I have to wait a year for another fix" time marker of most moviegoers is OVER! Having said all that... WOW, what a satisfying movie experience. Other than the crappy sound problems in my theater, I can't think of one thing I'd change. I'm sure I'll rethink that once I see the extended DVDs next year! Don't care about any of the shifting or omissions PJ had to do...all of it worked!
10.0~A Request to the People of the World Ziggo Sign in Permalink Hello everyone, Well ROTK was astounding (of course). However I am amazed at the number of comments, reviews, and statements about the film from people who have not read the books before hand. Listen up people, You cannot fully appreciate this film if you have not read the books! Its impossible! So please, don't go stand here and go on about how long it was, and how it made to many strong statements about christanity, and other plot complexities that you cannot possibly understand. If you are planning on seeing these movies, I emplore you to read the books before hand. It gives you an appreaction for the art that Peter Jackson has created, and an understanding of the motavation of the characters. Honestly, if everyone who has given this movie a poor review had read the books, they'd be on the ground praising Jackson as the cinematic visionary that he is.
10.0~Best LOTR movie yet thierryserra-05310 Sign in Permalink I may not be completely impatial on my review of this movie, because I'm such a fan of the books, the author and medieval fantasy all together. Yet, if you're like me, this won't disapoint. The trilogy only gets better as it advances, and the final movie has the best war scenes yet, along with incresingly complex and evolving charactrs and the drama that keeps escalting. Without a dull moment you'll enjoy hours of "on the edge of your seat" advanture. If you can watch it on the extended DVD version, do it. It has 50' of additional movie. Not to be missed.
10.0~a fantastic trilogy to be experienced. casselhag Sign in Permalink I just came home from the midnight-premiere of "The Return of the King" and I was absolutley stunned by the craftmanship led by Peter Jackson in this movie. This is my generation's "Star Wars", but ten times the better movie/trilogy. The acting is just superb, the sfx are better than the two previous films, and there are scenes that moved me to tears, over and over again. More flesh is added to all the characters, especially Gollum, who we are given the background to. I can't wait until I can see this on DVD and let myself get brought to tears, over and over again. I can only wait until the time comes when my son comes to sit in my lap and asking me what it was like to be "there". Experiencing the premiere and all that. "Well son... it was not bad at all."
9.0~Best of the three Hairy_Lime Sign in Permalink SPOILERS POSSIBLE Now that the whole thing is before us, we can see what an incredible achievement the Lord of the Rings was. To have been able to maintain such a consistent level of excitement and interest throughout ten hours is a spectacular feat. They ought to give Jackson the last two Oscars retroactively. From the opening sequence involving Smeagol's first taking of the ring to the last of the four or five endings (no doubt making up for the fact that the first two movies really didn't have ANY) Jackson was in complete control - there was not a second where the story lagged or interest waned. I have often felt that I remember and love movies more for the scattered images that stay imprinted on my brain. This movie gave me several: First, the scene of Rohan's massed cavalry charge into the orcs. Cavalry charges must have been like this; the weight and feel of horses plowing through foot soldier has never been captured in movies like this. It took my breath away. Second, the set design of Minas Tirith was remarkable, all the way up to the jutting rock, like the prow of a ship. The first time we see the city emerging over the mountains takes the breath away. Third, Shelob was the best giant spider in the history of movies - o.k., perhaps the competition is a trifle weak, but still.... Fourth, Gollum remains the pinnacle of CGI art; his ultimate scene, wrestling madly with an invisible Frodo at the brink of the fire of Mount Doom, and the look of triumph on his face as he falls into the fire with the ring is perfect. I understand that Sarkis cannot get an Oscar for his performance, but it is perfect throughout. And the penultimate ending, when Frodo sailed away, actually nearly brought a tear to my eye despite the fact that I had read the books a couple times, and knew not only the end but the line he was going to deliver. Lord of the Rings usually does not draw mention of the acting, of course, but the acting here is good throughout. Ian MacKellan is a great actor; the last movie where he was not good... come to think of it, he's never not been good. Of the Hobbits, Sean Astin's performance was the strongest. The remainder of the actors inhabit their roles with skill. Quibbles? Sure, the dismissal of Sauruman with a perfunctory "He's harmless" blew away what had been a prominent story arc of the first two movies. The absence of the scouring of the Shire was missed, but only a little; considering the prominence that Tolkein gave it, the movie played surprisingly well without it. I missed the Faramir/Eowyn romance, but only in the few seconds when they glanced at each other in the coronation scene. This entire arc of a story, from the retelling of the first great war against Sauron to the return of Sam to hearth and home, is one of the spectacular achievements of cinema. And three great movies, to boot.
10.0~An Altering kennybarney Sign in Permalink Wow! What can we say about this film. It is one of the best of all-time, that is no question. It has altered my perceptions in a lot of ways. I had not read the books, so I felt that I could safely watch the film without nit-picking at all the details the movies had left out. I found some people doing that, but even those people said it was still pretty true to the story. Knowing that and also getting the thrill of experiencing the Lord of the Rings for the first time was unbelievable. I had watched The Fellowship of the Ring for the first time on video and I was immediatley hooked. When Two Towers came out, I had to see it the first day out (as well as REturn of the King). I also did some research on Tolkien after that and found some reasons of why he wrote it as well. Knowing that he wrote it because he wanted to and not just to make a point was astounding to me! He just loved to create characters, drama, and just plain good storyline. Noone does that anymore! Yet, I was truly inspired. I have never been so inspired by a movie. It literally took my breath away! I believe we are all living in the Lord of the Rings. Whatever your adventure is, wherever your heart is at, whatever challenges you face, we can all learn from Lord of the Rings. "There is always hope."
10.0~I could talk about this all day s-azablocka Sign in Permalink Such a good movie. Sir Peter Jackson have picked out the best artists, workers and actors on this planet. I found some of my favorite actors in here as well, so I really exited to watch Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom perform. Alan Lee and John Howe, beautiful conceptual designs. I think that the battle sequences were epic and that when Gollum fell into Mount Doom, I was shocked. It is my favorite movie now. Ever since I watched this movie I wanted to go into Middle Earth, and I promise you will too. Viggo Mortensen is a terrific actor, and I am happy that they chose him. Best movie ever created!
10.0~Best movie ever!! Give it a 10 people! JayC_035 Sign in Permalink Wow this movie is so good on so many levels... best epic, best fantasy, BEST EVER! A film that truly keeps you at the edge of you seat and interested the ENTIRE TIME! I can't wait for the extended version:)!... This film is for anyone and everyone! Watch it and give it a 10! :) I Love THIS MOVIE:-) Captivating, entertaining, beautiful, a masterpiece. Peter Jackson you really did it. All the years in New Zeland paid off ending the best trilogy over with the best film ever. Great acting job, dramatic, action packed, amazing movie are all good descriptions for this movie. A MUST SEE. Anybody who likes good movies should see this one today! And once is not enough
8.0~I left the cinema not thinking about the film.. nick-613 Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I left the cinema not thinking about the film, but about where to catch my bus. Ending was a real drag. Faults: No Witchking v Gandalf! No Gandalf magic (except the 'torch') No Saruman. Witchking dies after 2 minutes in battle, in highly unlikely & predictable circumstances. Battle seemed to be edited so that it swung from near defeat to near victory in 1 minute. Riders seemed to kill 200k orcs? no-way. Then the dead convieniently cleaned up the rest, all of it out of sight. Frodo wears same facial expression for 203mins. Arwen.
10.0~Good but flawed Essex_Rider Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** Having now seen The return of the King, and having been an avid reader of `all' of Tolkiens work for over thirty years, I can at last cast a comment on it. If I view it as a work 'based' on The Lord of the Rings, then it has merit, however, Peter Jackson has changed much of the subtle sub texts and sub plots to convert it to a visual narrative and in doing so has lost much of the depth of the work. There are also glaring gaps throughout the film that I suspect will be nicely filled when the Extended Edition DVD is released late next year. The beginning puzzled me; surely the story of the finding of the ring of power should have been shown during Gandalfs explanation of the ring to Frodo, not as a prelude to the final part of the trilogy. Gandalf had wondered at the knowledge possessed by Denethor and discovered that he used the Palatir as Denethor burned on the pyre, but instead we were treated to the scene whereby a madman leaps in flames to his death. We have the unrequited love between Eowyn and Aragorn seemingly resolved with no explanation. We had the ludicrous situation of Faramir, Merry and Eowyn at deaths door only to see them apparently healed when Aragorn is crowned king. Of course; those among us here who have read the literature know these things happened in the Houses of Healing, where incidentally it became rumoured through the city that the king had returned and whereby Eowyn found Faramir. If anyone here has read the appendices to the book, they would also know that Arwen does in fact eventually go to Valinor and as for Enduril (Flame of the West), that was forged before they left Rivendell and once again played a major part in the actual mythology. Peter Jackson also extends his licence to changing the relationship between Sam and Frodo. In fact the pair drew closer together the deeper into danger they marched. Sam was in Shelobs Lair with Frodo for good reason, however, the sequence is very well filmed. I was also disappointed not to see Sauraman as he played a vital role in finishing the tale. But to my mind the worst piece of fiddling was with the end. Tolkien was very careful with 'The Scouring of the Shire' because he wanted to show the reader that your own home could become a residence for evil if we allow it. He learned that after seeing how the civil authorities sided with the Nazi's on the Channel Islands occupation in WWII. Like I said at the beginning, the film has merit, the battle scenes are wonderful as is the depiction of Sauron and I was greatly impressed by the Tower of Minas Morgul. I would give this a 3.5 star rating, not because of any cinematography or acting but because of the dreadful character changes.
10.0~One of the bets ever jlcmsu Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies ever in my opinion. I can't help but be drawn into this movie every time I watch it. The Lord Of The Rings movies have been some of the best I have seen because they draw you in and make what else is going on vanish into thin air. This movie tops the others because it pulls everything together. You see if Frodo's journey is a success, if Aragorn becomes who is needs to be, and all the other intricate story lines. Everything in these movies are just so cool the outfits, weapons, battles, characters, etc. everything is top notch. I love watching this movie and can't wait to see the EE later this year. It was great seeing it in the Theaters and even better on DVD as now I get to see it anytime I want to so for this ring fan its great.
10.0~The best movie lucasnt-43694 Sign in Permalink Um dos melhores filmes já produzido, fechou a trilogia do senhor dos anéis com chave de ouro.
10.0~Amazing sofdelta Sign in Permalink Best of the Best of the Best!!! I knew the trilogy would be great, but part 3 of the LOTR Trilogy, Return of the King, was absolutely the best movie I have ever seen. It features the best music (artists like Howard Shore and Enya), great graphics (Gollum) and the entire scenery is beautiful. I haven't seen a movie yet that can even slightly compete with this one.
10.0~Venting my adoration. rachel-titley Sign in Permalink I absolutely adored this film. It was so poignant and touching, even where it seemed too huge for anything as small, for instance in huge battle scenes you got shots of true friendship between the Fellowship or the sight of just one man or elf meeting their deaths brought it all down to a realistic human scale. The knowledge that, even if these characters only exist on the screen, they are there dying for what they believe in and that is a very powerful message. This film for me is like Pirates of the Caribbean. That too brings back to me how small we are on the face of everything but that that doesn't matter. Even if compared to the planet we are tiny our feelings still count. Even if you are facing a fight between you and the world you will find someone who can help you and you can do what your heart tells you to. Because if you do what your heart tells you to you won't go wrong.
10.0~a fantastic ending damonazgul Sign in Permalink Saw Return of the king this morning between midnight and three thirty. It's wonderful. The story changes are logical and every element brilliant. The acting bar has been raised and met (especially for Sam who invokes tears on many occasions) and the action phenomenal. Enormous bodycount for man and beast (luckily this is a fantasy or the RSPCA would be up in arms!!) and a continuation of Gimli and Legolas' rivalry. Legolas has an overblown and a bit dodgy (CG wise) super stunt that no matter what gets enormous cheers from the audience for it's sheer coolness! Gollum has his best scenes in this film and they've even made him look more real! (A brief prologue on his transformation is wonderful). The ending for some (meaning just the epilogue) might be a bit long but it is certainly fitting for this 10 hour+ epic. Shelob is disgusting (in a good way) and Jackson is very much pushing the boundaries of his PG13 or 12A rating. To add even more brilliance to this masterpiece, the end credits are beautifully done.
10.0~simple but amazing Don-Snipe Sign in Permalink eying that this film starts where 'Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. 'Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of 'Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in 'Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time. After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need tone up on your 'Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film. I want see this movie again and again
10.0~This is what filmmaking is all about... John Doe 316 Sign in Permalink What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? I want to write a review about this masterpiece while it is still fresh in my mind, although I probably should let myself settle down and think about the movie more first. This is a fantastic climax to the greatest trilogy in the history of cinema. More so than any other movie, you can really feel that you are watching an epic, a part of cinema history, while sat in the cinema watching any "Lord Of The Rings" movie, "The Return Of The King" in particular. As all three movies began, I got goosebumps as the title appeared on the screen. It's a shame that this is probably the last time I will have such a unique feeling in the cinema. I don't really know where to begin. Perhaps I should start with what really makes this trilogy tick. No, it's not the epic battles, nor the special effects, although they are very important, and will be discussed later. No, the key element of "The Return Of The King" is the performances by the perfectly chosen cast. Every single actor has become their character. You don't think you're watching actors - you actually start to believe these are real people. "The Return Of The King" has a three-pronged narrative thread. The most important story is Frodo's ongoing journey to Mount Doom, where he must go to finally destroy the Ring. Big-time plaudits must go to all three of the actors involved in this part of the story. Elijah Wood has really matured as an actor as this series has progressed. He began as a wide-eyed idealist, but by this movie he is a mere shadow of his former self. It is heartbreaking to watch his body and mind slowly lose their battle with The Ring. But it is Sean Astin who really must be given praise, as when Frodo's spirit fails, it is Sam who steps in as the film's true hero, and really shows his worth. His performance is almost powerful enough to invoke tears. I think a Best Supporting Actor nomination should be a given. And, of course, Andy Serkis works hard to steal the show once again as Gollum. The evolution of the character is fantastic. In "The Two Towers", Gollum became a tragic, sympathetic character that a lot of the audience developed a soft spot for, but in this film, Peter Jackson works hard to make him as vile and hateable as possible as he shows his true backstabbing, devious nature. The second narrative strand focuses on the city of Gondor, the stronghold of the kingdom of Men. This is where we find Gandalf and Pippin for most of the film. Gandalf is simply amazing in this movie. Ian McKellan deserves all the praise he has gotten and more, and he certainly deserved that Supporting Actor Oscar he was nominated for (but didn't win!) a couple of years back. Gandalf just has such a presence in the film, whenever he walks into a scene he immediately becomes the focus. The highly satisfying moment where he takes control of the forces of Gondor (I won't tell you how - but I loved it!) leads to some awesome moments of Gandalf actually fighting - and what a fighter he is! He is thrusting and stabbing with his sword while simultaneously spinning his cane around like it was a kendo stick. And I'm sure I could see Ian McKellan's face during this fighting, so I don't even think it was a stuntman - well done Sir McKellan! As for Pippin, who was merely comic relief in the first film, Billy Boyd really shows off his acting skills (and his singing skills!) in a truly heartbreaking scene of him attending to Denethor at the dinner table while Faramir heads out to battle. Speaking of Faramir and Denethor, both David Wenham and John Noble do very well in their respective roles. While Wenham came across as slightly bland in the last film, he delivers a superior performance this time in a role which is admittedly smaller than it was in the book. Noble plays a fantastic Denethor, even though rather than slowly descending into madness like in the books, he is on full-on boo-hiss mode from the first moment you see him. The final main strand of the story is the titular "Return of The King". This is referring to Aragorn, and is actually a question. Will Aragorn rise to his destiny, and accept his role as king of Gondor? Well, we don't actually see much of Aragorn in the first hour of the film, as he stays camped in Rohan. After really letting loose in "The Two Towers", Viggo Mortensen seems almost subdued this time round, back to the apparent secondary status that he had in "The Fellowship Of The Ring". But as the movie progresses, this proves not to be the case. The arrival of his sword Anduril, forged from the shards of Narsuil, the blade that defeated Sauron before, seems to bring the character to life, and we can see the transformation from ranger to king. Once Aragorn is decked out in his armour and red cape, he gains even more presence than he had before. But despite this rise in status, the excellent Mortensen still manages to maintain the human side of the character. This human side focuses on the love triangle between Aragorn, Arwen and Eowyn. Miranda Otto really comes into her own as Eowyn this time round. She is a lively, determined heroine, and I think she would have been a much better choice for Aragorn than the comparitively bland Arwen. Speaking of Arwen, like in "The Two Towers", her appearances are the closest the film comes to boring. But on a more positive note, both Dominic Monaghan and Bernard Hill continue to impress as Merry and Theoden respectively, as both set out to aid Gondor in battle. Well that's the performances - so hat about those battles and special effects? The battles are quite simply out of this world. The Battle of Minas Tirith is amazing - blowing The Battle Of Helm's Deep out of the water. You can feel the desperation of the humans even more this time round as they face a far larger number of orcs. I'd say this battle is superior to "The Matrix Revolutions"' Zion invasion because you actually care about the characters. Unlike with The Matrix series, the characters that are only introduced in the second installment of "The Lord Of The Rings" are developed well enough so that you actually care whether they live or die. As previously mentioned, during this battle, Gandalf simply kicks ass. And the prime ass-kicker on the side of evil is The Witch-King Of Angmar - quite possibly the Darth Maul of the "Lord Of The Rings" series - you know what I mean, villain with a small part who will become a cult favourite. There was a simple formula to the creation of this character. Take a cool menace - The Ringwraiths. Take one of them out individually and develop him more as a character, and give him a cool costume to make him stand out from his Nazgul buddies. You have the Witch-King. Shame they cut out his encounter with Gandalf in the theatrical cut, but we'll see it in the Extended Version. The battle of Pelennor Fields isn't quite as good, perhaps because its so short. Or maybe because it intercuts with the Mount Doom finale, which is even more exciting. Having said that, the moment just before the fight begins, where Aragorn looks to his men and says "For Frodo" is pure cinema genius. As for the special-effects, the crowning achievement in that ares has to be Shelob. With Shelob, WETA has created a truly terrifying movie monster, in a tense, frightening scene. The film's main weakness is the editing. You wouldn't think that a film that is three and a half hours long could seem too short, but it does in places. The aformentioned final battle's shortness can probably be attributed to the lack of time. I was really looking forward to the encounter with The Mouth Of Sauron, which precedes this battle. However that was also cut. However, the unkindest cut is the removal of Saruman from the story. For the last two movies, the legendary Christopher Lee has provided as Saruman what Sauron couldn't: a tangible, physical threat who can act as a mastermind to various evil-doings. He has taken this small part and made it into one of the highlights of the series, giving himself a career renaissance in the process. So I feel it is poor reward to not give him a good sending-off. Same goes for Brad Dourif's brilliantly slimy Grima Wormtongue. Sure, their last stand will be on the DVD, but I don't think that's the same. Some people have criticised the ending for being slow, and yes perhaps it was, but that was necessary to really tie up all the loose ends to a satisfying degree. And the ending was much longer and slower paced in the book. I'm actually glad of the slow wind-down to the end, as I really didn't want this thing to finish. I'm so glad that this movie had a decent ending, without too much ambiguity and weirdness, like the lame cheat of a finale that The Matrix series provided. While the "Matrix" trilogy (or at least parts 2 and 3) failed to reach my high expectations, "The Lord Of The Rings" not only matched, but exceeded them. I can't stop ranting about how much I loved this movie. I'd have to say that the best part of the film for me is the sequence at Mount Doom. You can really feel that the end is nigh, and the performances are so touching, so intense, that by the end you are as emotionally spent as the heroes. In closing (at last!), I have to say that this comment relates to "The Lord Of The Rings" as a whole rather than just "The Return Of The King" which is arguably the best film in the trilogy (the 3rd film in the trilogy being the best - a feat even Star Wars and The Godfather couldn't pull off!). "The Lord Of The Rings" is what filmmaking is all about. Every movie has one scene that makes you realise that. In "The Fellowship Of The Ring" it is the race through the Mines Of Moria to the bridge of Khazak-Dum, and Gandalf's subsequent confrontation with The Balrog. In "The Two Towers" it's the flash of lightning revealing the huge army of Urak-Hai marching towards Helm's Deep. And here, in "The Return Of The King", it is the aformentioned Mount Doom finale. This trilogy has made December a month to look forward to for more than Christmas for the last three years, and things won't be the same without it. To Peter Jackson, and all the cast and crew of "The Lord Of The Rings" - Thank you.
10.0~What a finish! eowyn_29 Sign in Permalink I must say that watching ROTK took my breath away! Although I've watched the FOTR (wonderful!) and TTT (amazing for the extended version) innumerable times before plus read the books, ROTK went beyond any expectation that I had! I felt like I was taking part in everything that went on on-screen. The special effects were amazing, I found the acting intense and moving and the departures from the book felt genuine and really in-place. Quite a few tears were shed by yours truly, but as Gandalf says: "not all tears are an evil". Now I'm really looking forward to the extended ROTK. Thanks to P. J. and his crew of dedicated and talented people, you've created a classic!
10.0~Awesome!! mortysmc Sign in Permalink This film is one of the best i ever saw !! I will never get bored watching it and once a year or more i watch the whole trilogy same day.. After i saw the lord of the rings trilogy i knew i couldn't stop there so i searched for the director ("Peter Jackson" no i didn't knew he was the director of this film i was too young back there) so i watched every film he directed (well not all of them but the most of them) a good director giving people what they want and how to make a movie interesting... About the movie has a bit of everything inside it.. Action: there is so much action u won't get disappoint. Drama: there is also drama inside, if you haven't seen the movie yet just get prepared because this movie gonna touch your heart. Adventure: if you open an dictionary you will see next to the word adventure the "lord of the rings"... One incredible music gets stuck into your brain for the rest of you life its something impossible to forget.. i could say much more about this movie but i don't want to spoil it so if you haven't seen this movie yet i suggest it with no regrets!! My respect to the actors!!
10.0~Utterly Fantastic shawny11_2001 Sign in Permalink Sadly, this isn't the film I was expecting. The end was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too choopy and cut up to be very coherent. If Jackson and Crew had to cut stuff, it should've been earlier in the film and saved the last battle in total. Especially the Mouth of Sauron. Not seeing him was a major disappointment. Acting: The best female role of the entire series is Eowyn. There is no contest between her and the other female roles. Viggo does a spectacular job as Aragorn once again. The biggest surprise is Pippin. Besides having a great voice, he can act. Denethor was amazing. Faramir truely showed his quality. Etc etc etc... Music: By far the best music out of the entire series. Howard Shore is one helluva composer. Plot: Just like the book, minus a few things. The addition of Shelob to the film, instead of at the end of The Two Towers was great. Very haunting and freaky. (Stupid crowds always jumped...and screamed...and gasped...) Minus a few qualms with the battle at the Black Gate, this is great. Top notch. SFX: The best of the entire series. 'Nuff said. Directing: Peter Jackson, you are a god among insects. Overall: 9.8 out of 10. If the film had the Mouth of Sauron and an ending battle that didn't seem so chopped up, it would've been perfect.
10.0~A Rare Conclusion to an Amazing Epic joberfeld113 Sign in Permalink The Fellowship of the Ring was great. The Two Towers was better. Those two thoughts put a lot of pressure on Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Return of the King. So is this a rare third installment? The Ugly: For a third straight time. NOT A F**KING THING. GOT IT? The Bad: The Return of the King runs at least half an hour longer than the first two. That again depends on which version of the trilogy you are watching. My Rare The Great: Everything. Just look at the movie. Final Verdict: Saying The Return of the King does to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy what Return of the Jedi did to the original Star Wars trilogy is an understatement. Return of the King deserves to be called a winner of Best Picture the most thanks to how political the Academy Awards get.
5.0~Good, but certainly not best of the year anhedonia Sign in Permalink This was much better than I expected and definitely better than "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," which was an excruciatingly dull (not to mention, seemingly endless) film. I realize Tolkien's book wrapped up everything in the end, but, as a film, "The Return of the King" has way too many endings. But the action sequences are well done (although CGI is clearly evident in some battle scenes) and this time the film was engaging. But it certainly is not the best film of 2003, though I am sure the Academy will laud it with numerous Oscar nominations and many would feel the film deserves Best Picture simply for the scope of the trilogy. But, this year, there are far better films deserving Best Picture nominations: "American Splendor," "Blue Car," "The Station Agent," "Swimming Pool," "Lost in Translation" just to name a few.
10.0~THIS is what a movie experience should be homiegpoptart20 Sign in Permalink I JUST saw Return of the King...and have no real words that would suffice to do justice...Here's an idea...my favorite movie used to be American Beauty...now it's this one....if you've seen American Beauty...you'll understand how massive this movie has to be to replace American Beauty as a person's favorite movie!!! AHHHHHHH!!! I am still in total awe...even with the absence of Saruman (which will undoubtedly be in the Extended cut) and the fact that this one follows the books the least...it doesn't matter...as a great piece of literature translated into a different medium...it more than suffices...The ONE beef I had with this movie is that the small slow sentimental scenes were ALMOST too drawn out...but ALMOST, mind you.....all I have left to say is that it's #4 on imdb's top 250...you be the judge.
10.0~great film,quality all-round, you have got to see it!!! thumbs up!! killjoy32 Sign in Permalink an absolutely fabulous film, which brings a brilliant trilogy to a perfect conclusion. the actors/actresses in the film play their parts perfectly, the score is perfect as always, the scenery and detail in the film is second to none and the action is utterly amazing. if you don't go to see this film, you really must be mad. the only sad thing is that there is no 4th film. hats off to Peter Jackson and his crew, for making a masterpiece of cinema history!!!
10.0~Definitely, the Best Movie ever Made soccerstar1993 Sign in Permalink I have hated Lord of the Rings from an early age. I don't know why, but I never quite liked the idea of it. But sometime I was inspired to read the books by JRR Tolkien, and immediately recognized how wonderful the story was. It was brought to life in three movies I regret to say I never saw on the big screen, only in the comfort of a home DVD. The plot line, which carries through the previous two films, is still alive and more suspenseful than ever. You cannot describe it shortly. To shorten it, in a fantasy world "Middle-Earth" there was a magic ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron, filled with his own power and malice. It can't be used for anything good or pure, only evil and bad, and therefore must be destroyed before it falls back into the owner's hands. If it does, he will dominate and destroy Middle-Earth. The Fellowship of the Ring must destroy it. The acting was simply magical, these people played off each other tastefully. The sets, costumes--note Eowyn's outfits and the beauty in Arwen's jewelry--and scenery, nicely set against New Zealand all were magnificent against very real special effects that give new meaning to "bring the story to life". Finally, the crew and cast both did a wonderful job. I must also add, the music by Howard Shore really ties everything together. It brings drama, suspense, brightness, and warmth to a movie that is both pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable for anyone to watch.

10.0~Best Fantasy Movie of All Time!!!! alecx5494 Sign in Permalink The journey ends in this remarkable epic ending to an astounding trilogy. Peter Jackson has outdone himself as a visionary director. I am sure that the Lord of the Rings trilogy will go on in history as one of the best trilogies ever. Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), and Gollum (Andy Serkis) are making their way toward Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Unbeknownst to the hobbits, Gollum is planning on killing them with the help of a creature named Shelob and taking the One Ring for himself. Meanwhile, Sauron's forces are moving toward Minas Tirith, the towering city of Gondor, where the Denethor rules. Denethor is the only new, major character in this movie unless you've seen The Two Towers Extended Edition. He becomes insane during the movie because of Boromir's death ( which happened in the first Lord of the Rings film). Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) has to finally face his destiny of becoming King of Gondor. Gandalf gets lot more to do in this film because he is carrying Pippin with him to Minas Tirith. The situation is grave for Pippin because Sauron thinks he has the Ring. The siege on Minas Tirith is one of the most breathtaking battles I have ever seen. Legolas and Gimli are along for the ride and the final confrontation at the Black Gate is extremely emotional. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The performances are top notch, especially Liv Tyler's small but pivotal role in the film. Sean Astin deserves an Oscar nod at the very least for his role as Samwise Gamgee. The battle scenes are immense. Howard Shore's score for the film is absolutely amazing. Shelob is absolutely the most revolting and the most convincing spider ever put ont film. The special effects are spectacular and Legolas' stunt in the battle of Minas Tirith will have you cheering. Gimli has some of the best lines in the film, and Denethor gets his ass handed to him by Gandalf. The end of the movie where Sam and Frodo get to the Mountain of Fire to destroy the One Ring is a really intense scene, especially when Gollum goes for the Ring. Eowyn's battle with the Witch King proves that women can kick a dead man's ass. This film did what other final chapters of other trilogies could not and that was bringing the story to a fulfilling close. This is without a doubt the best movie of the year and the best fantasy movie ever. Out of a 10, I give this a very strong 10!
10.0~The journey and the destination are both well worth the investment of time TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews Sign in Permalink I haven't read anything by Tolkien. It is a great credit to these movies that you can watch all three without needing to have taken in the novels beforehand. This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish, and this moves rather smoothly, with great pacing. This is funny several times, and there is very little of the annoying(and still easily ignored) comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything you're seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable, in general, and the imaginative designs, and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark, this isn't actually depressing, in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense, well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography, and has a marvelous look. The acting doesn't let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this, and it might be too much for children. I recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre, and, really, everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10
10.0~God has sent us another great film!!! zonkey10 Sign in Permalink In the beginning there was Lord of the Rings (The Fellowship of the Ring), Then The Two Towers and now the Final and the greatest of them all Return of the King. I went to see this film on the day of the release not knowing what to expect, many people told me that it was just going to be a 3 and a half hour kill fest but I was amazingly surprised. Even though the film supported a huge action packed battle sequence with fantastic CGI it also had a hugely deep storyline. The main theme of this movie is friendship and fighting for survival that deeply touched me in several scenes. The characters came into their own and became more believable as the film progressed as you could see the relationship between Frodo and Sam tightened. Peter Jackson has truly done this Trilogy Justice and I can't wait for the 5 hour special edition coming out in November and the Hobbit due in the next 3 years.
10.0~Absolute favourite film of all time demoui Sign in Permalink Where to start and where to stop? In my opinion: Best book adaption of all time. Best fantasy film of all time. Best adventure film of all time. Best soundtrack of all time. One of the best all around cast performances of all time. Most Oscars (Academy Awards) of all time (without leading & supporting roles!) Best visuals at the time : 2003 Best direction of all time. Best costume design of all time. Together with LotR:FotR & LotR:TTT, basically they make one movie. One awesome viewing experience. Peter Jackson deservedly won the best director Oscar for this powerful and enchanting concluding episode to his massively ambitious adaptation of JRR Tolkien's trilogy Nothing less than the fate of humanity is at stake as the action begins. Middle-earth faces a final onslaught by Sauron's vast forces, which were seen in an earlier era as mythic stand-ins for the Nazis. Aragorn, the velvet-voiced king-to-be, organises a defence of civilisation's last stronghold, a gleaming citadel called Minas Tirith. The scale of the coming struggle can be gleaned by a series of beacons burning across the mountaintops in a gorgeous sequence that looks as big as all New Zealand, where this masterpiece was made.
10.0~Excellent... Nagrom_Nniuq Sign in Permalink ...but the ending of the book was completely skipped, along with several important parts of the book. Everything it did cover though was perfect. I really, really wish they had filmed the end of the book though so it could at least be in the DVD.
10.0~Forget the cheese, this is classic stuff ch750536 Sign in Permalink ROTK for me is the definitive ending to what is now a masterpiece. The delivery of the Tolkein works may not be liked by all (including tolkein), but the sheer elegance and thoughtfulness of the direction gives weight to the director making this film his own. Special effects are fantastic, but are used to support the story and at no point become the story, for this reason this film will always be watched (unlike others). Scenes like Gollums discussion with a pool make for great tension, as do the might and splendour of the visuals which after 3 movies have still not worn off on me. I don't care about the extra cheese, this movie has earnt it. I don't care about poetic licence, I think it improved it. I don't care that it was predictable... after all is that not what fantasies are for. Watch this film now and in 50 years time when we will still be impressed with the creative and indulging movie that is ROTK
5.0~Pretty to look at, but otherwise empty essmeier Sign in Permalink This film, like its two predecessors, is pretty to look at but emotionally sterile and ultimately a colossal bore. The fault isn't with director Peter Jackson; the problem lies with Tolkien's weak, silly, and juvenile material. The characters are poorly developed; you don't know who they are and therefore can't relate to them or the incomprehensible story. It doesn't help that their names all sound the same, and that once you've seen one male character with long hair, a beard, and a name that seems to consist only of vowels, you've seen them all. The characters, places, and battles all have a sameness to them that just leaves the viewer numb. After a while, I lost track of who was fighting whom, or where, or over what. The character of Gollum surpasses even Jar Jar Binks as cinema's all-time obnoxious character. Ultimately, it's big, loud, expensive fluff, masquerading as masterpiece. Two stars, assuming that you can manage to stay awake for the entire film, which is something I wasn't able to do during the first two installments of the trilogy.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King comment James2507 Sign in Permalink The greatest film ever made without a doubt. Peter Jackson has truly brought Tolkien's imaginative and magical world to life. In my personal opinion this third and final film is better than the first and second combined. If you have watched the extended edition DVDs you will see that a great amount of care and love has been put into these films and that what makes it such an incredible film, and in my opinion, if this was made in Hollywood I would only be rating it with a six right now. If any of you reading this comment have ever been to New Zealand, you will know that it has a spectacular landscape with its snow-capped mountains and green green grass. This is why it was a perfect location for this particular film. Sadly now though the epic saga has come to end, this film will always remain in my memory as one of the few great films made outside of Hollywood.
7.0~Glad that chapter of my life is over refachero-1 Sign in Permalink I know it's blasphemy because the Lord of the Rings is the greatest thing ever done, but I'm getting really tired of hearing that this is the greatest film ever made--cause it's not. I didn't see anything here that I didn't see in the first two movies. In fact, this one seemed overly sentimental. It took at least one hour into it before anything interesting happened. Truth be told, I only saw this out of obligation, again because the Lord of the Rings is the greatest thing ever done and only idiots don't like it. I find it hard to understand why they cut Christopher Lee's scenes, but left the almost never-ending denouement. After three hours, I honestly could care less about these characters, especially Sam having a sham marriage so that no one would think he had a thing for the "Frod". I just wanted to stand up, go home, and get on with my life. Also, did this movie need to be so long?!? In the end, Frodo writes the whole story of his adventures in a book so small, it would have taken 20 minutes to film--and that's the whole trilogy. I could only wish I had been watching *that* movie. They shouldn't be allowed to make movies so long until movie theater chair technology advances to where I can sit that long comfortably. Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie and you should probably see it, or read the book, because you need to care and know what happens to these characters. It's the most important thing that has ever happened. More important than the discovery of America, landing on the moon, whatever Paris Hilton is doing, and even Christmas. So see it, but only do it once. I can't imagine bringing myself to seeing this movie again. If it really were the greatest movie ever, I'm sure I would.
10.0~Wow! Just wow! bgood26 Sign in Permalink It's hard to review "LOTR: The Return of the King" without regards to the first two movies. Unlike most series, "King" was written and filmed at the same time as the other two, so no one had to struggle to come up with another script. LOTR was probably the riskiest venture ever taken in the history of movies, and it was worth every penny. "King" opens by showing us something that was not written into the LOTR novels: How an innocent Hobbit named Smeagol became possessed by the One Ring and became Gollum. From there, "King" picks up right where "The Two Towers" left off. Helm's Deep was successfully defended against Saruman's evil Uruk-Hai, but at tremendous cost to both Rohan and Elven warriors. Gollum, who has retaken Smeagol's body, leads Frodo and Sam into Mordor. And Merry and Pippen are getting stoned at Isengard, now taken over by the Ents. A three-and-a-half hour adventure follows. As Gandalf and Pippin race from Rohan to Gondor to warn the acting king of an impending attack by the Orcs and Uruk-Hai, Merry, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Merry join Eowyn, Theoden, and Rohan's troops in the final battle at Minas Tirith. If you thought the Battle of Helm's Deep was incredible, the Battle of Minas Tirith is even better. Then there was Shelob, the giant spider of Mordor moved from "The Two Towers" novel to "King" in the movies. In one of the scarier scenes in the series, Shelob spins Frodo into a mummifying web and waits to eat him. The three epiloges carry on for at least 20 minutes, but they cover three or four chapters in the novel, so in order to keep with Tolkien's stories, Peter Jackson had to keep all three. "LOTR: The Return of the King" is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
10.0~The greatest movie of all time. charlotteparcher Sign in Permalink This movie is an instant classic. Everything about it is perfect - the acting, the special effects, the plot, the music, and the complete and utter emotion it contains. It will be remembered for years to come and its story will be passed down for generations. I have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies, and this one will always be my favorite. This is the movie I will show to my children and tell them how great it is until they tire of hearing about it from me. I have grown up reading the books and this movie did not disappoint. Nothing else has come close and nothing ever will. I hope for everyone to enjoy this movie and cherish it as I have and will. Kudos, Peter Jackson. Continue to amaze and inspire us with your work.
10.0~Best Movie Ever? dmgreer Sign in Permalink I'm really not inclined to say "best movie ever" about any film, so maybe I should wait until I have more time to digest this movie. But throughout this film I was overcome by the sheer craftsmanship of it. From the production, to the acting, to the directing, to the cinematography, to the casting, to the location scouting - and in how many more categories is this film excellent? Many, many times, it could have gone sappy, been overdone, been pretentious, been slipshod, but through even the most difficult scenes the quality was kept at the highest level. And the tension is excellenlty held and drawn out. Not having read the third book, I was amazed at how many truly tense and fearful moments there were in the movie, my teeth even started chattering a few times. But then, I've done some acting myself, and when I go to a movie, I strive to keep myself as far as possible from a cynical state of mind, and I focus on letting the actors on the screen affect me how they will. Speaking of that, I cried many times during this film, and would have cried more had I been alone. If not the best movie of all time, ROTK should at least win the Best Picture award, because that one goes the the producers, and the producers of LOTR deserve such an award for having the guts and the vision to do the whole thing in one shot, and to do it up right.
9.0~One of the Few Films From This Decade That Will Be Remembered. JohnWelles Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" (2003) is a true epic, a film that Tolkien himself would have been proud of. As the three film quest comes to a brilliant and stupendous close, it isn't hard to imagine that these three movies, that have given us the equivalent of the "Star Wars" trilogy for the twenty-first century, will be remembered in thirty years time, just like "Star Wars" is. It is intriguing to compare both trilogy's, as after all, George Lucas's movies freely borrowed bits and pieces from J. R. R. Tolkien's books. Both of them start off with a farm boy who is sucked into dark and dangerous times where he must triumph over unimaginable evil. In both films, epic battles take place that you will remember your decades to come. And in both cases, good totally eradicates evil. Anyone who was involved with the creation of "The Lord of the Rings" should be very, very proud to have help create this masterwork.
10.0~There are no words limpzeppelin187 Sign in Permalink I left the theater on December 16th without the words to describe what I have just seen. I still don't, really. No other movie has done that to me since Braveheart. No other movie has moved me to complete and utter shock then Return of the King. Shock that it was so good. Shock that I actually wasn't DISAPPOINTED for a movie i've been waiting for for years. Shock that I actually cried to a movie picture. It took me a whole day to become un-overwhelmed, and I just had to see it again. The second viewing solidified the movie as The Greatest Movie Ever Made(at least to me) The scenery was beautiful. The acting was flawless. Give Sean Astin and Ian McKellen the Oscar. Now. Sean Astin's Samwise Gamgee and Ian McKellen's Gandalf WILL go down in movie history as two of the most beloved film characters. A few cuts from the book left me a bit disappointed, but it didn't spoil the film on a whole for me one bit. They will be in the Extended Editions DVDs, so I'm not too worried about it. All and all, the greatest movie ever made. Bar none. Move over Godfather, here comes Return of the King.
10.0~Peter Jackson, "You bow for no one" Maverick-107 Sign in Permalink -Minor Spoilers- I don't know where i have to start describing the feeling i had after the last line of the credits scrolled before my eyes on the big cinema screen. I was not able to turn my head and look at my friends who where cheering their lungs out. This is the best movie ever made (followed close by Lawrence of Arabia) and will probably stay the best movie for more than a few decades. I don't know how a director who made movies like, bad taste, braindead and not to forget meet the feebles is capable to make the best trilogy ever. This is not only a great book been made into a movie but a magnificent personal effort of Peter Jackson who made these movies the best they can be. Beautiful pictures of middle earth dancing on the score by Howard Shore, are being followed by the biggest and best cinematic action sequences i've ever seen. This movie will simply blow you away. It's better than the first one, better than the second one and even better than the first two combined. If you are reading this and haven't seen the movie, your wasting your time, rush out to the cinema and go and watch this. The movie is a great team effort with beautiful and intriguing acting by all of the characters. John Rhys Davies is even more funnier than in the two towers, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are showing that they don't have to be together to act. Sean Astin is interacting better to Elijah Wood than in the first two movies. And Elijah is the best Frodo in the whole world, you see it in his eyes that he's becoming more afraid every minute he is closer to Mount Doom. And not to forget Orlando Bloom, who's showing that he's a great actor with a facial expression that will make the Elfs proud. And then last but not least there is "THE KING" Viggo Mortensen which is a true king. There isn't a greater king than him. Oh, i forgot Ian McKellen, everybody knows he's a great actor. This brings me to the following conclusion. Rush to the Cinema and go and see "The lord of the movies" "Peter Jackson" i don't think you read this, but if you do, i thank you on behalf of myself and the rest of the Cinema loving world. Thank You Peter Jackson
10.0~Climatic hess-axel Sign in Permalink There's a sag in the film! Not in this film! This is awesome. The trilogy; 'The Two Towers' doesn't match the opening movie or the climax and the best film of the decade. The Return of the King is mind blowing. Most seeing the movie know the plot as they have read Tolkein's mighty opus. But if you have missed the news, Christopher Lee's character doesn't appear. No Saruman. Make sense of it! And Saruman's death at the hands or "wraps" of the worm in the book. Battle of Pelennor Fields is a masterwork. Far better than the battle scenes in Russel Crowe's 'Robin Hood' which I saw this week. Scott uses flesh and blood and a mass of special effects beats him off the screen created in this monster of a movie. The bearers of the ring make the miserable ascent to their final destination to dispose of it. Sauron being stuck as a giant burning eye the whole time sort of limits what he can do. Peter Jackson solves that with a dreamlike moment of Frodo's final struggle. Peter Jackson is clearly a genius in his ability to allow actors to act and giving them space to do so. Lord of the Rings would have been so much lesser had he mashed the actors in special effects and monsters like George Lucas does. The biggest applause is for New Zealand's landscape. It is the land of 'Lord of the Rings.'
10.0~What a way to go wattiex3 Sign in Permalink Unbelievable experience, one of the greatest movies ever made. The wonderful assault on Minas Tirirth, Gollums betrayal. It's all breathtaking. The greatest movie I have ever seen. Quite simple. Has some thing for every one. another movie like this will never be made. Peter Jackson and his team did a wonderful job and deserved more Oscars than they got. incredible acting by all of the cast, Sir Ian, Sean, Viggo. Any one of them could have gotten the Oscar. They all should have. more nominations were in order. this will be remembered as highly as Star Wars. That is how good this film is. See this movie. You will love it. Enjoy.
9.0~The classic film trilogy comes to a close funkyfry Sign in Permalink Fans of the original animated version of "LOTR" were disappointed when Ralph Bakshi announced it would never be completed: "King" saw a release by itself in a version produced by Rankin/Bass, the team which produced "The Hobbit". So, in other words, many fans have been waiting an AWFULLY long time for this one, as well as for the whole trilogy. I think the most impressive aspect of this film, certainly from a technical standpoint, is the incredibly lifelike characterization of Gollum, aided greatly by Andy Serkis' vocal work. That said, there is less development and, generally, less of Gollum in this third film, which may explain why this film is less satisfying than "2 Towers". Gollum was a strong asset to making the second film even more impressive than the first, but "King" has no such ace up its sleeve; it is rather stuck with the task of wrapping up loose ends (at long long last) and saying goodbye to now-cherished characters. I think that we have to wait until "King" sees release on DVD to make a full estimate of its value relative to the other 2 films, since at this point (Feb 03, one day after its victory at the Academy Awards) we can only compare a truncated version of this film to a complete version of the other 2. This film feels, even more so than did the other 2, as if something important is missing in the theatrical version. This may be because the filmmakers, now knowing that most fans will see the DVD version more often and over a longer period of time, have decided that they can be a bit looser with the theatrical version. I don't necessarily think "Return of the King" was the best film of 2003, but it probably deserved the Oscar just for the achievements of the trilogy as a whole. American film fans have grown tired of derivative, stale sequels and so this trilogy is very refreshing because it has a different story in each part. Tolkien's work has been translated to the screen masterfully here, and although I as well as all other lifetime fans will find much to pick at here, there is so much more to be thankful for. That said, my major criticism of this film is in its truncated ending, skipping the "scouring of the Shire" section of the book which Jackson apparently does not consider important. I can understand not including it if his purpose was to wrap the story up as quickly as possible after its first major conclusion. But, instead of the scouring we get an extended scene in which each major character goes one at a time (and often in slow motion, Jackson't most egregious fault as a director) into Frodo's "hospital room" and talks to him, which scene is followed by another scene with everyone bowing down to Aragorn, etc. etc. The film could probably have combined these 2 scenes and left room for the scouring. Why do I think it is so important? Not so much for the plot, but because it illustrates beautifully Tolkien's concept that home is never the same place you left behind. They tried to do it in the film by showing Frodo sitting alone in his room. Here is the problem: in "2 Towers" Frodo sees the burning of the Shire and a huge mechanical mill in the Shire -- in the film Galadriel tells him that this is what might happen, if they fail. In the book, this is the future, and it is the future that Frodo and his friends find in the Shire, regardless of the fact that they "won" the war. This biting commentary was Tolkien's last stab at the "glory" of war, and I think it belonged in the movie, whereas removing it makes the ending a bit too sunny for my tastes, and relative to I think Tolkien's wishes. Anyway, an excellent movie that we will no doubt be returning to from time to time for the rest of our lives.
10.0~The Aphrodite of Cinema Squirelly_Jo Sign in Permalink Before I go into the same ramble of how great Return of the King was, let me say one thing: At a length of 3:20, it's still too short, only because I didn't want it to end. I must say I had my worries with how this was going to turn out (The Trilogy Curse being one of those worries) so I went into the theatre expecting something that would rise above every movie I have seen to date. This movie filled my expectations, from Shelob to the amount of times my tear-ducts were overflowing. As sad as I was that Saruman was cut out, the movie did well without him. There were many great moments, including a suicide mission without sound save for Pippin's (Billy Boyd) singing in the background. The only two moments that caught me off (in both ways good and bad) was the Army of the Dead literally swamping Pellenor Fields, and Mordor: it wasn't exactly as dark as I expected it to be, but that's just a minor gripe. What surprised me the most was that it stayed remarkably close to the book, like a child to a parent, respectively. Sure there were a few changes (Denethor's death is much more elaborate) and a few cuts (Houses of Healing anyone?) but the payoff is one that will leave you in tears and will stick with you for the rest of your life. Thankfully this isn't a Hollywood movie. Had it (the entire trilogy)been a Hollywood movie, it probably would have been 70% action, 30% character developement, and would have probably been made seperately instead of all at once. This is a god among movies, and Peter Jackson is a god among directors. I end this review on a bittersweet note: It is the end. Save for the Extended Edition (the TRUE version of the film) there is a sadness that wells up simply knowing that next year I won't be counting the long days passing to see another epic installment of the greatest trilogy ever. However, like the book, it ends without leaving loose ends, a rare achievement in these days of filmmaking. Long live the King.
1.0~What's the fuzz about? *yawn* tuikku Sign in Permalink Yeah great looking, but really boring, boring and boring movie. Giving such a great ratings for this "masterpiece" is eating the top movie list, since this really isn't great movie, just nice arts, etc. But NOTHING more. The first two were even better than this one. This is all just about how great effects they can make for movie. But well maybe people like this kind of movies nowadays, I want MORE IN movies, not just good looking movies, but good MOVIES. Have to say I'm generally disappointed movies nowadays, most of movies are just about how they look, not about writing, characters, etc. Good that some does like this movie, but I really don't. Last 30-40minutes I were just eating popcorn and thinking about my next days program. 4/10
10.0~like Art goldfish-34 Sign in Permalink This story (all three films) is truly art on film! I was blown away by this film and still am today as I watch it over and over again. Peter Jackson's talent is beyond belief. This film draws you in like nothing I have ever experienced before or since. The fact that the actors were not nominated for Oscars is appalling! If Elijah Wood is not Oscar worthy they need to quit giving the damn things out! For the people that don't "get" the Lord of the Rings and why it's so great, this thing is NOT complicated it's a story of human emotion and the struggle between good and evil so I don't understand why that is so confusing...maybe some are just to shallow to understand those things. My 9 year old nephew gets it so trust me it's not complicated. Lord of the Rings is just simply a great work of art and if you haven't seen it you are missing out on the greatest film ever made, there is nothing else to compare, not even close
10.0~They should have sent a poet............ i have no words. qadirmagsi Sign in Permalink The above line is from "Contact", the novel by Carl Sagan and it is the first thing that came to mind as i thought about writing this review. I truly cannot explain the grandeur of the movie or how seamlessly PJ has integrated it into the trilogy. This is no doubt the best film trilogy ever. TROTK may even be the best movie ever. If not that it certainly deserves a place among the very top of the best movies of all time. While watching the 3 1/4 hour movie, for the first time in my life, i regretted having read and reread the book, just because all the plot twists were known to me, but even then i could not help but get gripped by the scene on Mount Doom, and the battle of Mins Tirith. I think enough synopsis and explanations etc. have been written about the movie so i would not go into that. Suffice to say that this is a movie for every age, every genere. It has elements of Action, Romance, Sci Fi, and some good old good verses evil Epic battles. One thing for Tolkien lovers -- Tolkien was a master of the detail. In the book you can feel the colour of grass, the cack on a marble floor and the smell of Orcs. This movie is very much like that in detail. I cannot imagine how exaustive a task it must have been for the effects team to create such minute detail in every creek, every cliff, every suit of armour. All I can say is that Tolkien would have been proud. I have heard that Christopher Tolkien, JRR's son is not impressed by this trilogy. All I can say to him is that he should give it a second look and just see what PJ has tried to accomplish. As for the Oscar season i think the following should go to TROTK Best Picture - TROTK Best Director - PJ Best Supporting actor - Sean Austin Best Special Effects Best Score Best Screenplay
10.0~The Best Movie I've ever seen! drwatkins2000 Sign in Permalink This movie "is" the best of the Trilogy. I've read the books twice and even with the changes, I think this film is the BEST film I've ever seen in my life. Now maybe I'm feeling this way because I'm still pumped-up from seeing it. The feeling that it leaves you with is unforgettable. I want to see it again and again, and again. It really is that good! Tolkien would be proud.
10.0~After two years of waiting, Tolkien's trilogy ends on screen. (Possible SPOILERS!) rapt0r_claw-1 Sign in Permalink The first two Lord of the Rings were unbelievable. The acting, the plot, the trimming of the story, and special effects were all ground-breaking. Both left you on the edge of your seat as it ended. But ROTK does the opposite: you sit back with a sigh of relief, satisfied that an incredible journey is over. ROTK is a true epic. The characters mature a lot in the culmination, which makes for a movie better than its prequels. The story fits together seamlessly if all you've seen is the movie, but if it leaves a few stones unturned, so what? I read the book, and the scenes that were left on the cutting-room floor were good, but dispensable. The epilogue is the only flaw, but a very minor one anyway. I would have preferred the finale to end like it had begun: an overview of events by Galadriel. Maybe even the last line of the Appendices, when the reader is informed that with Legolas and Gimli crossing to the Grey Havens at last, the Fellowship of the Ring finally left Middle-earth. Characterization reaches its peak in ROTK. Aragorn is nothing like the travel-worn, sullen Ranger of the first two films: he has accepted his heritage as the King of Gondor, and shows his true colors as a brave warrior. A tip of the hat to Viggo Mortensen. Frodo's performance is an excellent one by Elijah Wood, but I can't help but feel annoyed with Frodo's character. I believe Sam is the one that should be receiving all the plaudits at the end of the film, not Frodo. Sam is the real hero. Sean Astin was unknown to me before this, and he finally shines in the third film. In ROTK, he is no longer a loyal servant of Frodo's; he is the driving force behind the destruction of the One Ring. Astin conveys his loyalty to Frodo and emotion perfectly, and makes the move from gentle helper to fiercely protective warrior seamlessly. His is the finest performance in the film. Orlando Bloom and Rhys-Davis are wonderful as comic relief ("That still only counts as one!"). Thank God their body count was retained for the film. Did Bloom have a stuntman? Apparently not, as he broke practically every bone in his body during production. Some of the stunts in this make the surfboard stunt from The Two Towers look like crap, astonishing though it was. Has anyone else noticed that the Dwarf Gimli looks A LOT bigger than the rest? Ah, well. Merry and Pippin do better in ROTK, getting their own story "paths" for the first time. Theoden King was a great character. I was sad when he died in battle (to his credit, none but the Witch King of Angmar could beat him). I was forcibly reminded of Mufasa. I cried at that when I was three. Was it Billy Boyd singing to Denethor or was it dubbed? As a comment on the acting in general, I have to say they made the dramatic, epic dialogue from the book seem normal. You might not even notice that real people don't talk that way. The music in ROTK is the same as the other two: breathtaking. Like so much else, it is on an epic scale, and gives a feeling of grandeur. Nothing could fit better with the shots of sweeping landscapes that show the characters' journeys, rather than the usual high-speed clips of different parts of the journey. This is one of the things I love about the direction in this movie. It's a lot better than the norm to see a view of a place with a huge orchestra playing, as well as the parts where someone enters or leaves in slow motion, with - surprise! - music to illustrate it. I need to see more of this kind of thing. The epic battle scenes take up a lot of screentime, and that isn't a complaint. Like a lot of the stuff, much of it is in slow motion, letting the music explain all of it. They all begin well, with inspirational speeches before the first charge. I don't see why the battles were attacked for dragging on. Especially since in ROTK you see a lot more: a lot more monsters and people, and the highlight were the oliphaunts. Great special effects, Orlando Bloom strikes again: the stunts are AMAZING. Special effects. Awesome. Gollum is the most complex CGI character ever, making him all the more difficult to portray. The voice is superb, that spine-chilling hiss. The split personality is extremely important, and it was essential that the film be able to pull it off. The abrupt changes in tone and facial expression must have been hard to do, but they are flawless. It was great to make it seem as if two Gollums were there, a good and a bad. It made me suspicious for a while, thinking that Bad Gollum was a product of the Ring, or there were two Gollums, one that showed up at night. Sean Astin may be the best human actor in the film, but the CGI Gollum might be a little better. With the addition of another side of Gollum and other miscellaneous beasties of ugly appearance, ROTK is a much more frightening film than its predecessors. The jagged rocks of Mordor and the darkness of the deep places of the earth, would be unpleasant places to be in without the edition of the eery score, which becomes loud, fast and furious when the concealed horror finally emerges. Wow. In the end, you're content with the year-long wait since The Two Towers. ROTK has done a tremendous job, it didn't seem likely the continuing story of the characters from The Fellowship of the Ring could beat the first installment. Pessimism about ROTK heightened after TTT was so good. But, well, to hell with the cynics, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best damned film I have ever seen, so there. Period. You're not beating this.
10.0~The icing on the cake:) ad_upclose Sign in Permalink A fantastic close to this epic masterpiece! There were so many great scenes before the chaos of the final mammoth battle begins: The beginning of the film was really good as it showed the development of Gollum into the monster he became; the 'lighting of the beacons' was very well executed; the scene where Faramir is riding to his death, while Pippin sings to his evil father was truly haunting; Shelob's lair was another great part of the story...more great effects; the undead soldiers' cave sequence was very nice, and a nice addition...as it seemed impossible for good to have overcome evil without their assistance. Finally the epic battle of Minas Tirith! All hell brakes loose in this one...there are fantastic fights in this one: The Nazguls in flight, the mythic elephants trampling everything, Eowyn's fight with the Nazgul, Gandalph's face-off with the Nazgul etc etc!! There were some complaints to the long ending of the movie. I disagree, as a friend of mine put it...a movie and story that has given the movie world so much deserves a celebration of 20 minutes! Overall, this trilogy is my favorite movie of all time. Hats off to P.J and the entire team for bringing this remarkable and complex adventure to life! Deserves every praise possible! For the true fans out there I recommend they buy the extended version of the trilogy to enjoy more depth and visual treats! Bring on 'The Hobbit'!
10.0~Best movie ever made. mrpat1206 Sign in Permalink This was the shortest 3 1/2 hours i have ever spent and worth every dime. Wow what a wonderful movie, if there are better ones, i haven't seen it yet. Characters, story, action and soundtrack better than excellent. The attention paid to detail was incredible. Don't miss out on this fantastic film and series
6.0~not enough rohanaroundtheworld Sign in Permalink A story with a history of huge proportions; the director seemed to settle for second grade quality. The movie was put out, advertised and expected to be one of monumental standings yet throughout it was riddled with bad special effects, terrible actors and a screen play that left much to be desired in the way of leading us into the world the author originally intended. A lot of revivals are being made, but the 'Lord of the Rings' epic should have been one to set itself above all others, and in my opinion this wasn't the case. I'm sure that even if JRR Tolkien wanted it to be made into a movie, which i doubt he would have, it should have been done to the best capabilities the film industry has.
4.0~it cool marilynnrainey Sign in Permalink This movie was ok some parts where lame maybe the next one will be better
10.0~Love Courage and Loyal sophyca Sign in Permalink Every time I watch the alight beacons to save Gondor among the white snow covered mountains, I always have a sense of awe or sublime. And the movie does pretty good in evoking that feeling because it gives gradual and long pictures together with music. During the unfolding of the pictures, I can not help but to ask myself " what would you do if YOU ARE the leader of the kingdom? Would you have the courage to fight for the honor of your country even facing seemingly indefeasible enemies? Would you have the courage to forgive the alliance that did not come to you when you are in danger? " And I myself have not been able to answer those questions yet. But I do think even if I do not have the courage at first, it would come to me after inspirations of other countries whose leaders agree bravely to help Gondor. And there are many other parts that impress me a lot. I still remember the eyes of Theodon when he leaves his kingdom in Rohan. He takes a last sight of his palace, of the supreme position in his country, because he know, this may be the last time he could ever to look at his kingdom. And the voice of Gandalf comes to him again, " so it is before the walls of Minas Tirith, the doom of human would be decided". At that specific moment, Theodon has a mingling of feelings, but he does not fear, even though knowing this would be an one-end journey which will never bring him back. So with the flags of Rohan, with the horse that stand for courage and gallantry, Theodon, together with his army, advances to Gondor. And I extremely value the decisions of Theodon, the king. After having peaceful and extravagant lives of king, I doubt seldom would have the courage to abandon the life behind and sacrifice himself. And Faramir,to show his talent to his father, summons a comparably and pitily small army to reclaim the city of Gondor, which is conquered by Orcs. In the city of Minas Tirith, people farewell the army and show them their love. Similarly, the movie depicts the eyes of Faramir, a cold, even desperate eyes, but not with fear. He feels death, but he does not fear it. Although at the end, his father does not understand he, Faramir is better than his brother, we as audience could clearly figure that out. Boromir, the brother of Faramir, died in the process of claiming The Ring, but Faramir lets Frodo and The Ring go even in defiance of the law in his kingdom. Faramir could summon army to, to some extent, give up his life just in the name of Loyalty to his father and Gondor. And here is Arogan. to distract The Eye so that it will not notice the track of Frodo and Sam, he, Gandalf and a group of soldiers come blatantly to the gate of Gondor, to defy the authority of The Eye flagrantly, to fight to death. Afer all the enemies have come out, the little troop of Arogan was surrounded layer by layer. They shrink in a very little size. But they try, for the sake of ultimate success, in the name of justice, in the name of promising future they envision in their minds. Eventually, at the last moment, gases arise from the mountain, The Ring is destroyed and the world seems to be reformed in the tremendous and unprecedented destructions The Ring provided. And finally here comes to the end. The best consequence that could come out of the situations. Everyone fulfills his/her dreams and everyone goes into his/her position in the peaceful Middle Earth.
9.0~All Good Things Must Come To An End CrassActionHero Sign in Permalink The Return of The King (2003) This is the final installment of the trilogy. What a journey it has been. The theater was packed, and I was ready. Review:ROTK is an awesome movie. Here we gain more depth to other characters of the trilogy. Mainly one of em is Gollum. We finally learn all about his past here. As our heroes journey to Mordor, the Hobbits must do the same with the ring. To Mount Doom. What can I say that has not been said already? ROTK delivers. The audience was pleased. I had a wonderful time in the theater. The final battle sequences were quite stunning. One scene in particular has Legolas an Gimli in competition with each other. Legolas does something amazing and the line delivered by Gimli afterward delivered. The theater laughed aloud. The visuals of the war mammoths was insane. They looked incredibly destructive. Only drawback here is the movie seemed to take forever to finally end. Just when it looked like it was over, it continued. This went on for a little too long. However, the audience gave a round of applause at the conclusion. An excellent movie going experience. I had fun. DVD Extras: The deleted scenes are actually good. If you saw this in theaters like me, you are probably asking: "What happened to Saruman?" The extras have an answer. On the DVD extended, We finally see the scene of Saruman. Peter Jackson had it cut because the movie was too long as it is. Now you get to see what happened to Saruman. The Last Word: A great trilogy is concluded. Out of the three, I enjoyed The Fellowship the most. Overall, Everyone involved with the trilogy deserves a massive applause for their efforts in making a stunning trilogy. You have earned my thanks.
10.0~Beautiful, Brilliant, epic, breathtaking, intense lennonfan929 Sign in Permalink There is not one scene in this movie where there isn't a valid reason to cry. This movie is a landmark of the movies, and this trilogy is a testament to the will to survive and surviving against impossible odds. No one could've made a better live action film adaptation of these incredible books than Peter Jackson. And no one could possibly improve on this movie -it is utterly breathtaking and flawless. It is beautiful, it is dark, it is intense, and there are uncountable moments that absolutely astonish you. If you do not like this movie, than you do not know what good filmmaking is, or you are hopelessy cynical and I pity you. This movie is magic, it's movie magic, and every frame is wonderful and sweeping and I'm not sure how anyone could not like this movie. Even if you're not a fan, you haven't read the books, and you haven't seen either of the two movies, the sheer visual spectacle can't help but amaze you. This movie deserves every tiny bit of praise it's getting, and will get, and If you don't go to see this movie, you are missing out on the film of this century, of this milennium, of all time.
10.0~The perfect ending horseygurlz Sign in Permalink I must admit, I had my doubts whether this film would live up to the incredibly high standards set by the first two films, but it has spectacularly succeeded. Once again, Viggo Mortensen delivers a polished and convincing performance as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom remains a very good Legolas, and Elijah Wood puts in a fantastic performance as Frodo Baggins. The special effects and computer generated scenes remain incredible and very difficult to tell from the real scenes, especially during the epic final battle. I always think that the final film in a series is the most difficult as the director has to tie up any loose ends, but Peter Jackson makes it look effortless - this is definitely one of the best films he has ever made. While the trilogy doesn't exactly follow the plot of the books, and this film is no exception, it still captures all of the ideas laid out in the books by J.R.R.Tolkein. A must-watch film.
10.0~Action-packed if not slightly overlong joy jasonz42 Sign in Permalink Well, this was my favorite of the trilogy, mainly because it was backed up by 6 hours worth of the previous films which meant it didn't have to build as much, and what followed was 3 hours of fantastic footage. The thing is because of those previous films you already have the feeling of the immense task and the size of the situation, so practically the entire film is more dramatic than one i have ever seen. It thoroughly deserved its massive applause at the end, although whether that was so people could walk about I don't know. If there's one criticism i have, it was overly long this time, mainly in the strung out ending. Sadly, i do not complain directly to the producers, since the endings are actually necessary and it would be criminal to leave them out according to the books. Even so I did feel had the movie ended 20 minutes earlier the cheer would have been an eruption, but maybe that's a personal dislike. Nevertheless, the battle sequences deserve an academy award alone, beautifully crafted and awe inspiring to watch. Acting is up to scratch as always, and there's not a dud scene in the film. All in all, if you don't see this film you will be missing out on one of the greats the camera was invented for. This is the one ring. See it.
10.0~Greatest movie ever chewablesarcasm Sign in Permalink Books are always better than their movie counterparts. This tells me, then, that books are always better than movies. So, if someone, in this case Peter Jackson, is able to accurately depict the greatest, most inventive piece of literature ever created, wouldn't the movie follow suit? To me, then, the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the greatest movie ever. The trilogy flows so perfectly together, that I can't help but point out that the entire trilogy is the greatest piece of film ever, but since that's not an option, and the final installment is the best, I'll have to go with that. For the record, though, the entire trilogy merits the number 1 spot.
10.0~The Voters have it!! The number 1 movie of all time!! jarzan2003 Sign in Permalink With the fact that nearly 80% of voters that give it a full-pull 10 out of 10, Godfather I & II and Shawshank Redemption is left eating dust, we can all bow to the King of all Kings of movies!! The Lord of the Rings, is now without doubt the greatest movie of all time!!! Believe the people! Its a ten! No, an eleven.... no... How do you rate this movie?? Its beyond rating... Lovely beyond description. WOW!!! I am certianly glad to be alive... Alive to watch the most breathtaking, astonishing, heartfelt movie to ever come to film. Thank you Peter Jackson!!! You gave my life something to cheer about... Thanks to all the staff who were involved with the greatest movie sensation in history!! Bravo!! This will become a continued favorite for families to watch every Christmas... One fair WARNING!! Don't eat or drink anything at least 4 hours before the movie. Chew gum. Don't drink or eat during the movie. Otherwise the movie will be lost from the frustration you will feel from holding your bladder.... Believe me, there isn't a moment that is 'free' to just leave... You'll thank me if you heed my warning!!
9.0~Quality Adaptation of Great Tolkein Novels. Great work, Peter Jackson, etc... movie-viking Sign in Permalink The title gives away the ending...But these 3 films are great because they do almost everything WELL! Many great, believable characters, wonderful (though complex) story line, hundreds of costumes, special effects, including nuanced, computerized special effects, believable villains (notably Smeagol/Gollum - the lowly bad guy who still will influence Frodo - for good or ill...)... Film students - this adaptation of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is worth intense study. Peter Jackson & co. did just about everything well. The long, long list of awards tells you his peers noted this. This highly complex three film series is to the average film - as the multi level D-Day invasion was to the typical battle. And speaking of battles, I agree that Sean Astin's Samwise is the best character of all. He is probably like the World War I foot soldiers Tolkein served with (called Tommies). The average guy who wants to get back home - who steps up to be the little-known person who helps win the battle...
8.0~Exhilarating, breathtaking and anti progressive. julejohn Sign in Permalink Without having seen the extended version yet, I vote Return of the King with an 8. It is without doubt one of the most impressive movies ever made and it follows the story and plot of the book fairly. The really great movies must have more than exhilarating action and breathtaking special effects. This is exactly the lack of Return of the King. It simply gives you nothing further to think about. It is anti progressive, which is necessary to be loyal to Tolkien. Peter Jackson managed to get almost the very best out the book(s), but it could never be able to reach the peak, although he gave it a good shot.
10.0~Watch this film right now! EverettSzurek Sign in Permalink A true benchmark in the history of film. The only thing that can come close to the make-up, cgi, plot line, and editing would be the original star wars trilogy which in my opinion is still not even close. There has never been a movie that was nominated eleven times at the academy awards that went on to win all eleven. SERIOUSLY THIS MOVIE WON ALL 11 times it was nominated. If that does not put this movie on your watch list then I am sorry my friend you have something wrong in your life. Even for people who may thoroughly hate fantasy or large scale Hollywood films this movie should literally be the one exception. I can live when someone tells me they have not seen other franchises like star wars or harry potter but when I hear someone say they haven't seen lord of the rings I become quite angry. Just do yourself a favor and watch the film. You will thank me later trust me.
10.0~The final chapter of cinema's greatest trilogy! mrpulpfiction-400-735188 Sign in Permalink This trilogy took my breath away, it made me laugh, it made me wince, it even made my eyes tear up in some parts, but in totality what it did was completely blow my mind!! Now let's get to the third chapter - The Return of the King. Unbelievable!! I will start with the acting. The entire cast was superb beyond imagination. Firstly, Viggo Mortensen again deliver's a brilliant performance as Aragorn, of a King emerging from an outlaw. It has been wonderful to watch his steady transformation over the two previous instalments but it really comes full tilt here. Sean Astin also deserves special mention as the true hero that has been buried inside Samwise Gamgee surfaces in the final film, navigating some of the films most frightening and suspenseful scenes. Reliable as ever is sir Ian Mckellen as thee wise Gandalf and now as general of the Gondorian armies. Finally worth mentioning is Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis. Elijah perfectly portrays the pain and weariness of an eroding soul. And as the wonderfully created CGI masterpiece Andy Serkis brings life to the creature Gollum through his movements and voice. Next up is the direction and script. Oh!! And how wonderful these aspects are!! Peter Jackson surpasses the scope and epic glory of the two astonishing previous chapter's to bring us something beyond cinema and beyond epic. The craft with which the New-Zeelander constructs this film is amazing. He builds in every aspect necessary to forward the narrative but gives it all ample time to wonderfully unfold. Working from a brilliant script, written by himself, his wife Fran Walsh and Phillipa Booyens he creates the utter magic on screen that was so evident in the undeniably majestic literary masterpieces of JRR Tolkien. The sweeping score just adds to the epic scope of the film and is so wonderful that it almost becomes a character all by itself. The Story follows Frodo and Sam's final steps towards Mount Doom, with their treacherous companion Gollum in Tow. The Other member's of the fellowship are gearing up for the final battle of middle earth. Aragorn is absent from the preparations while he recruits the army of the dead to fulfill their oath. Using Anduril, which is the Narsil after it has been reforged. The battle scenes are even more impressive than the visually stunning battle of Helms Deep from the Two Towers. With especially the battle of Pelenor fields being up there with the Final battle as some of the best battle scenes ever created. In the extended edition look out for the scenes where the terrifying Witch - king of Angmar's true power comes into scope. Many have complained about the films multi tiered ending. But to me this is a well deserved farewell to some of our most loved cinema characters. if there was an option to give this trilogy more than 10/10 I would, but seeing as this is the highest honor I can bestow on it a 10 shall suffice.
6.0~I needed to say that. SmashMe55 Sign in Permalink OK. First of all, this movie cannot be considered the best movie of all time because of many things. I've read almost every comments on this site about this movie (and i dont exaggerate at all) and all i saw was " Best movie of all time", " The way movies should be done today", etc, and i thought wait a minute, there's something wrong here. Before anyone becomes insulted by what im saying i have to say that i've read all the books and i loved them. The best trilogy in books history!! But here, what im arguing against is not the story nor the way Jackson adapted it( by the way, it couldn't be much perfect for a lotr movie). I'm just outraged by the ignorance of all the people that are stating that this is the best movie of all time!!! I certainly do not say these people are stupid or something like that, its just that this is not a work of art, a masterpiece. It is just another commercial movie that looks like the others and this movie happens to be based on the most popular books of all time ( i do not know anybody who havent red the books). All the battles have already been done th same way (See every movie categorized as peplum in the 50, 60s and 70s and you'll understand), the close shots of thes characters faces are nothing new and the narrative form is as simple as "The Beauty and the Beast" story. If you want to watch movies that are made by real artists and not by a lucky director of B-Series movies, check out Leos Karax, Jean-Luc Godard, Gus Van Sant, Stanley Kubrick, Tim Burton, Fritz Lang, Milos Forman, Francois Truffaut, Orson Welles, etc. Watch out, i do not say that everybody would like every one of these but i surely think that in the directors i've named, you'll find one that made a movie that'll make you cry, smile or feel fear better than a ordinary epic commercial movie as the Return of the King. In the end, i would also like to say that i liked the first two movies (as they amused me for three hours each) but i thought that the third one was a pale copy of the FOTR and TTT.
10.0~Stunning finale colsta Sign in Permalink PJ did it didn't he? Frankly, I don't necessarily rate this film higher than the previous two per se. Rather, I think the way the tale was weighted in both the book and more especially, the screenplay, lent itself to a climactic finish which this film encapsulated. I do think the CGI in RoTK (unsurprisingly) outclassed the previous offerings though. I understand that Weta were flat out right up to the release cut-off. My only grumble was the contrived ending. Even though Tolkien himself seemed to have a problem finishing the original novel satisfactorily, I thought the liberties taken in the conclusion marred an otherwise perfect film. I believe it would have been better served by placing the cut scenes of Sauron back in at the beginning, and then finishing on the crowning of the King. A voice over with a storyboard or flashes could have covered the return to the Shire, and Bilbo's departure. That said, its a pretty minor grumble and doesn't spoil the overall enjoyment. So well done to a local lad turned good :) With rumours that The Hobbit may now be slated for filming, I look forward to what other treats PJ and Weta can conjure.
10.0~An excellent Fairy tale, skillfully crafted! sabine-33 Sign in Permalink I always loved to read great fairy tales - and, of course, I wanted to see the one or the other fairytale as a movie. But every movie I saw before Peter Jackson came along with his Lord Of The Rings adaptation, had always sorely failed (in my opinion). The only fairytale movie, aside from the 3 LOTR movies, I can watch is the Director's Cut of Legend. The LOTR movies managed to "wake up" a strange nostalgia inside of me, I remember the times I read fantasy/fairytale books (for those of you who can read the German language I highly recommend the fairytale books of Ernst Wiechert, BTW). And I always tip toed around the Lord Of The Rings books - and never came around to read them. Mostly I didn't have the time, but also I think I was pretty scared by the size of these books together. Now with the magnificent and deeply satisfying third part of his movie trilogy, Peter Jackson has succeeded in bringing the books back to my attention. Sure, purists will say I should have read the books first and then see the movies. They will say the movies spoiled the books for me. But I will disagree: I was able to watch the movies totally unbiased, without scrutinizing them. I was able to take them on as excellent storytelling and movie making achievements by themselves, but also as a first wonderfully enchanting magnifying-glass-look at a vaster, deeper fantasy epic. And now I started to read the books. I was skillfully primed by the LOTR movies - and after having a relaxed great, unspoiled fun time at the movies I can relax even more and go on the (mental) journey to Middle Earth to discover everything else there is to see. Like the first and the second part, Return Of The Kind deserves a 10 out of 10.
10.0~Best Picture of the Year-by far iheartyou216 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings return of the king comes to an action-packed, heart-wrenching end in this awesome Xmas flick. This Xmas, in case you didn't notice, many flicks premiered around the 25th, and this one exceeds them all as far as acting, directing, special effects, and excitement. LOTR will sweep the Oscars this year. There is something definitely wrong with the world if Peter Jackson doesn't win the Oscar for Best Director.
7.0~Good in its special effects esteban1747 Sign in Permalink Commenting the first part of this novel I said that it was a real message for peace, but I cannot assert the same for this final one . Although technically this film is one of the best in its special effects, it has too many battles which make it sometimes boring, battle after battle with no space to think or to relax. It also amazed me to see that the villain of this story, i.e. Christopher Lee disappeared with no explanation. I was unsuccessfully looking for him in the film, but later learned that even the same Lee is now arguing for the exclusion of his scenes from this film. Why such a exclusion? It is a real mystery. One can guest more or less the rest of the plot, the good boys winning over the evil. In fact the end of the film is like a poem, Frodo has to go to a kind of a sweet death leaving Sam sad. This scene is certainly unexpected and makes you think that death is fatal but can be welcome when good doing has taken place. In any case, my criticism here does not demerit the success of the whole serial of these three films, but the third one should have been the best and it was not.
10.0~The 3rd is a Charm. Three Movies to rule them all! andy-800 Sign in Permalink Return of the King was a fitting and wonderful conclusion to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. A movie masterpiece. This one should definitely take Best Picture! Although many items, sub-plots, etc. are missing, I think Jackson did a tremendous job of telling this story (there should be plenty of great stuff on the extended DVD when it comes). 3 1/2 hours of extreme adventure, emotion and thrills await the moviegoer!
2.0~Yawn Yawn Sell Out daveisit Sign in Permalink Congratulations Peter Jackson. Plenty of imagination is required to try and pull off a trilogy such as "Lord Of The Rings". Not to mention a country like New Zealand to film it in. It was just such a shame it was so boring. Now I admit I struggled through "The Hobit", and never gave "Lord Of the Rings" a chance in the paperback department. So I applaud your effort of keeping me a little interested throughout the movie. One of the two things that bothered me was the ridiculous length of the movie. I have three words that could have saved this movie from becoming a joke. POST PRODUCTION EDITING. I was laughing in the end at what a farce the movie had become. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was nothing to do with the movie but JRR Tolkien, who came up with surely the worst idea ever written on how a victory could be one. Writers block or just a cheap cheap sell out. You decide.
10.0~Excellent tedlandis Sign in Permalink Excellent. Best of the best. I sat sweating through the whole thing. Emotionally draining. I will see it again.
10.0~It will last until the ending of all things manny5 Sign in Permalink Having participated in Trilogy Tuesday and also seeing the film again last night (Wednesday), I can honestly say there are no regrets. To quote Frodo regarding Aragorn: "We have no choice but to trust him," was my attitude towards Peter Jackson and his development of the films. Excellent job, this will stand the test of time and remain with all of us until the ending of the world.
10.0~Superb final chapter of a superb trilogy freonmonkey Sign in Permalink Wow. Wow. The coolest film I've seen in a very long time. I would simply descend into babbling fanboy territory if I started to discuss just what makes this film the icing on the cake of the finest film trilogy ever (yes, it's better than Star Wars). Suffice to say that if you don't go and watch The Return of the King at the earliest available opportunity, you will be missing out in a very big way indeed. But I'm betting you already knew that. Beautiful in every way.
10.0~Words escape me! lady-eowynn Sign in Permalink I saw this on Trilogy Tuesday...I was a bit bleary eyed after sitting through almost 8 hours of film so I'm not sure how well I took in the ROTK...even with this handicap I must say I was blown away. Of course the movie wasn't perfect, it had it's moments that I thought were just awful.. ****spoiler***** They eye of Sauron....please, it isn't a spotlight. But for those who say they wished Sauron would have come out and fought Aragorn...it doesn't happen...in the books Sauron has not quite regained his full strength...why do you think he wants the One Ring? Duh! That one orc, someone compared him to Sloth in Goonies...my daughter and I thought the same thing. Denethor was disappointing. No Houses of Healing But...on the other hand...for the most part this movie was grand, it was emotional, it was spectacular. Am I biased because I have been a huge Tolkien fan for almost 30 years? Yes...and no...I'm somewhat of a purist. But I realize that Jackson made this partly out of love for the story. It is his vision and in so many places his vision matched mine. It doesn't matter what he did, someone would always complain. If he stuck too closely to the book some would have called it boring. After all PJ had to satisfy both the fans of the books and the general movie going public...and we know how hard it is to satisfy the general movie going public. If you don't have a few crotch kicks, curse words or loads of sex they just don't want to see it. I think PJ did just fine without those (although I do recall a crotch kick in TTT) Jackson rates pretty high in my book just for taking this project on...the actors too! He is the One Director to Rule them all!! Now to see it a second time this weekend on the IMAX screen!! And I can guarantee that the DVD EE will blow the theatrical version away!! I can't wait!!
9.0~This movie really breaks your consciousness! iirolamppu Sign in Permalink Huh! Where would I start.. The beginning of the film was very interesting because it told the story behind (cute) Smeagol. You surely get the feeling that this film is going to be brilliant, and it really is. Althought it's over three hours long,you don't get tired of it, because there is something happening all the time. The casting is awesome. There are none of bad casting, and just some to mention Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood are brilliant. Everything is so credible that after movie it feels that you live in some kind of seventh heaven. This is the greatest movie of all, and you all must see it! 5+/5
10.0~The adventure ends the-gossip-king Sign in Permalink it well deserved the 11 Oscars, it is brilliant! These movies will never be forgotten. Peter Jackson is a genius! These movies are well acted, visually rich, have great dialogue and a great story. I won't bother with the story because it is one of the most famous of all time and pretty simple so i will just get to the movie. Revolutionary visual effects! Cast - perfect. Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, best casting choice ever, Viggo Mortensen, who would have though, everyone else is also great even Christopher Lee who I don't think has ever not played a villain but that is just because he is so good at it! And of course who can forget Cate Blamchett who is barely on screen but all the same is excellent. Dialogue, excellent, what more can I say, if you haven't seen this movie you have not been born yet! This is one of the best series created. Fantasy 1. Lord of the Rings 2. Chronicles of Narnia & Harry Potter 3. (Can't think of one worth putting up, there have been plenty of duds)
1.0~Weakest of the Three imdb3-3 Sign in Permalink If you make your way through the thousands of teens, Lord of the Rings junkies, and all the others who voted this movie a 10 for reasons other than a pure movie rating, you'll find that this is easily the weakest of the three films, unfortunately. Pro: It was a good movie and for the most part, entertaining. The characters are well cast, the CGI is good in most places, the actors are good enough to save questionable editing and the scenery is still breathtaking. Great effects in battle... you'll see. Worth the $10 to see but not really one you want to see again without having the ability to skip portions. Cons: 1) Way, way too long and poor editing choices. SPOILER --> The multiple endings was totally preposterous and belongs in the extended DVD version for fanzies. Remember, this is a movie, not the book. That time would have been much better spent on main characters that never surfaced, e.g. Saruman whom you never saw again and Sauron who was reduced to nothing more than a lighthouse. Oh yeah, I felt how dangerous he was. You will get restless at the end of the movie and will laugh your head off as to how awfully campy and forced it feels (especially when Frodo wakes up and the silly canned laughter begins...) 2) Too much time wasted at the beginning of the film as well. Mr. Jackson, pick your choices of what to develop. The love story and relationship between get any concern for the relationship. Too bad. Too much crap with Merry and Pippin... please, enough of the Hobbit details crap and focus on the main characters. Honestly, I didn't feel like I really cared so much about many of the characters because there was so much cutting between scenes and an incredible amount of time spent on Faramir and his going mad father, an odd area to place so much time. 3) Gimli and Legolas again reduced to nothing more than comic relief and incredibly cool and unrealistic CGI hero. There was practically no dialogue with Legolas at all. The reduction of these characters made me care less about Legolas and made the girl I went with happy the one or two time she saw him but wondered why he was nothing but occasional screen candy. 4) The movie felt very tired. Gollum again steals the show. 5) Some of the battle scenes were tired. A lot of quick cutaways and not as much feel of the one on one combat like you had in the first films. Also very, very poor display assistance of the dead -- it was as though they used up the budget for CGI and had this wave of green just end the huge number of Sauron's army in 10 seconds while the other characters hung out to chat. It was like a comic strip video game. Honestly, I didn't feel like I really cared so much about the characters at the end and felt like the ring was reduced to nothing more than an overblown reason to have a quest. I truly think this movie suffers from wasted time at the beginning and end, too many battle scenes and too little time to continue to develop the great dialogue and character development of earlier movies. My rating would place this film a very good 7.5 but that is as high as I'd go. Definitely bring some nourishment, wear comfy clothes and a watch...
10.0~"Put aside the Ranger, become who you were born to be." classicsoncall Sign in Permalink Weary beyond words, Hobbit companions Frodo and Sam continue their journey to destroy the One Ring, with the sinister Gollum still their guide. The film opens interestingly with Gollum's origin story, capturing his descent into depravity and madness, finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. The ring has the power to affect it's bearer, and not for good. With the battle of Helm's Deep over and Saruman's power gone, the attention focuses on the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. There the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy, while those visible are more of a threat than ever. "The Return of the King" in it's way is as much Aragorn's story as it is Frodo's; a reluctant noble struggling to find his destiny who comes to accept and eventually embrace it under the tutelage of the White Wizard Gandalf. The subtle subtext of Aragorn's relationship with Lady Arwen of the Elven realm leads to his triumph with no illusions for Eowyn, establishing a noble grace and dignity for the new King. Upon my second viewing of the entire trilogy, I was surprised at how my attention was continually drawn to the character of Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's faithful companion. This in large part to the excellent portrayal by Sean Astin, showing a range of emotions throughout the film that proffered him as the most well developed character of the story. He's a loyal friend through thick and thin, understanding clearly that by the journey's near end, Frodo's mind may no longer be his own. Gimli is another character to keep a close eye on for the understated humor John Rhys-Davies brings to the story. The personal competition he began with Legolas (Orlando Bloom) in "The Two Towers" finds comic resonance here; as Legolas brings down a rampaging olyphant on the Pelennor Fields, Gimli tempers his congratulations with "That still only counts as one" - marvelous! With the One Ring destroyed, so is Sauron's awesome power, and a quest resolved for the fortunes of mankind. The film's multiple endings encapsulate just as many feelings in the viewer, those of loyalty, honor, love, sacrifice and friendship. As a unit, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy stand as probably the ultimate in cinematic adventure to this point in time. Truly, I can only make one suggestion to make the series even more poignant, that for a film that reveals the discovery of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins, the basis for the adventure that begins in "The Hobbit".
10.0~The Ultimate Ending to an Unforgettable Trilogy alexxchiodo Sign in Permalink 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is the concluding chapter in the 'Lord of the Rings' Trilogy, and i must say, it concluded amazingly. The movie starts off with a dark backstory of Smeagol, which when I say dark, I mean dark. You see Smeagol murder his friend Deagol (or lover?) in which you realise how quickly the ring will poison men's minds - even to the point where one would murder a friend to have it. From here you see Smeagol deteriorate and become what we know as Gollum and it's just a really dark segment, but it provides a necessary backstory to the character. I must mention that there is one character in this movie that I despise of more than any character i have seen in any movie: Denethor, Boromir's father who pretty much scorns his second born son Faramir. It's obvious that Faramir has been trying to prove his worthiness to his father for some time, but when Denethor says to his son that he had wished he had died instead of Boromir, you can't as the viewer help but feel as broken-hearted as Faramir. I mean, imagine your father said that to you; that he had wished you had died instead of your brother. You'd feel grief-stricken. The look on Faramir's face in conjunction with the sorrowful music playing in the background makes it such a powerful scene. With watery eyes Faramir then says, "Since you were robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead", so then Faramir gathers his men to ride back out to Osgiliath in a fruitless battle to reclaim the city. It's such a sad scene because you know Faramir does not have enough men to reclaim the city, but he goes anyway to uphold the honour he has for his brother and halfwitted father. The whole scene is in slo- motion with Pippin singing sadly in the background as the Orcs draw their bows to kill Faramir and his men charging towards the overrun city. It's just all so sad and I'm pretty certain this scene will be very potent and indelible in my mind. In the battle for Minasterith Aragon saves the day with his army of the undead, which to me pretty much felt like him putting in a cheat code and just demolishing every Orc, Troll and Mumakil on the battlefield. And this leads me to another point - Gimli and Legolas's friendship. I loved watching their friendship grow stronger and seeing these two characters learn to tolerate each other over the three films. I also cherish the humour in their relationship, I mean how can you not laugh after Legolas impressively takes down a Mumakil all by himself and Gimli, apathetically comments, "That still only counts as one!" I love scenes like this that lighten-up the mood of solemn situations. One of the stand out performances, however, in the entire movie is by Samwise Gamgee. As the voice of reason in Frodo's head, Sam tries to tell him that Gollum is plotting to kill both of them and take the ring for himself, but because Gollum can empathise with Frodo, he believes Gollum's stories. When Frodo is poisoned and paralysed by Shelob (the giant spider) I really enjoyed seeing Sam battle her and be all courageous and brave and dexterous. As Frodo becomes weaker Sam needs to become stronger, and that's exactly what happens. When the two Hobbits finally reach the volcano Sam determinedly carries Frodo up the mountain to the entrance that really demonstrates his development as a character, in which the ring is later finally destroyed. It was interesting to see Gollum hold the ring close to his chest as he falls down into the pit of lava, yet even as he's sinking and burning and dying his one thought is to try save the ring. It just shows how evil can be tenacious and follow people to their death. In essence, I felt this movie was the perfect way to end such a memorable trilogy. Peter Jackson did a superb job to make all the characters unique and significant in their own way and encapsulate what life is like during Middle Earth. The setting, the costumes, the characters, the CGI and the story were all presented perfectly in a trilogy that will never be forgotten.
10.0~A classic. winstizzle Sign in Permalink The culmination of nearly 10 years' work and conclusion to Peter Jackson's epic trilogy based on the timeless J.R.R. Tolkien classic, "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" presents the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil fighting for control of the future of Middle-earth. Hobbits Frodo and Sam reach Mordor in their quest to destroy the 'one ring', while Aragorn leads the forces of good against Sauron's evil army at the stone city of Minas Tirith. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is easily one of the greatest classics of all time. Peter Jackson's filmography is the best interpretation possible of Tolkien's Middle Earth.
8.0~boring part of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. sanchuj Sign in Permalink This movie starts from the end of the second part. Frodo, Gollum and Sam head for Mordor. Aragon, Legolas, Gilmli and the Rohan kingdom go for help to Minas Trith where the war had started. But I think that this part was a little bit boring. I liked Legolas character in all the three parts and Merry and Pippin character was also funny. I think Gandalf the white looks good than Gandalf the gray. I think that no one should miss it.
10.0~simply stunning spazmoydalmoon Sign in Permalink I cannot say one bad thing about this film. It was powerful, awe inspiring, and simply stunning. Truly one of the greatest films for my generation. I will not drag this out, go see it. If you complain about the length, then you shouldn't watch films at all. Take time to see this, there is nary a downpoint here.
10.0~The Greatest Movie Trilogy Ever!!! JoshyMF Sign in Permalink With respect to the other trilogies: The 1st 3 Star Wars films, Indiana Jones, The Matrix, The Godfather or which ever other set you can think of, this final piece of Peter Jackson's masterpiece completes the greatest adventure story of the 20th Century in breathtaking fashion. Sean Astin and Viggo Mortenson capture each of their respective roles brilliantly displaying the correct levels of emotion and passion, staying true to Tolkien's vision of the human will. Also Ian McKellan's Gandalf will go down as one of the most beloved characters in any genre hands down. The Academy better pay special attention to what Peter Jackson has done here. As an avid fan of this story as a youth, I am very critical of how the conversion from print to film is accomplished. Though this movie has to be 3 hrs 20 minutes long to do it, Jackson does extremely well to include a more than worthy amount from the original story without alienating the movie goer who has not yet read the books. I did notice Christopher Lee's Saruman missing from this film. I have read that this was done for a number of reasons not the least of which is time as another 30 minutes would have to be included. Apparently this will be available on the special extended DVD to be released in Winter 2004. It does not however effect the fluidity or rhythm of the movie. You won't mind. Visually the cinematography in this production has to be a lock for the 2004 major awards. And that is before Cold Mountain has come to cinemas. Simply terrific to watch from start to the famous end. I have only given 22 movies to date a perfect 10/10, and this is the 23rd. The Lord of the Rings is now complete leaving me with only one question... When do we get the honor of The Hobbit! :)
10.0~There are no words to describe... Bulleon Sign in Permalink How superb 'The Return of the King' is. It is the ultimate fantasy film and a sure bet for all the film awards this year. Director Peter Jackson has achieved the impossible, to make this trilogy and make it so that Tolkien fans will be pleased with it in comparison to the book. The special effects are amazingly good, the actors (Sean Astin who play Samwise Gamgee particularly) are fabulous in their roles and the plot is unflawed, representing the book perfectly. There are parts left out but this was always to be expected. Peter Jackson, on first editing the film had a 6 hour long film that he was happy with. Now, although us Lord of the Rings fans may have been more than happy to sit through that, I don't think others would have been! So inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been taken out. But what we are left with is a film that works perfectly and is a masterpiece. Undoubtedly there will be plenty of extra footage on the extended DVD and so we'll just have to wait for that to see the film in its entirety. It's, arguably and in my own opinion, the best of the three films and one that fans and just movie-goers will love. It's got action, romance and an ending that leaves us satisfied and wanting to see it again and again. Go and see it now!
10.0~Lord Of The Rings IS The Greatest Film Ever Made ilovejeanrollin Sign in Permalink The only thing that must be said is : Thank you, Peter Jackson!You're the Greatest.... A Special Achievement Award must be created to honor all the people involved in the creation of this Masterpiece of Cinema! For the moment, honor them by seeing this RETURN OF THE KING over and over again in theaters...
7.0~A Symphony of the Senses dreyson Sign in Permalink One important thing to keep in mind when watching The Return of the King, is that like all the other Lord of the Rings theatrical releases, this is not quite the complete and finished product. The final part of the trilogy moves at a much faster pace than the previous two chapters and although it makes for exciting viewing, you somehow do feel there are some scenes ssing, especially if you're familiar with the story. Luckily, most of the people (myself included) who have come to care about the series have learnt to accept this fact about the theatrical versions and are able to enjoy them as a cinematic experience, which is definitely what you get with this finale. The Return of the King is like a three hour climax in which almost every scene is imbued with a sense of impending resolution for the better or worse of Middle Earth. `The board is set, the pieces are moving' Gandalf explains to Pippin, as the penultimate conflict for the fate of a world is about to begin in front of your eyes. The emotional intensity and drama witnessed on screen would not be out place in a Wagnerian opera, but it is complemented by some of the most epic sights ever beheld in cinema. The battle on the Pelennor Fields is like nothing seen before and even if many of the super wide shots of the armies are noticeably computer generated, they are nonetheless very impressive on the merit of their ambitiousness alone. It seems that when the heart and mind are not being engaged, the senses are being assaulted, so that not a moment of the 3h 12 min feels wasted. All the main actors have by now confidently settled into their roles and their character's development is really embodied through their performance. It's remarkable how these protagonist have transformed over the ten and a half hour course of these movies, compared to when we first meet them in The Fellowship of the Ring. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens especially need to be commended for giving all the important characters that kind of substantiality, by paying attention to the personal journeys taken and showing the genuine growth undergone by each of them. In technical terms The Return of the King is undeniably the most accomplished film in the trilogy. All the post production and art departments really present their best work of the series here, from the special effects, the costume designs, through to the breathtaking miniatures. The cinematography is especially noteworthy, experimenting with unconventional, exciting points of view and subtle colour grading that help to deliver even more memorable shots than in the first two movies. A word also has to be said about the music, because it has been the backbone of the trilogy in many ways. Howard Shore has brilliantly captured the depth and scope of Tolkien's world since the first soundtrack and has developed this vision from movie to movie creating a film score magnum opus. He has been particularly successful in rendering the operatic epic-ness of The Lord of the Rings and this characteristic truly comes to shine in the third instalment. It must be remembered, that an essential contributing factor for the success of this final part is the effectiveness of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers to generate the level of anticipation and narrative tension, that makes the climax so emotionally involving and rewarding. The sense of closure is in every respect satisfying and considered as one creative achievement from beginning to end, it becomes clear what a cinematic triumph the trilogy really is. It has become the film event of our generation, with all three among the top ten highest grossing movies of all time and the popular passion with which they all have been received. The Return of the King sets a new benchmark for the fantasy/adventure genre and The Lord of the Rings has given new meaning to the concept of epic filmmaking. It has arguably become the best trilogy of them all. A title it will deservedly keep for a very long time.
10.0~I was satisfied!!! tonkel21 Sign in Permalink I am usually not satisfied with movies because I believe that they are going to be great and they usually are not (The Phantom Menace, Matrix Revolutions). This movie was as good as I thought it was going to be and even surpassed my expectations. The acting and the cinematography were superb and although the movie was long, it went too quickly. I cannot wait to go back and watch it again.
1.0~We wants a good film! davefinlay2000 Sign in Permalink What an over-rated pile of toss! OOoooooooooh look at the effects! Oooooooh Gollum is so real! Ooooooooooh I'd love to have long blond hair and pointy ears! SHUT UP YOU FOOLS!!!!!! Why can't people just watch excellent films and appreciate them instead of being tossed around by the wild current of sensationalism and hype. All three of the films were, at best, average adaptations of the book but just because this is the last one, it gets the highest rating. It's a travesty that rubbish like this overtakes actual classic films on an otherwise excellent database. And don't get me started on Star Wars. This is fantastic nonsense. Over produced and under thought. Bad Taste is a far superior film. Stick with Schlock horror Jackson...and learn how to tie a tie!
8.0~***1/2/4 ufo0001 Sign in Permalink Pros: Great battle scenes, good score and directing. Cons: A bit too long, too many conclusions. Jackson's trilogy comes to a close with this nearly 4 hr spectacle (which is exceeded with the special edition) that serves as a great closer to the entire epic. Loose ends are tied and multiple conclusions are handled in a way that will please both casual viewers and fans. This outing is the best out of the lot, and Jackson proves that the third time is a charm after a somewhat lackluster second outing. For once, Howard Shore's score does not disappoint and the actions scenes aroused me for the first time since the troll sequence in film one. Did the movie deserve to win every Oscar it was nominated for? Yes, for it was recognition for what the filmmakers had accomplished with all three films, and no, for the fact that it wasn't the best movie of the year. Conclusion: Great but Jackson can do better
1.0~Ugh! this movie was too awful for words! Stewartjimmy Sign in Permalink The third Lord of the Rings movie was absolutely painful to watch. Even worse than the second one, it had me cringing and groaning all the way through; and not because of any empathy for the characters, but simply because the acting, the scripting, and the everything was so . . . so - so - so. . . stupid. And that is quite the word I was looking for. (Beauty and the Beast). Arwen makes me so mad for appearing at all the wrong times and far too frequently. It's all very well to say "director's privilege to change parts of the novel" and all right, I'm fine with that privilege, but it can be taken too far!!!!! Arwen only appears twice throughout the books, and her character is only established in the appendix. J. R. R. Tolkien is most likely turning in his grave, or at least frowning furiously from afar, as he watches these mutilations of his wonderful trilogy. And when Denethor jumped off the pyre, I almost died laughing . . . and I don't think that was the reaction Peter Jackson was aiming for. Ah well, disappointment comes in all shapes and sizes, and the biggest disappointment of my life came in the form of a movie called The Return of the King.
10.0~The Best Movie ever made kaihui Sign in Permalink Never, never has one movie touched me so much that I cried hard after I got up this morning just thinking about it. Yes, this movie is this good. What set this movie apart from any other movies in the human history is not just the stunning storytelling, the simply extraordinary CG work, the breathtaking cinematography, the overwhelming music, the great, great acting, it's the fact that this movie combines them all and have so much, so much heart and soul! The theme of this movie is courage, love and friendship. What touches me most is the incredible courage the characters have shown. When terribly out-numbered horsemen charging down the hill to the sea of Orcas, the courage is in their hearts; when Frodo drags his wounded body, crawling on the evil land of mordor with determination, the courage is in his eyes; when Eowyn standing in front of the most feared creature in middle-earth with her fearless eyes, the courage is in her sword... So many times they face the impossible, every time they carried on believing, "There is something in this world that is worth fighting for", and they did it when everything seems hopeless, they did it with their blood and tears. I realize why the battles scenes are so good. Yes of course they are the biggest battles scenes you will ever seen in the movie history, but never has a battle seems so human. You feel for them, you can feel their pain, their fear, their despair, yet they fight on. They are so human, the best kind of human. You may say, why do you get this excited, it's just a movie. Let me tell you my friend, this is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't say this lightly, since over the years, I have seen many good movies. But this movie is not just a movie, it's journey to the land of good and evil, hope and despair, it's journey that you feel that you are one of the soldiers fighting, and you are right there standing with Frodo and Sam by the mountain of doom, you shed the tears and blood right there in the middle earth with them. It's a journey 3 and 1/2 hours too short.
4.0~Fantasy is not my cup of tea eddie_olsen Sign in Permalink I have problems appreciating this film. All that weeping! I can't remember crying so much when I was a teenager. Nor did I call my friends Mr. this and that. Where did Sam get that from? Tolkien seems to be inspired by sagas like the Norwegian Viking sagas (Snorre's Kongesagaer) I read at school. These sagas tell the tale of brave kings and not of depressed and psychological unbalanced kids. As mentioned in one of my other reviews, I have grown tired of computer animations. I found it interesting in 2003, but my fascination has somewhat faded over the past years. I have no problem understanding teenagers fascination with this film. Star Wars was a big thing in my youth. Maybe this film wasn't meant for me...
10.0~Biggest Movie of All Time Jonathan_Bizerra Sign in Permalink Most movies we watch can be seen once and there is no reason to watch them again. The sheer scale of this epic gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.
10.0~Oh my god, i think i droped a tear. Jabbadoor Sign in Permalink So thats it then. Our journey through Middle Earth has drawn to a Close, and it´s time to sit back and reflect on what it has left us with. I for one had looked forward to this series, since i heard it was Due, and i must say that my expectations has been met on ALMOST every count. I will not go into Details on the plot in this thread, due to the fact that so many of you guys havent seen it yet (But you will of course shortly ;-) ) Peter Jackson has achieved a Milestone in Filmmaking, that multiple times has been awarded for its outstanding, and Groundbreaking new Techniches. Awards FULLY deserved. Of the Cast i would Like to point out Sean Astin. He really grows throughout the movies and fully matures in the last instalment of the Trilogy. All in All, For RotK: Ten thumbs up. I loved it. (Cant Wait for SE) As for the Series: About Bloody Time!! :-)
10.0~The most amazing film I've ever seen! spb251272 Sign in Permalink I cannot stress enough how good this film is. As an ending to the trilogy, it's as near to perfect as I think you could get (although I can't wait for the Extended Edition). Peter Jackson has had to try to please everyone from the casual moviegoer, to the die hard fan of the books. I don't see how he could have done a better job at pleasing most of the people most of the time. This is the first film since Braveheart where my breath literally has been taken away! There are so many profound and sad parts in the film, and they seem so true to the books, it was to me just as if I was "seeing" the books. I had a particularly large lump in my throat when Frodo left to go to the Undying Lands. I know there are omissions and additions to the books, however you could not ever put those three books directly onto film. For the people that are complaining about certains missing bits, or certain additions, you should just be grateful that somebody was capable of producing such faithful and amazing films, and enjoy them again and again. I really hope that Peter Jackson will be taking up the project of filming The Hobbit.
10.0~AMAZING cleric_01 Sign in Permalink Truly one of the greatest movies of all time. Peter Jackson is a god among men, and needs Oscar gold more than anyone else nominated this year. Easily the best picture of 2003. Let's hope the academy makes a good decision when handing out best picture and best director.
10.0~Mr. Jackson -- take a bow. You more than deserve to. lambiepie-2 Sign in Permalink In my lifetime so far, the best films ever made, of all time were done such as: The Godfather, Part I The Original "Star Wars" The Original "Raiders of the Lost Ark" The Original "Psycho" The Original "The Exorcist" ...and more... And a whole host of others before my lifetime...and guess what!?!? I am happy to say I am glad I was alive and one of the first to see "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring", "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and "Lord of the Rings, Return of the King". This last installment, was THE most brilliant and wonderful film I've ever seen in a long time. I am NOT going to give any spoilers or any information about the move for this is a movie everyone needs to see on the big screen at least once. The only pet-peeve? It is over 3 hours and I know theater owners are at a loss to run "Intermissions" but this is one film that should make them reconsider. People didn't WANT to miss a second of this film and were squirming in their seats...but didn't get up! This film was THAT excellent, to risk bladder control!! Oh.... in the theater: people clapped, people screamed, people jumped, people cried. (And no, I was not at a Magic Johnson Theater presentation, but I wish I was, I bet those audiences went CRAZY!!!) It has been such a long time to see this in a theater...the real reactions of an audience who were so moved by entertainment so grand, so wonderful...so EPIC in this day and time. Oscar voters, take note. If this film doesn't win this year for "Best Picture", there WILL be a riot. You cannot deny it this time. You just CAN'T!!!!! I hear Mr. Jackson's next venture is a remake of the classic "King Kong". Interesting choice but.... don't worry, I'm already standing in line and waiting for that one too. An Excellent film that will last the ages....a ten out of ten.
8.0~A satisfying and compelling end to the journey FilmOtaku Sign in Permalink If I wasn't a Lord of the Rings convert before this film, The Return of the King surely cemented my belief that if a film is good enough, even my stubborn preferences and opinions can be swayed. Hell, it didn't just prove this fact, The Return of the King was so good that this statement can practically be etched into stone tablets and not be displayed in front of government buildings. I had the distinct pleasure of seeing the extended versions of the first two installments in the theater in the ten days leading up to the day The Return of the King was released, a first for me, as I had not yet seen either of them on the big screen. Not only did I see these films in the theater, but I saw them with real fans of the films, which made the experience a lot more fun and interesting for me, and was just one of the many factors that made me truly excited to see the final installment the morning it was released. Only a fantastic film could create this kind of excitement in me  not only did the film have two strikes against it for the hype and for being a fantasy film, but was additionally handicapped by my stubborn inability to remember the character names and back stories. Yet I still walked out of the film in a daze because I was so in awe of its superior quality. Peter Jackson, who I have admired on a small level since seeing `Heavenly Creatures', continues to amaze me. Where did this guy come from? To go from making small, interesting and fairly weird films to directing the biggest blockbuster trilogy since `Star Wars' and doing it THIS WELL simply amazes me. I say this with the greatest reverence and admiration as the most cynical and probably pickiest `film person' I personally know. Another factor that stuck out for me was the acting. Look at most big budget blockbuster action films and pay attention to the acting. If you respond with `What acting?' that is pretty much the best way to describe most action films. For example, when I went back and saw the re-release of the Star Wars Trilogy in the theater, I was dismayed and amused at the same time by the terrible acting. The Lord of the Rings trilogy does not suffer from poor acting; rather it is enhanced by the good acting of its principals. I think the enormous number of characters and therefore lower amount of screen time than other nominees may prevent an Oscar win for acting, but if The Return of the King or Peter Jackson is shut out for this film I will be very surprised. I rarely support the huge films for Oscar wins, but I have a feeling that 2004 will be a well-deserved exception. The Return of the King is definitely in my top ten favorite films of 2003 and is only second to `Kill Bill Vol. 1' as my favorite action film of the year, words that I never thought I would be saying and words that could only be said because Peter Jackson has provided such an exquisite and superb film. --Shelly
10.0~summary of LOTR: Return of the King hvenus07 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: Return of the king is a striking, powerful and beautiful film, with an amazing storyline. This is the final journey for the Fellowship of the ring to complete their mission through battle, passion and love. I believe in this film, this is where the true relationships of the characters start to form and become strong and meaningful. Without spoiling the film for you, I will now talk about the soundtrack. For me, the soundtrack is at the heart of this film. It is filled with so much emotion, I even get teary when listening to it. A brilliant soundtrack along with an amazing story means you get an excellent film. I definitely recommend everyone to watch this, although this film requires full concentration, so perhaps only watch it when you have time, to get the best experience.
9.0~"But we will meet them in battle nonetheless." socraticirony54 Sign in Permalink I think the vast majority of people who have seen and love the LOTR trilogy fell in love with it from the get go with the 1st film TFOTR. I, however, wasn't so sure when I first saw the Fellowship. I enjoyed it, yes, but elements of that film left me somewhat disappointed and in particular my preconceived feeling of what its general tone would/should be like wasn't satisfied. Now, some years on, as the proud owner of the special extended edition dvds I can announce that the series has grown on me somewhat and I find all three movies an immensely satisfying experience to sit through. I could criticize the Return of the King in a nit-picking manner, it is far from perfect, but as we all know, nothing is perfect. What appeals to me most in this film is its beautiful nature, which will shine through for many years to come. And isn't the nature of things that which truly matters. Themetically strong, and new to the series, emotionally powerful, ROTK is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy. Never have I witnessed the theme of death dealt with in such a positive manner, which works for me, although it's true I'm not on my way to A&E as I write this. Congratulations to Mr Jackson and all involved in the making of this trilogy and the bringing to life of Middle Earth. Their efforts have produced something special. Lastly, although ROTK would narrowly miss out on my top 5, probably pushed out by Luke's Cool Hand (see what I did there?), I'm delighted to see it ranked #2 here on IMDb.
10.0~Totally worth it. marciayian Sign in Permalink I am 21 years old and I've recently watched the whole trilogy of LOTR. I don't really like films of this kind (action in an ancient-fantastic world, ex. GOT) but I found this movie fascinating. As a college student in AudioVisual Arts, I can't imagine the amount of work this project had in post-production in effects, given the fact that we talk about a period of time when digital cameras weren't professionally used (2003). The costumes were amazing and the fight scenes were extremely good. From my personal experience, this movie is the best in its kind.
10.0~A stunning finale wielderofspoons Sign in Permalink I've read the book version of ROTK several times before FOTR was released in 2001, and following the success of FOTR, and my mixed reactions to TTT, I braced myself for negative feelings towards Jackson's version of ROTK. But my bad expectations for ROTK soon evaporated as the simply amazing battle for Middle Earth unfolded on the big screen before me. Virtually nothing as been left sparse, special attention has been payed by Jackson and his team in every respect. The acting is superb, especially Ian McKellen's benevolent yet mighty Gandalf and Andy Serkis's evil, plotting Gollum. The special effects are nothing short of stunning, as huge Oliphaunts plough through waves of charging horsemen, as Trolls smash through gates and walls, as catapults launch massive boulders at whole squads of men and as the Eye of Sauron explodes at the end of the final clash. Of course, it wasn't all perfect in ROTK. I wish King Theoden had at least a mention after his death, if nothing else. And having Denethor as a crazed maniac from the start seemed poor and simplified to me. Some more information on the character's lives after the defeat of Sauron would be cool too, though I can understand why some of it was cut out. Still, I felt disappointed that so many of the battles were dependant on CGI fighting. But overall, I can overlook those minor faults, as this movie is a great ending to a great trilogy that is on par with Star Wars, The Godfather, and all the other all-time greats. Congratulations to Peter Jackson and all the cast and crew!
10.0~Brilliant. Now bring on the extended edition ... John K.-2 Sign in Permalink Excellent film, fantastic, unbelievable. And yet I can't wait for the extended edition, because I saw Two Towers: Extended Edition a few days ago, and it became so obvious that much was cut from the original movie just to save time, not for the good of the story. The extended editiion is a more well rounded experience -- more on the Boromir/Faramir/Denethor background, more on Aragorn & Eowyn, more one liners from Gimli the dwarf, a scene from the Old Forest journey (missed out of film 1) transferred to Fangorn, and we see Tolkien's tremendous concept of the living Fangorn forest moving to Helm's Deep and swallowing fleeing orcs. Why can't we get an (possibly optional) extended edition on DVD of all severely cut movies? I can think of many that would have been improved that way. Just one criticism of ROTK: the scenes of Gollum fighting thin air look a bit contrived. Can we have a scene interspersed where Frodo in Ring-spooky-land finds himself struggling with Gollum, to get the feeling of the climactic fight better? Thanks, Peter, for doing this.
8.0~A Elbereth Gilthoniel! tjw-9 Sign in Permalink After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring I thought "nice try". I appreciated the effort and integrity with which Peter Jackson had approached Tolkien but I couldn't quite see it as agreeing with my vision of what the movie should be, although I did enjoy it. I am a Tolkien fan and have been decades and collectively we are not an easy bunch to please. Tolkien himself, I think, would not have been very easy to please. I gave The Fellowship of the Ring three stars out of four. The Two Towers moved more quickly but sacrificed what is to me the essence of the Lord of the Rings: the humanity, if one may call it that, of the hobbits and the quiet contemplation of the natural wonders of Middle Earth - the flowers, the trees, the grass. But I have to admit that a movie which tried to explore those aspects of the novel would have been almost impossible to film. Nonetheless, as with the first movie in the trilogy I did enjoyed watching it. Again, three stars out of four. And so, to the Return of the King. Like its predecessors it is flawed but - YES! finally the series takes flight. Though using the latest in computer animation this film is a return to the great days of film-making past. The battle sequences are of epic proportions and the acting, particularly of Miranda Otto as Eoywn and Sean Astin as Sam, lifts the movie into another emotional level. The film is not as faithful to the details of the book as the first two parts but it is entirely faithful to the spirit. Like the winged Nazgul the film soars and carries us with it through excitement, laughter and tears. Without wishing to reveal the ending let me just say that during the penultimate scene, at the Grey Havens, the crowded theatre I was in was hushed: the audience was lost in the movie. The only sound you could hear was an occasional quiet throat-clearing as some person decided that it had suddenly become a necessity. Four stars out of four. It is a masterpiece that will be enjoyed for generations to come. Many thanks to Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew who have given us this Christmas present. It was a labour of love for all concerned and it shows. The Academy Award belongs to this film, to Jackson as director, to Howard Shore for a fantastic score and to Sean Astin for turning in one of the most moving portrayals of friendship in film history.
10.0~Outstanding ! daren-760-638711 Sign in Permalink On every level (acting, photography, sound, costumes, direction and plot) you are absorbed into the story. It is as fresh today as the day I saw it in the Cinema and has yet to be bettered in it's genre. You as the audience believe that the actors aren't merely reciting the dialogue but have become each character they represent. Peter Jackson could so have easily followed the blockbuster formula to conclude the film with an epic battle, but we are respected as fellow members of the story/crew and given the entirety of the story. Though it completes the story I was very unhappy it had to end as you want to know what happens next over all the leading characters lifetimes. This is a totally outstanding epic which will be enjoyed for decades to come.
10.0~To Amazing, To Unbeliveable, To Long! Memento_10 Sign in Permalink I'm a huge fan on 'The Lord of The Rings' and it seems as each movie in the series just keeps getting better and better unlike 'The Matrix' series which seems to get worse and worse by the movies. I saw this movie and was amazed by the special effects. I swear if this movie doesn't win an 'oscar' or 'golden globe' I'm going to be P***ED! If you loved the first two LOTR films then you'll love 'The Return of The King'. But, I will warn you this movie goes on and on. Near the end of this movie you'll think the movie is over. Well your going to be wrong. I give this movie a 10/10 for special effects. And the movie itself would also have a ten but due to it being a little bit to long I give it a 91\2/10
10.0~lord of the rings three footballsafety34 Sign in Permalink you guys, vote 10, come on, this was by far the greatest battle scene movie in 2004 and the S.E. were amazing. If you do not vote 10 you should be in a mental institution. Secondly, the video shots were spectacular, with flying over the new Zealand landscape. it was like you were there. i think that this movie tops all other lo tr movies in a landslide. Next, the script was amazing. the dialog was wonderful with the old words and the combination of the new words was quite spectacular. But because this is a spoiler, when Frodo walks up to Mount Doom and throws the ring in, supposedly, and gloom walks up and attacks him, i mean come on, that volcano is awesome. Well, i hope you liked my review, i know i liked writing it, go buy it, all four, including the original with Bilbo, and keep them, they make the best video games, and by far the most fun to watch, thank you and good day.
10.0~DVD's, Theatre releases and Oscars NotTheOne000 Sign in Permalink Just a note to film watchers, especially to fans of the book. This movie, along with all the other LoTR theatre movies, is not the finished item. Jackson knows what works well in box office terms and has crafted the cinema release of this film for the average cinema goer. The completed film that is designed to please die hard fans and film buffs has not yet been finished, and will not be released until November 2003. As a result, those who know the story well will feel bits are missing, and those who understand the art of editing may feel that scenes do not run together as well as they might. I am starting to wonder if perhaps the idea that the 'best film' award at the Oscars should be constrained to theatre movies is soon to become out-dated. With movies increasingly using alternative media to fill out the cinematic release (and not just as a way to make money), perhaps it is time to start considering DVD releases and movie concepts. For example the Matrix trilogy is supplemented with TV shorts and video games, which add to the story and the depth of the film. OK, it may not have worked too well in the end, but it won't be the last or best of its type. Maybe there should be a separate award for everything that a movie encompasses; a sort of 'multi-media concept' or 'best movie event' or something. This could judge theatre release AND DVD version, as well as well as looking at the use of the video games to compliment the film and use of TV features to expand the storyline. With the video game industry now outgrowing the movie industry and with the new innovations that are revolutionising the way we understand the movie experience it seems a shame to limit the appreciation of a cultural item such as LoTR solely to what appears on the silver screen.
10.0~Great ending to a great trilogy. anti-imperialist1194 Sign in Permalink A superb job done by Peter Jackson and the rest of the cast and crew members. Every movie in the trilogy was phenomenal. I guarantee that it will win Best Picture. If it doesn't then I will never watch the Oscars again. This movie made me cry 3 times. Yes I said 3. It was that good. Be prepared to cry if you are going to see this movie. If you don't then you have lost all emotions that you have in your brain. Don't be afraid to see this movie if you're not a nerd like I am. I know tons of jocks, cool guys, and other dudes that like this film. You might not want to cry if you are one of those guys though, because that would make you a nerd. 10/10. Like I said, a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy.
8.0~Fantastic (of course) pokemon_trainer_lucas Sign in Permalink It will no doubt be a timeless classic that people will watch for generations to come! It is action packed, fantasy filled and thoroughly exciting. A must see for any fantasy fan.
10.0~Simply Amazing william_sanjaya Sign in Permalink I love the way they show the storyline of this film. with amazing vfx and the combination of amazing cast and beautiful storyline. really love every part of the story.
10.0~Peter Jackson is God r-bredow Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson set out to turn a great book into an epic movie in doing this he has surpassed my wildest dream and produce the greatest film trilogy ever. Filled with suspense, action and a dramatic end that will touch your heart and bring tears to your eyes THE LORD OF THE RINGS - THE RETURN OF THE KING is the best movie ever made.
9.0~Just missed greatness isleofdawn Sign in Permalink This movie was absolutely fantastic - until it went on too long. The ending was seemingly eternal because it just wasn't that good. I have sat through longer movies and enjoyed them. It wasn't the length that bothered me, it was the content of the end. I was prepared to vote it a 10, but alas a 9 is what it gets. And I am sorry for that because the first three hours were pure magic.
9.0~great movie! divyangparmar35 Sign in Permalink Lord of the ring movie is one of the best movies! it's great. wonderful to watch! great fighting scenes. great action. acting is good. fun.. great story. awesome movie must watch movie one of the best series ever made!the great thing in the movie is that we don't get bored while watching it! its a really long movie .. still i love to watch it!

The elf who is two minded is great to watch! its a really good must watch the movie! movie makes us laugh , fill adventure , great action and in the last great performance by all actor! great animation too. it a really good movie to watch! different creature is designed well.
8.0~The crown jewel of the trilogies! gromit-17 Sign in Permalink After a refresh course for the part I and II on DVDs last week, I was prepared for the final installment. I have to say that the first two and half hours are nothing short of magnificent visual feast (surpass the previous two with stunning and breath-taking sequences such as City of Gondor, the Beckon towers, and the Battle of the Pelennor) yet surprisingly with attention to characters. Few of my favorites are Theoden ,King of Rohan (probably the most dramatic transformation in the trilogies and his ending brought tears to my eyes), Eowyn (you go, girl!), and Gollum/Smeagol (it provides most of the suspense for Frodo and Sam's journey and for the movie, and it's disappointing that Peter Jackson didn't give him a chance of redemption at the end when redemption is a repeated theme through out the movie.) I'm glad that I've never read the book and am not boxed in how the story should' be told. Personally, I felt the movie fell a bit flat at the end. It would be perfect to end the movie at the crowning on a high note (which reflects its title properly  the return of the King) but it drags on into an overly sentimental, anti-climax epilogue.
9.0~Go See This Film ! MGabbard Sign in Permalink *** Possible Spoilers *** Go see this film. Mr. Jackson has successfully, and sometimes incredibly, pulled off something that many thought was impossible. He, with the help of an extremely talented crew of actors, designers, craftsmen, artisans, and more; has brought the Lord of the Rings to the screen in a way that does more justice to Mr. Tolkien's epic story than has been attempted. Anyone who has read the books knows that to bring every detail to the screen could have taken a trilogy dedicated to each book and still some things would have to have been left out. And you have to grant Mr. Jackson some creative leave to add his own touches. But I have to applaud Mr. Jackson for expertly piecing the story lines together in such a fashion as to make this a very entertaining, and gripping set of films. Go see this film. As for The Return of the King, is it the best of the three? I don't think anyone will be able to accurately compare it to the first two until its final extended form is released on DVD - hopefully before next November. I think many people that have expressed disappointment still have the extended versions of the first two films fresh in their heads. It this theatrical version, quite a lot of things have been cut from the story - just as in the other two films. Don't believe me? Go read the first reviews of the other films here on IMDB.com. The way many of the scenes abruptly end, and the 'false endings' a lot of people are talking about tells me that the extended version of this film is going to be Mr. Jackson's redemption in the eyes of many of his critics just as the extended versions of the other two films have been. You'll get your showdown Saruman, you'll get your expanded Legolas and Gimli, you'll get a better winding down and parting of friends, you'll most likely get your Arwen and Faramir romance, you'll get more of Sean Astin's Oscar-worthy performance, and I hope you'll get Theoden's funeral, and more on the new bonds between Rohan and Gondor as well. Go see this film. If you are a Tolkien loyalist, take it for what is presented at this point and don't worry about what's missing, I am confident Mr. Jackson will make it up to you next November. If you haven't read the books - you need to. There is so much richness, depth, detail, and beauty in this story that no matter how good the extended version ultimately is it will never be 'perfect'. This adaptation (especially in it's extended DVD versions) will go down as one of, if not the, greatest movie trillogies of all time. Go see this film.
10.0~GREATEST MOVIE OF THE MELLENIUM bacchus_dan Sign in Permalink LOTR Return Of The Kings is the best movie i have seen in a very long time. It definately beats the other two movies of the series. The intense action scenes and sad points in this film had me on the edge of my seat crying then hooting and hollering. I didn't move from my position once. It was as if i was immersed in the movie. Peter Jackson did an amazing job with this one. Amazing graphics(If you watch the first one they weren't as good as the second or even third), wicked story, awesome scenery, and some nice women to look at(j/k) made this movie my all time favourite. Reading the books also intensify your love for the collection though, I highly suggest you read them. In short, as stated above, LOTR Return of the King was the greatest movie of the millenium. For anyone who likes/loves LOTR: If you havn't already, GO SEE IT NOW!
10.0~Best movie of all time! Seinfeldfan06 Sign in Permalink I have thought about this since the first time i saw the Lord of the rings (the return of the king 2003) why is this movie not number 1 on IMDb it was three for the longest time and recently just dropped to number four everybody who voted for this movie should have given it a 10 (excellent) there should not have been one person on IMDb who should have given this movie a 2 or lower. This is my favorite movie of all time and also it should be everybody's else's favorite movie of all time. Plus it had a great director (peter Jackson) who had also done King Kong (2005) which was also a great movie i think everyone else should agree with me that this was one of the best movie's ever made.
10.0~Breathtaking dominic-stevens Sign in Permalink Every scene jumps from the screen, be it mountains - cities - battles - or emotions, from the very begining right through to the music for the credits. I laughed, cried, jumped in my seat and fell in love and didn't mind who noticed. This will be watched again. Thanks
10.0~The lord of the films angawa Sign in Permalink A truly unforgettable experience, this movie is not only the satisfying conclusion to one of the most courageous productions in cinema history, but it has also fixed a new standard of quality that all epic movies in the future will have to consider. Even if considered only as an action-adventure experience, ROTK is almost perfect and really breathtaking (battle of the Pelennor is outstanding... Ride now! Ride to ruin and the world's ending! Death!); but I think (and the Academy thought it too, I see)it is more than that. It's not mere fantasy: it's human drama in a fantasy setting. Surely this film is so unique because Tolkien's book was (I mean, is) unique and absolutely amazing, plus it is so near to perfection in all its aspects (acting, directing, editing, music, special effects, etc.). The actors are the hearth of this movie - they're all good, and some (Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Bernard Hill) really are outstanding. Some (many) people criticize Jackson for the many differences between the movie and the book, but you must consider than a movie is a different media then a book and has different priorities. Peter Jackson may have changed many events of the books, and erased many characters, but in most cases he was forced to do that in order to make a movie worth of the novel, even if somehow different. Sometimes, being unfaithful to Tolkien, Jackson manages to improve, as a cinematic experience, the story. For example, Faramir's ride isn't shown in the book as it is in the film, but Peter Jackson made it so good, that it is one of the better pieces of the whole Lotr, and shall be remembered in cinema history. Pippin's song in that sequence is in fact from the book, but it has a totally different position, and a very different aim (in the book, it's a normal hobbit-song, not the moving, sad song seen, I mean heard, in the movie). Also the siege of Minas Tirith, including the battle of Pelennor fields, is quite different from the book, but it is probably the finest and most spectacular war sequence ever seen in a movie so far. And if you think that Peter Jackson didn't care about the novel and Tolkien, ask yourself why The Return of The King didn't end with the marriage between Aragorn and Arwen (a happy, classic Hollywood ending), instead of a nearly 20 minutes long sequence that many (maybe most of the) viewers found too long and boring, but that I think is a mature ending to the trilogy, and really close to the book, especially in its tone. I really like Tolkien's Lotr, as a book, and I equally, maybe even more, like Peter Jackson's Lotr as a movie. However, as the book, it has many detractors. Perhaps there are people who simply don't like fantasy - in which case I respect their opinion, but I'd like them to remember that a movie isn't a documentary nor a history lesson, but it's art, and fantasy is the blood of art. Surely, everyone has the right to like or dislike a movie, as any other thing; but, if you really don't like Lotr, maybe you should ask yourself if you like cinema...
9.0~A true crown on Peter Jackson's excellent work. l_n_e_d Sign in Permalink No need to loose oneself into saying what others already have said: yes, this movie is a true crown on Peter Jackson's excellent work on the trilogy. But more important: why? First of all this film just seems to be the perfect blend of digital animation and an outstanding cast 'slash' story-line. It does not overdose with the usual Hollywood 'blah blah', 'gna gna' or 'bang bang' nor does it try to numb you with too many, too heavy special effects (cough*matrix*cough)... After all, there is no emptiness to hide and just like the other two episodes this long movie seems to fly by and keeps you interested and excited the whole 3,5 hour ride. Secondly, the story line is kept very close to the original (only once in a while the director took some liberties) and starts where it left us in the second episode and hardly gives you any time to catch up with the story, so if you forgot or haven't seen the second part make sure you do before going to this last episode. Moreover, the world that is created is so convincing and breathtaking that even if fantasy movies just aren't your thing it will blow you away with the beautiful scenery, the overwhelming scale of the panoramic views and the splendid quality of the animations. Particularly the massive battles on one side and the subtle movements of Gollum on the other is something that shows how digital animation can be a remarkable addition to movies and if it's done well, you will even forget that it's there. So if you want to see a real '10 out of 10' don't miss this one: it's a blast beyond doubt.
10.0~Beauty and Vision together dreadfire-1 Sign in Permalink Not many movies can make a movie proud when coming from a book, but this is an exception. It has power and beauty throughout the movie. The acting is breathtaking. The amount of emotion within this movie is more than combining all the current movies out.
10.0~Epic movie with wonderful story-line h810626952 Sign in Permalink I do like to see the movie like this style, the director J.R.R. Tolkien and the writer both present us a vivid, magnificent virtual world. In the eye of Bilbo Baggins, I was traveled this world with my indulged mood in the whole time. The story-line is perfect. All of people has its own greedy, in this movie, it represent to one thing and one thing only, the ring. After seeing this movie, it tell us how to over come your desire and finish your own destiny. If we all like Frodo Baggins, we can achieve our many goals, I was touched with the honorable mission, the friendship, and the determination. With so many character, we can remember everyone after seeing the movie and the picture. Overall, it is a great movie that hard to come up with. Epic movie with wonderful story-line. I gave it 10 point without a doubt.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings ityja Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings, in my opinion are the best films ever made, and nothing comes close to them .The acting is beautiful , the scenery is magnificent. The directing is full of passion and love. Altogether this has made 3 wonderful movies. They have so many levels, so many depths,full of magic, journeys of love, friendship and leading to the compassion and good of a fellowship of men defeating the evil powers of middle earth. They will make you laugh,smile and cry.Altogether they truly are such powerful and enchanting movies. I am so glad that the entire team got the recognition and applause they deserved, for they truly are the most magnificent movies.
10.0~A truly magical end to the best trilogy of all time... james_norman1981 Sign in Permalink As my summary suggests I enjoyed this movie and reckon that it is a fine conclusion to the best trilogy of all time. There may be some debate on this but LOTR gets my vote for many reasons. What makes this movie so good? Put simply, LOTR was made with such composite love and skill that it is simply unbeatable. One can only imagine what is was like on set, by which I mean the entirety of New Zealand. The cast must have become more than just a group of employees. The production team, who were all united behind their visionary director, must have offered such care and attention to every factor of all three movies that it would've been heartbreaking to say goodbye to some of the props, let alone the whole process. All this, combined with so able a director, created a fantastic trilogy with its thrilling conclusion. And what of the film (and I shall be talking about the Extended Editions rather than the theatrical releases)? Well The Two Towers ended with the defeat of Saruman's Urukai and their subsequent slaughter while Sam and Frodo, set free by Faramir after he'd captured them en route to Mount Doom, are on their way back to Sauron's layer, unknowingly being led by Gollum who has returned to dominate poor Smeagol's mind. A brief aside: if none of this makes sense to you you're reading the wrong review! So what happens next? Put simply: the great battle of their times... Having seen Saruman killed by Grima Wormtongue, who was subsequently shot by Legolas, Theoden, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, Pippin and Gandalf return to Edoras, the latter in possession of Saruman's palantir. The heroes have just won a glorious battle but have by no means concluded the war. Sauron's forces in Mordor are far in excess of what Saruman had available and no one is sure quite where the evil demigod has his eye set upon. Enter Pippin who, true to form, decides to try and mess everything up by looking into the palantir and potentially telling Sauron all about Frodo and the dark lord's ring... Very fortunately, for the good guys, Pippin doesn't give anything away and instead gathers vital intelligence about Sauron's target... Gondor, the city of the King. All becomes clear (relatively). Gandalf, along with Pippin, must go to Gondor to warn them of their doom and get the defences prepared while the rest of the heroes have to wait in Edoras for a signal from Gondor calling for aid. Unfortunately, the steward of Gondor, Lord Denethor, is in no mood to be helped. Unprepared to accept the forthcoming invasion he is also aware of Aragorn's existence and has no intention of surrendering 'his' kingdom to the king. Old Strider doesn't seem particularly thrilled by the prospect either and a great part of the first third of this film is devoted to the metamorphosis of Aragorn from humble ranger to glorious leader. With Denethor proving difficult, Gandalf acts independently of him, using Pippin to alert Rohan to Gondor's plight while Denethor mulls on how best to send his remaining son Faramir to his death. The treatment of Faramir by his father, in the wake of Boromir's death, which everyone in Gondor seems to know about, provides most of the remainder of the opening scenes of ROTK and is both touching and dramatic. Meanwhile Frodo and Sam progress towards Mount Doom, but Gollum has plans for them. With Sauron's army departing the three halflings arrive at Shelob's cave, only for Sam to be sent away because of his perceived lust for the ring. Gollum's deception separates Frodo from his gardener/bodyguard and that is not a good thing as Smeagol leads the hapless hobbit into the cave only to abandon him to the giant spider... Enough of the plot. From that point on the setting up of events for the subsequent action is pretty much over. The beacons of Minas Tirith are lit, Faramir is nearly killed, Rohan comes to the aid of Gondor which is attacked, Eowyn follows her uncle carrying Merry along for the ride, Aragorn disappears with Gimli and Legolas to find an army of dead soldiers, Gandalf struts his stuff, Pippin becomes useful, Denethor is killed, Faramir is saved, the Witch king dies, as does Theoden, much fighting occurs and everyone generally has a thrilling time. So do the audience. The remainder of the film pales somewhat after the charge of the Rohirrim, while certain scenes offer more questions than answers. Why, for example, do the horsemen stand and fight a far more superior foe, the Mumakil, when they could just turn around and save the city of Gondor? However, this comedown is only to be expected and sets up the conclusion, which isn't too far away. Unfortunately, after that finale comes a long continuation where the hobbits return home only to leave again for the ending. This is unnecessary and rather boring but you can just about forgive it after the enormous length of the shoot. Plus it allows Samwise to have his last word. In terms of the acting there's nothing that hasn't been seen before, with each person doing their bit to appear tough yet vulnerable. Some fair better than others. Viggo Mortensen really comes into his own while Elijah Wood has to suffer for Frodo's shortcomings. Nevertheless everyone is excellent and they are matched by the lines they have and the areas around them. The CGI is seldom intrusive and never anything short of spectacular while the chaos of battle is not totally disorientating. All in all this film matches and surpasses the first two, providing an excellent conclusion and suitable end to some of the best films ever made. The only sadness is that, despite King Kong, Christmas is never going to be quite the same again!
10.0~Best trilogy ever ozgeyalcinkaya Sign in Permalink There is no need to talk much. I watched all movies long version, i read all books for many times not once. The movies and books take you to its own world and you live it. As a result i reaaaaaly love it.
10.0~Simply put, the best all-around movie you'll ever see alexbenfield Sign in Permalink The only movie that comes to mind when I think of an entire cinematic experience that blew me away. The music is powerful, yet not distracting. The acting is flawless, and characters play their parts to perfection. Whoever was responsible for casting this series deserves an award. The scenery is gorgeous and the camera spends enough time focusing on it to let the viewer enjoy what they're seeing, as well as imagine they are there. The plot does not need useless side stories to drag away from the tale told by the book as so many movies these days do. Subtle humor and breathtaking visuals make this a movie worth watching over and over again. It is the only 3 hr movie I have ever seen that I can honestly say I was not bored at any point, start to finish.
7.0~Overrated WeeBey Sign in Permalink This whole trilogy is hugely overrated. The movies have absolutely no intensity and the characters suck pretty bad. I must admit Legolas is okay and Aragorn is alright but all those hobbits make me want to punch them in the face, especially Frodo. The story really sucks too. There are no plot twists or any kind of suspense at all. The characters have no personality and are boring. The plot plods along at an extremely slow pace. Especially the parts with Frodo and the ring. The war scenes in the 3rd movie were pretty cool but didn't make up for the rest of the crap. They should have released all 3 movies in one 3 hour movie then it might have been pretty cool. I am a big fan of fantasy and movies with war scenes like Last Samurai and Gladiator (way better than lotr) but I must say Lotr as a whole was a huge dissapointment. I can't believe all the praise these movies are getting. Is there anyone out there who agrees with me? I don't think there is. This is madness. And the IMDb rankings of these movies are a joke. To sum up, great special effects (big deal) awesome looking, but other than that, pretty ho hum storywise. HUGELY OVERRATED!!!!
9.0~Hype and anticipation may be the only beasts middle-earth cannot conquor. rcd_daul Sign in Permalink Let me give you a quick overview of my emotional journey through the three and a half hour movie. Excellent-good-good-long-long-long. I didn't want the other two films to end. In the first two films I had more of a feeling of Dread as the hours passed and I realized the movie was coming to an end. I think this film had a little too much jammed into it. I'm not saying that Peter Jackson had an easy job. It isn't a story that ends easily. I think that this is an amazing movie, and it will stand the test of time well, however, I think that there is a slight drop in the story telling in Return of the king. There were just too many events that had to be forced into three and a half hours. To the detrement of Faramir and Christopher Lee. Fellowship was released and everyone was blown away. No one thought that the Two towers would be able to follow such an impressive act. Two Towers was released and people were even more blown away, their fears and doubts quelled. I don't think The return of the King delivers as well as the first two, I wouldn't go so far as to say that it was a let down, but I anticipated a movie as perfect as the other two and got one that was slightly less. In all fairness to Peter Jackson and the rest of the cast and crew (that I'm sure will be tossing in their sleep due to my comments) I did see the movie at 12:00 on a tuesday so my perception may have been a little distorted, what with having to wake up at 8:00 for work.
10.0~One Film To Rule Them All jamiekwok1 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is no doubt the best movie I've seen. The film captures you instantly up to the words "The End" appearing on the screen. The Return of the King is nothing short of excitement. For all those who doesn't know what The Lord of the Rings is about (I'm thinking everybody does either through the books or the movies), here's a brief summary: Just over 50 year ago, J.R.R. Tolkien published a tale about a long, dangerous quest to destroy 1 ring. This tale is split into 3 novels, "The Fellowship of the Rings", "The Two Towers" and "The Return of the King". This tale, is called "The Lord of the Rings". Nearly 50 years after the novels were published, Peter Jackson tells the tale in another way, by bringing it to life onto the big screen. This tale is about 9 people's quest to destroy one magic ring and return peace to Middle-Earth. If this one ring goes back to it's maker, the evil Sauron, the world will be under his control, bringing death and misery everywhere. The only way to destroy this powerful ring is to cast it into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was made. Only one hobbit could resist the temptation to keep the ring and this job was given to a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. To help him along the way, a fellowship of nine people were brought together. In it was a wizard, 2 men, an elf, a dwarf and three other hobbits. Together, they set out for Mordor, where Mount Doom is situated. Getting to Mordor is not as easy as it sounds. On the way they'll have to battle Orcs, Uruk-hais, giant spiders and other results of Tolkien's fascinating imagination. The Return of the King is the last addition to this vast trilogy. Peter Jackson does a great job in interpreting Tolkien's thoughts and feelings into a film. Watching the movies is just like reading the books themselves. If it was only the movies, it wouldn't have made such an impact on the public. The music in all three films practically takes you on your very own journey and the acting from the actors was also very impressive. If anything was missing from these movies, they just wouldn't have been such a success. Peter Jackson has done this to perfection. Overall, this is a must-watch movie. Plenty of action and special effects, not to mention a very heart warming ending to the trilogy. I'll just say one more thing, don't criticise anything until you have saw, heard or done it, especially Lord of the Rings.
6.0~A visual treat yes, but a classic??? kelvin-cery Sign in Permalink Cutting to the chase, I am not a fan of the book and will admit to not having read a single page of Tolkien in my life. This puts me in the position of being able to judge the film not as an adaptation but as a cinematic experience in its own right, and to this extent the film is far from being the classic that most claim it to be. Strip away the mind blowing SFX and you are left with a movie which is absolutely predictable from start to finish, a lead actor who on many occassions persists on annoying the hell out of me with his overly camp glances at his best mate, a fight scene that to the uninitiated seemed rather too similar in plot (SFX again excepted) to the battle scene in the previous film, and that ending........why? I would have rated this film an 8 if it wasnt for the fact that it delivers possibly the most disappointing half hour of cinematic history at the end. Slushy? Cheesy? Fluffy? Call it what you will, but it was cringingly bad and caused me to leave the theatre thinking "thank Jehovah it eventually finished" - never a good sign. A landmark piece of moviemaking, yes, but will I have cause to watch this in 15 years time when the SFX have been improved upon? I think I will be quite able to find a better way of spending half a day. 6/10
10.0~An absolute masterpiece redhotchillipitts Sign in Permalink This film is absolutely brilliant in many aspects. The special effects are incredible, as are the actors who portray each of Tolkien's dynamic characters. I went to see this film with my friend and we both found ourselves crying and laughing throughout many parts of the movie. This is the ultimate package, bravo! I hope that it gets the credit it deserves.
8.0~The series hits it's worst point, the end... igotranover Sign in Permalink As the series has caught on to a new franchise, attracting younger viewers and tugging a whole new look to the style of Tolkien's world, attention to detail becomes flawed and relentless in trying to sound clever in some of the lines; and characters begin to make conversations that are unnecessary that you've all heard before. Such as: "Middle Earth will fall to the hand of SAURON." being quoted by nearly ten people in the series. It possesses inner qualities in it's self that are more miscellaneous rather than real movie quality. It's clichéd, it's corny and repetitive, but that's what makes it brilliant. The fact that everything is coming to an end in a great adventure to end all adventures is the main interior of this epic series climax that we see before us conquers all of your reason to criticise and leaves you on the edge of your seat...that is, after two hours and forty-five minutes... The rest of the film is absolutely abysmal, and there is no point in the last three scenes except for filler material. If those last scenes were the overall quality of the film, this would be 4/10. Because it is a pure waste of time to look at the last twenty minutes. Another huge flaw, is that all the bits you actually didn't want to miss that were from the book are missed and some of the things you desperately wanted to observe are on sale for £10-20. They are all put on as extras on DVD video. I give this a strong 8, for reasons I said earlier. No doubt the worst film in the series, but you could still watch this over and over again and never get bored... I hope the new Peter Jackson movie bodes well, as he puts King Kong at the centre of his new phenomenon, because he's been a brilliant director for the LOTR series.
10.0~The best movie ever !!! raphael88 Sign in Permalink The novel by John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was said to be impossible to adapt for the cinema, Peter Jackson has done it ! I have read the novel and I think we can say that he has done it perfectly ! It's a perfect adaptation ! 3 hours and 12 minutes of intense happiness ! I saw this extraordinary movie three times and it's always the same wonderful feelings ! I always shiver when Frodo is followed by Arachne and when he must destroy the Ring and he doesn't want to any more... even if I know what will happen ! This movie is also served by a great cast: the excellent Ian McKellen, the funny John Rhys-Davies, the moving Elijah Wood, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan, the very convincing Viggo Mortensen, the unbelievable Andy Serkis, the beautiful Liv Tyler and all the others, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, David Wenham, Bernard Hill, Karl Urban, Miranda Otto and so on. But an actor has impressed me more than the others: Sean Astin is really fantastic in the role of Samwise Gamegie ! Finally, the music is exceptional ! So, we can't ask something more ! Thank you Mister Jackson !
10.0~A worthy, melancholic ending to the best trilogy so far... nosiesnetnieuws Sign in Permalink I can't add much to what other people have been saying; indeed, the LotR trilogy is a masterful achievement. I don't have to say that the cinematography, storytelling, acting and music are brilliant, because by now everybody knows. What is exceptionally well-done in my opinion is this: in part 1, we focus on the quest of a rather small group. In part 2, everything gets bigger and more epic... But in part 3, even though the battles to be fought are of enormous scale, instead of making everything bigger and more violent, Peter Jackson chose to highlight the characters. From the extremely subtle very first shot (a tiny worm) to the very last (won't spoil), the film treats you with memorable, highly emotional scenes of real PEOPLE. Instead of a bombastic ending you're treated with a much more suitable melancholy. I never cried when seeing a film, until seeing this one this evening. The parts with "I can carry you" and "You don't bow for anyone"... well, they're almost too beautiful. Without doubt, 10/10.
10.0~One word: Wonderful alisha87 Sign in Permalink I do not know where to begin with this film, but all I really have to say is that it is WONDERFUL. If you loved the first two of the trilogy, you are going to love the third. It has a balance of seriousness and humor, war and peace, good vs. evil, all wrapped in one package. I seriously doubt you will be disappointed with this one, and if the Academy doesn't give it Best picture....its blind!
1.0~the neverending movie chelchesoz Sign in Permalink The director was pretty jealous of the fact that a movie has to end, otherwise this movie would never have had an end. An interesting start (the first movie of the trilogy "Fellowship of the ring") but absolutely boring on the road to the end of it. I'm disappointed with this movie, as I've expected more of it. The characters seemed wonderful at the beginning, but the director made the worst of them. Shameful!! More shameful, as this is the movie that won the Oscar. I cannot think of the motives the Academy awarded the prize to this movie but the money that went into it. It's the second time in the history (that i know of) that the academy appreciates more the cost of a movie than the quality of it and of the actors' play. It's interesting, in this approach, that no actor in this movie won the Oscar. Why is that?
10.0~Amazing dude! harisali1989 Sign in Permalink Although this movie shows stuff that weren't in the book, IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT "WERE" IN THE BOOK! Peter Jackson is amazing and this movie is worth 20+ Oscar awards! I really recommend this movie to be watched after seeing the first 2. I really can't perceive why or how this movie has an 8.9 according to it's rating. I was shocked, i thought it would get a 10! Return of the king is my Favourite movie by far.
10.0~'Cinematic Glory' or 'And They Thought the Epic Was Dead' requiem1896 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's concluding film of the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy is a masterpiece of film making. For now, let's ignore the storyline. 'Return of the King' is one of those rare films that excels at every aspect of the film making process to make an across-the-boards excellent film. From costume design and Art Design/Production Design to lighting, cinematography, visual effects, sound effects, sound, etc. etc. etc. 'Return of the King' is a solid example of film-making at its finest. The sequence in which the Beacons are lit is probably one of the most cinematically beautiful moments on film in the past 10 years (if not more). Peter Jackson had a vision that was the Lord of the Rings, and he stayed true to that vision from beginning to end. Part of the greatness of this movie is that unceasing dedication. The attention to the slightest detail is the key to this film. Without a doubt, this film deserves Oscars for Art Direction, Costume Design, Score, Song, Visual Effects, Sound and Sound Editing, Directing and Best Picture. [Of particularly odd note, is the lack of a Cinematography nomination...although its efforts in the first film were recognized then.] This is epic film making in the finest traditions of Cecil B. Demill and others. Without a doubt, Return of the King will go down in Hollywood history as a shining moment of the first decade of 21st Century film. Now on to Acting: Was the acting great? Yes. Why so few awards? Simple. Return of the King's cast is irrevocably tied to each other. Each character, and therefore each individual actor, interconnects in a manner not unlike a quilt or afghan. Should nominations have been received? Probably. [especially for Astin and Hill]. Although with no individual cast member out- shining the rest, it is not surprising that no nominations were received. With luck, they will receive credit for Best Cast from the SAG - a fitting symbol of how close and well balanced the cast actually was. Now, on to the story. Yes you can point to inconsistencies between this and the book. And yes, you can have an endless debate about whether 'Return of the King' can stand alone or it is irrevocably tied to the other two. It is all unnecessary. Perfect adaptations are a pariah and artistic differences should not be a strike against a film's value for its own sake. 'Return of the King,' is a brilliantly crafted war and adventure story. Written more like one of Hollywood's great History screenplays, the story is rock solid with believable characters, situations, and a rich history. If you are the type that likes good fantasies, histories, and/or war movies. Definitely watch the whole trilogy. If not, see 'Return of the King' to experience the new masterpiece from a master director.
10.0~The worthy conclusion of a Masterpiece BerZerK_Bavaria Sign in Permalink Its just plain awesome. My shirt was soaked in sweat. At some times during the battle shivers cascaded down my back and to some touching scenes i had to cry very hard. The audience in the cinema was on the edge of the seats and when Legolas finished of his "big" opponent and Gimli said this way cool line the tension exploded in such a loud cheering that i thought i am in a soccer stadium when a goal is scored! I really never experienced something like this in a cinema in my life!!! Really, this lets you fall unto your knees. The Trilogy is now complete and ready to take over the rule in the cinematic Olymp!!!
10.0~Culmination of a 3-year experience nicolt Sign in Permalink What a great experience. This movie capped off a 3-year journey for me - one that included my first time reading the books (including The Hobbit and The Silmarillion) and several viewings of the movies. Each movie holds a special place in my heart, but I think that this last one is the most satisfying. I'll forever remember the beacons being lit, and Pippen's sorrow-filled song. Probably the most poignant moment, though, is Gollum's look as he gets to hold the ring one last time... and then the Eagles coming... As a whole, I feel I've accomplished something coming out of this experience. I'd like to thank the movie-makers for this experience... for it truly has been fulfilling and life changing.
10.0~A new standard in epic storytelling lordhagus Sign in Permalink With LOTR:The Return of the King, Peter Jackson has shown all filmmakers with recent epic films on their conto that they are all missing that most important element: EMOTION. Combining good storytelling and characterization with rousing action-sequences and special effects that actually serve the story and not dominate it, the film succeeds also in creating a lot of emotional depth. One of the most beautiful and in the same time most painful moments(together with Gandalfs death in the first film) was the charge on Osgiliath by Faramir. Sent to his death by his father Denethor, who wishes Faramir had died instead of his older son Boromir, he only wants his fathers love and recognition that he does not receive. While this happens, Denethor eats if nothing matters and he asks poor Pippin to sing him a song. He does so and on his face you can see the despair and confusion. This is a very subtle and strong scene. In stead of a pompous battle scene with ditto music Jackson has the guts to do something completely different, also when you realize this is not in the book. Scenes like this really draw you into the movie, and even in the battle scenes, which have yet to be equalled, the film stands out through focusing on the emotional side of things. Mr. Jackson, I congratulate you and your crew for this unique and unforgettable landmark in genre-film history.
10.0~The best of the 3 cosmiquemuffin Sign in Permalink I had very high hopes for this one, and was not disappointed. There were touch points I had visualized (the Cracks of Mount Doom, the Grey Havens) and they were done with exquisite beauty. What is amazing to me is that PJ can forge the tale onscreen with the SFX and majesty of overwhelming scope and power, while at the same time present Sam's sacrifice and the pain of Frodo with heart-rending humanity. Hats off to the best trilogy of all time.
10.0~Stunning tizmond Sign in Permalink Easily the best film I've seen at the cinema. I was glued to this for the full 201 minutes. So much so that I held in a pee for 2 hours of it, because I didn't want to miss anything ! This blew me away so much, that I was completely drained after watching it and I felt strange when I left the cinema because for 201 minutes it felt like the rest of the world had stopped while the movie was on. It's the best of the three films and was worth the numbness in my a55 afterwards. If you haven't already, watch this at the cinema, because when you watch it on video, you'll regret not going to the cinema to see it. Epic.
1.0~one of the worst movies ever !!! manco-25800 Sign in Permalink This movie was awful for me first and foremost because it did not draw me in to the story, for only seconds at a time did I care for or could I make sense of the story and the acting, I was simply bored and restless. And the directing was awful. The cinematography boring and predictable. The editing confusing. The score predictable. The storyline infantile. The acting, without any exception TERRIBLE. The lenght insane. The events too much for fantasy. The CGI effects hokey. It is a childs movie a la Jungle book. It belongs on Nickelodeon between Spongebob and Johnny Bravo. In fact, there oughta be a law against Peter Jackson movies.
10.0~Epic movie to complete the story danny204175 Sign in Permalink Everything you would wish for from a movie, edge of your seat until the very end!!
10.0~Words cannot express dagger32 Sign in Permalink This is the culmination of the GREATEST story ever told put to film. I read and saw previews of what the last installment was going to be. I saw in the extended editions how Peter Jackson said that this would blow the other 2 movies out of the water. I did not expect this installment to be beyond even the praises of even the directors' comments. The perfect ending to the best trilogy ever made or will be made. I feel sorry for anyone trying to make another trilogy and come close to being this good!!! I do not believe it can be done!!!
10.0~My favorite movie of all time e-guadarramafdec Sign in Permalink I have to admit i did not see LOTR until a year ago or so but after i watched it i will never see a movie the same again. Peter Jackson,with this movie, proves himself as one of the greatest director of all times.and the result of that is that this movie is AWESOOME!All the actors and actresses did a superbly good job also making the movie what it is,OK but who i think really kills it in this movies is Andy Serkis.Andy Serkis as gollum is the best casting choice ever he did such a good job at making every scene he is in count especially the end scene, and if you've scene the movie you know what i mean.So the lord of the rings is great i think it more than deserved all the Oscar wins it got and perfectly establishes itself as one of the greatest movies of all time.I'll give it a perfect score 10 out of 10.
10.0~Anyone else a little put off by the actors they chose? stlouisgirl777 Sign in Permalink Aragorn...should have been someone with a different voice...although I think he did an excellent job....he just sounds like Mike Tyson. The only other one I didn't like was the guy who played Faramir...good actor...did a decent job with the role...but just didn't fit what I imagined when I read the book. Just wondering what others think. Was anyone else upset that they totally left out Tom Bombadil? There was some other inconsistencies too. But mainly petty stuff. Overall I was super impressed with Jackson's vision of Middle Earth. Oh yeah...I really didn't like Cate Blanchette for Galadriel either. I hate to be mean but she isn't beautiful enough to play an elf. Or rather she has different kind of beauty than I imagined the elves to have. She is pretty just not the way the elves are pretty.
5.0~Great special effects but a wussboy for a main character buyerbuyer Sign in Permalink I thought that this whole series was pretty bad mainly because of Frodo. He is the most pathetic wussboy I have ever seen in a movie. His presence ruined all of the movies for me. The fighting scenes and special effects are awesome, but I am still left wondering why anybody entrusted the stupid ring with a sniveling, weak, whining, wussboy and why we have to watch him for 9 hours. The ending is gayish when everybody is hugging on the bed, but it seems to fit Frodo's wussboy personality. I don't think that JRR Tolkien's work was really that great compared to fantasy writers today, although he did open a door for them. He centers all of his plots (LOTR, The Hobbit) around weak, smallish, wusslike characters that nobody would ever want to be like.
10.0~Pure Bliss RulesofAttraction18 Sign in Permalink Wow what a movie, i mean visually stunning and just plain awesome in every aspect. The Acting was at its best, the f/x were great and the movie it self blew me away. 10/10 no doubt to me. I think this is the year that Lord of the Rings will sweep the Academy Awards.
10.0~WOW!! EXCELLENT hl_21 Sign in Permalink This movie is great, I just came from seen it and I wanted to comment on how brilliant it is. Visually it is stunning I mean the special effects are really breathtaking and combined with the great music, it makes it scenes really brilliant. I mean the music adds emotion to the scenes. The story is great, the acting is good, the special effects are extraordinary. It also has a motivating story, its good vs evil and well there are lots of things that inspires you. I left the theater with emotion and a good feeling. Not any movie makes me feel that way. It is extraordinary.
10.0~The greatest movie of all time? Yes. dmaguire Sign in Permalink The greatest movie of all time? In my humble opinion as a life long movie fan, there is no competition between this and any other movies whose titles dont begin with "The Lord of the Rings". The Two Towers and The Fellowship of the Ring aside, The Return of the King dwarfs all other movies by a factor of at least 100. The omly possible way it could be better is if it was simply longer, and included fan favorite moments such as Sam against the Watchers, the mouth of Sauron and Gandalf facing off with the Witch King("In rode the Lord of the Nazgul. A great black shape against the fires beyond, he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of the Nazgul, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face. All save one. There, waiting silent and still in the space before the gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax : Shadowfax, who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dinen."-Chapter IV, "The Return of the King", for those of you who havent read the book). The immense integrity and love put into this trilogy by all of the people involved(including the most important man, JRR himself) is probably most of the reason these movies are so so good. But also it is the scale of the stories while also staying true to character devolopment and plot that set this trilogy so far above anything else. Simply put, in my opinion if they had an oscar show for every movie ever, these three movies should win every catergory that they qualify for. I will always love these movies as art and as a great story, but even with all this praise, the book is still even better.
10.0~Simply the best balkwilld Sign in Permalink I first read LOTR in 1975. At the time (and after subsequent readings) my one disappointment was that there was no way anyone could possibly do justice to such a fantastic literary work on the big screen. 28 years on and it is such a wonderful feeling to have been proven wrong. I was priviledged to attend the world premier in Wellington, and feel it isn't really within my ability to express in words how truly great ROTK is - suffice to say this film benchmarks "epic" for the next decade and will be the yardstick by which all others of this scale are measured. Whether you are a long standing Tolkien fan, or a recent convert with the release of the previous two episodes, this film will not disappoint - on the contrary, it will take you to places few other (if any) films have. Peter Jackson and his crew have remained faithful to the storyline (probably more so than with the original releases of FOTR and TTT) and I would implore that the malcontent who are critical of the omissions set aside their misgivings to make the viewing of this film as enjoyable for themselves as it most assuredly will be for the vast majority. There is always the extended version to look forward to for the hardcore Tolkienites. I only hope for their sakes that when the Oscars come around the Academy members reward Jackson the outsider and his team appropriately for one of the greatest productions in cinema history - failure to do so would leave the voters appearing ridiculous, and the awards ceremony itself an irrelevant sham.
10.0~O Maior Filme de Fantasia da História do Cinema andersontw93 Sign in Permalink A Conclusão épica de Peter Jackson de O Senhor dos Anéis, é sem duvidas uma Obra-Prima que ainda é Espetacular no dias de Hoje!
10.0~The Best of the Trilogy DanB-4 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King is grand achievement. On its own, it is spectacular swashbuckling fantasy film, scary, intense and infinitely enjoyable. But as the final and best chapter of the Trilogy, it ranks as one of the best and most important films ever made. Picking up exactly at the end of The Two Towers, ROTK follows two stories. Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue on their journey towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring in its fire. We know from the end of the Two Towers that Gollum has plans to kill his two hobbit companions, and vows to let "her" do it. This leads us to an ingenious scene where Gollum talks to his evil alter-ego, this time by conversing with his reflection in a pool of water. It mimics the similar scene in The Two Towers, but tops if for originality and treachery. At the same time, the rest of the Fellowship re-group after the fall of Isengard, and start to amass troops to defend Minas Tirith from the inevitable attack of the Orc army. The sheer relentless action in this film is beyond description. The battle at Minas Tirith probably lasts an hour and will have you pinned to your seat. There is a sequence when Legolas takes on a giant Mumakil and a dozen or so soldiers riding it. It is one of the great moments of the trilogy, and is perfectly believable - not for a moment do you think that you are viewing a sequence entirely made of special effects. The sequences through the caves with Gollum, growing ever more evil in his pursuit to regain his precious, and the fights with Shelob the giant spider, are nearly too intense to watch. When you pause to think how silly the concept is - a three-foot hobbit battling a massive salivating spider - the success with which this scene comes off is all the more amazing. ROTK completes many of the characters, most notably Gandalf, who proves himself not only wise, but a great general and warrior. As the credits rolled, my first thought was that if a trite piece of fluff like Gladiator can win best picture, ROTK should be a shoe in. Two Towers was better than Fellowship, and ROTK towers over The Two Towers. The Trilogy combined will take a place in my all time top 10 - I just haven't decided yet which film they will supplant. I cannot think of an American trilogy that is superior, where each chapter improves on the previous and where three are a coherent story. This represents the greatest work of sustained film making in decades and will go down in history as of the cinemas crowing achievements. Kudos to Mr. Jackson, and also to New Line Cinema who put their very existence on the line by greenlighting this project. **** out of ****.
10.0~Brilliant ehuntley Sign in Permalink This is the most perfect movie I think I've ever seen. It was visually stunning, the plot was amazing, and best of all, it was completely acceptable by Tolkien fanatic standards. It's the kind of movie that, cliche as it sounds, will make you clap and cheer from your seat. Obviously there were things that were omitted from the text, but those things were chosen carefully, and did not detract from the greatness of the film. I loved this movie, and I am absolutely dying to see it again.
10.0~Fabulous, one of my favorites. wynsurfer Sign in Permalink Fabulous, one of my favorites. One can't but expect great things from the final film in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. But that isn't really fair, because it's very hard to top what is already very good and highly rated. With this in mind, I expected the third film to be about the same as the rest, with some people being let down, because they had unrealistic expectations. And so it is - it's more climactic, more emotional, and more bold, but not necessarily better. The special effects are strained by the demands of the story more so in "Return of the King". Don't expect miracles and you will appreciate the film for what it is. Even more has been changed from the book than the first two films, but of course the key elements are all there. As a fan I almost wished I didn't know the story, because I was looking for too many elements, rather than letting the film flow. But the second viewing cured me of this. Bring on the extended version.
10.0~The Best Finishing of Best Movie asifpreneur Sign in Permalink Making trilogy is not a easy task because it needs both balance of plots and a flawless finishing. Otherwise the whole thing becomes a lousy one. Even this is very tough to make a single sequel maintaining the frequency of any story. And LOTR is the movie that maintained everything expertly & I must say the ending of the story made me fulfilled. The cinematography was awesome & the music behind every part of the movie was set perfectly. Specially when I hear the instrumentals of LOTR it let me feel that I am one of the part of that movie. In addition, the metaphoric value is also gorgeous. But I must say about the friendship that sam has shown to the whole movie. And the other guys are awesome also. Thanks to the whole team for this awesome creation.
10.0~10/10 Best There is simon_chop Sign in Permalink Best there is out there. If you haven't seen it then you have missed a lot. Seeing The first and the second with a lot of joy, the 3rd one was surprisingly the best finish to a trilogy movie and a book there could be. I have watched both theatrical and extended movie and enjoyed both of them, but if you're a big fan of the trilogy i suggest that you watch the extended version to get more deeper knowledge about the Story. all tho the extended versions is more than 4 hours long i still recommend it to be watched. Parts from the extended version will surprise you. /This is my first review of a title. Best wishes from Me, a fan of Peter Jackson's work.
10.0~Simple yet great review brankopoljakovic-830-482375 Sign in Permalink Dear all, I find myself watching this title over and over again with same joy as for the first time. Charisma remain still and every single scene feels right, hits the point. Thousands and thousands of popcorn pass trough my hands and will again, most probably. But this must not will be a review of only one part, yet of all three as a movie marathon can begin once again.
10.0~Magnificent nativekingkurt Sign in Permalink Awesome, great, perfect, astounding, captivating, engaging, precioussss. There are not enough superlatives to describe this film. Not going to give anything away but Serkis MUST get an Oscar nomination. Just go and see it. NOW!!! If you're gonna shoot, shoot, don't talk.
9.0~Darn near perfect ending illusion00 Sign in Permalink As a huge fan of both the movie and the books, I am delighted to see how closely Peter Jackson has tried to follow the end of the story as Tolkien would have intended. Sure, there were a few omissions that I found disappointing, but until I've seen the extended cut, I won't even complain about that. This was a wonderful cap to the journey Jackson has made of the LotR series.
10.0~Spending 4 hours in a crowded freezing theatre to see this movie: Priceless FairiShadows Sign in Permalink Hail Peter Jackson for making the third movie in a trilogy as good or in my humble opinion better than the first! Tell me how often does THAT happen? Normally, big-budget-ultra-hyped Hollywood "blockbuster sequels" leave you disappointed at best. IE: The Matrix Reloaded, but The Return of the King won't have you leaving the theatre cursing every person involved with the film, theatre management, concession workers and every person that looks at you during the 6 hours following the movie. I'm definitely no movie buff, but I know what I like. And this is it. I'll admit, that I wasn't overly enthusiastic over the whole LOTR hoopla. I vowed to never see the movies. Any movie to me, that's as hyped as these three have been over the past three or so years, usually sends me running in the opposite direction. I was roped into watching the first two during a Starz! LOTR premier weekend (cursed boyfriends!) And boy, I was blown away. I've never been into epics, but they were amazing. The next day, when my bf asked if I was now willing to go see the last installment with him, of course I had to jump at the chance. Now, I've only just began to read the books, and I haven't gotten to The Return of the King yet, so I couldn't tell you how true to the story it is, but if it is anything like the first two, I'm sure it's pretty much right on. Of course there are always differences, but that's what happens when you adapt a book to the big screen. The Return of the King is brilliantly told, visually stunning, surprisingly well acted, and more than worth ten bucks or so to see. Some naysayers might be a little put off by the length of the movie. I'll say the first time I saw it, the last thirty minutes I was itching for fresh air, but I think, if it were any shorter, you'd miss out on the sheer brilliance of it. There isn't a minute that you ask what does this have to do with anything. It's finely woven and besides, a pain in the backside is nothing if can experience truly one of the best movies of all time. This is a movie for the ages. It's a Wonderful Life is an all time Christmas Classic; The Return of the King (or any one of the trilogy) can pick any holiday it wants. If you sat through three hours of the Titanic or The Godfather, camped outside a theatre to see Star Wars or still crack up when you hear "E.T. phone home", then give in to this bait, and forget the rest. You won't be disappointed. And if you are? I'll eat my shoes.
8.0~Something not quite right niallhcd Sign in Permalink I cannot fault this movie for use of special effects, and sheer thrill and excitement of battle sequences. However, this movie is not without its problems. It tries hard to combine drama and dialogue with action, but unfortunately the drama and script are not good. The film is full of far too many scenes where the actors stop and stare at each other lovingly and don't react in realistic ways. Yes it's a fantasy movie, and elves and hobbits do not necessarily act the same as humans in the same situations. But I cannot help feeling that Peter Jackson is not as talented in getting his script to make the audience feel for the characters in the way he wishes. Perhaps these scenes were not cut in the right way or, dare I say it, the acting was not convincing enough, but I felt there was something not quite right from the beginning to the final scenes. Without doubt it is overlong, perhaps NewLine have made so much money out of the first two, that they let Pete Jackson do as he pleases. Long stretches of the movie are hard work to watch, and there are numerous times in the final hour when the movie could have been wrapped up better. It will be strange not to have another lined up for next Christmas, and the movie itself is a remarkable achievement, but is not the one I hoped it would be. niallhcd
9.0~Magic and religion Hossein_Akbari Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. I believe that the writer consider religions for writing this scenario... using elf , trees, ghosts , orcs and a character like Gundolf (a savior) its like that you red and checked some religions like Islam and Christianity. Its like that Apocalypse happened and a savior comes to guide the survivors its the battle between Satan (The eye) and god (Gundolf and his allies) like the Apocalypse that holly Quaran and Gospel mentioned. The special effects of movie is great and all of the characters play their rolls perfectly. The story is very amazing that keep you tuned you like to follow every things till reach the end.

10.0~Better than hope for makes you yearn for the Hobbit. bailey664 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson is a Wizard among Directors. He will win best director and best picture Oscars if not the oscars will be no more than gold statue reprenting evrything that doesn't mean sh"t and will snub all those in charge. This One is better than the other two combined Great Job Cast Crew and support People.
8.0~good but not too good icer98 Sign in Permalink Well I just encountered the third lotr movie and i had no complaints BUT the movie didn't meet the expectations from word of mouth, the media and the ratings it got. I decided that this movie should get a score around 7 or 8. I do read many of Tolkens books and i kind of understood the ending but i honestly thought i was one of the gayest ending ever for a good movie. I don't know if i completely understand the ending yet but from what i know Frodo and the king guy goes to other adventured that Tolkien has written.Well if I'm wrong in any way just tell me but i still think that the movie would have been screwed up in the end for people who didn't really read the book.
7.0~Good, but definitely overrated swansongang Sign in Permalink This is one of those movies that you see and think, "Wow, that was awesome!" But then, you go back and think a bit about it. At least I did. Okay, I will say this: the visual effects are outstanding. The battle sequences are very well done. And those are what wow you. I left the theater thinking it was an awesome movie, mainly because of those sequences. Yet as I go back to this well woven fabric, tons of threads all of a sudden seem out of place. The beginning of the movie, for example, set me off. "Saruman is in Orthanc..."...well...now what? Are...are we going to see him? Is he going to kick the bucket? Yet no. Instead, it's a simple move on to the next phase of the movie. Later, as Legolas slides down the Oliphant in his awesome-cool-make-the-fangirls/boys-flip moment, I wonder, "Why was that showcase of special effects considered more important than 5 minutes of screen time for one of the greatest actors of time?" Another part that sets me (and other book fans) off from this third installment, is the scene where Sam leaves Frodo. WHY?!? He knows "Mister Frodo" is in danger...Gollum is leading him to a mysterious entrance to the land of evil, and the "Stinker" side is becoming really obvious to Sam, and Sam just leaves Frodo! The fellow hobbit he was willing to run out and nearly drown for, to leap into the way of a Ringwraith, is going off to face death directly, and he leaves him! This lapse of character, merely to get Sam out of Frodo's way so that Frodo can be bitten, does not fit well into the movie. Finally, the character of Gimli, I felt, had the complete wrong personality. Whereas, in Tolkein's masterpieces, Gimli is a battle-hardened dwarf who no orc should tangle with, his scenes seem to be mostly comic relief. Delivering quips and one liners in the middle of a battle, acting weak and cowardly merely to make light of the near death of our beloved characters does not go over so well in my mind. Overall, this was an enjoyable movie. You'll need a while to watch it, but it is an enjoyable time. I recommend the extended edition, as it adds in so many scenes that should have stayed (Saruman's death, the Mouth of Sauron). Jackson let me down with the third one, but you still have to see it.
10.0~A marvelous visual inundation. Be ready to hold your breath and gape your eyes in awe. This is one for the ages. razwee Sign in Permalink At the beginning of this year, I had a pretty good idea that Peter Jackson's final film adaptation of Tolkien's trilogy would be a given for my year-end top-ten list. Still, I was not making any rash decisions and would not give The Return of the King praise if it was undeserved. To say that my initial instincts were dead-on would be a monumental understatement. Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is hands-down the best film I have seen this year. No other film on my current list comes close. Despite the enormous strengths of the previous two films, it is in this masterful conclusion that the emotional intensity, plot developments, and character arcs come pouring off the screen in a marvelous inundation. The vision which Jackson and cinematographer Andrew Lesnie cast upon the besieged kingdoms of men and the growing plight of Frodo, the ringbearer, is uncompromisingly bleak. The lighting of The Fellowship of the Ring was lushly colorful and richly variegated, and despite the perils, the tone was not at all grave. With The Two Towers, the colors became increasingly desaturated, eliciting a much more grim and foreboding air. In this film, the vibrancy has returned, only this time, there is heavy use of bright neutrals (whites and grays) and almost fluorescent greens. This vibrancy is not at all inviting, but instead invokes feelings of isolation, barrenness, and worst of all, hopelessness. As strange as it may sound, there is an agonizing darkness to these bright hues. In talking with a friend, shortly after we had both seen the film, we concurred that The Return of the King is also the most Peter Jackson of the three films. Several of his previous outings (Meet the Feebles, The Frighteners, and Heavenly Creatures) had a penchant for the surreally gory, grotesque, and downright ugly, and it is in this Lord of the Rings movie (much more than the first two) that the phantasmagoria and horror-saturated imagery is at its most unrestrained. In terms of story, things start out slowly, but only because things are being set up for an explosive, relentless climax. And oh my, what a climax! Some have called the Battle at Helm's Deep (from The Two Towers) one of the greatest battles ever put on film. In actor John Rhys-Davies' own words, "You ain't seen nothin' yet". Maybe a little comparison might help. Helm's Deep was attacked by 10,000 evil Uruk-Hai soldiers and defended by a few hundred men and elves. In this film, the attack on the human city of Minas Tirith and the Battle of Pelennor Fields combine to pit the many combined forces of good against 200,000 Uruks, orcs, trolls, and corrupted men. The cinematic result is heartstopping, jawdropping, and completely engulfing. And once again, the creators have taken measures to ensure that CGI work acts as an enhancement, not as a sole force. This is certainly the most violent and disturbing of the three films, and several horrifying images in the battles push the PG-13 rating as far as it can go. Honestly, I thought the film strayed into R-rated territory several times. This is not the fun-filled, innocent, child-friendly, family film the promoters might want you to believe it is. The emotional pitches that Jackson hits deserve comparison with the most brutal moments in dehumanizing war films. As an example, I can tell you that the fun-loving, bumbling hobbit, Pippin (played by Billy Boyd), goes through especially painful changes and has a vocal solo that made me gasp and hold my breath. The acting for this film is by far the most difficult, and the cast of The Return of the King gives a collective performance that is simply incredible as an ensemble piece. Not often does a collection of performances result in something greater than the sum its parts, but such is unquestionably the case in this film. There are several individual performances of note, however. As the white wizard Gandalf, Ian McKellan displays more authority and strength than the previous two films, and he has some moments during battle that will have you ready to leap from your seat (although not as much as Orlando Bloom's shining moment when his Legolas performs a maneuver that makes his surfboard move in The Two Towers look pathetic). Legolas and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are still relegated mainly to their smile-inducing comic relief roles, but in context, this provides a perfect complement to (and sometimes, a welcome relief from) the ensuing chaos and devastation. In the role of the heir to the throne of Gondor, kingdom of men, Viggo Mortensen must display more acceptance of Aragorn's fate as king, and the Aragorn we see in The Return of the King is a far cry from the reluctant ranger we first met in The Fellowship. His performance easily communicates the growing, steadfast self-confidence Aragorn develops. As Merry and Pippin, two hobbits who have journeyed far from home and have since lost the innocence and care-free nature of hobbits, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd move beyond the comic-relief and supporting nature of their parts in the other two films and turn in wonderfully effective performances that require them to step forward and be leads for a short time. The primary newcomer to this film (if you don't count his appearance in the extended edition of The Two Towers) is John Noble, who plays Denethor, steward of Gondor. His performance is menacing and reveals a man who may have good intentions, but is nonetheless clouded by an obsession with his family's claim to power and a broken psyche that has been perverted by the strife his people have had to endure. The scenes in which Denethor is at his most unbalanced are some of the most powerful in the film. My favorite of the performances, however, belongs to the trio en route to Mordor. As the morally ambiguous Gollum, Andy Serkis gives a fantastic performance that is even darker and more frightening than his work in The Two Towers. As the hobbits Frodo and Sam, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have some scenes that tear at the heart. (By the way, some of these scenes generated sniffles from several people around me). Frodo's degraded emotional and physical state is captured perfectly by Wood's contorted facial expressions and awkward movements. Meanwhile, Sam's unwavering loyalty to Frodo is tested, and Astin's work is amazingly poignant. Like the other two films, The Return of the King has three hours of central story, but there is also a twenty-minute epilogue that chronicles events following the War of the Ring. This epilogue constitutes seventy pages (about one-third) of Tolkien's book, and therefore twenty minutes is actually quite short. So if you hear from critics (and you will) that the film "does not want to end" and goes on for too long, just know that you are listening to someone who has not read the books and is throwing shortsighted criticism at Jackson for a characteristic of Tolkien's work (which, by the way, I have no problems with). The epilogue of the film, just like with the book, allows for celebration and rejoicing, but also a lingering sense of mourning, irony, and pain. Jackson gets the tone of the final five minutes absolutely right, and I doubt that anyone who has grown to love these characters will be able to keep a dry eye. This is an astounding film, and without a doubt, a landmark in film history. Taken together, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King represent one of the greatest collective works of cinema ever made. Yes, you heard me right. No, I am not exaggerating. The Lord of the Rings easily represents the greatest cinematic fantasy work of all-time, but it also embodies much more than that. Jackson's endlessly fertile imagination has shown that the "impossible" can be done and that sometimes, it is worth taking risks (Thank you, New Line). I don't think there will ever be a time again when a work of film extends beyond the nine-hour mark (ten, if you count extended editions), and yet manages not only to keep its audiences engrossed, but also successfully create compelling characters that people will be reluctant to say goodbye to. After only one viewing, I consider The Return of the King the best film of 2003, and still, I feel I have not even begun to grasp how truly superior the work is. Bring lots of tissues, and be ready to hold your breath and gape your eyes in awe. This is one for the ages.
10.0~The movie that i cant get tired of yamir61-96 Sign in Permalink This is the most exciting movie to me . each time i watch it its like the first time . everything is perfect . the actors are great the acting is great, the special effects are awesome considering that this movie was made in 2003. no one could've done it better than peter Jackson . this movie is my precious
10.0~A fantastic ending to a masterpiece. kingofcats-55396 Sign in Permalink The return of the king manages to end the lord of the rings in all its glory. Though it was helpful to have the ending already written in the books, putting it into a movie is a whole nother thing. But they pull it off incredibly. Overall the return of the king is a fantastic ending to a masterpiece of cinema.
10.0~The greatest. eh_eh_ehhh Sign in Permalink It was the most mindblowing film I have ever seen at the cinema. I left feeling so happy that my expectations had been fulfilled, and yet so sad because it was all over. Can't wait for the extended edition, it will undisputably be the best film ever made.
10.0~A masterpiece has been born SietseVD Sign in Permalink The movie-seeing world is divided in those who've seen the Return of the King and those who are about to see it. A real masterpiece. I can only use superlatives to describe how breathtaking and magnificent this movie is. If you haven't seen RotK, get off your lazy butt and hurry to your nearby cinema.
10.0~Best movie of all time? subgenius37 Sign in Permalink LOTR has a bit for everyone if you love drama and character development then you're probably a bigger fan of the first movie in the series. But if you love action epics ala Braveheart then you will LOVE this movie. I went in actually expecting this to be the best movie of all time, and I was shocked that the movie lived up to the hype. It probably is one of if not THE best movie of all time especially since I really like action epics. But don't get me wrong don't limit the movie to a simple action epic there is TONS of character development as you can finally see the final arc to all the characters. Some complain this movie's end is too long, but remember it is only 20 mins for a 13 hr movie. There is NO reason NOT to see this movie and every reason to see it.
1.0~Overrated himimini Sign in Permalink Yeah I know that a lot of people like or love the whole trilogy, but I think this trilogy and the "Hobbit" trilogy are overrated. OK the films aren't bad, but it are simply fantasy films and eleven Ocsars are absolutely to many for this movie. A few of them have the film well earned, but not exact eleven like Ben Hur or Titanic. Maybe is my awful view about the film only, because I like fantasy films not really, but looking this movie was hard for me and than the horrible information that this movie WIN ELEVEN Oscars, give me the final think that this movie simply OVERRATED is. Even if the film is not really terrible, only overrated.
10.0~BEST Sertacbaba95 Sign in Permalink This is my first cinema movie. When i was 8, I watched this movie
10.0~beautiful film mattiagrassia Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson and one of the directors that I love so much and once again He has made a masterpiece film.Il Lord of the Rings and a movie Crazy I like so much for this I gave him 10 stars because for me and the best film that we SIA.Anche if this film was released so time ago I remember it as a masterpiece won 11 Oscar awards Other prizes that do not remember it was a crazy movie that I remember lifetime. One last thing the exceptional cast on all counts view, above all the actors who have been involved have been able to acting in the right way which is why this film is extraordinary, It remains today one of the best films in cinema history.
10.0~Awesome simonwood666 Sign in Permalink Best of the three ... hats off to Peter Jackson. One of the most perfect films that I have ever seen, except for a cheesey bit near the end, it cannot be faulted. I just cannot wait till the Extended version is out, I want to watch all three in one sitting to get the full effect of the trilogy.
10.0~Beautiful. sammartinez777 Sign in Permalink Simply. One of the best Films ever made. Peter Jackson, Thank You. Beautiful Cinematography, Tremendous casting, Music that sweep you away,and just overall fun.
9.0~Good ending of a classic movie already. JoshNL Sign in Permalink When seeing this movie in the cinema i felt a little bit disappointed because i missed something. I didn't know what and when i saw the long version on DVD i knew what. The storyline was by far better than the one in the cinema. Just because some phrases and scenes needed to be in in the first place. What a mistake from Peter Jackson. I'm glad i bought the whole long version series and not the separate parts. Now i am satisfied and really, really enjoyed it after all. I guess a lot of people don't realize they have to go to the video shop and see the long version before they miss the extras!!! Greetings from a lo tr fan.
10.0~WOW!!!! stian999 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson is now my movie God. What a beautiful, powerful, emotional, huge, amazing movie Return of the king is. I had high hopes for this movie and i was not disappointed. The trilogy is now complete and Peter Jackson has finished the trilogy with style and finesse, which i believe no other director could have done. The only sad thing is that is now over. Well atleast until Mr. Jackson gets the green light to start making The Hobbit.
10.0~INCREDIBLE smurf707 Sign in Permalink This movie u must see!!!, it incorporates just about everything that a person could want in a movie. Its an Emotional roller coaster of action, suspense,and a huge range of emotions. Awesome acting, a great end to a wonderful trilogy. This is a MUST SEE. So stop reading this review and go watch it!!!!
10.0~A great contribution to film history RachelTwine1 Sign in Permalink After seeing the first two films in this famous trilogy i couldn't wait for the third and expected one spectacular ending to the story of the one ring. I was not disappointed. After never reading the books i didn't no what to expect but came out of the cinema awe struck and amazed. Each actor has contributed greatly to this film and how superbly they did it. The computerised effects are wonderful and the war scenes are inspirational. After seeing the films I have since read the books and would like to say J.R.R Tolkein fantastically describes the fantasy world of middle earth and Peter Jackson has brilliantly captured everything in this history making trilogy. Well done to him and if you haven't seen these films then you don't know what your missing.
10.0~I will not say do not weep, for not all tears are an evil. Servant_of_Dagon Sign in Permalink Okay, this one's long overdue. The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King, or, as I simply shall refer to it from now on, ROTK, is a thrilling, wonderful, amazing retelling of the much-loved last part of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings. To call it one of the greatest accomplishments in film since some French bloke thought placing pictures next to each other would look groovy, would be quite apt. This title must, of course, be ascribed to the trilogy in its entirety, for it is all a single masterpiece. But ROTK has that one little thing the other two parts by definition cannot have: the payoff. Both Fellowship and Towers, while brilliant in their own respects, in fact merely exist to bring us to this point. As Gandalf states, the great battle of our time. And by Jove, what a battle it was. Visually as well as emotionally rich and tense beyond anything your nerves will be able to bear, the action set pieces in ROTK will blow you out of the water so far you'll reach the shores of Valinor before you can thank a single Maori at the Oscars. As amazing and stunning the settings, armies, costumes and CGI (Gollum/Sméagol being just so damn good you can't help but seeing him as an actor rather than a special effect), it's the heart of the story that'll draw you in. These are characters you've all come to care about, and you feel that they're putting everything on the line here to fight for what they believe in (yes, I also am a firm believer in non-annihilation-of-human-race-by-way-of-Dark-Lord). There is a sense of despair permeated throughout this film as opposed to the somewhat gung-ho adventures of the Fellowship in the first and (although to a much lesser extent) the second film. Even Gimli and Pippin seem to be somewhat dampened in spirit, given the fact they were the previous two films' funnymen. Dire straits, indeed. As in the previous two films, the actors are splendid in their roles, with no exception. This time though, the spotlight is for Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's country bumpkin gardener. He practically single-handedly personifies LOTR's recurrent themes of friendship, loyalty, bravery beyond duty, and love. Because of this, many believe him to be the true hero of the saga. That is, of course, a matter of personal opinion, though it is one I will gladly share. It is not without its minor shortcomings however (albeit very minor ones). The decision to exclude Saruman from the theatrical cut may have been a wise one pacing-wise, but as a rabid Christopher Lee fan, I thought it somewhat diminished the film. To put a more objective view on this, my mother after the film asked me 'what happened to Christopher Lee'. Maybe a lot of people who didn't read the book or aren't intent on buying the extended editions wonder(ed) the same thing. The end credits song by Annie Lennox is also the weakest of the three, in my humble opinion. I will admit it has grown a bit on me since the first time I heard it, though Annie's practical screaming of some verses still has me cringing. But by God man, don't let that stop you from experiencing ROTK or indeed, LOTR as a whole. Moments to watch out for in ROTK being: Pippin's song intercut with Faramir's death charge, 'For Frodo', the Ride of the Rohirrim, Eowyn (yes, there's nothing following that), Denethor's fall, the Lighting of the Beacons, and ANYTHING remotely surrounding Mount Doom. A lot has been made of the seemingly endless endings this film has, but I assure you, they are all in actuality one. They are not 'off-topic' or what have you, for they still pertain the matter of Frodo and the Ring (in this case Frodo's not being able to shake off its effects and needing to find peace sailing West). The only segment of the endings that you could find off-topic is Sam's coming home from the Grey Havens, and that hardly lasts two minutes. You've just sat through a three hour plus film, you'll be able to sit through two more minutes, won't you? P.S. Legolas kills an Olyphaunt. It looks cool.
10.0~WOW! Great! Goose bumps on goose bumps! stephen-stallebrass Sign in Permalink WOW what an experience. From the moment the New Line Cinema logo comes on followed by the Lord Of The Rings title to that great intro music that accompanies it the hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end. I was brimming with anticipation and excitement, my clapping and cheering were met at first with laughter but then everyone started to join in. I had eagerly awaited this moment since the Fellowship of the Ring and we were all in for the greatest cinematic experience of our lives, one that we will never forget. All went quiet and the movie began. I was like a child opening my presents on Christmas morning I was so excited, and this feeling never left me for the entire film. Shivers ran down my spine, even the goose bumps all over my body had goose bumps. I found I was unable to stop myself from crying like a baby, laughing and cheering with joy, sadness and pride as well as sighing with relief. I cannot remember ever feeling this way in a cinema before. The 3 1/2 hours or so that it was on went by like the blink of an eye, now the movie had come to an end I felt sad that it was all over but extremely overwhelmed by how amazingly brilliant this was and how much I enjoyed it. I will definitely be buying the extended DVD to join my other two special editions and enjoy this trilogy over and over again for ever more. But until then I will continue wearing my shorts even in the cold, as I did on this occasion when I saw this first showing, and see it several more times in the cinema and love it as much as I did this first time I saw it. I just can't wait to see what Peter Jackson will treat us to in the extended edition of Return of the King, and I look forward to the Lord Of The Rings exhibition in London. I guarantee that this will be talked about for many many years to come and will grow in our hearts to become the greatest piece of film ever made!!!
10.0~A brilliant adaptation of the Tolkien masterpiece bjmilhist Sign in Permalink A brilliant adaptation of the Tolkien masterpiece--The Return of the King is a fitting end to the great film epic of our time. My favorite scenes in the movie are the lighting of the beacons, the muster of the Rohirrim and the arrival of the Rohirrim at the Pelennor outside of Minas Tirith. Of special note, I loved Bernard Hill's Theoden, the king of Rohan, and Miranda Otto's Eowyn. I also liked Jackson's subtle but obvious homages to other classic films in the trilogy--when the orcs leave Minas Morgul, I had a sudden vision of flying monkeys, and of course, the more obvious reference to Triumph of the Will in the Two Towers, and even Henry V (Tolkien was not quite up to St Crispan's Day, but Jackson created somewhat pallid, but stirring speeches at the Pelennor and before the Black Gate from his writings). I must give high praise to the film and all involved in the film--they captured the spirit of Tolkien.
10.0~Love It beckrbug Sign in Permalink I love The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I have read all the books that the movie was based on as well as "The Hobbit". The Shire is lovely and I wish I could live there! Anyway, as one who has gotten through the books (phew!) I can safely say that the movies are more attractive and will catch your attention with more ease. The books were so dry. The movies, on the other hand, were visually stimulating from the sweet Shire to Rivendale and even the Dead Marshes, etc. The DVD is supposed to have additional scenes which were left out from the book (such as TOM!). I will buy them as a boxed set. SEE THIS MOVIE!
10.0~All time Favorite Movie FrankiePaloma Sign in Permalink Lord Of The Rings Franchise is my all time favorite movie!
10.0~10++++++ pmcilvaine Sign in Permalink I adored this movie. If it doesn't get an Oscar for Best Picture, something is very rotten in La La Land. It was uniformly superb. The battle scenes were stunning. I got dizzy watching them! I applaud Peter Jackson and the rest of the Fellowship.
10.0~There and "never" back again bkutlu Sign in Permalink This is one of those unique moments where nothing can truly express how one feels.In fact the second in my life. The first was when my wife said yes to me in a wedding ceremony. The second is this. When I had watched the Shire unfold before my eyes in the Fellowship of The Ring, I had uncontrollably started crying. My utmost cherished Middle Earth was there in front of my eyes, every place, every character as I had imagined them to be. The white screen, a window into a beloved priceless land. I was there and I had never really been anywhere else since then. The Two Towers and now The Return of the King. A moment I had waited not for three years but for 20 or more.Ever since I turned the cover of a really old copy of the Lord of The Rings. A moment I also dreaded for so long. Now the journey is over. The memory of it will remain even to my dying day. Thank you J.R.R.Tolkien for letting us step into a world so reminiscent of our own yet where honour, friendship, love and loyalty could actually result in something greater then ourselves. "The world is what we make of it" and if it can make you smile there up in the heavens -for I sure believe you are there- we will do our best with the time given us. You may be sure of that. Thank you Mr. Jackson and all the actors and every single being included in the production, may you get all that you deserve, I wish I could offer you more then my numerous admission fees to the theaters and my eternal gratitude. There is no real return-favour for what you have given us all. Thank you Mr. Shore for your music is still and will be ringing in my ears as long as I live, reminding me of the spirit triumphant over all thrown in its way. As hard as I try right now I will not be able to express my feelings as I said before.. But I know only this. I am not the only one. Not the only one changed. Not the only one lost. Not the only one there and "never" back again..
8.0~Jackson's Trilogy Ends TheHande Sign in Permalink Jackson's adaption of the Lord of the Rings has been an excellent series of movies and my expectations were rather high for the third part. This is where the biggest weakness in Jackson's films strikes back. After sitting through two movies that were nearly 3 hours, I have to watch one more that is more than 3 hours. It's times like these that I wish that Jackson could've given me a break. And that's just the regular version, I have no desire to see the "full-cut" of this picture. While "Fellowship of the Ring" was quite charming and "The Two Towers" a great action-packed film, Return of the King seems just a tad over-blown. Sure, there was a lot of warring in the book too, but this movie never stood out from the other two in any particular way. Though it has those nice little Jackson-moments, they tend to get lost in a film as big as this. I was also a little disappointed that some aspects of the plot (mainly Saruman's fate) are never really discussed. Once we get pass these I have to admit that many parts of the movie were most impressive and it is a great film and a must-see if you've already seen the first two. Regardless, I still feel it falls short of the first two.
4.0~Unimpressed oarch Sign in Permalink The movie is mostly a sequence of events with each bluntly announced before it occurs. I did not read the book so I had no idea what was going to happen, but at no point was I surprised. No twists in this one. After 6 hours of the previous 2 movies, I would expect I would familiarize with characters and actually give a f*** about them, but they were all way too one-dimensional even after another 3 hours. It would have been an OK movie if it wasn't for the incredibly cheesy, homo-erotic and, worst of all, overloooong long ending. 6/10.
9.0~A fantastic end to one of the best trilogies of all time Macleanie Sign in Permalink A fantastic end to one of the best trilogies of all time. A spectacular masterpiece in writing by Tolkien and equally fantastic achievement bringing it to the big screen. This was a worthy ending, full of drama and action. As the epic reached its peak it was a joy to see this story come to its close. From start to finish it was exhilarating. This is perfect narrative and perfect cinema. The Return of the King is so well balanced, and action sequences are again enthralling. Its difficult to choose between this and Two Towers but this could be the best in the trilogy just for nailing every aspect of what makes Peter Jacksons LOTR so great.
10.0~Great for me, BUT i am an fan of the genre predicaoctavian Sign in Permalink For me this movie had everything i excepted. I loved it and i'm thinking about how it would had been great if i could had seen the extended edition of all 3 parts in a single day marathon in a cinema. I think everyone has a favorite movie in his life. A movie they will see as many times as they're hearth will desire, like in an evening they don't have anything else to do, they will see that movie. For me that movie, was Commando, back when i was little and we where using a VCR (i doubt the smart phone generation has any idea what that is) to see movies, but that faded like in a summer. So the general idea is that every time i do not have what to do and have enough spare time and i do not need to wake up in the morning i am seeing this movie. If i have more time or days in which i calculate i can see them, i see the entire trilogy one movie after another. And it has been 12 years from when i saw this movie first. Am i crazy? or is the movie too great.
10.0~For once, a fantastic movie that surpasses the excellent book bluesky-23 Sign in Permalink I was first introduced to the Lord of the Rings in high school. I read through the entire trilogy and loved it so much I immediately read it through again, back to back. Whenever I love a book (and am very familiar with it), I tend not to fall in love with the movie. I think, "that was a pretty good adaptation," or I dislike certain elements of it, or I don't like it at all. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens changed all that. For the first time I love the movies even more, if that's possible since the books are the original, than the books. It was a love which grew over time and multiple viewings, that finally caused me to realize that here was something I never tired of. Not ever. I could buy extended versions of the movies, listen to hours of commentary, watch hours of behind-the-scene footage, and never be bored. Why? First of all, the casting in the movies is exceptional. I would not change one of the actors if I could. They will forever define the characters for me; they fill the roles and work together in a way that no one else could. It is a shame there is no Oscar for Best Ensemble Cast; if ever a cast deserved it, this one did. But the key to the success of these movies is their emotional heart and soul. Peter Jackson understood this (see Heavenly Creatures) and took the spirit of the books, rather than the literal letter, and made it work on film. The brilliance of the writing and direction on this gargantuan project cannot be underestimated. To the book purists: write a screenplay, pick up a camera, and do a better job yourself. I cannot imagine how it could have been done better. In fact, in many places, Jackson and co. improve upon the original by streamlining it, simplifying it, and making the whole story more logical. Finally, Howard Shore's beautiful soundtrack is so emotional, evocative, and memorable that the movie without it is unimaginable. My favorite movie (all three together) of all time. What more can I say?
9.0~The Amazing Ring Go's on and on Buddybaba Sign in Permalink It's possible that over twelve hours in one day was too much for my brain to handle but after having seen the LOTR trilogy today my favorite LOTR is still narrowly, the Fellowship. This is not to say that Return of the King didn't blow me away, it did. The problem was that I think Jackson didn't want it to ever end. There are multiple times during the final twenty minutes that said well that was great now it's over and it weakened a very beautiful finale, IMHO. Just shortening some of those goodbye scenes by a little would have helped a lot. That being said I still rated it 9 out of ten because this is one of the most exciting and beautifully filmed movies I have every seen. The battle sequences were incredible. I will see it again. I wonder what the director's cut of this will look like. Hopefully not more endings.
2.0~One of the most over-rated movies of all time. It drug on FOREVER. End it and hour earlier and i might think it's bearable. ddawgsutes Sign in Permalink Sorry, but how can people rate this movie so high? It's the worst of the 3 in this trilogy and definitely not an Oscar movie in any way. I enjoyed the trilogy to some extent and read the books as a teen but this movie was a huge disappointment. Please be warned if you want to watch this, it's sooooo long you prob need to watch it over multiple days to bear it.
10.0~the best ysfcyln Sign in Permalink The best movie I've watched. better than the book they are among the rare they did
10.0~The Perfect End to the Greatest Trilogy of All-time infenity Sign in Permalink What can I say about this film that others haven't said a million times before in more eloquent prose? Return of the King was beautiful and exhilarating in a way that few films are nowadays, much less huge Hollywood blockbusters such as this one. The sheer over-powering emotion and visual grandeur of it all is, in my honest opinion, second to none. . .and now, looking at these films as a whole, I cannot for one second imagine a greater trilogy of films ever being created in this or any other dimension ever again. The Lord of the Rings will stand the test of time as being an unrivaled cinematic masterpiece that's both bold and brilliant; magical, and yet grounded in humanity.
10.0~The best movie ever einar-35526 Sign in Permalink This is the best movie i have ever seen of all time
1.0~Hype much? - Spoilers spikethebloody Sign in Permalink ROTK is one of the most hyped movies of all time. I think that it is also the most personally disappointing movie i have ever watched. I was so excited to see this film. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. The first blow came when instead of showing the white wizard Sauroman's demise we open the film with something from the hobbit...Gollum's backstory. This made me mad because i was told that Sauroman was cut because they didn't want to dwell on Two Towers. Apparently they didn't mind dwelling on the Hobbit. So what you have in Return of the King is a villianous army with no general. No main villian save for Sauron who is only in the film as a spirit only. What you have as the main villian is a bunch of stunt guys in very good costumes. The action is fine in the film but Aragorn just doesn't sell his part well IMHO. His leaving to find the ghost army is waaaaaaay understated. Legolas and Gimli are made into nothing more than his stooges who look assuringly at him whenever he has doubt. Frodo/Sam/Gollum on the other hand give great performances and are the only bright spot of the film. Although i think Sheloub was a huge disappointment and did not live up to the hype preceding the film. The ghost army looks like scooby doo animators drew it and the action scenes involving them are all wide sky shots where you can't see what is going on. The multiple endings are also a plod along as the movie stops, starts, stops, starts, and finally comes to a end long after i was ready to leave. The movie just overall disappointed me greatly.
10.0~The most beautiful movie in cinema history. andreychelsea8 Sign in Permalink This movie is a must watch for any and every person, no matter the race or gender. The only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. It's quite depressing. I have watched this movie at least once a new year, and ever road trip. It's very entertaining, kills time, inspiring, awesome action scenes and the work on the Uruk-Hai and the other beasts is incredible. As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. This film is so much more than a simple "fantasy" epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been. This is probably the best movie ever made. If there was a rating higher than 10, i would give it. EXCELLENT 10/10.
10.0~Not Perfect, But Brilliant None The Less Kimberwyn Sign in Permalink With choppy moments and a few drawn out pauses at the beginning, The Return of the King is not a perfect film, but it is nothing short of a brilliant and entertaining film. And I will admit, I had to see this film twice before making an overall evaluation of it. King loses the pacing and flow that the first and most notably the second film had. What stops it from living up to its predecessor, The Two Towers, is climax. That film built up slowly, but surely, to its epic battle sequence, and finished it off beautifully. This film zips from scene to scene and rushes into not one, but two battle sequences without much of a breather in between. The film also lacks a beautiful, triumphant moment, such as when Gandalf led the Rohirrim down the hill to defeat Saruman's band of orcs in TTT. Yes, the film has faults, but the film makes up for it in many ways. This film had more elements of suspense and was creepier than any horror film I have seen in ages. The giant spider scene, which had to be one of my favorite parts, was thoroughly eerie, and definetly not for the squimish! And despite its many endings, which could have been tied up a bit neater, the film ended on just the right note. It is an ending that would give even the most emotionally detached person the sniffles. 8/10
10.0~The lord of the rings: The return of the king transylvania-d-o-o Sign in Permalink Now, after about 9 and a half years after we first watched The lord of the rings: the return of the king, I and my friends decided to have a Tolkien movie marathon, watching The lord of the ring's trilogy and The hobbit. As much as i adore Tolkien's book and Jackson's movies this is my absolute favorite. This is it you now, THE war, Sauron's fall and Aragorn becoming king. The top of the movie, the absolute thrill is the arrival of the dead commanded by Aragorn and it's just a joyful felling watching them through Minas Tirith killing orcs. The cast is great, but my favorite is Sir Ian Mckellan. I thin he should have won an Oscar for this role. Hope that The Hobbit 2 and 3 will be better. Absolute success for Jackson, for that he has found inspiration in Tolkiens book, cause i don't think anybody else would have given us movies and cast as good as it is now.. so for that BRAVO! Cant't wait for the second Hobbit movie :p
9.0~Return of the King adith-39480 Sign in Permalink A king who finally earn his right thrown , Peter Jackson's final installment in his monumental "The Lord of the Rings" represents that filmmaking rarity - a third part of a trilogy that is decisively the best of the lot. With epic conflict, staggering battles, super landscapesand effects, and resolved character arcs all leading to a dramatic conclusion to more than nine hours of masterful storytelling, "The Return of the King" is an urgently paced 200-minute film without an ounce of fat - until unfortunate multiple endings that go on and on, as if Jackson couldn't bear to let go. Again unlike other trilogy finales, this one will rank with its predecessors at the box office, where the first two entries have generated $1.786 billion internationally. Ancillary benefits from various versions and packaging will issue forth close to forever.
10.0~Cinema's greatest Trilogy? ThermalHeat Sign in Permalink The end has come and it was awesome. who would have ever thought that a 3 and a half hour long movie would not put u to sleep but this did it. The ending was a little gay but the as a whole the movie had me. many thirlogy's have come before, but the plan trilogy of lord of the rings is spectacular, truly an event any time and every time u see one, two, or all three of them. it was really worth the cash
10.0~Nothing but praise withingtonian Sign in Permalink Talk about saving the best until last. This final instalment rounds off the trilogy to perfection. Traditionalists may bemoan the omission of certain minor characters and events but the film nevertheless manages to brilliantly convey the philosophy of the story and its emotional and dramatic conclusion. 10 out of 10.
10.0~10 out of 10 blackknight-39-908599 Sign in Permalink Probably one of the few perfect movies out there, it has the perfect casting, perfect sets and perfect visuals (for that year of course). Some may say this movie has multiple ending however since it has a lot of characters it will be unfair to see endings for some and not the others, the return of the king is the kind of movie that deserves and requires this ending. one of the things that got my attention in part 3 is king Theoden and how the character developed and change from part 2 (especially the speech scene). For anyone out there that hasn't seen the Lord of the Ring trilogy yet, I highly recommend a movie marathon, you wont regret it.
4.0~a war flick that outstays its welcome mheuermann Sign in Permalink Quite clearly, this must be the most overrated film of all time. Right, if you are into special effects and fancy dresses, you get treated to some eye candy, but does this really justify three hours of nearly plot less costume drama. Halfway through the film it struck me that this is nothing more than some kind of violent war movie. Basically you get extremely tiring and brutal battle scenes that alternate with extremely tiring and boring dialog (usually one of the participants is dying, which makes communication a tad tedious). While 'Fellowship of the Ring' still had some humorous elements and a bit of a storyline, the third part comes across as a show reel for what computer animation can do today. But even that is not fully convincing. That little mutant that guides Frodo and his mate up the mountain remains a virtual character through most of his movements. As all the prime movers have already been established, the carnage starts annoyingly early. But hey, why bother at all with giving the cast some depth? As all the good guys are very cute, noble, good looking and dashing and all the bad ones are extremely ugly, mean, evil and nasty, every protagonist remains positively one dimensional. The condemnable moral being that ugly beings can't be nice. Well, being hardly a handsome object myself, I take offense to that. But what I really object to is the glorification of violence that is present throughout those excruciating 192 minutes, combined with unbearably stagy dialog to justify it. Hey, killing can be great fun. Though to give the director his due, this might not be Jackson's fault, but Tolkien's. However, no reason to like this monstrosity any better. Maybe I'm just a bit old fashioned but everything I like about films, i.e. great acting, an intricate script, an unpredictable plot, imaginative camera-work and clever editing is conspicuously absent here. I liked the fight with the giant spider though. Only for escapists.
10.0~There are no better screen images in cinema deastman_uk Sign in Permalink I'm not really tempted to spend any time talking about the plot, the acting or the general film making because what you see on the screen around and during the battles is truly amazing. It really is in a completely different class to any images I've seen in a movie. One scene sticks in my mind. A mad king, on fire, jumps off the top of his palace atop a city tower and the camera pans back to view the battlefield below which he descends into. I have no clue as to how this was even conceived. The city that the battle takes place around is in itself better than any of the creations thus far in the trilogy, and those were all stunning. When the invading army uses a huge catapult to throw rocks at the walls, you want to go for your mobile and phone a World Heritage representative to have the war stopped immediately. Only when the effects descend to normal levels do you remember that you are just watching a film. I am not trying to undermine the film by focusing on on what is, after all, some form of CGI, but we are talking about persistent images that go some way beyond anything seen in a film so far. The work here is not by a few hard working technical guys working with an art brief. This is visual landmark.
5.0~incredible production but a poor adaptation andy-188 Sign in Permalink A lot of people have called this a masterpiece, and I guess so many people can't be wrong. However, this movie just did not work for me at all. When I look at the stills in the promotional books I see an incredible movie. The artwork and passion of the production crew is amazing. But unfortunately we got few opportunities to dwell on these efforts. In far too many scenes the camera was constantly moving in grand cinematic flourishes, with the effect that many of the scenes were often blurred and shaky. Worse, in the battle scenes the "shake and bash" camera style was used excessively. There was so much artistry in the sets and costumes, but it was spoiled by the constant camera motion and often ugly post-production. I also found the score to be incredibly intrusive, melancholy, and boring. I thought the screenplay was very clumsy, with a lot of the added dialogue feeling inferior to the original. I was particularly turned off by Jackson's attempts to increase the excitement of every scene, to the point that was going on no longer had any credibility. If the bad guys are obviously unbeatable, then there's no sense of jeopardy any more. It all starts to feel phony and unbelievable. Jackson added a lot of scenes that were just excuses to show fights or special effects. These obviously increased the excitement for many, but not for me. Although I loved some of the deviations in the first movies, this time around the plot changes felt emotionally manipulative or like excuses for more special effects. People are calling this a masterpiece, but really it's just a great original story dressed up with a lot of special effects and dumb fight scenes. Which is sad, because with the obvious passion and talent that went into these movies, they could easily have been great.
9.0~A satisfying conclusion. MovieGuy109 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings finally comes to an end with this installment. An overwhelmingly powerful epic with soaring production values, top notch battle scenes, and the sense of adventure that made Tolkien so popular and these films so great. The climax is especially memorable amidst the whole thing's sheer power. Not since Star Wars has a Hollywood blockbuster had so powerful a following. This resembles Star Wars in many ways but it is its own technical accomplishment and I am sure Tolkien would be proud of what Jackson has crafted out of his writing. 3 hours have never passed so fast before.
10.0~good,better,best! alexandru101 Sign in Permalink If you have seen the first two movies and you are a tolkien fan as i am,you'll never think how good this movie is!You got to see it... Every character is making his best movie from the triologi and the war for the ring has begn already but...it ends...paine,emotions and fears together with a good picture and efects presents you LOTR:the return of the king.The end for Tolkiens story...

To the end I wanna say one last thing...I tryed to convince you that this movie is the best bur i failed..Is up to you if you want to see it or not..But is worth it!
10.0~Fantastic! tobbah Sign in Permalink I started reading the books shortly after watching "Fellowship of the ring". I completely fell in love with the story and all the people involved. I must say that based on the fantastic book by Tolkien I think that Jackson has made an absolutely brilliant film. The filming, the actors, the details and effects are all a real bulls eye. Everything in this movie is well done. And I mean every little detail! Jackson has thought of everything! Even though the story is slightly different then in the book he still managed to keep the Tolkien magic alive. All the Oscars and so on are well deserved! 10/10. - Best movie I have seen so far!
10.0~One of the greatest Modern Epics of our time. Antisun Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is the third and last chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, a landmark in epic movie-making for the 21st century. Director/Producer Peter Jackson has, without a doubt, compiled a vast story into a masterful film with great story telling, great action sequences, and astounding special effects. The Return of the King offers a greater appreciation of all three films as a whole, and it is truly a masterpiece. Peter Jackson deserves an Oscar for his remarkable achievements. What sets The Return of the King apart from its predecessors is its attention to battles of great spectacle while emphasizing on character development and finally concentrating more on the hobbits, contrary to the second film which strayed from that story line. While there exists this epic struggle between the forces of good and evil, The Return of the King doesn't stray from friendship, hope, betrayal, union, and other major themes evident in the first film. The special effects are truly amazing in The Return of the King, not only in fabricating huge battle sequences, and beautiful environments, which draw in the viewer, almost making it seem that you are in the depth of the action, but also in creating Shelob, and immense spider and of course, the remarkable cgi animation used to create Gollum, seeming almost indifferent from any other `real' character. My only complaint about this movie was the multiple fake endings, and the dragged closure of the film. But, none the less, what an incredible closure it was! The Return of the King preserves the original captivating experience of the first film with style, imagination, and storytelling while surpassing the epic proportions of the second film, making it definitely the best film of the three. Writing the script and directing the movie as a whole, instead of in parts with such stroke of genius has made the Lord of the Rings one of the greatest epic masterpieces of our time.
10.0~The Best Movie Ever sixxbach Sign in Permalink The perfect ending of the best epic movie in the history. Do not try to compare the first, or the second movie with this, you must see it as a 10 hours movie. Sorry there is no Lord of the rings next year...DAMM!!!!!
9.0~Fantastic! petarmatic Sign in Permalink Please note that I already wrote a review for this title but for some reason it did not make it to my review list. So here we go again. This is definitely one of the best films from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. There are so many excellent reviews about this film that I have not much to add. Visual effects are excellent, plot is excellent, acting is excellent. There is nothing else you can do then just lay back and enjoy a masterpiece like this. My friend who does not like the films in general actually bought dvds with all three of the Lord of Rings films. So it is a must see!
10.0~better!!! whatduyamean Sign in Permalink they are right the third is best even if you dont think its possible go prove yourself wrong! *spoiler* the best part is the elephant scene especially with Legolas and Gimli.
1.0~Very Good... but not the best jiromba Sign in Permalink I just got home... and I must say that I am not as satisfied as I thought I would be. The film is very good... but, in my opinion, is far way to be considered the best of the trilogy. Both previous movies were more intense than this one. The battle scenes are awesome... but... the "rest" is very slow and quite difficult to stand for three and a half hour. The ending is boring... and that scene where Legolas beats a Mummakill... C'mon!!! What does an army stands for, if a single elf, can handle such beast ?????? A third part of a trilogy which is in the 3rd place.
10.0~Flawed, but undeniably brilliant simonbobin Sign in Permalink I saw The Return of the King last night and when it had ended my initial feelings were one of disappointment, especially since people had been labelling it one of the greatest films of all time. This, I'm afraid, it is not. It certainly IS the most complete film of the three pictures and features some of the finest acting, most spectacular scenery (I'm referring to the awesome beacon lighting sequence etc), some truly breathtaking action sequences (the attack of the Army of the Dead) and includes some of the scariest moments of the trilogy. The stand out performance for me was undoubtedly Sean Astin's, and his performance is so brave, heroic and genuinely touching that he almost steals the film from the true king, Aragorn - Viggo Mortensen excellent as ever. But whilst this film is one that will go down in history as one of the great epics, it still has its flaws. Firstly, there is no recognisable, tangible face to the 'baddie'. Sure, we have the ever watchful eye of Sauron, but its just a big eye for godsakes. I wish he could have taken the form of the figure we see in the first five minutes of Fellowship during that final battle. Denethor is the only character that is a notable bad figure and he is on the GOOD side. Indeed, Saruman is sorely missed but hopefully his scenes will be reinstated in the EE. Secondly, the film is too long at 3h12m. I felt the ending would have had more impact were it to end with the coronation of Aragorn. The stuff with the Shire at the end could have been left to the imagination. Overall, however, this is a film that simply demands repeat viewings - it is impossible to take it all in first time round. A fantastic, towering achievement that leaves you gasping for breath, it rounds off the greatest trilogy ever to grace celluloid . If this doesnt win Best Picture at the Oscars next year, I will never be able to take the Academy seriously again. 10 out of 10
10.0~The best movie I have seen... ever. c_odonnell Sign in Permalink At 10:30 PM, on December 17, 2003, I began viewing The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I absolutely fell in love with it instantly. It is quite possibly the best film I have ever (and will ever)see in my life. After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, it became my all-time favorite film. The Two Towers left me a tad disappointed that I had to wait another year for the end of it. The Return of the King had me almost crying in my seat. To me, these films are that great. One thing that The Return of the King has to offer that that the other films don't is that this one is much more character driven. I believe that both Mortensen and Astin should both be given a nod in acting as far as Oscars go. The two, along with Mc Kellen and Wood, delivered amazing performances. This truly is, and will remain, a remarkable film in my opinion. As I said before, it is quite possibly the best film ever made. It even surpasses such films as The Godfather (both parts I and II). Granted, the Godfather films are excellent pieces of cinema, and they do have much to offer. However, The Return of the King worked so many of my emotions. The Godfather films (and many others) fail to deliver on that "emotional diversity". There is no front that this third installment does not deliver on. It was very well directed on Peter Jackson's part. It also had a large number of beautiful shots, as well as that action portion to satisfy the crave for Man versus Orc action. All and all, The Return of the King is an absolutely amazing, heart-pounding, emotional ride of a film. Even still, none of what I have said in these comments does this film justice.
9.0~Magnificent, spellbinding, intense, and imperfect 0rganism Sign in Permalink This movie marks a major achievement, not just by Peter Jackson & co (who surely deserve some serious Oscarly consideration), but by the film industry as a whole. Many have tried to do cinematic justice to Tolkien's famous books, and so far this is the only real triumph. Just as in the previous two LotR movies, there is a remarkable attention to detail combined with a vast scope that truly stand out. Not to say that it is flawless -- one can certainly question the placement or existence of certain scenes as opposed to what was omitted. Nor is it 100% true to the storyline of the books -- it is not. Some of the scenes seem rushed, others drawn out needlessly. Nitpickers and armchair quarterbacks can certainly have their fun. But they will not be the only people having fun. Overall, this is a thoroughly satisfying theatre experience which ought to be experienced on a big screen. I have seen at least one review where an angst-ridden critic says "skip the movie and get the DVD". Such people do a public disservice, perhaps in hope of shortening the lines at their local multiplex. For this is an epic film that deserves its box-office popularity, and should be taken in with the wide screen and powerful sound system of a quality theatre. Don't let the naysayers fool you, this is the best movie around right now. Those three hours will speed by like a minute to the mind, if not to the buttocks. The battle at Minas Tirith is particularly intense, as is the climb to Cirith Ungol. You'll ride with the Rohirrim, fly with the Nazgul, and suffer with the ringbearer on the slopes of Mt. Doom. My life is a little more complete for having seen Tolkien's vision expressed by Peter Jackson's films. Warning: DO NOT BRING BABIES TO THIS MOVIE! 'Nuff said about that. 9/10, with the option to revise upward once the extended edition arrives.
10.0~Delivers on the promise of greatness emmazdad Sign in Permalink Just finished seeing the midnight showing of the premier of Lord of the Rings: The Return Of The King. FANTASTIC! The film really delivers on the promise of greatness built up by the first two movies. Having read the book many times, there are a few minor quibbles, but overall the movie was spectacular. I can't remember when a 3+ hour movie went by so fast. The battle for Gondor was breathtaking. There will be some comparison with the Hoth battle in The Empire Strikes Back, but still, it was sheer delight. I can't wait to see it again with my wife and daughter. 10/10!
10.0~You're all in for a treat dmcard01 Sign in Permalink If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're all in for a hell of a treat. Words are inadequate to convey the range of emotions I have just experienced while watching this masterpiece of cinema. If this movie doesn't earn best picture at the academy awards then a grave injustice will have been committed.
10.0~By far the best of the trilogy and the one that will go down in history McManniss316 Sign in Permalink The greatest of the three Lord of the Rings movies and one that will blow your mind. It shows how much hard work went into this trilogy and it shows. I cannot give any higher praise. As a filmmaker i know that Peter Jackson and his team did something no one else ever has and probably wont for a long time to come. Its THE trilogy to end all trilogies. Superb filmmaking. A+
10.0~The Greatest Fantesy Story On All The Time mk_sabet Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings written by professor John Ronald Rule Tolkien is the greatest fantasy story on all the time. Peter Jackson with his visual effect group really went very close to what Tolkien try to show to mankind. Dark Lord is very like Hitler. I think the World War 2 influence on the Tolkien works and made him to show the future history after the war. A Habbit Bilbo Baggins find a ring from the mystery mountains . He take the ring from Gulum who killed his friend for her love (the ring) many years ago. A wizard (Gandolf the gray) find out the ring is The Dark Lord lost ring .one ring for rule them all . In my country (Iran) The Lord of the Rings is the top movie for the peoples. I saw all of three part of the Lord of the Rings and read all of them. I think The Fellowship of the Rings is better than The Two Towers and The Return of the King .But The Visual effect is improve on the Return of the King. However I offer that you see this great movie.
8.0~Impressive final film in wonderful trilogy rosscinema Sign in Permalink This is the third and final film (For now, anyway) in the infamous J.R.R. Tolkien stories and its hard to argue that this may be the best of the three. The first film introduced the characters and took its time setting up the story while the second film was highlighted by a battle sequence in a place called Helms Deep. This film picks up the journey of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) who are being led by Gollum (Andy Serkis) who is suppose to lead them to Mount Doom where Frodo is to throw the Ring into the volcano but Gollum wants it and is secretly instigating events that will split Frodo and Sam. While this is going on three battles take place that will hopefully give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring and these battles will keep the Eye of Sauron busy. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) head to Gondor while Merry (Dominic Monaghan) stays with Eowyn (Miranda Otto) at Rohan. With the army of Orc's heading to Minas Tirith in great numbers Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) go to the Cursed Mountains to try and persuade the ghosts to come fight with them so that their souls will be redeemed. *****SPOILER ALERT***** Once again director Peter Jackson has given us a film so technically and visually stimulating that it would have to be classified as a special effects masterpiece. The scenes where actors and built sets are blended together with computer digital effects are so impressive that it's at times hard to notice what is real and what isn't. There are so many events and creatures all put into this film that you come to realize that this is really technically brilliant. The giant spider that attacks Frodo, the creatures that resemble elephants and every battle scene are exquisitely filmed. As far as the performances go Astin gives the film the humanity that it needed and his special bond with Frodo is very evident. Even when the power of the Ring tries to take him over his friendship with Frodo is what convinces him to do the right thing. In a film so blanketed with special effects Astin's performance is the touch of reality. So while I admit that this is arguably one of the most technically proficient films ever made I still ask myself "Is this a great film"? The answer is yes but its not great like "The Godfather" or any other great film that deals with real characters and real events. As far as movie making and all the technical aspects its easy to say that it's great but it's not of the same caliber as say "Citizen Kane" or "Schindler's List". I think we should be careful as to what films we label as great. One of the flaws in these films is the lack of depth for the female characters. Otto's character comes off the best but the so-called romance between Aragorn and Arwen was never convincing. But this is nit-picking because Jackson is an incredible filmmaker and what he has created with these three films is really a landmark in cinema. Everything that he and his fantastic crew of genius's have done has in some manner changed the way certain films are to be made. These three impressive films demonstrate great storytelling and filmmaking and they are now part of history. I have heard some talk about Jackson maybe filming "The Hobbit" which actually came first. With Jackson at the helm I can envision that film becoming part of cinema history as well!
10.0~one is not enough... LTJ99 Sign in Permalink the funny thing is is that I left the the first time slightly dissapointed, then when I saw it the second time I worked out why, I just wasnt capable of taking in all the subtleties and nuances in one sitting, second time around it became argubly the best film I have ever seen, and without doubt my fave. (for the record,the other arguable best film is Schlindlers List, which I MOST definetly didnt want to see a second time...)
10.0~Very, VERY good. HiMyNameIsAlisha Sign in Permalink It's REALLY good. Every single thing about this movie is cool. It's my number one favourite movie of all time. ( Well actually, the entire TRILOGY together is my favourite number one movie of all time. ) There's no swearing or nudity. I still don't recommend it for the younger audience because there are some slightly frightening scenes, though. But anybody over eleven shouldn't be bothered. I don't recommend it for arachnophobia, because it might give them a heart attack. Anyways, this movie has an excellent beginning and a wonderful ending. And everything in the middle is great, too. BY ALL MEANS RENT IT, but make sure you watch the two first movies first.
10.0~Hail to the King karenlynn1 Sign in Permalink The third and final installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to life bigger, and bolder than the first two. Director Peter Jackson and company held nothing back when it came to CGI, special effects, gorgeous landscapes, and breathtaking cinematography. Fans most familiar with Tolkien's famed novels would take note of changes made in the interest of keeping the film short (as with it's two prior films), but he stuck close enough the main story and brought it to its destined conclusion. He didn't water down the scene where Frodo finally gets to Mt. Doom in order to get rid of The One Ring once and for allin fact it packs quite the punch. The way that scene was intermingled with the battle footage heightened the emotional level of the scene as well as the excitement. The actors deserve praise as well. Viggo Mortensen reminds us of what a hero truly is, with his performance as Aragorn, the man who would become King of Gondor. Sir Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf the White, bringing the Wizard to life as if he popped right out of the pages of Tolkien's novels. Elijah Wood draws us in with his portrayal as FrodoSorrowful, and weary of his travels and all of the trials he'd gone through along the way. Other noteworthy performances include those of Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchet, Miranda Otto, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Hugo Weaving, etc. I highly recommend this film (as well as it's predecessors) to anybody, regardless of whether or not you've read the novels. Of course the books are betterthey always arebut the movies are an excellent adaptation of Tolkien's wonderful tale. This film is clearly worthy of the many Oscars it has won. I easily give it a 10/10.
10.0~this was a swell film citysleeps Sign in Permalink This movie, as with the previous two, just blew my mind. It was the most Peter Jackson-esque of the 3, which was why I was surprised that it won the Oscar for Best Picture. But it deserved it, despite it's flaws, which all movies have. This was the antithesis to 'the Matrix' trilogy. Instead of starting strong and growing weaker, it truly did gain momentum with each movie. Hell, with each scene. And there was an actual payoff! This is a movie you should just see to believe. Fantastic.
10.0~Greatest movie ever... swipht1 Sign in Permalink ...is all I can say. If I were to describe what was great about this movie, my review would be 100 pages long. This movie was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't think anything will be able to top it. 10 out of 10.
10.0~Stunning Conclusion jrm-3 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is a visually and emotionally stunning conclusion to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Not only are the special effects amazing, but the story develops to a heart-pounding, emotional climax. The characters all come full circle in this movie. The most notable character in the Return of the King, surprisingly, is Sam. Sean Astin does an amazing job of showing loyalty, fear, surprise, and hope all with just his eyes. Although I'm sure his acting will go unnoticed by the Academy, he definitely deserves some recognition for his skills here. Elijah Wood once again performs magnificently as Frodo continues to spiral downward toward despair. If you watch the Fellowship of the Ring before this, you can really see the emotional impact of his journey and the toll it has taken. All of the characters are given special attention here, and they all receive satisfying storylines. (With the exception of Sarumon, who is curiously missing in this installment). I am sure a lot of people will point out differences from the text. Yes, there were a few, but I was pleased with the changes. Shelob the spider finally makes her appearance--and the suspense and special effects that accompany her are jaw dropping. The conclusion is a little different as well--AND yes, it does seem a little long. The movie continues after the climax at Mount Doom for another thirty minutes or so, but in my opinion it's all necessary. I for one would have been upset if the movie ended abruptly after Mount Doom and we didn't get a chance to see where life was taking these characters that we have grown to love now that their respective journeys have ended. Overall, this movie was fantastic. The acting, the story, the special effects, and the devotion to the imagery and genious of Tolkien were amazing. I hope the Academy finally gives Peter Jackson--and this movie--the awards they deserve!
10.0~Laughter and tears were all that I could add to this story clay_thompson Sign in Permalink rating 10 of 10 I have never been the biggest Tokien fan. I read "Hobbit" in High School, and bought the Trilogy ten years later, but had always been unable to get more than halfway through the first book. The second and third still sit on my shelf, unread, but never thrown away either. With the earlier animated versions of the story, I watched but felt unsatisfied, even though I am a huge fan of Sci-Fi and fantasy. When I learned that Peter Jackson was tapped to bring the stories to the big screen, I was intrigued by two things: he was a fan and he was committed to bringing cinematic life to Tokien's vision. While I had not been able to read the books, I always respectd Professor Tolkien's vision and purpose. I respected his values and have honored his life as I can. I knew that whoever would do well with this material would have to be someone who "got it." Peter Jackson "got it." And because he got it, we get it. I could write this using every superlative that I am capable of, but 749 other commenters have done that far better than I. What I can say is that is a world of so many "relative values" it has been an oxygen bottle of fresh air to see people. hobbits, elves and dwarves coming together to fight an overwhelming evil. It was not the city walls of Minas Tirith, or the army of the underworld, or the individual courage of an elf and a dwarf, or even a reluctant king taking up the sword of his ancestors. All played their part, and as in real life, if any had failed to do his or her very best, it all could have collapsed under its own weight. The least impressive of all of the fellowship was Sam, and while he did not have the strongest sword, or the sharpest eye, he had the biggest heart. And while he could not carry the ring he could carry ... Oops, I got away from myself. Peter Jackson, has proven himself a director of the first rank, and has accomplished what no other would ever try. He has told a story or splendor and glory, but never lost sight that these qualities rest in the heart of very human people, whether they come from the human race or not. I will always be grateful for what he has done here.
8.0~The Dusk of an Epic Trilogy stamper Sign in Permalink Contrary to my other reviews of The Lord of the Rings film, this review is based only on one screening. I have decided to do so, because on the day that I went to see The Return of the King I felt good in my skin and I could thoroughly enjoy the movie. I didn't look as closely as with the other two films at differences between the film and the book and that made the experience more pure and wholesome and therefore two screenings are not necessary to come to a conclusion about the quality of the movie. What I really loved about the movie was it's beginning. Heck that was great. One of the most fine moments in the whole of the trilogy, together with the very ending and the scenes with Shelob I presume. Those are the scenes that make the whole trip (3 hours and 21 minutes) worth while. Now almost three and a half hours may seem very long for a film, but will not seem long I can assure you, although the first hour and a half seems to pass much slower than the remaining two hours, that never got boring. Of course there are those critics that say that Peter Jackson seems to knit ending to ending to ending and that the whole becomes too ling, but I as one who has read the book, expected that and am greatly satisfied with the skill of Peter Jackson in knitting the endings together in a way that does not make the film look too lengthy. This is not too say that I am without criticism. I have some, but it just minor criticism and it criticism of the man himself (Peter Jackson). I do not want to belittle his achievement in bringing The Lord of the Rings trilogy to the screen. He has done great. The battle sequences look great (look out for the scenes with the elephants' versus the riders of Rohan), the acting is good and the directing is superb in my opinion, but he also did some things that I deem unnecessary. I could not quite put my finger on in while I was watching The Two Towers, but while I was watching The Return of the King it suddenly I could. The thing that bothered me a bit during Two Towers and even a bit more during The Return of the King were some of the dialogs (actually monologues), which reminded me of brainless action comedy's and actually added nothing to the film itself. An example of monologues like that is the counting of the victims by Gimli and Legolas or the comment Gimli has when Aragorn utters his plan to save Middle Earth. Also I felt that the burden Frodo was bearing was not emphasized enough in this film and it was slightly overshadowed' by the large amount of battle scenes. I know these are tiny things and I do not want to imply that this spoiled my viewing experience. What I want to point out by stating this, is that while The Return is definitely a good film and an improvement over The Two Towers, it is not a perfect film. At the end of this 10 hour journey I'd like to say a few things. About the trilogy in general. First of all I cannot believe how well Elijah Wood acted and carried the film. My initial reaction to his casting was: He'll ruin it.' but I have to say that he did an incredible job. The other actors did a fine job as well as did everybody who was part of this epic adventure. There are flaws (as described in my three comments including this one) in the films, but they still are good watching material. The Fellowship of the Ring is in my opinion the best film of the three (8,25 out of 10) as it is a great introduction to the world of Middle Earth and it's characters. The Two Towers was solid, but I felt that it could have been better and it is in my humble opinion the worst film of the trilogy (7,5 out of 10). Second best in the trilogy is The Return of the King, which despite above mentioned criticism is a good ending to a good trilogy. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is what I had hoped The Matrix trilogy would be. It failed. The Lord of the Rings trilogy and all involved in the making did not. Thank you for that. Oscars for: Best Art Direction-Set Decoration; Best Effects, Visual Effects; Best Cinematography and Best Makeup Nominations for: Best Picture; Best Director; Best Writing; Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing; Best Sound; Best Editing and Best Costume Design One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind them. 8 out of 10 post scriptum: I WILL watch ALL of the extended editions at some point and that might change my opinion about these films. Maybe I'll tell you about that when it happens.
10.0~Kick-ass finale RNMorton Sign in Permalink Final chapter in Tolkien trilogy returns to the standard set by fantastic first entry. Corrects it's course from the in-comparison-only lesser Towers, which suffered from two significant faults: 1) pointless deviations from the source material, the best fantasy work ever written; and 2) a tendency to make the odds against our heroes laughably impossible. Not that this one is perfect on those counts but it tries a little harder, maybe they felt Towers needed more ummmph or something. We're talking a good 500 pages or so for Return, they do about as nice a job of stuffing the material in as they can. Pretty much flawless acting, my personal favorite being Hill as Theoden King of Rohan. Real nice job on lighting the warning beacons, a dazzling combination of sight and sound (although I still would have preferred it "by the book" while Gandalf and Pippin are on the fly to Gondor). I lived with these books so much as a kid I get choked up throughout this movie it's visualized so well. Tolkien was a master of having his characters (often Gandalf, sometimes Galadriel, but not always so) say the perfect lifetime-memorable line; somehow with all this effort they still miss some of the great ones. But I guess nobody's perfect. Great movie. 10 out of 10
10.0~perfection gold_pain Sign in Permalink Best movie ever seen in my life the music and the graphics and the actors and the story are perfect
10.0~Great, but disappointing in a way pgear83 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King was the third film in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy and was my least favorite of the three, despite winning 11 Academy Awards including 3 of the 5 major Oscars. It is the one that suffers the most in terms of altering the content of Tolkien's novel. Most notably the Scouring of the Shire is absent. Even if they could not include this in the movie, it should have at least been alluded to. Perhaps this chapter could be made into a separate film. Another problem that bothered many people was the loose end that was left by the absence of Bill the pony. The viewer will have to read the book to find out whether he lived or died after being set loose! On the positive side, the characterization of the Haradrim and the Mumakil was excellent and Howard Shore's score was great once again. The Return of the King also contains the best original scene in the trilogy (ie a scene that was great independently of the book's greatness). We hear Billy Boyd's Pippen sing a haunting melody while seeing the grotesque juxtaposition of Denethor voraciously eating while his son Faramir, rides to almost certain death. As a film unto itself I give it 10/10 As a faithful adaptation of the book: 6/10
10.0~The quintessential cinema experience Man_in_the_Top_Hat Sign in Permalink I saw this film two days ago and am still reeling from its impact. IMO this is the finest work to ever be put onto film, no question. I won't summarize the movie since that has been done many times already, but I simply don't see how anyone could walk out of the theatre disappointed after viewing the masterpiece. The visuals are brilliant, and by far this is the most emotionally engaging chapter of the trilogy. It is a bittersweet feeling that it is over, that we do not have another LOTR to look forward to next December. All i can say is I hope PJ makes the Hobbit because there is something wonderfully unique about everyone involved in this production as a whole. 10/10
6.0~This film has delusions of grandeur Argead Sign in Permalink Return of the King has much in the way of special effects but little in the way of passion. The characters are flat with most serving as interchangeable placeholders. Does anyone care when Aragorn is crowned? Was anyone really terrified (or even mildly disturbed) by Sauron -- I mean his legendary evil is only the driving force behind the plot. I could go on and on. I eat my words. Apparently, Jackson lacks the emotional depth required to give Tolkien his due. Compare the monotonous drone this film is to the roller coaster ride that was Empire. Recall the impact when Vader and Luke battled and Vader announced he was Luke's father. Twenty-five years from now what will anyone remember about Return of the King? For me ROTK is long on foreplay and short on orgasm. The high point being Eowyn in drag defending her father from the wraith -- which, in any case fell down and died obligingly in front of her. This is Disney-fied Tolkien and it utterly lacks the magic of the books. ROTK may be a good movie, perhaps even a "7" but I found it emotionally bland and overlong.
8.0~Three years, one story, and one giddy school boy. jaymim101 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's culmination opened today worldwide and I must say he leaves you feeling like the wait was worth...and it was. Without giving anything away, the movie clocks in at a little over three hours, leaving plenty of time to wrap up the loose ends. I did sense a feeling a disorientation for the first half of the movie i.e. the build-up to war and Sam/Frodo/Gollum's journey seemed to switch off quite a bit, while leaving me thinking things were left out that should have been kept in. But the finale was as grandiose and beautiful as any movie(not just epic) as one will ever encounter. See it once; see it twice, see it with friends and loved ones. There's no other reason to go out this holiday season and gain some morality back from a time a year that is as hectic as it is enjoyable. And if you don't know what I'm speaking of then you'll never know until you see the Return of the King.
2.0~Stupid film edwithmj Sign in Permalink I cannot believe this film was liked by everyone. The annoying presence of Elijah Woods and Orlando Bloom made it unwatchable. I was surprised that a good actor like Hugo Weaving could be in this after being brilliant on the three Matrix films. The sillies t thing about this film is that the good guys use ghosts to win the war. I am not surprised that they won. I mean the Orcs had no chance against ghosts! i cannot believe the fans took this rubbish seriously. The most annoying thing about this film is that bloody Smeagle with its stupid voice. I just wanted someone to beat the crap out of it all the way through. I know I am supposed to want this but it really is annoying. Why oh why do the Orcs have cockney accents and those hobbits despite coming from the same place, have different ones. One of them is Scottish and the others sound from Cornwall. One thing I cannot stand is Elijah Woods's horrible bitten nails they are painful to look at. Why this is liked so much when the books are so bad I will never know. Bad and boring in a BIG way.
10.0~Amazing movie, best in the trilogy sarxabomb Sign in Permalink I was not so impressed with the first two movies. They are good movies don't get me wrong, but I never thought they were anything special. But ROTK just blew me away. Everything about the movie screams class. Come February 29th this movie must win Best Director and Best Picture. I don't agree with many viewers who said that the ending is drawn out. It's exactly as it should be. I would watch this movie 10 times in a row and not get bored. Watch it now.
10.0~Best Movie of all time. Spidah Sign in Permalink Hi, I've seen it. Length was fine, any complaints about length or "wrap up scenes" are silly. They are very much needed to close all story lines, which, Jackson does with great care. I personally couldn't get enough. Perfect in every way. Amazing acting. Peter Jackson, awsome effort pre and post production. CG - awsome. Gollum..awsome. Sean Aston..awsome. The battle scenes had me transfixed in my chair I stayed for a second viewing! If you haven't seen it, or don't intend to, I would suggest an open mind and go see it. Even if you haven't seen the first two movies, see this one. There is no way you would be disappointed, and at 3.5 hours, regardless of whether you liked it (which you will) or not (unlikely), its great value for the dollars spent. What a show! I disliked Ebert/Roperte's review, where Ebert didn't believe "that old guy on the horse could do all that stuff, kinda takes believability from the movie..but we'll give P.J. that I guess." He was wrong on several points, but as Ebert is not up on the culture behind LOTR, its not really his fault, though, he did see the first two installments, he should know by now that Gandalf is "other-worldly" and not "an old guy on a horse" as he said in his review. Gandalf is actually 3000+ years old, immortal and very, very powerful. Jackson did an excellant job in the portrayal of Gandalf, downplaying the Wizardry part of his character and focussing instead on the human side as he relates to this monumental quest of seeing the One Ring destroyed. I would suggest Ebert read the book? Peter Jackson is an incredible person. His committment to his craft really comes through in these movies. I doubt very much if anyone will ever come close to his accomplishment of directing three movies at once, and to have such continuity bear such excellant fruit through three movies; Hollywood being notorious for botching sequals. He certainly deserves Best Director 2003, this is just a step above any other effort this year. There was such a buzz in the audience, everyone was eager to get the movie started, the annoying pre-show seemed to drag on and on. Finally, the lights went down, and there was this tension in the audience still. Then..slowly...the Newline logo appeared and this wild CHEER in the audience!! I laughed. We were in for a ride no doubt. I sipped my drink, took some popcorn and watched intensely for the final chapter to close, after a year long wait, what was I going to see? Truly, the best movie I have ever, ever seen. At another high point in the movie, I noticed the crowd again (I was a bit back in the theatre) actually shift en masse as the camera angle moved...man...it was so intense. WOW !! I'm so excited still just thinking about it. :) And I think this is a great movie for Humanity as well. We are a global village. Millions will see this movie. I hope it brings us all together, as Tolkien had no love for war, this movie will make strides in shifting perceptions, and maybe making some lesser countries more aware that emotions like EMPATHY, PASSION and HONOUR are more conducive to growth, understanding and unity than the status quo as is. Tolkien would definately approve of Peter Jackson's amazing effort. I've no doubt that everyone involved is a very much changed person for the better, as I was changed years ago reading LOTR for the first time as a despondant, upset child and seeing it come to the big screen in the best possible way. Fate it seems, doesn't pull punches. Return Of The King, Best Movie Of All Time.
10.0~OK - Great visuals, but disappointing (spoiler) DrPhoton Sign in Permalink I actually enjoyed much of ROTK, but I found it lacking in some major ways, especially compared to the first two installments of the LOTR trilogy. 1) I found the whole scene in which Eowyn and Merry defeat the Lord of the Nazgul to be rather flat, which is in stark contrast to the portrayal of this scene in the book - it just lacked the high drama found in the book's depiction. 2) Omitting the Houses of the Healing left unanswered the question as to what happened to Eowyn's passion for Aragorn - my wife, who has never read the books, would've been really confused had I not been there as a second source to explain how Eowyn fell in love with Faramir. 3) Leaving out the Scouring of the Shire made for a complete letdown at the end of the movie. This for me is the gravest mistake of the entire movie trilogy. The Scouring of the Shire in the book summarizes the whole moral of the story, and shows that The Travelers (i.e., Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin) had learned to stand on their own two Hobbit-feet, and weren't just coat-tail riders. I hope it's Jackson's intent to include (2) and (3) from above in the extended video when it gets released. Otherwise, I will believe that, in the very end of the story, Jackson failed to deliver the whole goods as promised.
9.0~The Return of the King Fountain245 Sign in Permalink The third film of the Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King, closes Tolkien's legendary tale of honour, pursuit of power and epic battles in a stellar fashion. Not only this film will be a part our our happiest memories but set a new standard for filmmaking. Writing this review in 2014, over 14 years after Peter Jackson's film was launched in 2003 is a good indicator of how amazingly good the film is. We follow Sam, Frodo and Gollum on the journey to Mordor, one that's crammed with perils and adventures as you'd expect. The rest of the Fellowhip of the Ring is getting East, trying to organize the defence of Gondor. The Battle of Minas Tirith is to date the best piece of filmmaking I've ever seen. No battles have lived up to the high standard this battle between orcs and men represents in terms of emotion, sheer violence and power. If the previous two movies were useful to tell the story of the Ring and the need to destroy while building up the story for the many battles ahead this movie, The Return of the King is all about epic battles and heroes.
10.0~one film to rule them all!!! trendykendy-1 Sign in Permalink absolutely unbelievable! the battle scenes alone make this worth seeing, the sheer scale of them is mind blowing! great acting, great locations, fantastic score (billy boyd's song in particular is incredibly touching). the first film i've ever been to that everyone in the whole theatre gave a huge round of applause when it was over, magnificent film!
7.0~Where did the Magic go? metro71 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King can be broken down into two story lines. The battle for Minas Tirith and the journey of the ring bearer. Whilst the trials of Frodo, Sam and Gollum are handled with much aplomb by Peter Jackson with the best acting by far (with maybe the exception of Sean Bean as Boromir in The Fellowship) provided by Sean Astin as Sam the much lauded battles of Minis Tirith are impressive only for the visual effects with the main players mostly relegated to husks at times. Movie making clichés creep slowly into this side of the movie. I feel that Jackson has been squeezed for time and sadly misses the mark on the feel of impending doom. Having another scene of a woman clutching a crying baby flash past the screen in a nanosecond (oft repeated in TTT) does not make me connect with the people of Gondor. There is little or no emotional connection for the audience in regards the people of Gondor. It's missing. There's no myth to be savoured. Minas Tirith is all sizzle and no sausage. The battle scenes are mostly snazzy but not menacing as in Helms deep. Even some of the CGI (the Trilogy's real star!) look fake, especially the scene of Legalos battling the Oliphant. The relationship between Gandalf and Denethor and the people of Gondor is not explained or even broached but Peter Jackson (Maybe the extended version). Although, there are some great scenes (Eowyn and Merry fighting the Lord of the Nazgul) there are some clunkers. The army of the dead look like left over CGI from The Frighteners. The lighting of the Beacons of Gondor look as if even Sir Edmund Hillary (sorry but Jackson is not even a pimple on the backside of New Zealand's greatest ever citizen no matter what the hype or our Prime Minister tries to tell us) would be hard pressed to scale the peaks where they are lighted! Visually snazzy but looks like an Air NZ tourism commercial. However, the movie's true highlight is the journey to the Cracks of Doom. The interacting between the Frodo, Sam and Gollum is great (even though Jackson takes liberties with the book). Shelob is amazing. Minas Morgul great. Everything works well here and Sean Astin provides some real emotion. The ascent of Mount Doom and the casting of the ring into the Cracks of Doom are handled well. Although, Mordor seems to shrink in size and time and travel is not handled particularly effectively by Jackson where things seem to happen all in the space of a couple of movie minutes with the moving of the army of Gondor and Rohan to the black gates and Frodo and Sam moving from the Cirith Ungol to Mount Doom. Mordor seems small because Jackson almost always shows Barad-dur and Mount doom very close to one another and they never look very far away from wherever they are viewed. Whether that be the Black Gates or Cirith Ungol. You lose the perspective of the formidable journey undertaken by Frodo and Sam. Overall I rate this movie as a good movie but not very good or great mostly because it's disappointing in making the audience believe in the myth of Middle Earth. It's got an air of the contrived or hollowness about a lot of the Minas Tirith story arc. Its close with some great scenes but somehow you get the feeling that its taken the lowest common denominator, Hollywood approach at times (lets see some Trolls so we can sell more toys! Or, don't bother explaining that, it might confuse people). Of the three films I won't be rushing back to the theatre to see this again. The Trilogy is blemished a tad with this last entry but I await the extended cut so I can view all three films back to back. But somehow, I hope to one day see another retelling of Tolkien's great masterpiece although its not his life's work. The Silmarillion is. I would much love to see this adapted to a series of movies although I imagine the Tolkien purists would be aghast at the thought. In closing I don't agree that Jackson should get an Oscar for this film. His best film is still Heavenly Creatures. The LOTR trilogy will make billions of dollars but let's not be blinded by popularity as a barometer for film making excellence. I think this trilogy has been good to very good. Besides. What does an Oscar mean? Russell Crowe gets an Oscar for Gladiator and not for A Beautiful Mind! I hope that Peter Jackson's best work is still to come.
10.0~Movie Love safyre22 Sign in Permalink One of the movies that I love to watch at any time.
1.0~Too many deviations from the book ravva_77 Sign in Permalink As someone who read The Lord of the Rings 15 years back and has been re-reading it ever since, the movie just takes too many liberties with the plot. The scriptwriters have introduced many twists that destroy the story and I'm sure Tolkien would have been horrified if he ever saw this. All in all, a good action movie but really ruined by some very lousy scriptwriting. Plot deviations include: The entire return to the shire is omitted so as to show the movie concluding with the defeat of Sauron, which just removes probably the most tragic part of the book. Frodo, manipulated by Gollum, asks Sam to leave him and go home in the climb to Shelob's lair. Faramir decides to take Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath(out of nowhere!! where did the scriptwriters dream this up from?) and many others too numerous to mention such as Tom Bombadil's scenes being assigned to Treebeard (???) AWFUL!
10.0~Utterly Amazing JohnnyNoGood Sign in Permalink The past few years have produced ridiculous sequels like The Matrix, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Dumb and Dumberer and so on to once great films. And LOTR is a wonderful relief from the numbing crap to come to theaters. In a word, The Return of The King is amazing. It delivered more than anyone had expected and was a spectacular ending to a flawless series. Diving into the specifics would only leave me wondering what I left out. It definetly raised the bar, maybe incomparibly high, to filmmaking but never lost sight of it's accuracy to the books. Almost never have I found the $6.00 I spent at the movies so valuable. I say almost because I saw the first two LOTR.
10.0~Peter Jackson is outstanding director orion7 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson managed to make an outstanding film version of the favorite book of millions of people all over the world and justified their hopes. He is worthy of respect. It's great film! Go to the cinema immediately!
10.0~Breathtaking DKqwerty Sign in Permalink This movie is phenomenal. The depth and substance that is conveyed in this film immerses you so deep into Middle-Earth, both visually and emotionally, that the viewer cannot help but feel some sense of attachment to this place, as if it had once truly existed. The most genius moment of the entire trilogy of movies is the scene "The Finding of the Ring." Played out as a sort of prologue to The Return of the King, it's a bold move on Peter Jackson's part that he should start his 3rd movie by telling back-story, rather than re-hashing what has already been established in the previous films. It shows not only Jackson's confidence in the continuity of his story and the substance of the character of Sméagol/Gollum, but it also shows his confidence that the audience will allow him liberties with the structure of the plot, that a flashback doesn't necessarily have to be placed into context before it appears to be fully comprehended. One production element of these three movies that makes Middle-Earth seem so tangible is Peter Jackson's apprehension towards using CGI models except where truly necessary. Scale models and half-sets were used in places where most director would simply shoot 100% computer generated sets with bluescreens. And while it doesn't afford the technicians the absolute freedom and ease that a complete virtual world provides, the time and effort spent doing miniatures is rewarded ten-fold on screen. I know it's cliché, but if you compare LOTR to Star Wars in terms of how special effects were shot, you can see that 100% CGI shots would have likely ruined the enchantment of the films: The original Star Wars trilogy was shot using miniatures for effects shots as there were no rendering computers in existence during its production. And while computers would have been nice to smooth over some of the bluescreening and stop-action issues, in the end everything appears very fluid, organic, and real. But once the pre-quils were shot, the technology was there to do almost all effects production on computers. However, Lucas continually abuses the technology and the effects ultimately convey very rigid lighting against only semi-realistic elements and ultimately the visuals subtract from the story because they stand out so substantially. LOTR's effects blend seamlessly into all the other elements of the movie because they don't scream "fake" like Lucas's, but rather whisper "this is no less real than your mind will make it." Miniatures and partial sets may seem like a step backward in terms of technology, cost, and time, but it can be argued that this was one of the many decisions that ultimately gave the films their pristine artistic quality. This is only a segment of a much larger essay that I wrote in the process of writing this review. There is so much more to say about this movie and it's predecessors that could never fit in this context. Just trust me when I say that this is the most impressive, memorable, and ultimately rewarding movies that I've seen.
7.0~Gondor is waiting their king other-files Sign in Permalink This movie was very good. I like it. This is my 1 number in fantastic movie category. I think, only Aragorn the emperor of middle-earth in this movie. Because, he beat Sauron and conquer the MORDOR. There isn't problem in his road. He believe himself and he achieve. Lord of the rings.. Frodo. Frodo is half-ling for fellowship. He is accepting a mission. The mission is go to Mordor with the ring. He achieve this because his close friend(Sam) is helping to Frodo. I'm recommending to LOTR followers. You should watch this movie again and again. I don't understand anything when i watched at first. But, I watched this series again, I understand something.If you don't watch this movie. You should watch... or not. If you won't watch, you will be loser like Sauron. I will probably watch this after I close my computer.
10.0~Great if slightly flawed stevegle Sign in Permalink Films of books aren't the book itself, and movie-goers have to accept that. The Lord of the Rings trilogy, brought to a spectacular climax in 'The Return of the King' redeems some of the weaknesses of the second instalment (The Two Towers) and firmly places this among the great films of movie history. We should be thankful that Peter Jackson had the vision to inspire, plan and direct a wonderful event. The sheer scale of it all and the scope of the story is awe-inspiring and he does full justice to a story that rests securely on so many mythological cornerstones. The flowing action scenes are perfectly handled, showing the pace and drama without losing sight of the multiple characters central to the plot. The attention to detail is outstanding throughout. What it must be to not only act in this epic but be given your handsomely crafted sword at the end of it! Aragorn emerges a great leader (his rallying speech to justifiably frightened troops is truly inspiring), Sam Gamgee turns out to be the real hero in doggedly keeping the wavering Frodo going on the quest to destroy the ring, Gandalf shows steel in battle under his wise exterior while Merry and Pippin play their part to show that even 'minor' characters can claim their place on the great stage of history. Andy Serkis deserves the highest award - though probably won't get an Oscar - for how he helped make Gollum the finest CGI character ever. The score is beautifully judged and the editing first rate. However, for those who have read Tolkien's masterpiece there is a sense of frustration that there was, inevitably, some 'cinematic twisting' of what is essentially a story of small people (literally) driven to overcome a challenge they never believed possible. The Hobbits travel in hope rather than faith and achieve things none of their fellow- creatures, cosy and ignorant back in The Shire, could have ever imagined. A great film... but, alas, not quite the greatest. There were a few edges that should have been smoothed, or re-worked. The not particularly convincing love interest of Aragorn is highlighted by him choosing the fairly insipid Arwen while rejecting Eowyn, the woman who had the guts to fight at Minas Tirith, there is a faintly unbelievable attack by the ghost army (as wraiths who can't be killed how do they wield weapons that kill?), a badly damaged Minis Tirith apparently made good in short time (unless Gandalf's magic helped) and a strange final departure of Frodo from the Grey Havens when he was supposedly dying from an old wound but in fact looked pretty healthy. Compared to his call for valour earlier, Aragorn's crowning speech, with its half-hearted appeal for all to share in peace, seemed like a modern-day sop to those who think we ought to all love each other no matter what needs to be done. The fact that Gollum sank into the volcano's lava flow as if it was water, the way that Frodo and Sam were able to cling to a rock in a torrent of lava (wouldn't they have been roasted by the sheer heat?) and their rescue by heat-proof eagles suggested that at the end the trilogy and this final part ran out of steam a little. Oddly, I noticed that on one occasion the wizard in white on a horse was anything but Sir Ian McKellen and had more the shape of a female from the back, and I found I was more aware in this final film of children playing the Hobbits in long shots. Perhaps the haste to wrap up was understandable after so many years in the making and an inevitable tiredness set in. No doubt the extended DVD version will fill in some gaps and perhaps bolster the weaker elements. But even with a handful of flaws and oversights this film successfully closes the book (and the trilogy) and will be recognised for years to come as one of the great films of our time. One final observation: Sam goes at home to Rosie at the very end of the film and his house number is three. There's probably a whole lot of significance and symbolism in that...
10.0~Lord of the Rings: Return of the King quinimdb Sign in Permalink "Return of the King" is an incredible end to an incredible series. At many points in the film, it almost seems as if all hope is lost. A king is upset that his son Boromir died, so he takes it out on his other son, Faramir, when he is in desperate need of help against Saruman's forces. Then when Faramir is brought back (seemingly) dead, he assumes the worst and sets up a ritual for his body to be burnt. Of course Gandalf comes in at the last moment and the king ends up being burnt and only just after he sees that his son is alive. Frodo is deceived by Golum and tells Sam to go home, symbolically choosing his bad side over his good, or his Golum over his Smeagle, respectively. He has self control. Merry is taken away from Pippin. Gandalf even seems to have lost hope in the situation. But the characters prevail. We see a shot of Frodo hunched over Golum, strangling him after Golum betrayed him, but unlike Golum, Frodo stands up and stops, showing how Frodo is different from Golum. Sam falls down the stairs trying to back, but returns right when Frodo is at his most vulnerable, and despite being tossed around and almost killed by a monster, he kills it, which shows how much they need each other, and again how every man needs someone to lean on. Merry decides to fight for his friends despite not being with them. Aragorn fights to get more people to fight with them against Saruman's army. This is one of the greatest strengths of this film. Putting aside the fantastic and believable character arcs that develop over these three movies, and the incredible, epic action scenes, with special effects that hold up surprisingly well, there's something that really stood out to me. In the beginning, a fellowship is assembled that puts together some unlikely companions who end up becoming friends through their experiences and further understanding of each other. This care for each other is what drives them and gives them courage in the worst situations. This begins to happen on a larger scale in the third film. The elf army is now uniting with the humans, when only just recently they were arguing with each other. The ents fight against Saruman's forces as well. Then in the next film, this continues to grow in scale, with everyone they could possibly get uniting against Sarumans forces, and this is mainly to help Sam and Frodo who are in their own task. This is not just relevant to the film, but to the world. There is much evil in the world, and we need to be able to depend on each other to help get rid of it. No one man can do it on his own, and every man has a part to play. But the greatest part of this film is its ending. This film has an incredibly bittersweet ending in which I actually found myself tearing up and nearly crying on multiple occasions, which almost never happens to me in movies. Sam at one point on the mountain says "We may not have a journey back to the shire" shortly before they destroy the ring, but this line coming from the most optimistic character in the movie shows that he has accepted the idea of death. Pippin and Gandalf do this earlier in the film in a conversation they have about death, and the end of the film is about this acceptance. Death is inevitable, but it's not always a bad thing, and we have to accept that at some point or another our time will come for all of us, it just comes faster for others.
8.0~Good film. But top 10? Nah. OllieZ Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed Return of the King - just like the previous two films. They were fantastic epics, with some great battle scenes, some lovely "epic" acting. But I can't help the feeling the hype has wrecked it a little. In my opinion, it is not the best film ever, nor the third, or the fiftieth. I have seen better epics - ones that didn't need to use CGI (Lawerence Of Arabia). I have seen better battle scenes and action scenes (Braveheart, Last Samurai, Matrix 1). Return of the King is great - just not as good as some people like to believe. It looks fantastic. The design is second to none, and the epic feeling is captured so well on the battle field. Acting from everyone is fantastic - Mckellen and Viggo being standouts, as well as Sean Astin. And, damn, has this film got some great set pieces (Pelannor fields!). But what wrecked this film? The editing. I know some purists loved the ending - but it ended about (checks his notebook) four times. It faded to black - BUT WAIT - it's starting again! Really, Jackson could've cut this down. It made the film over-wrougt to the point of screaming. All in all, a great film, one of the best ever - just not top 10 worthy! It has great production value, Jackson is talented for doing all three in a row - and everyone involved should be proud they've been in such a film. Though, the editing crew must feel a little sheepish...
10.0~One film to rule them all- The new IMDB King? Magick-93 Sign in Permalink Until yesterday, I agreed with the consensus view of IMDB users that the Godfather was the greatest movie of all time. I've changed my mind. What set the Godfather (I & the young Vito Corleone sequence of the Godfather films) was the profound feeling of family, and of immersion into a culture that tempered the violence & intrigue of the plot, and made watching them a holistic experience. Peter Jackson has outdone this in the Return of the King. The action sequences are the best ever, in terms of build-up and excitement. The seeds of friendship, fellowship and romance that are planted in the Fellowship of the Ring and developed in the Two Towers come into fruition here. The flaws of the Two Towers are remedied- better pacing, fewer stupid Gimli comments. The film is filled with an incredible sense of devotion, of love by all the participants for Middle Earth. Jackson has invented a new way of filmmaking, of immersing the actors into an alternate reality for years, until they became inhabitants of it. The attention to care and detail is noticeable throughout the film- and it feels as if we are immersed in Middle Earth, with its cornucopia of cultures, dreams and desires. The film feels like a labour of love and the characters achieve profound depth, especially in the scenes where the characters say goodbye to each other. I think it was also a stroke of genius to include the flashback on the origins of Smeagol/ Gollum's attachment to the ring. This makes their last shot even more meaningful, and should secure Any Serkis a best supporting actor Oscar. My only complaint is the complete absence of Saruman- sure I know adding the Scouring of the Shire sequence would have been one too many endings, but there should have at least been a shot of Saruman and Wormtongue brooding in Orthanc. I've read other reviewers' complaints that there are too many endings, and while the movie would have been perfect to end after "ending one or two", all of the endings were necessary. Jackson said that we should think of the trilogy as parts to one 11 hour movie, and with that in mind, the multiple endings serve to tie up threads started early in the epic. Little things from the opening Shire scenes, like Bilbo's party, like Sam's nervousness around Rosie; and Gandalf blowing a smoke ship through Bilbo's smoke ring; alluded to important events that needed to be shown to bring closure. 11/10 on a Spinal Tap Scale
10.0~why oh why is there not a 4th installment of this awesome story dkkev Sign in Permalink im truely lost for words.. some of my friends (well they used to be) never liked LOTR 1 and never bothered to watch LOTR 2.. even my mom didnt like it... i'm gonna disown myself hehe.. Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew has made me happy 3 years in a row.. and I so wish there could/would/should be a 4th and 5th and 6th and... installment.. just lovely
10.0~Peerless Dodger-9 Sign in Permalink *Contains possible spoilers* Having seen this the morning after a hit and miss Christmas party, with no food and no sleep, I felt pretty sick in the first few minutes. So, heartbroken, sleep deprived and starving, the sight of Smeagol's descent into madness as the one ring turned him into Gollum was not the most appeasing of starts. But having waited with the rest of the world for two years to see this conclusion, nausea would be kept at bay for the next three hours and something. What unfolded was one of theose movies you remember forever, despite it being just a day and a half since it was over. Hollywood is going to have a hard time recreating the level of excellence on display here and although some bits were dubious - Legolas on the Olymphant was a CGI lowpoint, the rest of the movie was a stunning treat. Finally a director has told a story in which computer effects, actors and craftsmen get the chance to shine, none of which was at the expense of the story. There were far too many endings and Jackson could have done with cutting 20 mins from the finale. However, you certainly get your money's worth and it deserves all the praise and awards that will be heaped on it in the months that follow.
9.0~A monumental film Chris_Docker Sign in Permalink Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by. Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either. The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements. This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!) The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .
10.0~Deserving of awards & criticism from die-hards tacitpro Sign in Permalink This is the *film version* based on Tolkien's work. All of you die-hard Tolkien fans need to get a grip when dissecting the differences between book and film. For everyone who has read the books (I've read the books and listened to the audio versions), we have our own mental imagery of the characters and how they interact with the scenery and circumstances. We have created our own mental film version in doing so. Peter Jackson et al have taken their mental images and created a visual representation of over 1,000 pages of literature. The theatrical versions comprise not quite 10 hours while the EE versions add about 2 hours on top of that. If anyone can read TLOTR in 12 hours, you are a world class speed reader. OK, now that I have that off my chest... There are many memorable scenes in the final installment of the trilogy and both versions (TE and EE) contain excellent pacing and dramatic ebb and flow. Many of us have seen the TE several times and, therefore, the EE will stand out for the additions especially since we've come to respect PJ's devotion to the EE as not just a separate menu choice of "deleted scenes". I particularly like the way PJ did not cut short the ending even though he eliminated the shire scouring chapter entirely. Who wouldn't want to see the whole book on film but even Hollywood doesn't have that much money... yet. I'm very happy with the Eowyn/Faramir additions to the EE (yes, it's not "enough" but it's more than the TE). The editing is as expected considering the massive volume of footage to review. The sound, lighting, cinematography, score, costumes, special effects, set design and acting are all top notch. Gimli? He's arguably the deepest character, especially in the EEs. How about his fawning of Galadriel? Mourning Balin? Discussing dwarf women? Not letting Aragorn out of his sight and calling him "laddie"? Exhorting Aragorn not to "tell the elf" when he lets Aragorn toss him? Apprehension of Fangorn and the Dimwalt road? The battle death counting is Tolkien's mechanism to establish a bond between dwarfs and elves which becomes much greater than simple acts of bravery. By having Legolas announce that he will be dying next to a *friend* excellently shows the elf's development because we know Gimli does most of the chattering. The drinking game also shows good contrast between the refinement of the elves compared to the crudity of dwarfs. Whether Orlando Bloom delivered his lines to our satisfaction can be debated but it clearly shows the growth of Legolas as an emotional character willing to "lower" himself to foolish contests contrary to normal elf behavior. The way PJ used Gollum to divide Frodo against Sam was also an interesting twist required for cinematic purposes. Tolkien had the luxury of page after page to describe the ring's evil power slowly taking control of Frodo but we can only do this so many times in film before getting bored and restless. This scene quickly punctuates Frodo's degradation and Gollum's manipulative motives. The multiple fade-outs were also a good way to slowly take us to the conclusion without being cliché. PJ knows that most of us know the ending and he's teasing us with the fades. Did the film affect you? Were you inspired to look at things differently? Were you completely immersed for several hours away from the daily struggles of life? Were you just a bit empty these past few weeks because there was no Lord of the Rings movie opening on a Wednesday in mid-December? Rarely does a film evoke so many emotions and, thus, this was clearly deserving of the awards. A Beautiful Mind in 2001? Chicago in 2002? Please. I understand the Academy has a reputation and it wouldn't be "fair" to give all 3 Best Pictures to PJ. Maybe if he released them every other year like Godfather I and II, he might have gotten all the Oscars...
10.0~Wow! Balidorf Sign in Permalink The ROTK may not be the best movie of all time, but it is definitely top 5, and without a doubt top 2 of my lifetime, only because I was like 5 minutes old when The Godfather was released, and The Godfather is a film without equal. I have always answered the question "Have you read the lord of the rings?" with the answer. "It is not have I read the Lord of the Rings, but how many times have I read the Lord of the Rings". Well my answer will be the same for these 3 films, and ROTK in particular. In my opinion had the extended version of this film (admitidly I have not seen it, and am only speculating on its quality)been the theatrical release I probably would have rated it # 1. As it is This movie and its 2 predecessors are among my favorite of all time. Peter Jackson, well done!
1.0~Braindead BoMbY Sign in Permalink Well, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy seems to be a cheap action movie, which hasn't much common with the great book from Tolkin. "The Return of the King" has some nice battle scenes, but it's just another action movie with mostly good special effects. Many good parts of the original book where totally twisted, mixed or deleted with not much sense, and some very stupid parts are just invented from Peter Jackson, to show more of this not so impressive Orlando Blum. It's good that Tolkin can't see this movie - I just hope it makes him not spinning in his grave. My hint to Peter Jackson: Stay at your roots and make more splatter movies like "Braindead".
10.0~Amazing Rudi1401 Sign in Permalink It was the best film I have ever seen and could watch it over again. It was quite disappointing that Saruman wasn't in there, but because of that you had a slightly happier ending. If he had been in there, the film would have been 45 minutes longer. Anybody that is still confused should read the book rather than wait a year until the extended version comes out.
10.0~Hold your ground, hold your ground! Sons of Gondor, of Rohan. . . my Brothers! raphael_df12 Sign in Permalink Great opening, Andy Serkis did a wonderful job, creating the moves and voices for Smeagol. Smeagol is a true character with feelings and emotions, very well performed. The hole cast had a great development and acting. Everybody is the leading actor/actress in the movie. Thanks to Peter with his great critics to cast them, it worked after all. And I have to say about Éowin too. She exceeded all my expectations from her, specially the scene from Nazgul where no man could kill him, but she was there and she really could! Brilliant idea the love of Éowin and Faramir for the extended version, she had a happy ending. Frodo&Sam, with that idea of friendship that they carried through their quest such as Legolas&Gimli, between all that hate and violence that everybody suffers (like what the world is and will be), and all the good values can be seen in this trilogy that really makes us wondering if we can have it in our lives and look forward for a friend like Sam. It's a tremendously quality and amazingly scripted. What about the war? Breathless, seriously! Faramir in Osgiliath, Theoden's army and speech, the Oliphants, the army of living dead, Gandalf's words for Pippin, Pippin saving Faramir, Merry riding with Éowin to war, Éowin killing Nazgul, Aragorn's speech leading everybody for the last battle and finally Frodo destroying the ring (or not, but thank you Smeagol anyway!). Sam: "Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo? It'll be spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom, and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. And the whistle in the summer barley in the Lower fields. And eating the first of the strawberries with cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?". Gandalf: "Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea... comes the end of our Fellowship. I will not say do not weep, for not all tears are an evil.". Frodo: "My dear Sam, you can not always be torn in two: you will have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy, and to be, and to do. Your part in this story will go on". Remarkable moments and quotes. All I have to say is this is the best movie/Trilogy of my life. Every time I watch it gets better and better to appreciate. And I will wait with all of my heart for the Hobbit, For Frodo! :D
8.0~Visual great, but the directing... dbudelsky Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Second part contains some spoilers. Just seen ROTK in cinema and as expected: visual an absolute great movie, never seen before some of the imaginaries. An absolute must to look. As a Tolkienist, I am satisfied with the ending and can understand the differences to the book. The prolog is really good. What is not OK: every action scene is overdrawn, Jackson screwed them all one turn too much, as he want to show more than is in the book. Logic and character understanding are often lost to show even more fighting and danger and *** SPOILER ahead *** cliffhanging, where it is physical impossible. Why is Denethor acting like he does? The film explanations are much too thin. Why is the straight book explanation for his behaviour left out, when it is prepared? Every time, when there is a logical or motivative gap, a look in Tolkiens book would have helped. And less fighting and cliff hanging would be sometimes more. The big battle is much less boring than in TTT. *** Bigger SPOILER ahead *** I do not like the falling of the tower. Have to reread the book in this point, but the vanishing of the Ork army is a bad joke.
7.0~A good movie, but not great Vidgamefreak7 Sign in Permalink Alright, this movie can say that it has won a total of 11 Oscar awards. but does that mean that it is a good movie, no. i did see this movie in the theaters before it won all of the awards and when it ended i said to myself, that was a good movie. notice i did not say great like some readers may think. there is most definitely a difference between good and great, and the reason i say this movie is good is because the acting is once again superb and the music can not be matched. but it just left me wanting something. and that something was a more complete story. now i know that some will say it was based off of a book so what can be done to add to the story, but that is not what i am saying. there are just many parts that seem to be weak, such as the major battle scene. the animals looked great and the background looked fantastic, but when the ghosts just came into the battle and killed everything in a blink of an eye, i was disappointed. i wish that that part could have been better. and i know this has been said a million times but the ending really turned me off from this movie, because i feel that a great movie needs a GREAT ending. and the million and a half ending really left it feeling open and confusing. if you want a great movie, watch The Godfather or The Usual Suspects, because those are some of the greatest movies i have watched, and they leave nothing to be desired. for all of these reasons i gave this movie a 7 and that is exactly what it deserves.
10.0~Peter Jackson is a Genious DJAkin Sign in Permalink This movie captured the imagination. Sure, it had Gollum in it, but heck...what's to not like about that little creature!!?? I loved this movie and saw it four times at the theater. Samwise the great was excellent. Sean Astin was snubbed for the oscar in that role. Of course, Frodo was played by Elija Wood. He was BORN for that role. Every single person in this movie was BORN FOR THEIR ROLE. The visuals were great. The cameo by Eddie Van Halen was very strange. However, the movie was hardcore. Viggo apparently was so into this role as Aragorn that he forgot who he really was and thought that middle earth was a real place etc. How much more into a ROLE can you get? Peter Jackson, you are a GENIOUS!!!
1.0~Stupid, junk piece of trash Abhijan Sign in Permalink Indeed, a more appropriate name would have been "Lord of the Trash". I have not seen anything sicker, perverse or violent than this one especially considering the Oscars it won. It says a lot about the culture and times we live in. No doubt, a lot of money has been spent and a lot of effort has gone in. But what is the final result ? Violence, blood and gore..... What is the purpose I wonder ? Has human culture stooped so low that we need such forms of entertainment ? Its time Lord of the Rings is confined to the dustbins of history! Awful, filthy and violent piece of crap. Here goes the story. Apparently somebody has forged a bunch of rings and given some to different groups of beings on a fantasy place called Middle Earth. One of these rings is more powerful than the others. So there is this big bad guy who wants it to dominate the others. So the good guys decide that it is better to destroy the ring than let it fall in the hands of the evil guy. The rest of this garbage is full of magic and sorcery. Things do not make sense at all ! Any idiot can write a stupid story like this....
10.0~It changed my views on watching films. erik-diehn Sign in Permalink For every person who watches movies, there is one film that he or she really enjoys the most. This film is the one that I enjoy the most. It excels in all of the areas of film making. The story is well-written, the characters are likable, the effects are amazing, and the dialog is unforgettable. The Return of The King is destined to become a classic motion picture that will be remembered for many years to come. Peter Jackson has created a cinematic masterpiece to be enjoyed by all. Every person who watches it will find some part of it that they will like very much. I would recommend it to any film buff. I am sure that they would not be disappointed by seeing it.
10.0~Absolutely Phenomenal! tylerdurden-93338 Sign in Permalink This is an absolutely phenomenal movie that deserves its place on the top 250, besides that its higher than fight club, which I do not agree with, but I am not going to focus on that. It is a great end to the trilogy, and it blows the other ones away. Highly recommended, one of my favorites. however, if you do not have a high attention span, then you will need to pull through it, but I think that you will most likely find the 3 and a half hours very worth it, like I definitely did. It is a great movie that will give you a great experience, and it is an absolutely, all around, epic movie to watch when you have the time to sit down and watch it through.
7.0~Best Picture of the Year? Give me a break.. ichabod81 Sign in Permalink Man, and you thought Titanic was cheesy?! When I first saw this film on the big screen, the multiple endings bothered me only a little. Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation. Every single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and skål their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off. The most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the "Russell Crowe-syndrome", as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much. I can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No. ** / *****
10.0~Fitting end to epic trilogy Danny_G13 Sign in Permalink The major 2 trilogies of recent times have been Lord of the Rings and the Matrix. While the Matrix clearly peaked during its first installment, with the Two Towers it was clear that Lord of the Rings was capable of getting better all the time. Now, with Return of the King we see the final part, and it was certainly worth the wait. Having never read any of the books I cannot compare or judge the movies compared to them, but I can judge the movies on their own merit. And ROTK is a fine piece of cinema with a touch of everything a movie needs. It has action, adventure, cracking direction, mouth-dropping scale, good dialogue, a dash of comedy, and a gripping storyline. One could argue it is a tad convoluted due to the number of locations and characters referred to throughout, but it really doesn't detract from the quality. ROTK sees Sam and Frodo on their final part of the journey to the volcano, with Aragorn and chums engaging in battle with Orcs who're trying to take the City of Kings. I think that's what it's about anyway... The special effects are, again, marvellous, and are utterly breath-taking when seeing mass armies of thousands colliding with one another. The acting is good again, with characters we unquestionably care about. There aren't really any flaws with this, and it's definitely better than Two Towers. Only Fellowship of the Ring comes close, and I'd actually it's pretty even between the 2. Overall, superb film and fitting end to what has been a great adaptation.
9.0~More than a fantasy lordgourav Sign in Permalink It was 1995 when first I saw 'JURASSIC PARK' by Steven Spielberg. I, a mere toddler, was shell-bound by the shear adventure and drama. This made me believe that there will never be a film that would be able to over-shadow the impact I had after seen 'JURASSIC PARK'. But amazingly after 8 years Peter Jackson made me change me mind by his 'LORD OF THE RINGS-THE REATURN OF THE KING'. The shear pander with which he create LOTR (LORD OF THE RINGS) trilogy, mold my inner understanding of movies to a different level. It made me believe that a movie of such gargantuan proportion can ever be made. The film is a poi gent experience and an allegorical representation of human struggle for existences against the backdrop of many surrounding difficulties. The most interesting part of the film was the way in which Peter Jackson treated the story of the film. It would have been much easer for him to make a film marveled by astonishing special effects. But he took the harder way of making it a masterpiece of powerful story narration and characterizations. Like many other great stories LOTR also deals with many important characters. But if you watch the film carefully you would be able to understand that each and every character was projected with importance and perfection in the film. From Frodo to Sméagol, Gandalf to Aragorn every one has their importance in the drama. Jackson narrated the complex story line and battle field sequences of LOTR in such grace that the audience remained glued on their seats to the end of this never ending saga. So, the film has a lilt of humanity with the flavor of extravaganza which makes it more enlivening. Therefore it has all that the great film can.
9.0~Overall a wonderful adventure, but a little long. royals_cr Sign in Permalink The last edition to The Lord of the Rings trilogy is extremely fulfilling. The special effects are brilliant, the computer animated creatures very lifelike and intimidating, and once again, the dynamic plot and characters draw one into the story. Bits of genius humor are scattered throughout the movie. Whether you are anti-war or not, the battle scenes are inarguably spectacular. The only qualm I had about The Return of the King was that it was very long. For the most part, one forgets the time because of the high level of engagement of the storyline. But the last half hour of this 3 and 1/2 hour production seem to drag. The producers obvioussly tried to tie all loose ends of the plot together after the most important parts were finished and the movie could have easily been called complete. Those last 30 minutes become somewhat tedious. However, the overall effect of the film was not tarnished, and will undoubtedly make box office records.
1.0~Review of "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" JustinSeim Sign in Permalink First and for most the movie was far too long. There was no reason for it to be 3 hours and 21 mins. Much of the film could have been edited and it would have still had the same effect(As for all the people who felt the length was good or wish it had been longer, buy the dvd and watch the deleted scenses). Second, to much of the film was way to unrealistic even in a place like "Middle Earth." I'm not going to go into any detail on this because some people may not have seen the film but take note. Also many of the things which could have made this an exciting film were cut short such as the dealings with the Witch King. Besides some great special effects and nice cinematography the film was a huge disappointment. In conclusion I am left with a few question, how did so many people trick themselves into liking this moive and how did it get to number 3 on the users choice poll?
10.0~Lord of the rings ROCKS iamho_wut Sign in Permalink I definitely loved all of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. However, my favorite movie is the "Return of the King". It was the best movie in the trilogy. There are as many funny parts as there are serious and intimate ones. One of my favorite funny parts is when Gimli says "certainty of death, small chance of success. What are we waiting for?" One of my favorite intimate moments is close to the end of the movie Aragorn walks up to Pippin, Merry, Sam, and Frodo who all bow to him and "my friends. You bow to no-one." The reason that he says this is because the four little hobbits played such a major part in the demise of Sauron. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job filming the movie and chose a great location for it to be filmed and the special effects in the movie are truly amazing. Elijah Wood does and amazing job as the starring role of Frodo Baggins of the Shire. All of the characters make the film really believable and the special effects make it look real.
10.0~The best in the trilogy and perhaps one of the best films of all time. russem31 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King tops the first two films that came before it (The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers) - which is no easy feat considering the first two were near perfect films in their own right! Director Peter Jackson really has a passion and understanding for film-making and the beloved The Lord of the Rings books by J.R.R. Tolkien. Considering this film is the longest of the three, it would have been easy for any other filmmaker to make this film long and boring - only Peter Jackson could have successfully continually make it exciting (with only the very end of the film dragging on just a little bit). Again, an special mention goes to the cast (kudos to Sean Astin as Sam) and composer Howard Shore (whose theme for Gondor is one of the most majestic themes ever composed). A PERFECT 10 out of 10 (the first 10 out of 10 movie on the IMDb that I reviewed BTW!).
8.0~overrated but still one of the best Tom9106 Sign in Permalink great movie , but needed better actors i mean orlando bloom sucks.apart from some of the acting it was a great movie but watching all three of them in the one day you would surely see that the fellowship of the ring was the best and then this but the two towers wasn't to flash apart from the special effects. peter jackson could have done so much more with the trilogy especially looking at the extended version.he may as well have just released them to the cinemas because they are better than the original versions. on this movies extended version especially it explained every last detail with the extra seens and some of the effects were also pretty sweet. overall an awesome movie
10.0~Masterpiece! shantanuverma Sign in Permalink One of the biggest, most spectacular work of art on celluloid. It's rare to see a film of this calibre be made while sticking so closely to the book's plot and storyline. A masterpiece in terms of direction, set design, costumes, make-up, production and even acting when it comes to a few characters. The dialogues of this movie are ingrained in me till today. MUST WATCH, if you haven't already that is.
10.0~Into the West... stabo Sign in Permalink When I saw Sam and Frodo climbing up mount doom I knew I was witnessing a cinematic and artistic moment which passes into a realm of honesty which has been lost in the current world and Hollywood environment. This is the only trilogy in which I find it hard to pinpoint which one stood out above the rest. Perhaps it is because one spiritual experience can't really be measured against another. I could ramble on about all the amazing performances by the actors, the inspiring locations, cinematography and the long list of things that couldn't have been done better by anyone else. However I'll just end this review by saying that if you can't see any merit in these masterpieces than I truly feel sorry for you, as you have lost all grasp of humanity and anything beyond it 10/10
10.0~My favorite fantasy movie jinglengyouhun Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson is really a cow, the first is the mountain work, which laid the tone of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and then created a magical masterpiece of magnificent atmosphere, it is worth seeing...
10.0~Perfect integrity of story, acting and effects andrewhdk Sign in Permalink Wonder, immense scale and immense courage hold centre stage in this majestic, jaw-dropping movie. Writers Jackson, Walsh and Boyens weave the narrative brilliantly around this central theme of standing to fight against huge, intimidating evil, true to the spirit and detail of Tolkien, yet spotlighting and re-emphasising with great insight. The conflict between individual choices to be courageous and massive, mechanised enmity - again entirely true to Tolkien - are part of the movie's success: to an extent no other film has matched, the resplendent acting of the ensemble cast weaves in and out of the enormous and beautiful CGI, and both acting and imagery deepen and strengthen each other's impact on us. Tolkien - and Jackson - are sometimes accused of glorifying war. It's naïve to say this - the totalitarian minds of Sauron and Saruman who initiate war are portrayed as evil and terrifying. What the book and film glorifying is the courage to stand against war-mongering. In the CGI work, Weta Worksop and Jackson have improved so much with each film of the trilogy that there is an extraordinary grace and fluidity in the large-scale movements of the riders of Rohan and the hordes of the Dead who fight alongside Aragorn, and in the flight of the enormous eagles who reappear towards the end, a sign of blessing in the face of imminent collapse. This is not to say that the forces of evil aren't also pretty stunning achievements - particularly the now-perfected fell beats which the Nazgûl ride, and the giant mûmakil (huge, multi-tusked elephants). With great truth and understanding, the writers place Gandalf, not Aragorn, at the centre of these battles against evil and one's own fear of it. His roles as the inspiring captain of Gondor's defence, the caller of Rohan's aid, the protector of Faramir against Denethor's madness and the attacks of the Nazgûl are never the deeds of a super-hero, but always the courageous choices of a wise leader who knows fear yet inspires others. Ian McKellen (Gandalf) is entirely up to this, physically as well as in character and inner strength. If the movie has a star it is McKellen as much as Elijah Wood (Frodo), and he should be Oscar-nominated as best actor, not supporting actor. Gandalf's bravery lights up another wonderful performance from Bernard Hill as Théoden, finding the same courage to fight even without hope of winning. Hugo Weaving (Elrond), the Mr Spock of the trilogy, becomes less impassive, more beautifully expressive, as he lets his daughter go free to be with her love. By employing the same actors over such an extended shoot and ADR period, Jackson has managed to show them with worn faces and sadder, reddened eyes - a legacy of the physical hardships of the film-making as well as makeup. One realizes that this is really a ten-hour film, not a trilogy. Nowhere is this truer than with Elijah Wood, whose tendency to make a meal of his sufferings threatened to annoy us in Two Towers. Now we see the steel of his resolve, the Hobbits' ability to fight if necessary which Tolkien actually celebrates at the beginning of the first book. Perhaps the creative tension between character and CGI also explain why the principal effect and character of Gollum is so enthralling, and even better realised here than in The Two Towers. The character is in constant battle with his own ugliness and craving, and Andy Serkis (surely another Oscar nominee?) has more opportunity to reveal his genius for crazed yet sympathetic characterisation. Too briefly amid the scale of everybody's achievement, we need to acknowledge the wonderful cinematography and score of Andrew Lesnie and Howard Shore. Faces are framed more subtly than ever, with the 'realism' Jackson has strived after; terrible fighting is charged with solemn choral lament, not gung-ho military sounds. Nowhere is this meld of seeing and hearing more perfectly realised than in the lighting of the mountain-top beacons summoning Rohan to fight - and yet again New Zealand becomes another star. To be sure, there are small flaws and weaknesses. The movie simply starts - no concessions to anyone straying in without at least having seen Parts 1 and 2. (Not even a fiery Balrog-type overture as in Two Towers - still, it's great to see Andy Serkis' face, with a flashback - no spoiler - of Sméagol obtaining the one ring of power, killing Déagol and placing the awfulness of the Ring centre stage.) Warning - Possible spoilers next 2 paragraphs? Small miscalculations include Sauron's eye now starts moving in its socket - lizard-like in a way that does not fit the implacable terrorism of the role. (It would have been better to keep the eye still, and illuminate the land it gazes at with lightning.) Aragorn's speech after his coronation involves the trite words and limp hand gestures of a young clergyman. Shelob the giant spider seems, at first sight, just a big cumbersome, CGI baddie, though as she stalks Frodo her unearthly movements and presence convince and scare. Some critics have faulted Jackson for one too many endings. Frankly it's hard to see what worries them - in the epic scale of the film the farewells at The Grey Havens pass quickly and with a single purpose and emotional integrity. True to the spirit of Tolkien there is no glory at the end, only courage and the costliness of the courage. Here at the end, framed by a beautiful seascape based surely on J M W Turner's `Dido building Carthage, we enter a mellowing that allows the mind and heart to digest the enormity of the struggles we have been witnessing, and to take on board the scar of Frodo's `wound which will never heal'. As with listening to a performance of the greatest music, at the end one wants to say Thank You, Thank You, to the creators. Thank you, Mr Jackson, and your wonderful Company of friends.
10.0~The Best of The Best Chris_Wint Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy are the three greatest films ever made; and Return of the King is the best of the bunch. Sometimes you love a film because of the performances, the cinematography, the direction or writing and even the music. But sometimes, it's just simply how it makes you feel. In this case: speechless. The performances are note perfect , particularly Sean Astin, Andy Serkis and Sir Ian Mckellen. Jackson's direction is outstanding, keeping the audience utterly gripped, moved and overwhelmed for three hours. The special effects have started to date in places, yet this is a that's film over 10 years old. And given the speed in which technology and CGI progress these days, it says a lot that, for the most part, it can still compete against modern CGI output. The film trilogy, and Return of the King in particular, is a monumental achievement in film making, never matched historically, and unlikely to be bettered in the future.
10.0~The worst part of this movie... maryzworld Sign in Permalink The worst part of this movie was the realization that the trilogy had come to an end. I cannot begin to express how much enjoyment both my son and I gained from The Lord of The Rings series. Not only were they visually stimulating but they also contained superb character development with an exceptional cast. For each 2-3 hour movie I was taken on a journey into another world that my imagination could never have created. It was a beautiful experience, however the most fantastic component was the underlying message. No matter what socio-economical class, no matter how large or small each character played an intricate role in the prevailing outcome.

9.0~The best overall of the series xtwells Sign in Permalink Good action, Good character development, Good story.. the best of the trilogy. This movie lacked almost nothing.. there was minor details that could have been sorted out, and certain parts were a little too corny.. but other than that -- quite an awesome trilogy and movie if you find yourself into the D&D genre.. Only thing I have to say is: See them in order. Some stuff might not make sense if you have not seen the other two, nor will the end be as interesting in the same way. Worth full price, definitely worth buying the trilogy.. Just my 2 cents..
10.0~UNFORGETTABLE CINEMA-GOING EXPERIENCE! mayakk Sign in Permalink What an absolute masterpiece. This is by far the BEST trilogy film series ever made - no - make that the three best FILMS ever made! All the hard work from an awesome cast and a heavenly-sent crew have left this third and final instalment of PJ's masterpiece cemented in my memory as the greatest! You know how you always talk about how your point of view of a film has changed over the years? And how there was always one film that you enjoyed actually watching at the cinema as well as afterwards on DVD/Video? Well - I now have three films that I can proudly proclaim I have remembered being at the cinema to watch, have enjoyed the whole process (waiting, researching, watching, gossiping afterwards and then purchasing for home viewing!) and will cherish forever! May there be: Oscars all around! Content audiences all around! And continuing successful careers for ALL the cast and crew of all three films all around! :) Peter Jackson et al. : You are truly gifted, talented and worth every bit of your being here on Earth! And to J.R.R. Tolkien, for making this magical world of yours available for all to experience in the first place, Thank you.
10.0~mixed feelings peterwijn Sign in Permalink After Fellowship and Two towers I could hardly wait to see how it all ended on the screen. Already knew the ending after reading the book, atleast thats what i thought. Where is Saruman in The return of the king? He had a rather big part in the book's ending! And Aragorn and Arwen??? Don't think Tolkien meant it that way. On the other hand the scene's with the olifaunt's.....Great!!!! Never seen such things in film. I thought after the Matrix i've seen the ultimate effects, but this was breathaking. Legolas on one of the olifaunt's was great (thats my opinion). And the dead army...beautiful. Some people now think that there will be a following movie because this one has an open ending, where they see that i don't know, but i don't hope that. This story was told, altough great parts are different then in the book, and it was told in a way that many years from now people still want to see it and talk about it. Maybe The Hobbit will be a nice story to put on the big screen, although my hero from the lord of the rings will not be in it. And that is Samwise Gamgee. I will be one of the people that will see this trilogie many times,but i will not be alone in that i think.
10.0~wonderful fishfeet Sign in Permalink this movie is so beautiful and meaningful, every scene with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin is terrific and you will go to hell if you didn't cry when they're on mount doom or the end where Frodo leaves, this movie is a cinematic epic filled with wonderful effects, some of the best acting i have ever seen, Sean Astin deserved at least an Oscar nod, and Elijah Wood will soon win at one point, his eyes just tell you what he's feeling and whats he has been through,and Billy Boyd and Dominic Mohangan have finally grown out of their trouble making comic relief roles, this movie is not to be missed. also very good acting from Ian McKellen, Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, and everybody else in he incredible cast.
6.0~Is this thing ever going to end? komedydude85 Sign in Permalink It had its moments, but it just wouldn't end. I know it has to loosely coincide with the books, but jeez, I had no idea when it was going to end. It must've faded out like 5 times before it finally ended. I was not very happy with the ending. The rest had great special effects and okay acting, but why did they put in that bedroom scene. It was so unnecessary and really effeminate. Sorry to all who made the movie, but it just didn't make the cut in my mind. 3 and a half hours could definitely be better spent. If you think this movie is great, please don't plug it in front of me. I've seen all these movies, and I can say for almost ten hours of footage, I wish I could have those ten hours back. Just didn't strike me in the way you ever-quest playing people would think it is great. Have a nice day and go screw yourselves.
9.0~The best conclusion to a trilogy (even better than Return of the Jedi!) Spike-Washington Sign in Permalink I'd been following Lord of the Rings since the 2001 film and had a lot of hopes for the third film. And they were fulfilled here. It's easily the longest and there were plenty of action sequences, but it was all worth it. This was also the only one of the trilogy I had seen in theaters. What a hit! Everyone was cheering at the appropriate times and it was such a ride. For both the audience and the main characters. The ending was both happy and sad and it was a grand conclusion that could outdo Return of the Jedi. Who knows, maybe it did. Peter Jackson, this is your best work. It's the 2000s answer to the original Star Wars trilogy. And the loose ends are all tied up. Do yourself a favor and watch it.
4.0~immensely frustrating lkh2006 Sign in Permalink I looked forward to this film, especially after the darkening tone of The Two Towers. However, I was vastly disappointed, as character and plot were subjugated to action sequences. It's true that no one could ever bring Tolkien's works to screen in true fulfillment of their genius, but Jackson made changes that, in addition to being entirely unnecessary, hurt the meaning of the film--and the whole trilogy--immeasurably. The only reason I gave this film a halfway decent rating was that the visuals are amazing and the acting strong--it's the story that suffered. Reducing Gimli and Legolas to comic relief was a waste of the actors' talents and was really a rather senseless move. There were many changes in this film, some that made it work better as a movie and some that hurt it, but a few dramatically altered the tone and purpose of the story in a way that made the moments leading up to the conclusion not make sense in terms of continuity. I will never forgive Jackson for changing how the ring was destroyed. The moment in the book--when Gollum bites the ring and Frodo's finger off of the hobbit's hand and dances with glee at having his "precious" back, only to fall to his and the ring's destruction--is so poignant and beautiful, so perfect, that I cannot understand why Jackson changed it. It is that moment of joy--decreased to something one almost doesn't notice in the film--that is so beautiful. In addition, Frodo had not yet, even in his acceptance of the ring, become like Gollum, searching and fighting for it no matter what. When Gollum takes possession of the ring, Frodo's true self returns. That, too, is significant and likewise ignored in the film. There are further manifestations of this sort of problem in the film. I guess I'm saying that what Jackson did took much of the deeper meaning out of the story, reducing it to a more simple action-adventure story. That's not what it was in print, and given the earlier films, that's not the story we were following on screen, either. The story is about something greater, deeper and more meaningful, and the third film utterly fails at conveying that.
10.0~Best of the series, hands down joelman Sign in Permalink For those fans of the books who have been watching these films unfold during the past 7 years, it has been a journey of love, labor and a good number of sacrifices... but a great deal more rewards. For those fans who have only just begun to discover Middle Earth through the films, Tolkien's masterpiece 3-part epic remains intact in its message, imagery, and timeless virtue. Here preserved on 35mm film for all to see is the capstone to the epic film series that has become an international phenomenon with critics, fans, and especially the box office. The Return of the King is the big payoff. In a sense the film is just that, the third chapter to a massive 11+ hour epic film, and certainly the most rewarding film of the series. But for being packed with exhilirating action, nail-biting suspense, intense dramatic scenes and heartfelt emotional scenes that will make grown men cry - The Return of the King tells the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings with surprising patience and a very carefully wrought edge to storytelling. Here the many strands of the story are skillfuly interwoven throughout the film and eventually brought together in a very momentous climax which will literally make you want to rise up from your seat and start roaring battle cries along with the bedraggled warriors on the screen who, in the face of unstoppable hatred, rally together and charge forward nonetheless. You will love this movie. If you have missed seeing the other films then go and watch them to prep yourself for seeing this one. You simply cannot miss this while it is in the theaters, it will knock you down and you will love every minute of it. 10/10
10.0~Nothing short of Amazing! MovieManiac44 Sign in Permalink In December of 2001 I was practically dragged into the theaters to see a little film called: "Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring". I never had previously wanted to see this film but like I said I was dragged. After the begining of the film I was totally in awe at how good and intresting it was. I could not believe I never wanted to give it a chance. Needless to say I loved the movie and could not wait to read the books and see the second film. Now almost 2 years later after seeing the Return of the King I am absolutely stunned. This movie was spectacular. Not only was it breath-taking and amazing it was heart-wrenching. Chills literally ran up my spine as Aragon spoke to his troop before the final battle for Middle Earth. I felt like I was part of this huge battle and it was emotional and great. I am now convinced that these movies are among the top ten movies of all time if not at the very top! Peter Jackson and his whole crew deserve all the awards and nominations you can imagine. If anything I cannot say enough about this film. Take note of Sean Astins performace as Sam. Not only does he stand out among the other actors but his pain and emotion seems so real. I recommend this film to anyone who has a love for cinema! This is an event that should not be missed by anyone! Amazing 10/10 enough said!
10.0~This is The Movie MovieChopper11 Sign in Permalink What can I say? I've read a lot of what other people said about this movie. Some positive reviews but other not so appreciative. This is why I've decided to write a review myself, even after so many years since this movie was released... I felt I owe to it at least that... I did not grew up with Celtic tales as I'm not from that part of the world. However, as a kid, I've read a lot of tales, from my own folklore but also from other regions as well: European, Far East, Middle East, American, South American, you name it. The Lord of the Rings was not one of them and I didn't knew anything about it until I saw The Fellowship of the Ring. From that moment on, I just couldn't wait for the next release each Christmas. When finally I found the book translated, I bought it and read it. All three movies were already seen by then but I've still read it. For all of J.R.R Tolkien fans, yes, the movie doesn't respect the tale in every aspect. Yes, Bombadil is missing. Yes, the swords of the hobbits are not carried by Aragorn and we could keep on this way for hours BUT... what would be the point for that? I'm speaking about the movie, not the book. LOTR (the whole trilogy) is The Movie. Even after I read the book, I cannot think of a better way to put this huge story on screen. For all those who are upset because the movie does not respect 100% the book: guys, we are speaking about 9 hours of film to put the whole story in a coherent form! Something had to be cut, something had to be "adapted" to make this movie enjoyable and not boring. My opinion is Peter Jackson and his entire crew did the best job it could have been done. The cast is almost perfect, starting from Frodo and Gandalf and ending to the last elf, orc or hobbit. Very good acting using an excellent script, giving to the movie a touch of Shakespeare drama. Breathtaking landscapes and cinematography, superb costumes and design, a music that surely will be subject of study by film music composers for many years! Great CGI, I have to say it because I've seen a lot of movies where CGI ruined everything! Here is not the case! Each of the three part made me to be there, in the middle of the story. I was Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, even Saruman or Gollum. I felt like I could ride Shadowfax, shake hand with Elrond or take a tour of Minas Tirith on foot. I've lived every single battle, slaying orcs aside Theoden or Faramir. After three hours, the only thing I wished for was to continue the adventure for another three hours. 11 Oscars? I guess this tells us everything about the movie... Maybe it's not the perfect movie. For me, however, it's the best I've ever seen so far! Thanks to all the LOTR crew for this precious gift!
10.0~Peter Jackson has accomplished the impossible maximinus76 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's LOTR The Return of the King is truly the art of cinema at its best. Despite the numerous grumblings from people over who or what would be cut (I being one of them), the film seamlessly ties together all of the hints and plot lines scattered throughout all three movies. The final battle for Minas Tirith has to be one of the finest sequences ever committed to film. And, no it was not just the action. The sets, customs, and overall 'feel' was beyond my wildest expectations. A must see experience.
9.0~Excellent tshodan Sign in Permalink Some spoilers may appear: Jackson comes thru, even the removed sequences that he took out of his script do not effect the magnitude of this epic film. The only weakness this film shows is found in its endings. While Jackson actually truncates the many endings of this tale left by Tolkien, its still long and dragged out. Im still looking forward to seeing the extended edition.
10.0~Epitome of Epics crazymonkey89 Sign in Permalink History was made in cinemas, higher than at the level that Star Wars achieved in the 70's, on December 17.I was one of the fortunate people who didn't have to go back home because the tickets were sold out. This movie has crossed its Rubicon by several times. The acting surpassed that of any of the previous movies(as great as they were, they are not close to the acting in this movie), and I specifically mention Sam. His acting was what you would compare to the best of actors. Directing was more superb than usual and it was expected from Peter Jackson to do so in an epic of such magnitude. The CG special effects were marvelous beyond all doubt and Smeagol (Gollum) did an even better performance than in "Two Towers". A special Oscar from the Academy should be made for 'best non-human thing'. The Battle of Pelennor Fields was a spectacular showdown between the armies of Sauron and the Free Peoples of Middle Earth. The sound system in the theater was top-of-the-line, so this helped augment the sounds of the battle, creating a feeling of tremendous awe. The Wagner-style theme and music filled the room, echoing the grandness of this movie. The climax was too astounding to explain in words when the "end of all things" finished. The end was so heart-wrenching that nearly all of the people in the theater were in tears as they were not prepared for it. However, a few necessary scenes were cut out to reduce the running time, and I think this affected the emotional impact of the story. Despite this, 'King' is easily the most near-perfect* movie in history! If there was any movie that was worth recommending(also commending), this is it! I *The Extended Edition coming out late next year will include most of the cuts, so it is safe to presume that 'King' is the best movie ever!
10.0~Masterpiece LukeWilliam Sign in Permalink All of these movies were amazing, but this one is the best of the 3. It is one of the best, if not the best movie I've ever seen. It was filmed perfectly, the acting was dead on, and the special effects and battle sequences were mind blowing. The camera views were perfectly placed so that you can see everything that is going on throughout the film. Peter Jackson is a genius in my book. He deserves all the awards he got for the films. If anyone dreams of becoming a film director, they should try to model themselves after Jackson and this film. J.R.R. Tolkien is also a genius. The books and movies are so deep. He practically created a world with all the realms and people involved with it and how everything fits together. This is definitely a movie you have to see.
10.0~Must watch. akmalazhar-14933 Sign in Permalink The effort they put into making this movies, its insane. Gotta love this D n D based movie.
10.0~a worthy finish humpback Sign in Permalink wow.................... ok, I am still breathing. This is definitely the grand flourish that finishes the series. Epic, breathtaking and final. No more needs to be said ! Of course - one could list awesome settings, whether real, CGI or model, the true mother of all medieval battles ( I foresee an army of rip-offs going to copy this one ), great performances (Kudos for Bernhard Hill, John Temple and Viggo Mortensen - I never believed they could do real justice to those three rulers, but they did ) and an ending that truly kept the spirit of the book. Peter Jackson deserves an entire mountain range of praise for how he managed to pull this off. As an aside - you need to have seen parts one and two to understand this, latecomers to the series will be hopelessly lost plotwise. Second - while the battles are graphic, terrifying and violent, they are astoundingly blood-less. Still, not for the squeamish and faint at heart, and think hard about bringing children - if Helm's Deep had some bad moments, there is far darker stuff here ( especially for arachnophobiacs ). And yes - loath and dread from the rabid fans out there - Peter Jackson dared to edit some scenes to resolve in a different way from the book ! Let the "fanboys" ( I would call myself one - having read the book like 50 times in the last 25 years - but I loath the term and the people who claim to be "true fans", with the "one true vision" of the LOTR ) and nitpickers gripe and moan - I heard not one cheesy or cynical comment from the audience in the whole 3+ hours playing time (they sure weren't asleep ). Honestly - who in his right mind cares if not each and every scene sequence and dialogue is precisely true down to the accentual inflections of what is written in the books - Jackson's (cinematic) telling of the story can stand proudly besides Tolkien's (literaic) one. Like the Hobbits - it needs bow to no-one ! 'nuff said. Am off to get me tickets for another showing. 10 of 10 rings from me - and crossing my fingers the Academy will not do a cheap 'cop-out' on this one
9.0~the journey may have ended, but the legacy will live on TheUnknown837-1 Sign in Permalink And so, Jackson fulfills his vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's story of Middle-earth and he does so with breathtaking detail and near-flawless artistic craftsmanship. Both previous entries of Jackson's epic "Lord of the Rings" trilogy were spectacular achievements. "Return of the King" is an eleven Academy Award-winning movie and I suppose it's very worthy of such a title. It pretty much has won all of its Oscars for the entire trilogy, finally scoring big in the Best Picture category. Box office was also incredible, this film is the second biggest hit worldwide, just barely behind James Cameron's superb film "Titanic". "Return of the King" is the conclusion of the trilogy. The stories of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Aragorn, and the others comes to a close as the characters all meet their fates. The final battle against the dreaded Sauron begins and there are numerous, almost countless battle sequences throughout the film using combinations of live-action actors in costumes and makeup, and state-of-the-art flawless visual effects created through months of hard work. The giant deranged elephants, trolls, and the sadistic Gollum are all incredibly convincing despite the fact that they are simply an illusion put on the film screen. Sometimes you might be able to guess that they are CGI, but Jackson's skills at directing a medieval battle sequence draws you into the action too much to pay any attention to the detail of the graphics. And you have to look hard to find any possible flaws or weak points. The Lord of the Rings is an amazing film trilogy, definitely one the best, ranking amongst others such as "Star Wars". "Return of the King" is an amazing achievement as well. Perhaps its only flaw is the excessive running time at nearly four hours in length. Still, that does not make it a disappointment in any way. That is unless you want it to be extremely faithful to Tolkien's original work. For me, it's a great movie.
10.0~no comment yuzeribrahim Sign in Permalink No require many words for review just look at the movie's title..
5.0~A poor conclusion to the trilogy karlito5 Sign in Permalink Essentially the Return of the King (ROTK) is a rehash of the Two Towers, think about the basic plot is the same, Frodo continues on to Mount Doom whilst the rest of the fellowship do battle with another enemy bent on the acquiring the ring. The final battle meanwhile is an inflated version of the climax to the Two Towers, only in the ROTK it is considerably less enjoyable to the crudeness of the CGI. The less said about Elijah Wood's performance the better, he was irritating at best in the Two Towers yet he managed, somehow, to be even more annoying in the ROTK in that he has more or less the same expression on his face throughout the entire film. The flaws in the ROTK though cannot be entirely attributed to the actors and crew, since Tolkien's book is easily the worst in his trilogy. The book is simply a long fuse leading to an all too obvious and therefore uninteresting climax. Peter Jackson's film, meanwhile, is over long and has nothing new to offer - for example, try to pin point anything meaningful that happens in the final half hour. In my opinion Jackson's undoing was that he stuck far to closely to Tolkien's novel. In the ROTK another 'good guy' needed to go (George Lucas made a similar mistake in Star Wars VI) had Jackson written out say Samwise he could made the audience unsure as to which characters would survive. Perhaps Frodo should have fallen into the lava at the end, after all he had been corrupted by the ring. In the film though Jackson only gets rid of Theoden who was only really a peripheral character. Don't get me wrong though, I do not have anything against the trilogy in general, I thought that The Fellowship of the Ring was a brilliant film and I thought The Two Towers was a very solid adaption. With the ROTK though I felt I had wasted three and a half hours of my time waiting for one scene in Mount Doom and a pretty uninspiring final battle, invincible warriors show up with Aragorn hardly nail-biting tension is it, especially when compared to the stunning battle at Helms Deep in the Two Towers. The ROTK could surely have been shorter too. All in all the ROTK falls way short of the FOTR and the TT which was a shame because the ROTK's failings really do in my opinion drag the whole trilogy down.
1.0~all hype, no delivery thetax81 Sign in Permalink Without the use of computer graphics, this film would not be worth the price of a cheap bargain day 3 for 1 special rental at the local video store. True the locations and cinematography add to the film, however, heaven forbid that the cast should either have to act, or in the case of the veteran actors, overact! CG removed, and this thespian (in name only) grouping are woefully short of the depth and quality characterization brought forth in the classic book. The direction is sporadic, and the pace is inconsistent, leaving little to the imagination why so much of the budget was spent on computer technicians instead of acting lessons. Sorry for all those who jumped on the lemming band wagon for this one, but, lift your heads above middle earth and return to the land of the living.
1.0~Boring Rocky63215 Sign in Permalink This movie is so damn boring. One of if not the worst film ever made. Give me a real movie with real actors with a producer with real talent. These movies made me want to throw up they were so horrible, don't waste your 3 hours watching this movie it's not worth it there's better ways to spend your time. Did anyone really believe that green thing that can't even talk. It was like that stupid Jar-Jar character they put on Star Wars. Now if you want to see a movie with action and adventure with better writing then go watch Face/Off don't waste a minute of your time on this movie. Please, who ever voted and made this movie #3 where it doesn't belong it should be along the lines of worst movie ever. I rather watch From Justin To Kelly a billion times then waste my time watching a movie like this.
10.0~great story debopriyonandi Sign in Permalink A truly epic and beautiful end to one of the most incredible stories made in the history of mankind. Chapter of interpretations, the best over the trilogy is Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, and Ian McKellen in the role of Gandalf. That has been one of the best performances of Jackson. It's a perfect epic. There's not one false step. The battles are incredible, the characters just as fun as ever. This movie is basically flawless. One of the best ever. Like all great fantasies and epics, this one leaves you with the sense that its wonders are real, its dreams are palpable. The conclusion of Peter Jackson's masterwork is passionate and literate, detailed and expansive, and it's conceived with a risk- taking flair for old-fashioned movie magic at its most precious.
10.0~Took my Heart figwit_2190 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings Trilogy must be the greatest three movies created! The beauty and art of these movies is fantastic and without a doubt magical. The Lord of the Rings the Return of the King was a beautiful heart grabbing end to the best story ever told. It has a great amount of different emotions running through you, happiness, sadness, and anger all at once. This movie ended a journey that i myself went on with Frodo. The beauty and majesty of these films are too much to handle. The love, the hate and the anger are all mixed in with believable, incredible acting to steal your heart! The passion and love in this film is amazing. It taught me for one, the power of true friendship and love. I cried at the end, not only because of the sad parting of the fellowship even though they loved one another so deeply for they had grown so much by each other and learned the true meaning of life, but also because it was over. There will be no more Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn and Arwen and Legolas and Gimli. They are gone forever. And they took my heart with them.
10.0~Best Of The Trilogy mattieahawkins Sign in Permalink This is by far the best out of the trilogy the story comes to a very intense and strong climax in this film with strong acting and very emotional moments it will keep you captivated throughout, the siege of Minas-Tirith is by far my favourite in medieval battles i've ever seen. Would highly recommend watching The Fellowship Of The Ring And The Two Towers Before Watching This Title as the story is fully linked to the two previous films and some of the story will not make sense if not watched. But even without watching the previous films this film holds its own and is still more than adequate watch without the previous films, I wont add any spoilers but its definitely by far the most satisfying ending to the trilogy and i believe they did the Author proud.
10.0~Too good to be true, simply doesn't leave a thing to the imagination. yuvg Sign in Permalink Everything I'd hoped to see was shown, not a bit less. Some might say it's too long and that a few of it's parts were irrelevant, they just didn't understand the depth. Lord of the Rings? More like Lord of the Movies.
10.0~Most spectacular movie I have seen IAM4UK Sign in Permalink Many people ask me to identify my "favorite movie," or the "best movie" I've ever seen. I deflect such questions, because too many factors and subjective judgements affect and periodically change my answers to them. However, I will state unambiguously that "The Return of the King" is the most spectacular movie I have ever seen. Best? Favorite? I wouldn't say. But certainly the most spectacular. Wow!
10.0~Amazing. pawznhooves Sign in Permalink Absolutely incredible. The storyline is enticing and gripping. I found myself anxiously shoving in the next disk after each movie. The character development is flawless, as is the entire story. J.R.R Tolkien's dedication to these characters was properly reflected on screen. Peter Jackson did very well giving the book life on film. The casting was very appropriate, I especially loved the casting for... You know what? All of them. The love story was also an interesting touch, as I felt that it gave Aragorn an extra dimension. The feminist addition to the story was also great. All of the morals of the story I loved and admired entirely.
10.0~spoiler loragoj Sign in Permalink As Sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of Middle-earth, Gandalf the Wizard and Théoden King of Rohan rally their forces to help defend Gondor's capital Minas Tirith from the looming threat. Aragorn finally claims the throne of Gondor and, with the aid of Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf summons the Army of the Dead to help him defeat Sauron. Still, it comes down to the Hobbits, Frodo and Sam, to bear the burden of the One Ring and deal with the treachery of Gollum. After a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous lands of Mordor, seeking to destroy the Ring in the place it was created, the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.
10.0~The Greatest Movie Of All Time.... theoden_the_king_of_rohan Sign in Permalink Sometimes in life there are times when you feel the happiest, the proudest and the luckiest. I have never, and I mean NEVER seen a film quite like The Return of the King. I am huge Tolkien fan, and now officially a Peter Jackson fan. The Fellowship of the Ring + The Two Towers combined does not equal The Return of the King. I give it a 10 out of 10. I would stay and discuss it....but I need to go view it for the 3rd time!!! Farewell!
3.0~It's always the same aoiharu01 Sign in Permalink The directing and editing are still so bad. Better than before, but it's always a big deception. Jackson have no sens of space, proportion, he don't mind of his character. The entire problem with The lords of the ring "trilogie", it's everything are shot at the size of the book, and never at size of the history or the characters. There's no "point of vue", we never passing trough the eyes, the heart, soul or passion of the characters. The great saga what i would like so much to see is never come. This is just an adaptation, not cinema.
10.0~Truly glorious benjmiles Sign in Permalink Extended edition. 4 hours! So worth it. This is a truly glorious, if very long but we'll deserved, ending to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is Jackson and co at their finest. It was always going to be a full-on final piece to the incredible journey. The acting is perfect, sets are breathtaking and utterly amazing, the action and effective TS are brilliantly done. Honestly there really is nothing at all wrong with this film. This trilogy will stand the test of time as being the pinnacle of film making for fantasy.
10.0~One of the best venuradananjaya Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movie i have ever watched.
10.0~Loved it AbbyJordyn Sign in Permalink It's such a great movie!! I loved everything about it!
10.0~Fairytale of lifetime, now as movie catja Sign in Permalink I can't believe that this fairytale of lifetime could be turned as movie like this, this was much better than my imagination produced when I read the books. This was unbelievable, so near perfection. Thank you :-)
9.0~At the end of all things... Skeloboy Sign in Permalink It's over. No more Lord of The Rings(well, there is still the extended). When I first realized that Peter Jackson was gonna to make the movies(in 98-99 or something like that), I was thrilled. Then I saw the first movie, and I was totally amazed, the same goes for The Two Towers. And then the day came, where Return of The King had premier, and I was so excited. The movie was absolutely fantastic. The score is one of the best ever, and the visuals is absolutely amazing. Does the movie follow the books? No, not entirely, but that's not so important. The important thing here, is that Peter Jackson had made an amazing adaption of the books. Something he have from the appendices, and somethings from Silmarillion. Jackson has managed to create three movies for the fans, and for those who haven't read the books, and that is the hard thing to do. This trilogy will live forever. Return of The King. 93%/100 The trilogy: 96%/100 Skeloboy
8.0~BRILLIANT ITSMESANJEEV Sign in Permalink This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.
10.0~Perfect Fiction nlakshithakb Sign in Permalink The film The Lord of the Rings is the first film in the series and the most memorable film in the film. In the film, the movie has a special place. It is necessary to produce the story through the characters, Director has been successful.
6.0~Sometimes more is LESS! ringram Sign in Permalink One has to admire this film (and the others in the trilogy) for its technical achievement and the scale of the undertaking, but that doesn't mean it is due any special respect beyond that. Of course opinions will vary wildly (and probably mostly contrary to mine), but for me this was just not sufficiently entertaining to justify its length. Well, the story is familiar, and that probably undermines the film for me (and I am not in awe of Tolkein's work anyhow), but just because Tolkein went over the top there was no need for Peter Jackson to follow. I would have probably liked the film better if it were not so long and repetitive (how many battle scenes can one watch before tiring of them). Sometimes more is less!
7.0~from a 41 year old woman who never read the books bgalligan Sign in Permalink I have seen all three "Rings" films in the theater. That's the only place that does them justice. I thought the final chapter had a bad case of not knowing when to quit-itis. The director couldn't seem to let the story go. The major battle sequence was beyond exhilarating. (spoiler) And, of course I loved the woman who did the faceless bad guy in.."I am no Man!" He crumbled like the wicked witch in Oz. I don't really take these movies seriously. I've never really cared about any of the characters. Maybe you need to be a male who grew up reading the trilogy. The trilogy is pure entertainment. Elijah Wood(en) seemed to be striking two notes. Either he was crying or he was glaring in rage. What a dull character. I guess I wanted him to be stronger. Throw the ring in already. I guess we could blame the ring. Maybe he was hypnotized. I found Sam much more interesting because Sean Astin's a better actor. I guess I'd give this a movie a 7-8. I have a difficult time giving fantasies a 10. Oh..is it just me? or is Gollum incredibly difficult to understand most of the time, in every movie. I guess I'll have to put on the close captioning when I rent the DVD to figure him out.
10.0~Iconic Movie ! vinayakbaldi Sign in Permalink I do not get impress so easily to Give very good rating it is not my cup of Tea, So far only 9 titles I have rated 10. This Movie Is on Top of those 9 Titles. Why ? I like a complete Package mean it should have :- Best scenic beauty, (if it is their). Character's :- Best and very clear. Animation Part is Best and clear. Best Music. Perfect amount of Humour,emotions & comedy. Powerful story. Movie runs in speedy And specially when movie runs 201 minutes in 2003 and even today is a very BIG BIG BIG Disadvantage but in this case when time End we do not know I specially wished it should have lasted a little more. Conclusion :- I Feel lucky that movie was released before my Death and I was able to Watch It.
10.0~The best movie biniamin20 Sign in Permalink This is the best movie of this god damn century, funally some perfect movie which can combine all of movie categories such as horror and drama and so on,... this is the best there is.. and he deserve to be a winner, cause them all, all the other movies, just cant be such great as it..well done mr. jackson, keep doing what you do..an make more movies for us...you the best..lotr is the best, the matrix just blew it all, just blew it, and that is very bad... why "the year of the matrix" became all of a sudden "the century of lord of the rings", cause peter jackson had a vision, and that vision came true by outstanding rating, and the number of those who have seen it, this is the true king.. this trilogy, this producer, well done.. lord of the rings: the return of the king- the best of the best
2.0~I'm going to see one of adventures, or I thought that Andres-Camara Sign in Permalink Well the fact is that from time to time I have put it at home, even knowing that I did not like the movies, but I feel like watching an adventure movie and I say come on, I'll see the. The problem is that in a while I start to get bored I start to see that I do not like anything like this carried, that does not catch me. It should be a movie with the typical values of friendship, honor, courage, but apart from having great fights and adrenaline rush through your veins. I should create a spirit of wanting to enter the adventure to the end, no matter what I do tomorrow, but when you think that you have to endure this nine hours to see what you think, if it were another movie if but not this one. I had a complete material to create a world at his feet, to do what I wanted, had money to do everything and for my taste has not got almost nothing. I do not think he took advantage of all the material he had. I do not think he took advantage of the spaces he had. The possibilities were immense and it remained in a simple film. The photograph is very well, telling that there is no plane touched by computer and with the means that he can not. But the management does not get me to catch. I do not believe that fascination that adventure movies created for me years ago. Let's not talk about plans. With that material, he only knows how to make airplanes or close-ups. How can you make an adventure film in the foreground? He does not know how to compose plans, he only knows how to make general plans or close-ups. Of course the makeup, the hairdresser and the dressing room is spectacular, but there is a lot of money behind. I will not make the criticisms of the other two because they will be like that, I will only say that I was watching the second part and it seemed that I was filming in Aranjuez, not wanting to disparage Aranjuez and the third I do not know how many endings , But too many. When it seems the end has already come, go on and on and on and on and on and up seven times. Anyway, I must be me, I imagine you will all be against me, I'm sorry, forgive me the fans of these films.
9.0~One film to rule them all mikham Sign in Permalink WIthout a doubt, this is the best of the Lord of the Rings films, and even less doubtful is that it is one of the greatest films ever. 3 hours and 20 minutes flies past, and you don't notice how the lower half of your body becomes completely numb. A visual spectacle on the grandest and most refined scale, with an excellent screenplay, great cinematography and excellent acting. Some scenes which will stay in your mind, will be the march by the Rohirrim, Legolas bringing down an oliphaunt accompanied by Gimli's reaction, Eowyn v. the Witch King and Aragorn's speech. The interactions between Frodo, Sam and Gollum provide for very absorbing viewing as well. The seige of Minas tirith is amazingly done as is the battle at the Black Gate and the bit in Mount Doom. All in all, well worth seeing again and again and again... Maybe if there was one tiny flaw, it was that the ending does seem to drag on a little bit, but after what you witness preceeding that, you don't really care.
10.0~Hail to The King reneverdad Sign in Permalink Gutsy Jackson made a musical epic phenomenon. Even when continuity falls apart in Shelob´s cave, THE RETURN OF THE KING IS AMAZING. Finally the hobbits sang LIKE IN THE NOVEL. Finally Aragorn looks amazing as a king and sing. Gollum mets his antique body and finally we saw a lot of eagles and dragons. The performances are astonishing, Sean Austin deserves awards. Billy Boyd makes a great performance and Sir Mac Kellen shows his anger even when people could think his shy and peaceful. We never saw Sauron but we fear him all the 3 and a half hour movie. What happened with Worm Tongue and Dracula? they just are hidden in the tower. The women finally showed their guts and Peter jackson presents his aesthetics so depured and full of color and mysticism. Annie Lennox presents the original song in the end and it´s a jewel. We can see the friendship of hobbits and the tour de force of Gollum. The best film ever? i think is one of them it´s not just an epic film. it´s a mirror of world history. Is it good? yep, even when billy boyd fight against Sauron´s sphere and pretend he is hurted as frodo did in the first part, the movie shows how magnificent is Tolkien and his perception of his Middle-Earth. Hail to Aragorn Hail to Tolkien Hail to Jackson Hail to God. RENÉ V.
10.0~Best we could have hoped for ( possible spoilers) mdorband Sign in Permalink First let me say that I have read Lord of the Rings several times and love the books and they have a special place in my heart. I have seen the first two movies in the theater and on DVD, standard and extended editions. I saw the third appx, a week ago and I must say that it is the best of the three in many ways. I was riveted to the screen. It was in a word, intense. Let me tell ya what the theater was like in Daytona Beach, Florida. First it was packed. which is no mean feat in a large retirement community. The crowd was mixed, of all ages, even babies, which worried me that they would start crying sometime during the 3 plus hours, but such was not the case. there seemed to be an air of excitement before the film. During the length of the film, very few people got up to go to the rest room or for refreshments and those that did, literally ran up the aisles as fast as they could to get back as fast as they could for fear they might miss something. The film had that feeling for me through out. I just simply did not even consider leaving for any reason. At points during the film you could hear the audience ooh, ahh and even sniffel back tears and emotions. At the end, there was applause. Actual live applause in a small local theater. Sure, the film strays from the book in several meaningful ways and even some parts are personnel favorites of mine, but the reality is that this is film, and it is just not possible to include the depths and lengths that Tolkien delved into in such glorious detail in his work. I can just imagine Return of the King could have been 8 hours long, easy, especially if the scouring of the shire were included. It is almost another movie unto itself. I was with people that never read the book and they were just as much in awe of the film as I was. Jackson deserves the Oscar, no doubt. These films could have been an utter disaster, mangled beyond recognition and made in such a way as to have had no credability and no possible hint of reality, but instead delivered the heart of the story and incredible action, with care to the meaning and spirit in which Tolkien intended. The acting was good to excellent. the casting was over all brilliant. I don't see any particular actor recieving top honors from the academy, but, that may be because the focus was on all the characters as opposed to singeling out just one of the bunch. This is a must see film. It will change how films are made in the future, in more ways than one.
10.0~An emotional drift elliottthomasc Sign in Permalink After reading all three books and watching the first two films, I was extremely excited for the critically acclaimed finale. As expected, this film did not disappoint one bit. Cinematically this is an enormous triumph and a huge success. Amazing writing topped on prestigious directing with some of the best CGI usage I've ever witnessed on film. Great acting by all of the stars and the supporting actors and actresses. Keeping this spoiler free. First time ive ever cried at the end of a film. Super inspiring. This trilogy (the movies and books) also makes you feel deeply connected with both the characters and the story throughout. I 100% recommended this film and all of the other Lord of the Rings movies and books. Truly a Masterpiece
10.0~Greatest film ever made maurofonsecaff Sign in Permalink I watched this movie in 2004 as soon as it came out in DVD, because I was too young to go to the movies to watch it (born in 1995). It has always been the greatest to me. Watching it again, after nearly 20 years, just proves my feeling about it. Yes it is huge and even tiresome, but also monumental and titanic. The pinnacle of movies, by any means. Powerful and clever, capturing the viewer entirely, until its bittersweet end (which is also another big win in its favour). Keep in mind, its predecessors held a pretty big standart, and it delivers all it has promissed. Samwise the Brave, the crowning of a king, "The Greatest Battle of Our Time"... and to quote one of my favorite parts... "Centainty of death, small chance of success... What are we waiting for?" GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.
10.0~The best Fantasy movie, ever! zorgg Sign in Permalink In my humble opinion the lord of the rings is the greatest blockbuster in the history of the modern cinema. It has monumental music, monumental action and monumental story. The story where forces of good are good and forces of evil are wickedly evil. It is a clash of light and darkness, life and death, law and chaos. The film compromises some of the greatest characters in the modern literature- should this be Gandalf, Aragorn, Frodo, Saruman, Sauron or the Nazgul (Ringwraiths). The special effects are breathtaking and must have been awarded with an Oscar. It should be as singnificant for the humans of XXI st century as "Trojan War" and "Odyssey" were for the Greeks and Romans.
7.0~Many Problems, But It was a Fun Movie. kyoto1981 Sign in Permalink Just saw it... I'm tired as hell now. The film begins as young Golleum(still in human appearance) fishing on the bat with his friend. His friend catches a big fish and gtes drawn into the water.. there the innocent friend(like Sam to pathetic Frodo) finds a ring in the water. Golleum sees it, kills a friend and takes it from him. Cut to Golleum with two hobbits on the journey... now digitally animated... I know from the moment I saw first few minutes the film was going to be a dumb crap, like the first two installments. Too long- easily cut to half yet missing some key personnels(Solomon... "The Villain" in the first two who never died on "The Two Towers"- what the hell happened to him? Too much downtime. Break after each battle- don't be chilling like you are on vacation, Aragon! And why did he let ghosts leave after the first battle? Let them take care of the last one, too! But Peter Jackson... his obsession with those zombie looking characters were certainly there. good work, I love ya Pete! MVP- Eowyn(Miranda Otto), killing one of them superdragons and dark lords like she's the strongest human being in the film.?She should be the Queen instead of Aragon becoming the king. And Sam... saving loser Frodo's p*ssy a number of times- a true hero. Yet Frodo gets all the credits- don't understand. Villains. Big oalks were cool, but elephants.. I like elephants, don''t slay them! And those human(more precisely, Turkish looking skin headed) looking villains. is this film a racist. I guess fantacy movie can do whatever so 99% of cats can be whites and still pass. I'm not mad. Finally the ending.. it keeps going on and on. never seen such a long deneument in films before. Despite all the problems, this trilogy is definitely setting a landmark to film history- better or worse. It should win all the awards. They are just awards, after all, especially Golden Globe and Academy... such jokes.
5.0~The book took less time to sit through fawnlebowitz Sign in Permalink I find it very hard to believe this is #4 of all movies! Oh, it was a fine story, but it went on forever. I think everyone that gave this a high vote fell asleep for an hour in the middle and just gave it a high mark because they were guilty. I admit I had to fast forward through a bunch of it just to keep my interest. Some random thoughts: Ghost warriors? didn't we see that in Pirates of the Caribbean? The Battle-Elephants: didn't we see that in one of the Star Wars movies? I was expecting to see an x-wing fighter come out and trip the elephants with some kind of cable. Did you notice the TOTAL ripoff of BraveHeart? -- basically any battle scene in the LOTR trilogy was a ripoff of BraveHeart. What was Mr. Smith from the Matrix doing? it looked like he was pimping Liv to Aragorn?! of course, anything with Liv gets at least a couple of stars! but why did she get third billing in the credits? she was in for like two small scenes? Why was Frodo the star? Sam had him beat from an integrity perspective. of course, he was a pain when he was in 24 last season. What was Charlie from Lost doing? it looked like he was being carried in the last two movies--Ent's in LOTR2 and by whats-her-name in this one. Basically, i think this is WAY over-rated. At least there were no Ewoks.
10.0~Frodo and Sam. Sirus_the_Virus Sign in Permalink After the second film's release, people started making jokes. Not because it was it was a bad film(which it wasn't it was spectacular). It was because Sam and Frodo became very close. People were making gay jokes. THat was a funny time. The third and final Lord of the Rings won best picture at the Oscars and it deserved it. The final lord of the Rings film is by far the best in the trilogy. In the final chapter, every character continues they're battles. Frodo(Elijah Wood), Sam(SEan Astin)and Gullom(Andy Serkis) continue their adventure to Mount Doom. This time their get into scarier situations then ever. THey get tangled in huge spider webs and stuff. THey also figure out that Gullom was just with them to kill them and steal the ring. You also find out a little more about Gullom. THe last Lord of the Rings film is far from disappointing. It's an amazing film that will stay in you heart forever. It was very upsetting to see such a fantastic series come to an end.
9.0~Ace film kellypibworth Sign in Permalink Must watch!!! Thrilling and exiting from start to end.
10.0~Not my favorite movie, but possibly the best I've ever seen rughead Sign in Permalink There are other movies that I will watch more often than LOTR:ROTK, but I don't think any of them are actually better. This movie does an amazing job of completing the cycle of the trilogy while still being its own movie. It stands on its own merits. If you know the basic story of the first two movies of the series without actually having seen them, I am confident that you would be able to follow the movie quite well anyway. If you have seen the first two parts of the trilogy, you'll love how certain bits of ROTK tie into them. This thing is a '10'
8.0~Overrated ... peacefrogx Sign in Permalink Cliches, cliches, cliches and more cliches. Melodramatic, sappy, hokey, childish... I felt like I was watching Harry Potter all over again. But at least HP was TARGETED at 10 year olds. This movie was supposed to be an epic; a finale. Hardly. There was nothing different between this film and either I or II, save for the fact that they finally let Frodo put the biscuit in the basket, uh, I mean the ring into the fire. Nearly 11 hours of the same build-up, movie after movie. The battle scenes were, of course, incredible but c'mon, computer-enhanced imagery and trickery has become redundant. There is no suspense, no fright, when you know the outcome. Maybe the D&D geeks amongst us get off on this computer fantasia bull but I don't. Really now, was there any great difference between LOTR II and III when it came to the battles, save for the bad guys were now on elephants instead of ugly, giants Orgs? Nobody can argue that Tolkien's story is incredible - you could strip all 3 of these films of all the special effects (overkill) and the story would still be fantastic - but when you keep laying on all the pre-battle buildups and then drone on about the unconquerable power of the ring, well, after a while, I just wanna' hit the pause button so I can see what else is on.
10.0~Greatest film i have seen so far. shadowu-1 Sign in Permalink I have seen this movie a total of 5 times. Three times in Theatre. This has to be the best movie ever. From the first when Frodo, Sam and Gollum wake up in a cave and continue with their Journey, to the end when Gollum and Frodo battle each other for the ring. If i had the chance, i would watch this movie again. I recommend this movie to anyone that loves medieval type stuff. Paul Ward I give this movie a rating of 9/10! Thanks for reading. :) Oh, and this movie has the best visuals i have ever seen in a movie. The best acting.. the best everything. Thank you Peter Jackson for such a great movie!

10.0~emotional, but exciting end to the trilogy!! bluehouse-69659 Sign in Permalink This is I think, the best Lord of the Rings out of the 3. It was so sweet how Aragorn and Arwen got married but sad that he turned Eowyn down. But Eowyn and Faramir are together so that is super cute too. I loved it how Eowyn and Merry went out to battle together. Even though they both almost died. I cried when Pippin sang that beautiful song, Billy Boyd has a fantastic voice!!! I also cried at the end when Frodo left forever on the boat with Gandalf, Galadriel, Arwens father, and Bilbo. The long hugs and goodbyes were so sad between Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action, adventure, and romance. I left a lot out but I don't want to spoil it that much!
1.0~doesn't belong in the top 250 pjyielder Sign in Permalink first, i am a huge fan of the LOTR series by Tolkien. it is one of the most richly detailed and wonderfully written stories of all time, and it pains me to see the dreck that peter jackson has produced. i didn't mind 'the fellowship of the ring'; i thought it was definitely the most concise and well-directed of the three films. also, the visual aesthetics of the films are excellent. the set design and choice of locale is impeccable, and i applaud the people involved for their dedication to recreating the surreal wonderful world of tolkien on screen. however, it is the technical aspect of the project, what should be the real beef of the film, that puts the knife in. 'the two towers' marked the real beginning of jackson's self-righteous altering of tolkien's noble story, and left many fans and serious film-goers wondering what went wrong. but 'return of the king' takes the cake for what could very possibly be the worst adaptation of a novel in film history. jackson changes large portions of the plot of the novel for no apparent purpose; even friends of mine who had not read the book asked me why certain scenes resolved the way they did. the character development is excruciating, as some of the major character-based events from the book seem rushed and inconsequential in the context of the film. jackson has done a great job at remembering the characters' names and their titles, but has drawn a blank on their behavior, values, emotions, and relationships with other characters. the script is pathetic; tolkien's majestic storytelling and tasteful use of pathos and emotional turmoil is replaced by long-winded, sappy, cliché monologues, complete with the exact same musical score used for the previous two films. entire scenes are based around petty arguments and melodramatic emotional breakdowns, and filler dialog is rampant; it seems that jackson did this simply to keep the 3-hour running time. the action sequences are grandiose and somewhat true in objective form to tolkien's telling of them, but jackson employs cinematography that is on par with a nickelodeon miniseries, using cheap close-ups and nauseatingly swirling camera angles that leave the viewer feeling more confused than involved in the action. jackson throws in some cheap action film comic relief during the battles, giving the viewer the impression that the characters are not fighting for their lives, but rather swashbuckling for swashbuckling's sake. very simply, this is not the 'lord of the rings' that i grew to love years ago when i read tolkien's masterpiece. i am a supporter of artistic freedom in the adaptation process (i.e. kubrick, coppola), but not when the adapter simply has no artistic ability in his craft (jackson, genius behind such film classics as 'the frighteners' and 'dead alive'). this film does not belong in the top 250, nor do the other LOTR films. knowing that this film is above 'seven samurai' and 'casablanca' (and that the first two LOTR films are the reason 'citizen kane' sits at #11) sickens me.
10.0~I have a new favourite film UnlovedSeason Sign in Permalink and this is it. I was outrageously fortunate to attend last night's London premiere of King and, though I don't say such things lightly, this goes straight into the list of candidates for best film ever made. Rest assured, fans, less liberties are taken with the source material than was the case with Towers. But never mind the literary roots - this is CINEMA at its best. Spectacle to put Ben Hur or the Star Wars films to shame; emotion and the human dimension to rival American Beauty or even Casablanca; settings and cinematography that make you want to sell your flat tomorrow to get New Zealand air tickets; and, of course, astonishing performances. So, who to give the Oscars to? Besides Best Picture, Best Director for Peter Jackson and Best Score for Howard Shore - those I take as given. Surely Sean Astin for Samwise - and make that Best Actor in a Starring Role. It's a large main-character cast, so how do you define the star? Put simply, he provides the emotional core, the heart of the story and the summation of its message about fighting for what you believe in, about courage, friendship and love - and he does it SO well. Besides, the Supporting Oscar belongs to Andy Serkis for Smeagol / Gollum. OK, I'm finished, now. I'll leave writing a proper review to others this time; my gush will have to do, as I don't want to include any spoilers and I haven't time to do this sublime film justice. I'll just say: Go and see it. Repeatedly. And buy the DVD - extended again, please! (Though what else needs including besides Christopher Lee's seven minutes, I'm not sure.) Enjoy!
8.0~Beware of the corny ending Angeneer Sign in Permalink So this is the end of the trilogy. For today's standards it is the apex of epic film making and audiovisual effects. Moreover it honestly tries to follow the plot of the books (but notice I'm referring solely to the plot). The Return Of The King is a movie you simply have to see for the sake of it. Now the bad part. It is unbelievably corny! Please, guys, why did you have to make the breakup of the Fellowship just a series of end-of-summer-camp goodbyes? No respect to the spirit of Tolkien, no inner meaning, no depth. This was completely unworthy of the rest of the effort and it spoiled it for me. Perhaps the whole crew got tired of this enormous project and daubed the last 30 minutes so that they could get over it.
10.0~Someone Peel Me Off the Floor FemmyV Sign in Permalink NO SPOILERS Just got home from the theatre and I'm still absorbing RotK. Huge is the word I keep coming back to. This movie is so huge it would be Texas if Texas wasn't so messed up. It is 3-plus hours of peak after peak after peak. It has its cheesy moments near the end but they are so rare as to be milked from mountain goats raised by peasant shepherds in Spain. ie, forgivable. Every Rings fan that trusted PJ & Company with this novel is in for a great reward. Even the lack of the Scouring doesn't seem like the major disappointment I thought it would be, if only because there's just so much to absorb in this movie.
10.0~Awesome, Phenomenal..... hullmackem Sign in Permalink You can't say much more about this film then the above two words. The best of the three films sure enough, but it would have been anyway probably. Not having read the books I cannot comment on its closeness to the written text but as the final installment of the best movie trilogy ever it couldn't have been better.
10.0~A perfect ending lasse-uk Sign in Permalink Extraordinary, brilliant, thrilling, beautiful and masterful. Some of the words that sum up this film. The Return of the King completes what has become the greatest film trilogy of all time. True the Godfather Trilogy is outstanding too and the (original) Starwars Trilogy was sublime and the Matrix Trilogy was stellar but they all pale in comparison to this trilogy which has become modern classics after only one year and one can already begin to look forward to the day Peter Jackson makes The Hobbit. Well back to The Return of the King. This film is outstanding in so many ways it is hard to figure out where to begin. OK, the cast: They all play brilliantly though some better than others. I think Ian McKellen has been the most consistent of the actors in all the three films. He was without a doubt worthy of the Oscar he didn't for Gandalf the Grey and he was great as Gandalf the White but unfortunately the character of Gandalf isn't in the second for enough time to truly show his qualities. However, in the third film we get to see Gandalf the White much more than we did in the second film and Ian McKellen's performance (though not as good as in the first film) is sublime. He plays with experience and variety worthy of even the greatest actors. Also Andy Serkis, who plays Gollum, is pure genius. How he does the voice is beyond me and one kind of feels sorry for him that he didn't get his own real performance in the film. Viggo Mortensen plays well in this film as he did in the previous films but there isn't to much variety in his acting and I could imagine I would get tired of him if I had to look and listen to him for any more time than he is on the screen. Elijah Wood plays very well I'd even say better than in the first two films and his chemistry with Sean Astin is very good. Orlando Bloom doesn't say much in the film (fortunately) because he really is not a very good actor he just looks the part. John-Rhys Davies plays well in the third film as he did in the first two films and I was happy that they toned down on the dwarf jokes. Bernard Hill is also a very fine actor who plays his part and then dies when he has to. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd play the characters who probably change the most during the films aside from Elijah Wood and they do so with humor and confidence witch makes them a joy to watch. The effects in the film are probably the best I've ever seen and I think they are so good that they will be valid for at least another 50 years. Especially the Gollum character continues to amaze me. All in all a brilliant ending to a brilliant saga.
4.0~Computer game over stensson Sign in Permalink One of the greatest triumphs in movie marketing has finished (or has it?). Regarding all billions of dollars there must be more to come. It's very difficult to understand all the fuzz about this trilogy. The plot is told in an average way, you have seen all the effects before (many, many times) and the acting is really no acting at all. Yes, it's entertaining in a way professional action movies mostly are. Cut the first hour and the last half hour and keep the battles. That would do this a perfect movie for twelve-year-olds. Yes, many things are professionally done on the screen here and you surely don't feel like you've been sitting in the same chair for about 3,5 hours. But once again. What's the fuzz?
10.0~Amazing Dinu9 Sign in Permalink This trilogy is purely amazing, words can't describe.
10.0~Couldn't Have been better...FANTASTIC mctrigger2002 Sign in Permalink This film is a major achievement. It is the most wondrous, engrossing and entertaining film I have ever seen. This will take some beating. The best battle scene ever. Peter Jackson must be rewarded with an Oscar.
10.0~Best of the Best jon_jon Sign in Permalink I have watched it three times and enjoyed it more than the previous viewing this is simple a marvelous movie. The ending is just fine and don't understand why some people didn't appreciate it i think it's needed. I rate this 10/10 the trilogy will definitely be at my favorite movie collection list.
5.0~The only good things about The Return of the King are the two films that came before it. iamthenumman Sign in Permalink The great bang that started with The Fellowship of the Ring went out with a whimper. Somehow, after pushing through one harrowing obstacle after another armed with nothing but wits, courage, and sheer sacrifice, our heroes finally came to the end of their rope at Minas Tirith. By all expectations, this final climatic battle should have ended with the scorching of the White City and the utter annihilation of the last remnants of the enemies of Sauron. Yet, miraculously, a legion of undead floats (literally) forth from god knows where and sweeps aside the minions of Sauron like a storm scattering leaves. This turning of the tide takes about 10 seconds on screen and not only ruined the Return of the King for me, which I immensely enjoyed up to that point, but almost killed my high opinion of the entire LOTR trilogy. The movie should never have introduced the undead and stayed true to the book's use of Man as the ultimate victor over Sauron's Orcs. This plot alteration makes Aragorn appear vain or foolish, since given the ease that the undead defeated the Orcs and Mumakil at Minas Tirith, it would not have taken them much greater effort to rout what remained of Sauron's forces in Mordor. Yet Aragorn insisted on releasing the undead prematurely and drawing out the Orcs in Mordor in a largely token gesture. It further undercuts the wisdom of all the protagonists (Gandulf, the elfs) since none of them had the foresight of focusing on reforging Narsil and use the undead to handily defeat Sauron. The third installment in the great LOTR trilogy possesses none of the energy that made the first two films so compelling. Even the final climatic battle feel tired and rely on witticism and deus ex machina to carry the plot through to its conclusion ("I am a woman." I concede this line is quite a classic, however.) It is, much like Matrix Revolutions, the worse film in the series, riding on the coat tails of its much more captivating predecessors.
8.0~awards winning epic SnoopyStyle Sign in Permalink Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are guided by Gollum to the darkest of Mordor. Gandalf leads the group to to Isengard where they are surprised to find Merry and Pippin having already defeated Saruman. Pippin touches the crystal ball and Sauron mistakenly assumes that he is the ring bearer. Gandalf and Pippin travel to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith but they find mad Denethor on the throne. The quest comes to an end. There is a ton of CGI and it's state of the art. It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven. Technically it is far superior and the story is a compelling epic.
10.0~They said it couldn't be done. Jackson did it. Sander Pilon Sign in Permalink This movie is the second '10' in my vote list, and so far it counts 650 movies. Having read the books, I, like many, formed my own middle earth. And for a movie it is next to impossible to live up to the already established image the excellent books have left in my mind. But Jackson did it. Never have I been so impressed with a movie. There are numerous 'wow!' points in the movie, from the first shots of Minas Tirith to the arrival of the elephaunts to the fight with Shelob. A breathtaking amount of detail and care has went into the movies, from the digitally created Gollum to the straps on the kings armour, the production of the movie is near perfect. Words fail to describe Minas Tirith, and the cast does an excellent job all around. Some people here say that the ending is too long. Indeed, the movie does not follow the current hollywood standards of a climax and then the end. I blame hollywood. I wish more movies would take the time to wind down and end their story properly. Some people say that the movie left out some important parts of the book. They are right, but it would've made the movie too long. On both accounts Jackson made the proper compromise. Peter Jackson & Team - Thank you!
8.0~10Words - The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King anothaonechampion Sign in Permalink An emotionally outstanding conclusion to a trilogy already outstandingly perfect
10.0~Best Cinema-theatrical Experience nugrahane Sign in Permalink I've been a fan of the book ever since I picked it up 10 years ago, and I have read it several times since. I had particular imaginations of what Middle Earth should look like, the atmosphere, the sound, the smell, the characters, and miraculously, Peter Jackson brought up to life all those things ! There are things that are different from the book. There are images and effects that are flawed to nitpickers, but (especially straight after watching Fellowships of The Ring EE and The Two Towers EE), Return of The King is such a complete, amazing movie experience on the grandest scale. I'm going to go watch it on the theatre several more times. Thank You, Peter Jackson. Now take a bow ! (who said hobbit bow to no one ?)
10.0~No good way to put this....it is better than any other movie that has ever been made. rands-1 Sign in Permalink In a world were death horror and hate fill the air each and everyday, it is truly amazing that something so beautifully surreal and enigmatic, could ever be put out. The first two installments of this series left myself and most of the general public in awe of the beauty of these films, but the third is something different. The Return of the King actually makes you feel like its characters you relate to them not in a literal sense but in an emotional one. The themes of friendship and loyalty ring loud and clear, and everyone can relate to these themes in one way or another. Never in it's three hour and thirty minute stretch did the movie lag, this is a feat not easily accomplished by any film. Take the two newest matrix movies for instance they do not even begin to approach the three hour mark yet they feel longer and Return did. Also the amazing amount of material covered, how did they ever fit all of these events into one film? There really felt like there were 5 different movies playing at once, but they are edited together so well that the time just flies by. This is the first film I have seen in my life that actually gave me a hope in todays modern man, with all of the terrible things that happen everyday I have little faith left in the goodness of man. The team that brought us this film have shown an unpresidented amount of goodness, in that people have the ability to see something so beautiful and dedicate so much of their lifes to making it a reality. I highly doubt there will ever be such a grand ensemble of people working on a single film for the rest of our days. These films will trancend generations for years to come and go down as the most successful and important films of all time. Never again will something equal the magnitude and heart these 11 hours of film have. Return of the King: Greatest single cut of film of all time. Lord of the Rings: Greatest whole film ever produced. My hats off to you Peter Jackson you have given life to what we all thought was a dead world; commercial film.
9.0~Great, but far from flawless, final installment nerettyksduredro Sign in Permalink I watched this on the night of the 17th December, sitting in the middle of the front row of a THX-theater. My ears are still ringing. Let me start by writing that this film contains some of the most exhilarating battle-sequenses of all time. *SPOILERS AHEAD* The Great: 1. Frodo, Sam and Gollum start to climb the stairs near Cirith Ungol, just as Saurons army starts marching out, and Frodo starts wandering towards the tower instead. I was cringing in my chair like I have never done before, I almost couldn´t watch. One of the most brilliantly unsettling scenes of all time. 2. Pippin using the Palantir. Done just right, with brilliant SFX. 3. The establishing shots of Minas Tiriths, going all the way up to the top with the White Tree. If you thought the zoom-out from the mountain (Caradhras) in the first film was breathtaking, that was just a little brother to this. 4. The attack on Minas Tirith. Brilliantly done. When they start catapulting giant rocks down on Saurons army, and when the Nazgul starts attacking, it is epic battle-scenes at its best. 5. The Rohirrims appearance and the subsequent Battle of Pelennor Fields. The appearance of the Rohirrim was simply magical. When Theoden started to rouse them to battle, I found myself writhing and making loud exclamations at a rate I have never done before in a theater. Luckily, there was noone sitting near me. Anyway, it was mostly drowned by the soundtrack. The following battle, and the coming of the Army of the Dead, was simply the best ever on film. No exceptions whatsoever! 5. Sam and Frodos encounter with Shelob, and their final journey to Mount Doom was one of the most intense action-sequenses ever filmed. When they started their final descent to Mount Doom, my blood-pressure was probably 10 times the normal. I can´t even call it bristling with tension, it was far more than that. There were more great moments, but I can´t list them all here. The flaws: 1. When the final retreat was called at Helms Deep in The Two Towers, it was immediately followed by a close shot of a thoroughly ghastly Orc thoroughly bashing a human soldier. An almost exact repeat of that is used when they decide to give up Osgiliath in this film. Maybe Jackson wanted to use it as some kind of trademark, but it was more tiring, because it was repetitive. 2. Same thing with the Nazgul, at Minas Tirith. Someone shouted `Nazgul`, and then we had the good old IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!- screams, and everyone cowering. Tiring. 3. No duel between Gandalf and The Witchking of Angmar. Early on, Gandalf spoke of the leader of the Ringwraiths as the most fearsome member of the enemy forces. But nothing was really made of that, the flying creatures the Ringwraiths rode were more fearsome and killed more humans. The Witchkings last stand was rather tame too he only said something like: - You shouldn´t stand between a Nazgul and his prey. And then he was killed. 4. The One Ring in Mount Doom. Like I said, the journey to Mount Doom, was really exciting, but once inside, they slowed it down too much. First of all, Frodo stands at the edge for so long that it becomes boring. I am not a Tolkien-purist, but I believe that they should have filmed at least this sequense exactly as in the book. Instead, when Gollum attacks the invisible Frodo, he bites his finger off and takes the Ring. Then, instead of dancing around in mirth and losing his foot-hold, HE SITS DOWN AND STARTS CARESSING IT! At last, Frodo approaches him and PUSHES HIM OFF THE EDGE! Sorry, this should have been done exactly as in the book, with Gollum screaming a final precious-s-s. Instead, we see him down there, and it takes some time for the Ring to be destroyed. It should have been more urgent, with Saurons fortress starting to crumble as soon as Gollum fell down, without help. In the book, it also underlined that the Ring always betrays its bearer in the end, as it happens to both Frodo and Gollum. 5. The ending. This was drawn out too much, which made me forget the impact of the earlier scenes. It made me want it all to be over, instead of enjoying it. I think they should have gone faster to Frodo sailing out on the Elven ship, and skipped Sam going home. Or they could have edited it more tightly, without skipping anything. To end it, let me just say that the Army of the Dead was the most scary and impressive spectres ever to be put on film.
10.0~AMAZING MOVIE. Best one I've seen yet! ejda Sign in Permalink Return of the King took my breath away. It was beautifully done and I was pleased to see how well Jackson followed Tolkien's vision throughout the trilogy. I was excited to see Return of the King take best picture at the Globes and am sure it will get the oscar also.
9.0~My favorite out of the trilogy. ObjectiveGray Sign in Permalink This is the best out of the trilogy - books or movies - and it is a well-done movie. However, it is important to note that as Legolas' surfing down stairs on a shield in LOTR:TT was uncalled for, so was his surfing down the trunk of the oliphaunt. That and many other comic-relief moments took away from the movie and made it a little too "Hollywood" for my taste. But, luckily, those moments are far and few between. It was a good movie and a fair addition to the movie trilogy. You should still read the books for the full story, though. Much of the third book is not included in the third movie as it is really a combination of the end of the Two Towers and some of the Return of the King. Read the books.
10.0~The epic movie u-12770 Sign in Permalink A good movie, is bound to have a fixed number of elements: beautiful pictures, beautiful music, ingenious design, excellent crew members. Of course, these must be established at a time to stand the scrutiny of the script. The Lord of the rings, I do not know whether it is "no latecomers" but must have been "unprecedented". It is bound is fantasy film landmark outstanding representative. The Lord of the rings, good-looking, but big debate, many people to it as pure fantasy film, but in fact, the displayed video things far beyond the category of magic. The Lord of the rings, Peter Jackson shows us the movie art the most fascinating characteristics: a people completely forget the reality of escapism -- full of atmosphere of classical Gothic fusion of Norse mythology, Greek mythology and Anglo Saxon mythology elements. With Wagner. Shakespeare is full of grand and magnificent music style. Peter, with the integration of these many long directing shows us a magnificent full of a powerful and unconstrained style, color of the world, a alluding to reality but drifted away from the reality of the world. In this world, man is the absolute protagonist, although this role for the whole film increase sub lines a bright color, but can not change the film to masculine tone. Full of masculine beauty of the building, the dark sky, magnificent mountains, war scenes thrilling, legato Ledu is a stream of blood the flavor, this is indeed a man in the play. But when we read the entire film, you will find that most impressed us is not grand scene and dazzling picture. But that in the dark can still see the light of hope and in the case of a failure still adhere to the belief in the success of. This reminds us that face no matter how powerful dark, should adhere to the justice of conscience and courage. Besides Frodo, this hero he is not in the traditional sense. He does not seem to be a full of wisdom and strength and can resist all temptations of the great man, in the film, and Aragon, wise handsome wizard Archer seems to be better than his to take the task of destroying the ring, even the ridiculous stubborn the dwarfs are stronger than he was. But the author Torkin believes that small characters can change history. Because a great need to persevere in the faith, it is actually a very broad meaning, the "magic" exists in the hearts of every person, it is human greed. In reality, the Lord of the rings everywhere obviously, money, beauty who tempted you to mind anything you may become the Lord of the rings, when you become greedy slave, you become a guru, and you have overcome greed, then you will become great Big Frodo. In fact, in the face of the temptation, Frodo than every one of us has more courage. But at the end of the film, the destruction of the Supreme Lord of the rings and not because Frodo beat it to evil forces. On the contrary, is greedy desires to murmur with the Lord of the rings buried in Mount Doom, from one side reflects the experience of two world wars in the mind of the author's pessimistic. I want to say is that both the film itself excellence great for, or in addition to the film's noble, the king of the ring has no qualms to what it swept the awards and box office.
10.0~Words Fail... robinpoe Sign in Permalink To describe the wonder of this film. The two previous Lord of the Rings films were superb, but the final film exceeded them all. Once again, Peter Jackson tested the absolute limits of the visual effects technology. Although the film was over 3 hrs, it seemed to fly by. The Extended Version DVD added scenes were excellent as well. The horse charge of the Riders of Rohan will long be remembered as an epic work of cinematography. Behind-the-scenes news says that ove 600 horses were used in the charge. While not as scary as the Shelob scene, the "Mouth of Sauron" scene in the extended version was very weird and creepy. The screenplay was beautifully written and executed. This is a flawless movie.
7.0~That ending was pathetic. I laughed so hard! giantkiller Sign in Permalink Of the three I think the Two Towers is the strongest. I thought the beginning of Fellowship was weak and boring, but I loved it's end. Bit now we have ROTK and I was hoping for more than I got. The beginning was disjointed, clearly the movie was affected by something having been cut. The middle was fanntastic. But that ending?!?!?! WHAT?!?! Ten different slow motion endings that made no sense. Homosexual hobbits jumping on a bed. In the showing I went to half the audience, myself included were laughing at just how pathetic this was. Just like AI ruined itself when the movie should have finished with the boy staring at the submerged statue, so ROTK should have ended with Frodo and Sam on the rock surrounded by lava. Anything but those cringe inducing eagles.
10.0~Quite Possibly the Greatest Movie Ever dylankielman Sign in Permalink Screw Finding Nemo,Lord of the Rings the Return of the King is absolutely the single greatest film EVER!!! Everything is just stunning about this film the actors, the story, the action, and the special effects. I think that Ian Mckellen should have been up for best actor during the Oscars. And finally the fields of Pelenor scene is absolutely the single greatest scene ever in a film that will have you at the edge of your seat with your heart pounding like hell through the entire scene. Now that I have all the positives out of the way let say some of the very few negatives. Some of the scenes should have been in films 1 and 2 here is the list *SPOLIER ALERT* -Foreging of Narcil -Shelobs lair -Plantir of Saurman Also where is Saurman? To sum up this review Finding Nemo is the worst film ever Return of the King is the best.
7.0~Great Story and Adaptation, Pretty Good Delivery (Beware...Spoilers) Enonemis1 Sign in Permalink The first time i saw The Fellowship of the Ring, i hated it. Then again, i have never read the books and i thought Isengard was a person and Sauruman and Sauron were the same person. After watching it on DVD, with subtitles (due to people in the room not being able to be quiet), i fell in love with it. The Two Towers was also a masterpiece. It was no better or worse than Fellowship, it was its equal, just on a bigger scale. Every frame of the first two were masterfully crafted. The actors were seemingly born to play their parts. Although both movies clocked in well over three hours a piece, i felt none of it dragged (there are hour and a half movies that have more dragging moments). Peter Jackson was quoted in saying that "The third movie is his favorite," and "this is the reason why you make the first two movies." So you could imagine how high my expectations were for Return of the King. Then the lights in the theater dim. The opening Gollum scene was beautifully shot. Especailly the sounds you here when Smeagol is gradually transforming into whom we know now as Gollum. The "then we forgot the taste of bread" shot was absolutely jaw-dropping. However, The Two Towers involves Gollum much more and felt it should have belonged there. It just seems like Peter Jackson is still dwelling on the issue of Gollum's insanity which was clearly stated in The Two Towers. Given it's an introduction, but it seems to linger on the second movie as opposed to starting a new one (which Peter Jackson claims is the reason why he took out Sauruman). Once the movie got underway, i was beyond impressed with Mordor and how Frodo and Sam walk through a barren land led by Gollum. It really gives a sense of darkness and that there is nothing that grows as they get closer to Mordor. My hope started to gradually dwindle at this starting point no more than 10 minutes into the movie. The celebration at Edoras was reminiscent of the party scene at The Green Dragon in the Extended Edition DVD of Fellowship and was quite the unwinder after Helm's Deep. The acting in this one is quite up-to-par, if not overshadowing, the acting of the first two movies...for the most part. Aragorn and Gandalf steal this movie along with Sam. Their facial expressions throughout the 3 and a half hour ordeal made me p****d off that no one was nominated for Best Actor or Supporting Actor (guess the Academy wanted to play fair for all the other nominees). I understand that due to pacing and runtimes, Gimli and Legolas have taken a backseat compared to the first two movies. That's not my real quarrel with Return of the King. In terms of directing style, this one seems distant from the first two. Th e camera angles of the first two are much more artistic. In this one, there are many centralized shots of the characters and many close-ups. It's a good concept to capture feelings and emotion but doesn't look as good on screen. What was so magic about the first two movies is that while you feel the emotion, the camera angles are just right to catch what's going on around the characters. That plays a big part in the sense that you feel like you're actually there with Gandalf and Aragorn or Frodo and Sam, not just watching them from a movie theater seat. There are lots of shots where you can catch the beauty of Middle Earth and all but there are just way too many close-ups. When close-ups are not used, extremely wide sweeping shots were used. This was a really effective tactic used when Gandalf and Pippin were first riding through Minas Tirith (a scene which put my jaw on the floor), but there was too much of it in the battle scenes. Helm's Deep had an epic scale, but was a better shot battle in the sense that there were many little individual battles going on. The Siege of Minas Tirith and The Battle of the Pelennor Fields featured mostly wide sweeping shots. The hour long battle of Middle Earth was seemingly a compilation of sweeping shots. Given, it is much more grand than Helm's Deep, but the emotion and sympathy are no longer present. I felt that The Battle at the Black Gate seemed rushed that also Gollum was on Frodo's back for too long a time and made the scene look comical. The endings, although they got many complaints were great to me (except for the overly mushy scene with Frodo on the bed. The fellowship could have been reunited in a better fashion) and the Grey Haven scene was one of the most beautiful shots of the whole Trilogy. The Return of the King, flaws aside, is a fitting close to a legendary Trilogy. The story and acting is just as good, if not better, than the first two movies building up to it. In terms of directing, it seems as if Peter Jackson was hard-pressed for time and lost a little (very little) of the magic he presented in the winters of 2001 and 2002. Don't get me wrong, i'm still buying it on DVD and i still run through the IMDB forums hoping to find news on The Extended DVD. There is no such thing as a perfect movie let alone a perfect Trilogy, but Peter Jackson has brought us as close as one could possibly be.
9.0~The Best of the Best i have ever seen webahar Sign in Permalink i am writing this review from a country where people only watches Hollywood movies because they thought there will be action , fighting in it, they does not understand the language though but they do understand the story as movie progresses, When i watch the LOTR back in 2006 for the first time, i was one of them, watch it for fun thrill and action, i watch it again when i understand the language to some extent, i find this movies more and more interesting and i was like fall in love with this movie, i have watched it infinite number of times, and still planning to watch the extended , 3d what ever version are available now in market. This review is for the peoples who are going to watch this. I suggest them to wait till the launch of "The Hobbit : There and Back Again" , and then start watching The Lord Of The Ring (Trilogy)and the The Hobbit's Movies , you will love all of the six movies in a proper sequence, i even thought that movies is more powerful then off its real books. but hats off to J. R. R. Tolkien for writing such an astonishing story.
10.0~hallmark of new cinema ja_bone Sign in Permalink I think what makes the LOTR movies all the more epic in nature is Jackson's downright strange and eery attention to visual detail. Return of the King has more than the other two; the scene where Sam and Frodo are approaching Mount Doom is a miniature epic all it's own - we truly feel Frodo's burden as he swipes at things in a hallucigenic state, we feel a sense of elation of the human (er hobit) spirit as he breaks into a run with the last remaining ounce of energy, the scene where Shelob crumbles back into the gloom, into the inifite darkness, is more allegory than plot. These are all scenes that could exist on their own - the fact that they belong to a movie that incorporates both epic-scale and human-character study into a seamless whole leaves one both out of breath, stunned, and very reflective. It's one of the best movies ever. Whatever discussion Tolkien fans have about whether LOTR can be argued from a metaphorical perspective, Jackson allows for all kinds of metaphorical impact. The beautiful, dymamic, soundtrack helps a lot too. This is a watershed kind-of movie. Stylistically, it incorporates all sorts of effects that are as original as they are effective: tinted lenses, panoramic shots that are absolutely impossible without cgi (like following a boulder as it's hurled through the air from a catapult) and effective but not over-done macro slow-mos'. I don't have the slightest problem with its length. It was a very short 3 and a half hours - I only remember one person in the theater getting up for the entire movie, and they were quick about it. The conclusion is a protracted 20 minutes, but each final departure is very important and I wouldn't want anything taken out. To understand the trilogy as Jackson's portrayed it is to understand it's most lasting, incredible impact: the epic proportions of it all can be paraphrased in the most simplistic, pastoral scene. That is how the movie ends, with a small family in hobbiton, and we realize that is what the whole shebang after all was all about. I think Jackson gave a perfect ode to Tolkien with his decision of a conclusion. Well done. 10 out of 10.

10.0~Staggering Achievement pianoplayinpaulie Sign in Permalink It would seem impossible for THE RETURN OF THE KING to be more spectacular or awe-inspiring than the previous films in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, (THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS), but the what seems impossible has been achieved. Once again forgoing a recap of previous events, the movie gets underway with a further explanation of how the ring of power came into the hands of the creature Gollum, who in his natural life was one of the river-folk named Sméagol (Andy Serkis). It is actually his cousin Déagol who first finds the ring, but Sméagol's lust for the ring is instantaneous, and in order to gain it for himself, he murders his cousin. We are shown is small bursts how the ring consumed Sméagol, and gradually transformed him into the dastardly Gollum, who now guides Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) through a secret passage into Mordor. From there we return to Isengard and the fortress of Saruman, which, when we last saw it, was under siege from the Ents, tree-herders of Fangorn Forest. Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) approach Isengard and are reunited with the two Hobbits Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). They initially return to the kingdom of Rohan, where there is great anticipation that the battle for middle earth is about to begin. From this point, the movie is wall-to-wall excitement. The photography and visuals are even more stunning than anything seen in the previous two films. Scenes of Aragon outside Rohan at dusk were particularly striking, and there is a truly breathtaking sequence where the Beacon of Gondor is lit, setting off a chain reaction across Middle Earth to alert all warriors that the world of men needs their aid. In addition, the stone city of Minas Tirith is one of the most breathtaking combinations of set design and computer enhancement ever put on film. The passages of the book dealing with Frodo and Sam's journey up the steps of Minus Morgul to Shelob's Lair, the tower of Cirith Ungol and ultimately Mount Doom have been realized to absolute perfection. It all looks exactly as Professor Tolkien described in his books. The sequence with Shelob is particularly chilling, as Jackson eliminates all sound for a particular passage and allows the silence to create a major amount of tension for the audience. Shelob is, gratefully, the creepiest spider ever committed to film. The battle on the Fields of the Pelennor features the most exhilaratingly exciting war action. Particularly thrilling is a sequence featuring Legolas and an oliphaunt. The brain is, of course, aware most of it is special effects, but they are so seamless, so utterly photo-realistic it is staggering. This is a monumental accomplishment for the digital teams at Weta. The battle for Helm's Deep in THE TWO TOWERS was impressive of course, but by all accounts, is made puny by what is seen here in RETURN OF THE KING. It's absolutely mind-blowing. The actors, who tend to get lost in films of this scope and magnitude, hold their own and tower right along with the effects. Viggo Mortensen demonstrates an inspiring command as Aragorn finally allows himself to lead the world of men. Miranda Otto has some wonderful, audience cheering moments as Éowyn, the maiden who refuses to be kept out of battle. Bernard Hill is quite stirring as King Théoden. Certainly not to be counted out is Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf. He has few scenes of grand acting like those in Fellowship, but when he must give his thoughts, it is quite moving. As with the story, it is in the hands of two little hobbits that all our hopes lay. As Frodo and Sam, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin more than rise to the occasion. Wood completely feels the exhaustion and utter devastation the Ring has put him through. Astin completely holds his own as he summons his own courage to help his Mr. Frodo. In the way of both of them is the wretchedly brilliant creation that is Gollum, who gets to be really nassssssty, wicked, tricksy and false (as he would say). The way Jackson has structured the finale, with fades to black after two of three scenes, however, makes it feel as though the movie is ending about three or four different times. I understand this device was used to demonstrate a passage of time, but perhaps there might have been a better way. That is a minor quibble in a film that is otherwise perfection from first frame to last. It will be an absolute robbery if Peter Jackson is not awarded the Best Director Oscar at next February's ceremony. What he has accomplished with this trilogy is so monumental and groundbreaking that he simply must be recognized somehow. I also hope it wins for Best Adapted Screenplay and, for Howard Shore's rousing, tremendous score. I cannot imagine a more successful movie-going experience this holiday season than THE RETURN OF THE KING. It is the Best Picture of the Year.
7.0~Weak Adaptation, But Decent Action Film michael_the_nermal Sign in Permalink As an added caveat to any spoiler warning: I will judge this film based on my enjoyment of the "Lord of the Ring" novels, and not based solely on the film's merits as a standalone piece. That is not fair, but I am not fair. To start: there is one other adaptation of "The Return of the King", and it aired numerous times on The Disney Channel many years ago, amidst Dr. Seuss and Winnie the Pooh specials. Many consider that a godawful adaptation, but it's fair to compare that with Peter Jackson's ultimately overrated movie, which is good as an action movie, but hardly worthy of the Best Picture Oscar (which was probably meant to reward all three "Lord of the Rings" movies simultaneously, considered as one giant epic). The Rankin/Bass 1980 cartoon adaptation was, in some ways, more faithful to Tolkein's vision than Peter Jackson's CGI extravaganza. The former movie had the deficits of having to squeeze 2/3 of LOTR as a backstory, and thus exclude major plot lines and characters; Peter Jackson's "Return" has none of these deficiencies. Still, the cartoon emphasizes the One Ring's evil influence, and incorporates Tolkien's dialogue in a credible way that Jackson's film does not. Frodo's influence under the Ring's power is better shown in the cartoon, where the hobbit (voiced by Orson Bean) glows red and grows angry and malicious. Elijah Wood simply bulges his eyes and looks out of breath. He looks like a doe-eyed Hummel figurine. When Elijah the Hobbit claims the One Ring as his own at Sammath Naur, it is utterly without menace or foreboding; the cartoon tries, however vainly, to instill the creepiness of the moment. Elijah casually claims the Ring in a nonchalant manner that utterly lacks passion. Importantly, the cartoon features a scene where Samwise (voiced by the dude who played Corneilus and Caesar from the "Planet of the Apes" quintilogy) spares Gollum's life out of pity; mercy and compassion, hobbit traits essential to the themes in the LOTR novels, is ultimately what allows the Ring to be destroyed. The final film of Jackson's trilogy has little of that theme incorporated into the story, instead going for action (to be fair, "The Two Towers" features a key scene where Frodo spares Gollum's life, but that's another review). In sum, Jackson includes Legolas and Gimli, and has the benefit of the whole of the LOTR backstory. Rankin/Bass lacks Legolas and Gimli, but makes up for it with a terse rendition of what it can salvage from the final novel, ultimately remaining faithful to Tolkein's tone and keeping key pieces of dialogue without looking ridiculous. The cartoon, for all its faults, has the benefit of crispness while retaining the important themes from the novel. Jackson has the great luxury of scriptwriters and special effects, but cannot remain faithful to the essence of Tolkien's works, with the very important exception of Aragorn's role as a protagonist. At least Jackson emphasizes Aragorn's (played by Weaps of "Crimson Tide") destiny to be the human ruler of Middle Earth, as told through Elrond (played by Agent Smith). The filming of Elrond presenting a reconstructed Narsil to our hero is beautifully done; for this, Jackson deserves praise, if only for emphasizing an important part of the LOTR epic that seems secondary to the whole business of destroying the One Ring. The acting varies in quality. Weaps is awesome as Aragorn, and takes his hero role seriously. The lovely Miranda Otto does bring passion to her ultimately secondary role as the heroine Eowyn. Elijah Wood is utterly dull as Frodo, though I don't know if his character is supposed to be this way. He is not an involving protagonist. Mikey from "The Goonies" is better as Samwise, and brings emotion to his role. Andy Serkis is wonderful as Gollum, but I preferred the crazed groans and screams of Brother Theodore from the cartoon. Still, Serkis does make Gollum come alive; out of all the actors from the movie, he deserved an Oscar. CGI doesn't impress me that much. This movie includes too much action, to the detriment of preserving the essence of the novels. The prolonged rendition of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields was meant to appease the average moviegoers who like thrills and spills. The Dead Men had a small role in the book, but Jackson brings them to center stage as Aragorn's ghostly allies, who kill off the oliphaunts and allies of Mordor. They look like the zombies from "Pirates of the Caribbean", and whether you think they're cool depends on how much you're deceived by CGI. This film is ultimately overrated, and definitely did not deserve the Best Picture Oscar. Still, it does remain true to some of Tolkien's art, in spite of its attempts to also be an action blockbuster. I recommend it, but true Tolkien fans are better off with the Rankin/Bass cartoon for a movie that tries to capture the themes of the literature that inspired it.
10.0~The greatest adventure film of all-time! OriginalMovieBuff21 Sign in Permalink There is no epic like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I have never had a better time seeing this movie in theaters. This breathtaking epic, is the third and last installment in The Lord of the Rings. Sam and Frodo are closer and closer to the cracks of Doom while their journey becomes very dangerous along with their guide Gollum helping. Meanwhile the rest of the fellowship try to stop Sauron's army from taking the ring. The movie is pure magical from beginning to end and the characters are all wonderful. Return of the King went very fast for a three and a half hour movie, mostly because I loved it. I have become very obsessed with the trilogy and if you loved the first two Lord of the Rings, you will definitely love the last one as well. Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+
10.0~A work of Genius All-round. The_Elfstone Sign in Permalink This was always my favourite part of the Tolkien Trilogy, and it turned out to be director Peter Jacksons favourite too. Watching all three films together will show the viewer how Peter Jackson (et al) have grown and the techniques they have employed have all gotten so much better, to culminate in this fantasy masterpiece. I always thought (from reading the books) that Samwise Gamgee was the "real hero" of the quest to destroy the One Ring, and actor Sean Astin turned in a stirling performance to match my expectations. Whilst some themes from the book are lost, it doesn't (in my humble opinion) mar the film in any way, with the slight reservation over the loss of the "Houses of Healing", as it lessens Éowyn's victory on the fields of the Pelannor. Overall though this is a small gripe. Don't listen to people who say that this is all about fighting and ancient war craft, it is a sure sign that if someone tells you this, that they didn't understand everything that goes on. Put simply this is a work of cinematic genius, a modern classic that will set the benchmark for all films that follow. If Peter Jackson does not get Best Director for this film, and the film doesn't get the Best Film Oscar, then I shall never watch the Oscars or see them as a fair judge of what is good in cinema. My only gripe (and it's directed at IMDB) is that their voting system doesn't allow you to vote 12/10 for this movie, because not only is it worthy of that sort of vote, but it deserves it too.
10.0~One of the Greatest Cinematic Achievements in Cinema's History! griffolyon12 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is a film full of ambition. That is what truly sets this film apart from so many similar fantasy adventures. The scope and scale of this film was enormous, I do not think that there has ever been a film made with one quite as large as this one, and I'm not sure there will ever be another. Though not only is Return of the King a true epic through and through, it also has a ton of drama. This film has so much emotional resonance, and it achieves this by simply playing off of these wonderful characters and who they truly are. When Sam picks Frodo up and carries him up the slope of Mount Doom one would almost feel their eyes begin to tear up. This film is not only a terrific actioner, but it is also a beautiful film that might even force the more hardened moviegoers to shed a tear before all is said and done. When it is over there is no denying that the Return of the King is one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film. I give the Return of the King a perfect 10 out of 10!
10.0~This is epic filmmaking at it's best... katarina_af Sign in Permalink *Some minor spoilers* The emotion of this film is just overwhelming at times. Stunningly beautiful, so moving, so inspiring. So many powerful moments: the determination of Legolas and Gimli to follow Aragorn to the end, the strength and courage of Aragorn himself, the loyalty of Sam, the love of a father for his daughter, the look on Faramir's face when he is rejected by his father.we become so in touch with these characters that we take every step with them, feel every blade, experience every loss. I wanted to take up arms in every battle, even the ones where defeat was imminent. I'm one of those people who's always saying "it's just a movie.", but this film got to me. This is moving, touching, epic filmmaking. When you see the leader that Aragorn is, the king he will be, and then you look at the leaders we have today, it's enough to break your heart. The willingness of Aragorn and co. to make the ultimate sacrifice for Frodo and, really, for mankind, was heart-wrenchingly beautiful. These are some of the most profoundly heroic characters that have ever been brought to life. You can't help but feel the emptiness when the fellowship ends; our lives have been changed along with theirs. And that's what good filmmaking does; it changes you, if only for a few brief moments. And as for all the critics.People, this movie is BASED on the book. It is not a word-for-word, scene-for-scene translation. I don't think you appreciate how painstaking a task it must have been to transfer a work like LOTR to the big screen. And until you can do a better job or know someone who can, don't criticize!!! The point of this movie was not to follow LOTR, masterpiece that it was, word for word. It's a different experience entirely than reading the book and Jackson's goal was to transfer the battle of good vs evil, the emotion of the journey, and the spirit of men (and elves, and dwarves.), which he did impeccably. Best line-Gimli to Legolas: That still only counts as one! Best moments: Pippin's song, Aragorn's speech, Sam carrying Frodo up Mount Doom, Legolas and the Oliphant (now THAT is skill). Somebody here actually described Legolas' stunt as "unrealistic".people, come on. This movie makes us believe in heroes, in goodness, in the true meanings of friendship, love and honour. This is by far the best movie of the year, possibly of all time. But don't expect those stiffs at the Academy to realize that. These are the same people that gave an oscar to American Beauty, for crying out loud. The moving performances of Viggo Mortensen (the only man I have ever seen actually look good with facial hair) and Sean Astin--and all the actors, really--epitomize powerful acting. This trilogy has no equal in modern-day filmmaking, because it combined a spectacular story with spectacular filmmaking, and gave a face and a heart to every beautiful hero in Tolkien's book.
9.0~The chapter that sealed the trilogy's legendary status jacobhunt6 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King truly captures the best of what this trilogy is famous for. Without such an epic conclusion to the series, I honestly believe that The Lord of the Rings may not have been considered a successful adaptation at all. This is a true epic in every sense of the word. This is a film with heart, emotion and incredible visual appeal. It combines the epic battle sequences of The Two Towers with the human element and character arcs of The Fellowship of the Ring. Our love for the friendship of Elijah Wood's Frodo and Sean Astin's Sam comes to fruition in this instalment, as does the camaraderie between Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, Orlando Bloom's Legolas and John Rhys-Davies' Gimli. Not only that, but this is the film that truly cements The Lord of the Rings as one of the greatest accomplishments in cinema. This was the culmination of nine hours of the most epic and much-loved trilogy to date, and it lived up to the expectations in a big way. There is not much more to say. The Return of the King takes what the previous two films did well and amplifies it several times over. It's bigger, it's more brutal, it's more emotional, it's more gripping and it's more inspiring. There's no question to me that if I only got to see one more film from this trilogy in my lifetime, it would be the third chapter without a second thought. Praise goes to Peter Jackson, of course. The action epic is a style of film so rarely accomplished to such a degree as this. To captivate and thrill audiences over the course of three or more hours is a challenge, and Jackson achieved not just that, but made it one of the most widely beloved films in all of history. The Return of the King is an absolute must-see, whether you're a fan of the Middle Earth folklore or not.
1.0~Shorter version of my review... master5000 Sign in Permalink I can't talk about the (thousands or more) positive aspects of this film when so many people are so overly optimistic about it and completely blind to it's sometimes unacceptable flaws. When I saw it I wanted to spit at the moviescreen. It's a truly great movie, but there are so many stupid unnecessary faults and flaws preventing it from being perfect that you just gotta hate it! Doesn't people see the excessive use of cgi-graphics making this film look like... Final Fantasy? Don't YOU SEE THAT?! What - you just think it looks cool??!! "Wow, look what they can do those special-effects-guys!" Don't you realize? No one will be impressed by the effex of this movie in 20 years! Those of you who haven't read the books, how can you like this at all as just a movie? cuz it isn't even a movie, it's a really detailed animated synopsis of the books (the three of them, that is) - and not really accurate at that! Ever wondered where the drama went, the depths of any scene or character, the direction and exhibition (if I can use that word) of the parallel story lines? or are you just revelling in the roller-coaster-ride-feel to the film: the cool effects, weaponry and armour, digital creatures, the battle-scenes and the heroic speeches with the typical romantic gaze of the eyes looking out over the horizon (I actually usually enjoy the latter things, but it's just too much here, and not good enough). This really is true porn for the mid-teenage RPG-junkie and immature and nerdy men. Are you really that superficial? Can't you smell the melted plastic? Sure, this truly is a gourmé-dish - all the more reason not to have any funny odeurs interfering with it!!!!! This review wont be helpful to most of you, of course. Cuz y'all are probably like everybody else. I just needed to spread my word. Get it off my chest. Peter Jackson deserves all the respect he can get (and the actors are really great and perfect for their roles) - but don't over-do it! This trilogy-film IS NOT the best movie ever made! Not a chance!!!!! Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away each carry more depth than all three parts of LotR together! It's MAGNIFICENT... and Overwhelming... but NOT BRILLIANT!!! A film of this magnitude shouln't leave anyone unsatisfied, but it did, at least with me, cuz it didn't live up to it's potential and it wasn't even better the the prior part! So of course I was mad at it, how couldn't I be?! How couldn't you be? It's like you're fanatical muslims or christians and this is the holy bible or coran - you can't even question it or criticize it! Wake up!
10.0~Once in a life time john-nail Sign in Permalink There are films that you can watch 10 times but this film i have seen almost 30 times and each time i see something new and it never falls short of making me sad happy and over joyed for start to finish,i never thought that making this film would ever work but after watching it all the times i have it would take something to beat it and i don't thing a film will ever come along i my life time to beat it,for any person to vote this below 9 i would never take note of again,you would be a foul not to see the other two films before this one,this is the best film ever made,this is a must see film for anyone and i hope you all in-joy as much i i have.
10.0~The best of the trilogy freemantle_uk Sign in Permalink After making two amazing epics, somehow Peter Jackson was able to save the best till last. Here we have the amazing conclusion to the War of the Ring, a brilliant adaption of a fantasy classic. Despite the victory at Helm's Deep and the defeat of Saruman (Christopher Lee) they is still a lot to do for the free people of Middle-Earth and the Fellowship of the Ring. After Pippen (Billy Boyd) seeing into the Palantír the Fellowship discover Sauron's plan of invading Gondor, and take their main city Minas Tirith. Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) and Pippen go to Minas Tirith which is under the rule of Denethor (John Noble) who has fallen into madness. The kingdom of Rohan lead by King Theoden (Bernard Hill) attempts to muster enough of his own forces to fight, but lacks the numbers. This forces Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) to take a dangerous path to ensure victory is possible. And in the midst of the wide battles is Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) attempt to take the One Ring to Mount Doom, under the supposed help of Gollum (Andy Serkins). But Gollum too has his own plans to lead Frodo and Sam to their deaths and take the ring for himself. There are also sub-plots to the action, like Éowyn (Miranda Otto) and Merry's (Dominic Monaghan) desire to fight in the battle, Aragon's doubts to become King and Arwen's (Liv Tyler) fate being tired to the fate of the war and the ring. Peter Jackson directs and co-writes a faithfully adaption of final novel in the trilogy. This is a an action-packed film that had drama at his it heart. It is an adventure film where people do die and the consequences of failure are sky high. This is the least comedic out of all three films, but it's better because of it. Jackson still adds a sense of fun to a mostly serious film and the battle scenes are some of the best ever put to film. This is a more loyal adaption to the previous film which ruined the Faramir character. They are some things that were left out which would nice to see in the film, like characters like the Prince Imrahil, the only Gondor man capable of leadership because Denethor lost his mind and Faramir was injured. It would have been good to see Saruman taking over the Shire like at the end of the book, the only really major thing that was left out. But for the most part changes were made in the film were minor or necessary to trim down the film. This is the film with some of the best lines in the series, like Aragorn's speeches and Sam carrying Frodo (that bit was taken straight from the book). There is top quality acting. Andy Serkis should have had a Oscar nod for best supporting actor. Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin and Sir Ian McKellen are of particular note. It is also Elijah Wood's and Orlando Bloom's best performances. This film is a great example of excellent art direction, film music and costume design. Everyone who was involves deserves credit. The Extended Cut is the best way to watch this film. The scene with Bruce Spence as The Mouth of Sauron is worth it alone. A must see.
10.0~I will not see the Hobbit unless Peter Jackson directs. Sign here. ricknorwood Sign in Permalink I, the undersigned, will not buy a ticket for the 2009 film of The Hobbit unless Peter Jackson directs. There is a long tradition in Hollywood of biting the hand that feeds them, of cheating the creators that fill their pockets. For more than ten years Gene Roddenberry, creator of Star Trek, the most popular syndicated series of the time, was told by Paramount that "Star Trek isn't making any money in syndication." Similarly, Peter Jackson has been accused of being greedy for wanting the money guaranteed him under his contract for The Lord of the Rings. Because he asked Hollywood to pay him the money they owe him, Halo has been canceled and he has been told that his services as director of The Hobbit are "no longer required". In other words, allow us to cheat you or you'll never work in this town again. The only thing these people will listen to is the almighty buck. If enough people click on "reply" and add their names to this list, maybe Hollywood will listen. Please click "reply" and sign below.
2.0~The trilogy fizzles out.... mahlersoboes Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson set himself up really well as a director when The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released. He had created a fast-paced and exciting yet beautiful and poetic thriller that utilized old cinematic tricks in fantastic new ways and, despite its three-hour running time, left me breathless. I had pretty high hopes for the rest of the trilogy. But alas! Jackson did not deliver. The Two Towers was, in a word, boring: it lacked the great screenplay and the emotional depth that Fellowship conveyed so wonderfully. And then came The Return of the King, which won twelve Oscars as well as critical acclaim. The three and a half hours that I spent in the theatre enduring that schlock are three and a half hours of my life that, very regretfully, I will never, ever have back. Why did this film fail almost completely in my eyes? Well, perhaps it's because Jackson spread himself too thin in the second movie: while the Frodo-Fellowship dual storyline worked fairly well (I won't say particularly well, but it worked) in Tolkein's books, in the cinema it has the unfortunate effect of making the story seem choppy, and the flow of the story is lost. Another unfortunate by-product of the dual storyline is that the divergent elements must come back together. How did Jackson accomplish this in Return of the King? By making the story's dénouement last over 30 excruciatingly long minutes. Jackson chose the tear-jerking happy/sad path for the ending, which wears its heart on its sleeve and reeks, to me, of a sort of Hollywood melodrama raised to the nth degree. While the dialogue in Fellowship had a poetic charm to its semi-Shakespearean prose, here it feels inflated and pretentious. Aragorn's address is reduced to a ridiculous and shallow "Let's all live together in harmony" speech that, to me, is a huge disappointment in context of the film's gigantic scale. Return of the King suffers in its two hours and fifty minutes before the ending from the same shortcomings as The Two Towersa broken storyline and a pretentious screenplay. The tricks that were used so well at first have become worn thinthe Ringwraiths, which in Fellowship managed to magnificently convey a real sense of evil and terror, are reduced to dinosaur-riding apparitions that are almost laughable. With the exception of the very well-done tunnel scene (which does produce the desired effect of suspense and shock), the monster scenes make you feel like you're watching some B-flick. One particularly ugly Orc, which I guess we are supposed to believe is some sort of supreme embodiment of Orc-like evilness, is never explained, never given any sort of credibility. In fact, none of the monsters have that grippingly real feel, which takes away from their scariness. The main thing that keeps a film alive for me is characters, especially in a film that tries to convey some deeper meaning like the Rings trilogy does. Most of the characters in Return of the King were about as three-dimensional as a life-size cardboard representation of a popular actor or sports figure. There is a clear demarcation here between good and evil, with little nuance to either side. Even the scenes where Gollum "battles" with himself are two-dimensional, from the "dialogue" right down to the cinematography, which shows that there are two very clear sides and nothing in between. The movie seems to be trying to show here that people can have complexities, but it doesn't work because it doesn't set up any complexities in its moral world. The Ring gives Evil a single embodiment: it is the source of evil Saurons' power, and the source of Gollum's treachery. The idea that all the bad deeds in the movie can be traced back to this one palpable object reduces the entire story to a one-dimensional and shallow didactic fable. And with all the fireworks that the film provides, the glories it tries to convey, the tragedies, this doesn't feel credible. I find myself yearning for something more complex, deeper, more meaningful. Maybe that's why I didn't like this movie: despite its remarkable action sequences, its overblown and inflated dialogue, it didn't have any real heart. I would say that this is okay, except for the fact that the film tried to be so much more than it really was. It set itself up as a gargantuan epic and ended up getting lost in itself. This is surely one of the greatest efforts in film historyI admire Jackson just for taking the risk. I can understand why he was chosen for the Oscarsthe trilogy does manage to sweep you along with its story and the breathtaking scenery and cinematography certainly keep your eyes glued to the screen. Unfortunately, such a huge, epic project needs more than dazzling special effects, more than flowery dialogue, more than huge battle sequences, more than a plethora of characters. It needs a heart behind it to match. As Dr. Seuss would say, Return of the King's heart is "three sizes too small." Despite its epic proportions, the film just doesn't feel "real." It plays on emotions, it dazzles the mind, but it doesn't really touch the heart; and ultimately, this lack of depth left me feeling insatiated after the bombardment of glories and tragedies. In conclusion, this is a film that impresses but does not stay. In terms of scope, it may be the greatest epic ever made; but unfortunately, it doesn't live up to itself. It could have been vastly improved even just by cutting the running time down to three hours; instead, it feels grand but emptyin a word, pretentious. And pretentiousness is, in my mind, inexcusable. "A" for effort, "D" for product. Thumbs down. Two stars.
10.0~Tremendous PlatiousDOTcom Sign in Permalink Movies have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I can watch my favorite films over and over again, I've studied films for years, and I've loved movies, aspiring to make my own, wanting to engulf my life in them.but I have never had a film experience like The Return of the King before. In film history there have been few films that have literally changed the ways movies are made forever, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Star Wars, but I have never really felt that there was one made in my lifetime (I was born in 1980 by the way), but I truly think (and infinitely hope) that Return of the King will change the way movies will be made in Hollywood (and the rest of the world). How can anyone claim that they are making an `epic movie' if it doesn't follow in this film's path? Why was it so great? It was everything. I don't get emotional at the movies very often, I don't get lost in movies often enough, and I DO NOT sit through a three + hour movie and not let my mind wander. But I did not want this movie to end!!! I did not want this trilogy to end. In a perfect world a Lord of the Rings movie would be released every year FOR ALL TIME! I totally bought every line, every image, every sound, every special effect, every performance, and every minute of this film. It was 3 hours and 20 minutes TOO SHORT. The reason why these movies are so great was because every single person making them was 100% dedicated to the project (I know this because I watched both 3 hour "extended edition" DVD documentaries). It was made all at once, just like the books were written, and IT SHOWS. Yes, I know the first two films had all the same amazing effects, sets, and music, but what stood out in The Return of the King was the PERFORMANCES BY THE ACTORS. Ian McKellen deserves the award for the most convincing performance/ perfect character/ and all around bad-ass! Gandalf cannot ever even be matched by any other character EVER. But Samwise Gamgee is the true hero of this story, and I can't tell you why without really giving anything away, but he just towers. Gollum/Sméagol was even more incredible here than he was in The Two Towers (which I didn't think was possible), and Frodo sinks amazingly to a new low. I thought that Theoden was the biggest JACKASS/KING in the universe until I met Denethor. Eowyn was so NOT annoying, and kicks ass. Merry and Pippen are no longer simply C3P0 and R2D2, they become warriors. Last but not least Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli do not disappoint. Oh, and HELMS DEEP WAS A TEA PARTY!!! There's an enormous ground battle that simply RULES ALL!!! Complete with Goonie orcs, Imperial Walker elephants, and killer ghosts. But every emotional scene in this film centered around the hobbits. This was their movie. When (spoilers) the whole kingdom bowed down to the four hobbits, I cried...like a little girl...and I DON'T CRY. (end spoilers) The question simply is, though: Is Return of the King the best movie of all time? I don't know, the test of time can only answer that. But I do know that it IS the most well made movie of all time, you can freeze frame any moment in this film (or in the whole trilogy for that matter) and hang it on your wall as a work of art. I know that it IS the most influential film made in my lifetime, this movie will inspire a record amount of people to accomplish whatever they want to accomplish. Finally I know that personally this film IS the most satisfying movie experience that I've had in my life and I can't wait to see it again and again. The only thing wrong with this film is that it ended. FRODO LIVES!!!! Grade: A+ + + + + + + + "
9.0~Exactly what it should be. Wrightsfd Sign in Permalink Return of the King is exactly what it should be. A fantastic and imaginative epic adventure film with mind-blowing action/battle scenes, suspense, drama, and special effects. If any movie is worth your money ($11.50 now in LA) it is this one. It is proof that Peter Jackson was the only person who could pull this off. I am not really a LOTR fan per se, but enjoyed the films for what they are. The third installment is the best and should be seen in a big loud theater to get the most enjoyment. I must say that the ending is even longer than I expected despite the fact I was warned ahead of time! It is really extraordinarily long. Pee before you enter the theater!!!
10.0~The end of the trilogy foxy_chic_45 Sign in Permalink The Return Of The King was a great movie that I recommend to anyone out there. This movie takes the battles, the adventure, and the romance to a whole new level. In this movie the characters now have the sense of bondment between them that shows that they aren't just companions trying to destroy an evil ring but that they are friends that will look after the other now matter what. As Frodo and Sam get closer to achieving their goal, Frodo notices how hard it was going to be and how this adventure will claim his life. As they continue on the things that they have to go through become much harder and the road they travel doesn't help them much. In this movie the big battles start to commence and with the help of the dead they are able to defeat the army of mordor. Then the rest of Gondor's and Rohan's soldiers go infront of the black gate to distract the eye so that Sam and Frodo can get into the mountain without being detected.
6.0~A nice little film caspian1978 Sign in Permalink What can you say about this giant money maker of a movie, it's a nice little film. Take away all the special effects and the powerful musical score and you got a universal story about good verse evil in a time universal to our own. Unlike most of the movies of 2003, this will stand the test of time and be watched by generations to come. It will last a thousand years for the simple reason of it being a simple, and somewhat, little film.
5.0~Utopia and hell. sivakumars Sign in Permalink The movie is, as always, about an evil force fighting and losing against a good force.There is no character transformation, no maturity in story telling and a dark massive use of special effects clouds he entire movie.Surely its a visual spectacle but I found myself dozing off halfway through the movie. One device that is often used in this trilogy is the effect of "almost" - Frodo "almost" gets killed, the ring is almost lost, nothing really happens out of the expected, just as plain and stupid as an average sci-fi crap. I felt no star-wars like awe at the atmosphere created in the movie; just plain "let this end soon" ennui !
10.0~What else can you say... rooroo Sign in Permalink Sheer brilliance from start to finish. The perfect end to THE perfect trilogy. Absolutely Mindblowing. Go see it.
10.0~Wow. efrodo Sign in Permalink This movie cannot be praised enough in words. It was able to master the grandeur of the battles and locations, and yet, it was also able to make you feel the heart of the story, which was that of Frodo and Sam. This movie made me cheer, cry, laugh, and get totally immersed into story that I don't think any other movie will be able to do again. Yes, some will say it was long, but there is no other way to end a movie of this scale. I don't think any movie will ever top, or even parallel this movie (except for maybe the Extended Edition).
10.0~Wonderful! but... gisela-2 Sign in Permalink Being a fan of the books I liked the film, because it's perfectly well done! but there's something I didn't like from the way Peter Jackson adapted the books: he started the trilogy with the 4 hobbits, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli and he wanted to keep them along the films with even more importance than other REALLY important characters. He forgot that as the story develops other important characters appeared! I think that he did a very stupid thing by ignoring the importance of Faramir (frankly, one of the best characters of the book with the most dramatic story!). I agree with many people that Peter Jackson made many long and unuseful scenes in which he could have developped Faramir's story (specially the love story with Eowyn). He could have cut the end and just finish the movie with the coronation of Aragorn. The rest isn't really important for the people who have not read the book( many people asked what the hell they were taking a boat!!) he could have added the end we saw in the DVD, we don't mind! He can even put a 6hrs film in the dvd's! the fans will appreciate! but I really was very disappointed about Faramir.
10.0~Excellent Movie dclaydon Sign in Permalink The movie was a fitting finale for the trilogy. I found it to be an excellent adaptation of Tolkien's work. The movie stayed true to the book and where it did veer away it did so in such a way that I did not find it to be "blasphemous". I have always enjoyed the books and I feel Jackson has done an outstanding job, especially when you consider the magnitude of the undertaking, in bringing all three books to the big screen. It was unfortunate that Hollywood knew all the movies were to be released in sequential years. I believe this was the reason that the Fellowship of the Rings lost out on an Oscar Best Picture nod. When the original Godfather came out it was at the time considered a stand-alone movie and was appropriately rewarded this way. It is too bad that the Academy Awards did not view the three LOTR movies in this light or they may well have won more Best Picture nods.
9.0~OMG this movie is SO epic I always cry!!! A true masterpiece and a perfect end to an amazing trilogy! OneRingToRuleThemAll13 Sign in Permalink *I'm sorry I took so long to review this, I've been really busy with schooollll!!!! :'(* OK, so I saw this again the other day on BD for the first time after my BD Extended Box Set (although I had only seen the Extended cut once before, which only contains like 4 scenes that are actually worthwhile. Some, however, like the fight between Gandalf and the Witch-king, which is more of a ''Gandalf getting his arse kicked'' kind of fight, are totally absurd ...) and I lived again the pure GENIUS of this movie. It (along with the entire LOTR trilogy) still stands as one of my favorite movies! The plot follows the broken Fellowship as they complete each of their tasks (for example, the principal story arc of Sam and Frodo's journey with the treacherous Gollum to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring once and for all). This is the final movie in the trilogy, and it is recommended you watch the first two before this one, as you WILL NOT understand much if you just jump straight into this one. The script is very well written, emotional and the dialogue is enchanting (trust me, you will smile and your heart will literally jump with joy and emotion when Pippin yells during the end ''Eaglessss!!! The EAGLES ARE COMINGGG!!'', just like in The Hobbit where they appear unexpectedly! :DDDD) . although some MAJOR changes have been made to the books (which angers me a tiny bit, and is the reason for me giving it a 9 instead of a 10, which if it would've followed the books a bit more, I would have gladly given it). Like, WHAT THE HECK is up with the thing that Arwen is dying!! That never happens in the books. And Denethor's madness just because he's an a*&hole?? In the books it was explained that he was like that since he obtained a palantir and started seeing Sauron's army get ready to attack them and had imagined what would happened. THIS is the reason he's mad. not just because. Before he got the palantir, he was a wise and just steward!! AND of course there is that particular scene where Frodo sends Sam home... OMG, I can't even BEGIN to express my disapproval of that scene. It goes against EVERYTHING about their almost homosexual friendshipppp! O_O The special effects are excellent here, with Gollum being someone you not even begin to imagine not really there and just a creation of SPX (which, of course he IS, but that's the beauty of it ;) ). This is truly a beautiful movie, specially in BD. The non-CGI environments are also breathtaking. And... we come to the acting! In here, it is really, REALLY good!! Elijah Wood steals the show, and we truly hate the person he's become while under the influence of the Ring and Gollum's tricky words. Sean Astin, Ian Mckellen and Viggo Mortensen must also be mentioned as Sam (who Sean plays beautifully and acts JUST LIKE his literature counterpart), Gandalf the White and Aragorn respectively. The music and sound effects are glorious also in here, like the previous movies. The LOTR adventure theme and the sad theme are both amazing. And the Orc cries, human cries when they die, creatures calling, swords clashing, etc., is also worth noting. If you have this on Blu-ray, you MIGHT want to turn the volume to its highest. And we come to the most amazing part of this conclusion to LOTR: the breathtaking action scenes. This is so amazing!!! Every fight in this movie out-stages EVERY OTHER ACTION SEQUENCE IN THE PREVIOUS FILMSS(except the Battle of Helm's Deep in TTT, which is THE BEST action sequence in the history of fantasy cinema)!! This movie, in that regard and also in the emotional one, is nothing short of EPICCC!!! All in all, an excellent film an a landmark in fantasy cinema!! LOTR is truly the most epic and enchanting work of fantasy in history. You will laugh, you will cry (with both sadness and pure joy, specially if you read the source material like me!), and you will have a great time. Although it may be a TAD disappointing for the novel fans, the people who loved the other films will surely applaud at the end (although some will applaud anyway because of it's eternal running time, specially extended) and give it a 10 on here. Trust me, IT'S THAT GOODD!! xDDD Now excuse me, I have 2 go return some videotapes ;)
8.0~Greatest trilogy-capper ever charchuk Sign in Permalink Superb finale to the greatest trilogy in cinematic history. Even with multiple story lines and a broad cast, it never loses its focus or its flow - something that plagued the second film every so often. Superb performances all-around, with Astin, McKellen, and Bernard Hill standing out. The action scenes are outstanding and the effects, of course, are top-notch. So many memorable images from the film. And, despite the hype, there aren't that many false endings and the film ends appropriately. However, this is the only film of the trilogy that is not improved by the extended edition. It makes it far too long and adds too many scenes (Houses of the Healing, a lot of the Army of the Dead stuff) that Jackson obviously didn't want to include and thus shortchanged them. The Army of the Dead stuff, in particular, removes much of the suspense that the theatrical cut had. The Mouth of Sauron and added Witch King stuff are welcome, though.
10.0~Continues the wonderful story! cowgirl-12 Sign in Permalink We loved all 3 episodes of this movie! If you have enjoyed the movies, or even if you haven't, the books are absolutely terrific! JRR Tolkien spent many years developing the world of LOR. These are must-read books. And starting with his "The Hobbit" is a real plus. About Return of the King, #3? Very good; although I would like to see some tweaking to improve the weaving of the final points into the overall movie presentation. Am looking forward to the extended version in 6 months or so on DVD! Do enjoy this movie.
6.0~Too Damn Long Weeping Hobbits... Egahd Sign in Permalink Yes, it's battle scenes were second to none. But battles are not all the stuff of great epics. The fact that none of its actors were nominated says alot. I feel in time the recollections of this film will be revalued to nothing more than a good movie. The edit of this film was criminally long. At 3 1/2 hours without intermission it felt like six. The ending upon ending was one weepy hobbit scene after another - emotionally redundant. I feel that two phenomenoms in hype are at play. First , it was released at a time when most epic adventures are directed without the wit, sensitivity and storyline Jackson has. Two, after investing all day into a movie, if it's good you liable to say it's great, especially after recovering from severe butt cramp. When the hype dies and people look at the film again, they'll see it for what it is. A good film with great battles and mediocre to in some cases below the line performances. Elijah Woods shades of torment read as the same response except at different volumes. While diffusion, a good sound mix save Liv Tyler from utter ridicule as she gives us her unequaled rendition of the gaumless pout. It is her stoyline I find the most distracting. Her lack of craft amidst a well trained cast, cheapens the overall perfomances. Her attempts to looks deep are as vain attempt to show life behind her eyes as her Oscar Night spectacles. Thank God she wasn't in a scene with Cate Blanchett. The contrast would reveal the babe casting truth. Was this an appeal to Frat boys far and wide. Surely they could've found a comely brunette with chops. In the end, the endless moaning and weeping of Hobbits, especially in the last reel, will be viewed for the sentimental drivel it really is. Had they cut down on this along with Liv Tyler's distraction, the film could have been a tight 2 1/2 hours with far more resonance. And on a philosophical note, are we too take the somewhat physically and sometimes mentally feeble Hobbits seriously as heroes. Their inumerable flaws often stretch the line of credibility. In this orc eat orc world of Middle Earth how they survived at all is a fantasy unto itself. On the good side, for a third installment it didn't fall into the entertainment abyss of the Matrix. In all 6 of 10 Egahd.
9.0~A few things overlooked m_a_singer Sign in Permalink Well, I think I said in my review of TTT that I was afraid that Jackson and company wouldn't be able to fit in all that was left. Now, though I have not seen the extended cut (longer than the cut of _Napoleon_, I believe!), it looks like they added much of it back there. As a Tolkien geek of 30+ years I was greatly impressed by these films even though I miss much of the subtlety of the book itself. However, that subtlety is not entirely lost; instead, it is often taken up in the acting. Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto actually make *more* of their characters than the books do. All of the Hobbits are fine, Andy Serkis is better than fine, and Ian Holm, bless him, gives all the young ones lessons in sly scene stealing. Ian McKellen is a bit too subdued at times, but when he hits the mark he's very powerful. Elves are basically impossible to play, but all of the actors in those roles do well even if Orlando Bloom is a bit callow. The revelation throughout all three films, though, is Viggo Mortensen. I hated him immediately upon his entrance in the first film, then quickly started to reassess as the film moved on. I quickly realized that he managed to hit every single one of even the deepest notes of the character, a man who is not only skilled beyond his first appearance but whose nature as a hero and a king is based in millennia of history and inheritance. It is an amazing performance, one of the best I have ever seen, and so strong that even though the end of the film was naturally without him I missed his character, just as I do every time I read the book. So, enjoy the CGI. But watch the acting - that's where you'll get the depth of the tale.
4.0~Plodding series richardjo Sign in Permalink Sorry but I'm not a fan. Years ago I tried reading the Hobbit but got bored by chapter 2. The first film was so so pedestrian and plodding and dare I say boring?? I saw the second on DVD such was the lack or exceitment, for me, caused by the first one.The second was little better and the third although the best of the lot is surely not THAT good?? Undoubtadly a brave production and full credit to Peter Jackson and co, awesome special effects, excellent acting but I just find this whole hobbity elf wizard thing SO BORING. It was like the Phantom Menace all that quasi neo religious clap trap was such a let down compared to the first Star Wars that I haven't bothered seeing the one about the clones and the third one.
6.0~Good movie spoiled by being overlong BigGuy Sign in Permalink There are some cases where a three hour movie is a good thing. There are other times when you don't even realize a movie was three hours long. This is not one of them. Especially when the last half-hour of the movie is extremely slow sappy wrap-ups. At the end there were three or four points where everyone in the audience thought the movie was finally over, only to have a loud sigh fill the theater to find another wrap-up scene. There were also numerous scenes in the middle of the movie that were of the slow dramatic variety. That is all well and good normally, but there were too many and each was too drawn out and they helped bloat the total length (and seeming length) of the movie. Aside from that gripe, the rest of the movie overall was pretty good. The scenery was amazing, and for the most part the visual appeal was very good. The ogres and orcs and trolls were even more ugly than before and the battle scenes were on an epic scale. The acting was pretty good, outside of the dramatic speeches. There are some actors who should not be allowed to make troop rallying speeches and they all had such speeches in this movie.
6.0~pretty good or whatever BrevinBeltrock Sign in Permalink Lord of the rings? pfffff more like.... bored of the rings am I right fellas?
1.0~Not the best movie of all time. gunnar_zero-1 Sign in Permalink I must say that after Titanic and Shakespeare in Love won ''Best Picture of the Year'' on their respective years I could not avoid to feel sad for the masterpieces that were competing for the award and that deserved it more than the actual winners. Having said that I must say I felt deeply insulted when The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King won, over such a delightful film as Mystic River. I honestly think the Academy cheated all the viewers with an actual taste form films. My reasons for this: First. Even though the production values are amazing, only a few technical aspects are really worthy of recognition, art direction, sound direction and mixing, film edition and make-up, however other technical departments are not so worthy of the recognition they received. This statement is especially true for the visual effects department. It is true that for 2003, the visual effects were honestly good, however unlike many winners in the visual effects category, the visuals of TLOFR: ROTK, have aged in a very unflattering way. The visual effects, especially the Oliphants sequence and the charge of the ghost army look so outdated now, that makes me wonder why did the Academy awarded this department that year, especially when the visuals of the other two nominated films on that category have aged so much better than the visuals of this movie. Both Master and Commander and Pirates of the Caribbean, have more realistic looking visual effects and today still look impressive, compared to the awkward looking Legolas during the Oliphants CGI scene. Academy Award winners on this category have the amazing property of still impress after so many years, the best example of this is Jurassic Park, the visuals of JP have aged wonderfully compared to ROTK's visuals, the visuals still impress and look so much more real than most of the CGI flicks these days. Second. The adaptation of the book is nothing else but disappointing, many, many, many, missing things from the book, things that actually made the whole trilogy make sense, that gave the whole, the natural, small man versus the industrialization sense to the story were left behind in order to add more sense-less fantasy action that the fans demanded. Also the characters look only like a pale shadow of the characters we fell in love with on the books and the first two films, especially Gandalf, Sir Ian McKellen did such a wonderful job in the first two films, especially in The Fellowship of the Ring, impressive enough to received an Academy Award nomination on a kind of movie that almost never receives that kind of nominations, but on this one is almost painful to watch actors as good as him and Viggo Mortensen. Shame on you mister Jackson. Third. Even though the sound department deserved the nomination and the Academy Award they received, the music department is far from good, is in fact very deficient. The original Shire themes and the action cues from the first film are reused thru the trilogy, however they fail to get fresh with each film, to be honest after more than 7 hours of the same themes, they get very tiresome and boring. Not counting the horrible themes provided by Enya, boring, un-exiting and devoid of heart and soul, which is the complete opposite of the feeling everyone gets when reading the books. In short, this movie is not a bad movie, it is average to good, with great values in some departments but for the most disappointing for missing the main themes from the books, turning a very interesting, moving and appealing story into a fantasy action massive blockbuster for the masses.
10.0~Breathtaking, unbelievable, heartwrenching and depressing. jlucina Sign in Permalink Breathtaking, unbelievable, heartwrenching, and finally depressing. These are the reactions I felt as I watched ROTK - not once, but three times. At it's premiere in Hawaii, I had the privilege of watching it on a gigantic screen with awesome sound. I was irritated because I sat beside someone that was not necessarily as big of a fan. He was giggling and heckling several times. Anyway, that probably contributed to the irritation I felt for the missing scenes that I had been expecting. Dont' get me wrong, I really enjoyed the film, but it wasn't all that I expected . .. However, as I went to watch it again less than 14 hours later. I went into the film not expecting anything, and was planning on just enjoying it. I cried! I cried at the beacons, I cried when Sam held Frodo and thought he had died "Don't go where I can't follow" Even though I knew the Rohirrim charge was breathtaking (it was my favorite scene the first time I watched it) I lost my breath again and actually was shaking in my seat as I watched the Eorlingas charge into certain death. Gah -- too much. I enjoyed the rest of the film again. The third time I watched it, it all happened again - Though I did laugh a few more times -- especially when I heard the chorus of sniiffles all around me during Sam's brave "I'll carry you" line. All in all, I don't think I'll ever see another movie like this, and that depresses me.
10.0~Best of the Trilogy smaug-9 Sign in Permalink I have probably watched this movie about 8 or 9 times, and it keeps on getting better every time I watch it. I think this is the best movie of the trilogy, because it has the best action scenes (especially the siege of Gondor/Battle of Pelennor Fields) and because it has an end. It didn't matter to me that it had about six endings, because this is a classic, and epic series. As I said before, I loved the battles in this movie. I think they are by far the best of any movie I have ever seen. The one-on-one fights, like Eowyn vs. Witch King and Sam vs. Shelob, are awesome, but the giant battles with hundreds of thousands of warriors were AMAZING! I also thought the scene where Frodo and Gollum fight for the ring at the end of the movie is amazing too. My advice- Buy the extended edition, it's SO much better than the original one (I'm not trying to put down the original one, but I just think the EE is much better), and it's definitely worth the extra money.
10.0~Best of the Trilogy! ridiculonius Sign in Permalink I would just like to take a moment to say; I loved all three Lord of the Rings books, and all three Lord of the Rings movies. The Two Towers was actually the best of the books, (which is surprising because I hated the second movie) but when it comes to the movies, Return of the King takes ALL of the cake. We pick up where we left off in The Two Towers (the movie); Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf reunite with Merry and Pippin after the hobbits have defeated Saruman with the help of the ents. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam near the end of their journey, still on their way to the "short cut" into Mordor, led by the treacherous Gollum/Smeagol. Aragorn & co. split up, with the majority of them staying in Rohan whilst Gandalf and Pippin travel together to Gondor, the kingdom that by right should belong to Aragorn, and also happens to be next on Sauron's hit list. However, Gondor is being run by the Steward, who is the father of Boromir (remember him? the guy from the first one who died?), and he doesn't really feel like trusting Gandalf, *or* handing the kingdom over to Aragorn. Frodo and Sam face problems of their own; the Ring's power is growing and Frodo is suffering the same personality change that got poor Gollum/Smeagol. Speaking of the little bugger, his dual persona's are battling it out; the Smeagol part wants to be good again and help the hobbits, whilst the Gollum part wants to kill them and take the Ring. With this guy leading them, Sam and Frodo really need to watch their backs! Now, I love this movie and everything about it. The effects, the acting, the pure scope and brilliance of the plot meshed with the intricacies of fantasy... it all works. However, there is one. Little. Exception. Mr Frodo Baggins. I absolutely *hate* him! I can't stand him! All he does is wallow in his own misery, he barely fights the Ring's influence at all, and he's always falling over. Oh, gimmie a break, angsty boy! As far as I'm concerned (and, according to my sources, JRR Tolkien felt the same way), Sam is the true hero of the story. He faithfully went along with all Frodo's ideas, he kept him afloat, sacrificed his own food and water to keep Frodo going, because he knew he couldn't take the Ring. He protected him as best he could from that conniving little Gollum/Smeagol. At Mt. Doom, he freaking' CARRIED Frodo up the mountain!!! He rescued him when he was going to let himself fall into the lava! And at the end, he had to deal with the pain of his best friend leaving him forever. A real trooper, a real, brave, selfless Hero. Love the movie! Hate Frodo!
1.0~Gollum has the voice of a muppet?! mulconrey Sign in Permalink First the good things. This people who made this movie really tried and put effort into what they were doing. They get an A for effort. Maybe they tried too hard... The good things about this movie come from the book. The story, the inspiration, every good line, every good "scene." What the movie brings to this story is not good. It manages to make each chapter into a long drawn out mess. It's tiring to watch a super close up of "some heroic figure" speak a overly dramatic line delivered in some pseudo-Shakespearean delivery again and again. Watching Elijah Wood furrow his eyebrows for 2 hours almost drove me insane. Aragorn and his "accent" were ... (to avoid exaggeration) pretty annoying. Thanks to Liv Tyler for some super uninteresting words, whatever they were, something about love, and forever, yada yada yada. That being said, Boromir and a few others had some memorable lines. What passes for action is hyperbolic CGI, silly costumes (I loved seeing goblins prance around like Broadway dancers), and Kung-Fu, Blockbuster style action scenes (If you have scene any movie with swords, and/or fighting in it, then you've seen this before). If you like MTV, video games, or crack, you will like this movie. It is a triumph of using good books as an ingredient in the big movie formula. You can rent this and Spiderman 2 all in the same day, then go download some Britney Spears pictures. All entertaining, for about 5 minutes. If you are over 16, or you are looking for something interesting, or new... pass this by.
10.0~Not only the best film of 2003, but the best film of the Lord of the Rings trilogy! TheMovieeGuy Sign in Permalink I just came out to see The Return of the King, the third and final chapter in the highly successful Lord of the Rings trilogy. WOW! Not only is this the best film of the year, it manages to top both the first and second films. The battle outside of Minas Tirith is possibly the greatest action sequence ever put on film, and it will be talked about for many years. The scene in Shelob's lair, both frightening and exciting! Every one of these characters has a moment to shine. Of all the characters, Sam shines the brightest in this film! Thank you Peter Jackson for creating to film, the greatest literary achievement of the 20th century. This trilogy will become the highmark of professional film-making for many years. This is by far the best film of 2003, and if the academy doesn't reward Peter Jackson, there is no justice! He has redefined the fantasy film the same way that George Lucas redefined science fiction nearly 30 years ago! A 10 on a scale of 1-10!
1.0~An amazing video game..I mean movie Tiger_Mark Sign in Permalink I have seen a lot of movies made from computer programs, Lara Croft, etc.. However, this computer generated cartoon beats them all. No, nobody really gave a great performance individually or they would have got a nomination and won it no doubt. But the graphics, oh man, they almost looked like a real movie being shot. Moreover, the special effects were incredible. I can see why this movie won seven Oscars for special effects alone. I mean, you have to give it to this movie, it had some great special effects. Oh sure, the acting was overdone and a bit sappy, but man, get a look at the special effects here. I mean, it won 11 Oscars, so I guess it must be the best film ever, even though nobody from the film was acknowledged for their performance, because nobody was really great in it, but man, the special effects here, outstanding. Hey, a billion geeks can't be wrong.
3.0~A poor adaptation blemay-4 Sign in Permalink How can anyone who has read the books think this is a good adaptation? The liberties taken with the story were almost forgivable in the previous two movies, but The Return of the King is just hogwash in my view. It's a shame that Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson succumbed to the trend to Hollywoodize everything adapted for the big screen. Major disappointment.
10.0~The greatest book to film adaptation and fantasy film of all time, bar none! reversedthepolarity Sign in Permalink On Lord of the Rings in general: This is how film making should be done, this beautifully woven piece of cinema deserves all the praise and attention it gets, it is truly a labour of love and care, the tremendous amount of effort put into these films makes it a must see for anyone wanting to see how a big budget fantasy blockbuster SHOULD BE MADE! There's nothing bad about this film, and if there is then people would be looking for things that are bad, and that's just knit picking. Everything from the writing, casting, acting, production design, art, cinematography, lighting, music, sound EVERYTHING is spot on with this these films. On this film in particular: The best of the three, that's right, this is the first time I have watched a trilogy/ sequel and can put my hand on my heart and say that these films get better as they go along, mainly because it reaches the ultimate climax it possibly can without losing any momentum and steam from the first films, and has the best pay off you could ask for, changes have been made from the books of course, but every change Jackson has made from Tolkien's novels is completely justified for it's use in a cinematic context, I honestly cried at the end of this film, and that's not an easy task for me, to get me as invested in this world and it's characters as Jackson's trilogy has, well lets just say, it takes a lot, only Pixar has achieved the same with me, and I'll be lucky if any other film is capable of making me do so again. What is there more to say, a beautifully made film, with a wonderfully dramatic climax, you really do get the feeling of being on a journey with these films, you feel enticed with the characters as they embark on it, and for a 3 hour film to do so without losing any momentum (as with all three of them), well that's an achievement in itself. It honestly deserved every award it got and then some.

6.0~Good, not great kodave Sign in Permalink IT had some stunning sequences, but the movie was entirely too long. They could cut out some of the weeping stuff in the end. Plus, a lot of the main characters are really one-dimensional and the dialogue scense are sorta cheesy. this is my humble opinion. no way, do these films top Star Wars or the Godfather
9.0~Awesome follow-up with amazing visuals and groundbreaking special effects ma-cortes Sign in Permalink The third part in Jackson's trilogy based on the novels written by the great J.R.R Tolkien , picking up shortly after the second one left off . This extraordinary film begins with Frodo (Elijah Wood) , Sam (Sean Astin) along with Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis) continuing the travel towards Mount Doom , the only place where the Ring can be destroyed . Frodo and Sam care the Ring in order to keep it from falling into the hands of its evil creator . Meantime , Gondor is invaded by the Orcs of Mordor and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) ride to Minas Tirith . There rules Denethor (John Noble) , father of the deceased Boromir (Sean Bean) , and Faramir (David Wenham) . While Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must choose between his two lovers , Eowyn (Miranda Otto) and Arwen(Liv Tyler) . Later on , Aragorn , Legolas (Orlando Jones) , and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) travel to the creepy caves inhabited by the Army of the Dead . This sensational epic adventure is plenty of action , impressive battles , spectacular drama and being pretty entertaining . The movie packs a real sense of wonder and stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown feats of the various protagonists and winding up in overlong battles and a stunning finale . It contains incredible array of technical visual effects by Weta Digital and Weta Workship , among others companies . Sensational cinematography by Andrew Lesnie and spectacular as well as sensitive musical score by Howard Shore , winning deservedly Academy Award . Beautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values . The film provides enough amusement during the three and half hour and stays closer to the novel than any of the former adaptations -mostly animated and in low budget- such as the mediocre effort by Ralph Baski . The motion picture will appeal to Tolkien followers as the neophyte who didn't have seen the previous parts and those unfamiliar with the lengthy literary work . Magnificent direction by Peter Jackson bringing stunningly the imaginary world and mythology of Tolkien to life .
10.0~A film of the unfilmable AlastairDavie Sign in Permalink As a big fan of the book and a major critic of the compromises Peter Jackson et al. made in The Two Towers they still need to be commended for completing a film of one of the hardest books ever to imagine filming. This is definitely a film of it's time, the first close up shot in ROTK of Gollum is flawless, a full screen of Gollum's face and you can see skin texture and every detail you would see from a real actor. The changes made from the book to the film in this case (and Fellowship) are very much in the spirit of Tolkien as is the ending of the film that manages to preserve the mythology of the books without (hopefully) confusing those who have not read them. 10/10 for the film and 10/10 for the trilogy, hopefully the Oscars will follow and not be too concerned that this came from New Zealand and not Hollywood.
10.0~A Masterpiece Of Filmmaking Desertman84 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King brings Peter Jackson's mammoth adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic to a close in suitably epic fashion. epic fantasy-drama film directed by Peter Jackson that is based on the second and third volumes of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is the concluding film in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, following The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. As Sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of Middle-earth, Gandalf the Wizard, and Théoden King of Rohan rally their forces to help defend Gondor's capital Minas Tirith from the looming threat. Aragorn finally claims the throne of Gondor and summons an army of ghosts to help him defeat Sauron. Ultimately, even with full strength of arms, they realise they cannot win; so it comes down to the Hobbits, Frodo and Sam, to bear the burden of the Ring and deal with the treachery of Gollum. After a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous lands of Mordor, seeking to destroy the One Ring in the place it was created, the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.Notably, it won all eleven Academy Awards for which it was nominated, an Oscar record, and tied for largest number of awards won with Ben-Hur and Titanic. Instead of starting just where the previous film left off, however, it goes far back in time to the moment the tormented creature Gollum first came to possess the One Ring. In this flashback, actor Andy Serkis who voiced Gollum and performed his movements onset prior to the final CGI effects finally gets to appear on screen, portraying Gollum's former self, Sméagol. This disturbing scene serves as a potent reminder that the Ring seeks to corrupt even the well-intentioned Frodo, who is increasingly struggling with the dark power of the Ring himself. Thus, the film returns to the present, following Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they journey ever closer to the foreboding land of Mordor. They pass by the terrifying dark city of Minas Morgul, watching as the dreadful army of the Witch King sets out for the human strongholds in Gondor, and move on to the rocky stairs to Cirith Ungol, where an even darker enemy lies in wait. Meanwhile, the rest of the Fellowship reunites in Rohan, having defeated the wizard Saruman on two different fronts, at Helm's Deep and Isengard. They are not together for long, though, since the hobbit Pippin gets into trouble, making it necessary for him and Gandalf to hastily depart for Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor. Once there, they find the steward of Gondor, Denethor, in an unstable mental state and the city preparing for battle against the amassing forces of Sauron. Denethor unwisely sends his only remaining son, Faramir, back into bloody battle to prove himself. He returns nearly dead, sending Denethor over the edge of sanity.In another realm, elf Arwen begins her journey to immortal life in the Grey Havens, on her way to leave Middle-earth -- and Aragorn -- forever, but has a vision that causes her to once again reconsider her decision. Back in Rohan, the men are preparing to ride to Gondor's aide. Éowyn desperately wants to join the men in battle, but her uncle, King Théoden, orders her to stay and defend Rohan if necessary. The hobbit Merry also desires to ride with the men, but is denied due to his small size and inexperience. Aragorn is met there by the elf Elrond, who brings him the re-forged Sword that was Broken in the ancient battle with Sauron and urges him to take a different route to Gondor. Heeding Elrond's advice, Aragorn, along with elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli, takes a cavernous path through the mountains, where they meet ghoulish ghosts who betrayed Aragorn's ancestors and are doomed to eternal unrest unless they fulfill their broken oaths by aiding him. All but Frodo, Sam, and Gollum will meet on the massive battlefield of the Pelennor before the gates of Minas Tirith. The former three instead engage in a battle of wills between each other and the One Ring as they head toward the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it. The thrilling conclusion to what has become the film event of our time - - the definitive screen fantasy -- features more spellbinding moments, bigger battles, more emotion and more poetry than the terrific first two films in the trilogy.It is visually stunning as it pops your eyes, excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion.Jackson boldly and faithfully brought J.R.R. Tolkien's world to life as he's created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time as evidenced in this third film.Aside from that,the movie is great at all levels including the brilliance of the cast.Standing out amid an excellent cast is Elijah Wood, stymied by tweeness in the earlier films but here convincingly developing the character of Frodo as the embodiment of valor and self-sacrifice.Aside from that,it provides the viewer a great tale of heroes, bonded together by friendship and spectacular themes about very special friendship between hobbits Elijah Wood's Frodo and Sean Astin's Sam that touches us most of all.This is a masterpiece of filmmaking.
10.0~This is the best film ever made. dgeer80 Sign in Permalink I know, I know. There are a lot of films out there. And to say that this is the best film every made is truly a high honor, and should not just be given to anyone. But I truly feel that The Return of the King IS the best film ever made, and that the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best film trilogy ever made. I should actually say simply that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best film ever made, because it was all filmed back-to-back as if it was one film, and the storyline continues right where we left off in the previous film. This trilogy truly deserves the recognition it gets, because there has never been any film project that's endured so much. The people who made these movies put more time, effort, passion, and love into these films than any other movie to date. Just watch the documentaries on the Extended Edition DVD box sets and you'll see what I mean. No film project has EVER matched how much this film crew went through. And never have we seen a film crew work so hard and achieve perfect films. They ARE perfect in every way. The story is excellent. The acting is excellent. The visuals are astounding. And I don't think I've ever seen a fantasy film that felt more real that these films. They really pulled off what Tolkien had intended with his books - that we're supposed to believe it was a real historic tale long forgotten. With The Return of the King specifically, there were parts that were just so emotionally driven that I almost cried. That never happens for me. The acting was just phenomenal. Every visual effects shot was an absolute masterpiece. It was very intense, and it is a great conclusion to the trilogy. As far as some people's complaints about the ending, they just don't know what the ending is truly all about. This is an ending to all who were tempted by the ring or were in possession of it. And it's an ending to an entire trilogy. We really needed time to wind down and find out what happens in our beloved characters' lives after the victory of Sauron's destruction. I think that people were just tired of sitting in the theater for 3 hours, and all the fade-outs were faking them out that the movie was ending. I bet those people will love the ending much more when they can watch it on DVD and pace themselves throughout the whole viewing of the film. The ending is truly spectacular and IMHO is perfect. Overall, this movie is a 12 out of 10. This is my favorite film of all time.
10.0~Long, but not long enough CapDac Sign in Permalink Well, at long last, I have seen The Return of the King. Need you really ask? That was the single greatest film in the history of the earth!!!! Well, I really should get the bad stuff out of the way first, so then you can read the rest of my review with a clean slate. The scene where Arwen saw Eldarion. That was about as needed as horse dung on your front doorstep. Just carrying on the needlessness. They didn't need any scenes with Rivendell in TTT, and they carried on in this film. Sure, the reforging of Narsil, becoming Anduril, was important, but the rest was entirely not. I'd like to say naught more about this And of course, the cuts. The Mouth of Sauron. His taunting was sorely missed, but I can't say much about the poor guy. Pity, he really was a badass. The houses of Healing was an obvious loss, but perhaps not as serious to me as it could have been. Overborne by the other cuts, really; namely, the Watchers. We had a brief glimpse of them as Sam entered Cirith Ungol's tower, but no more. Bugger. The Woses were an unfortunate downblow (is that a word?), because they added to Rohan, and Theoden was essentially guided by them to the Pellenor. Oh well. Poor wild men. And my most unfavoured loss of all: SARUMAN! The White Wizard...well, the original White Wizard. I could hear people behind me (between the constant crunching of chip packets) saying "Where's the evil wizard guy, and his worm sidekick?" I really think the Rivendell should have been dropped in favour of poor Saruman. That's the bad stuff, now here's the good parts When I saw Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I saw the giant spiders and I thought 'Jeez, they did well on those!' Having seen the mighty Shelob, she not only chewed up and spat out the Harry Potter spiders, but she chewed them up again and shat them on Frodo's face with the webbing. She was done as good as you can get, and though I despise spiders I have to admit she looked bloody amazing. Admittedly, she didn't look exactly like a standard spider, but who really gives a damn? The expressions all said many words. Most of them said "Oh, sweet crap!" Most notably Theoden's when the Witch-King gave him the jump. Speaking of Witchy, there is no denying that he was done amazingly. About time the Nazgul did more than screech. Hissing and snarling all the way, with a few words. And his tussle with Eowyn was brilliant. The Fell Beast decapitated, but Witchy still has a mace and he introduced it to Eowyn's arm. Brilliant. And his death ruled ass. Say what you will about Eowyn's "I am no man!" line, I thought it was great Another of those s***-scared expressions was the orcs at the pirate ships. Say hello to the Dead Men of Dunharrow, who were done better than Shelob. Ghosty boys, meet the Deformed. Guess whose arses get the s*** kicked out of them? Orcies go bye-bye, spirits rule! Words alone are not enough for the Dead Men; they deserve more This is all going on at the same time as the Pellenor Battle, and what a battle it was! With the Olog-Hai marching the siege towers in, and 200,000 orcs alongside, you have a battle that makes the battles of Helm's Deep and possibly Hastings alike look like barroom brawls. Gothmog of the orcs, cool and confident while a boulder is flying for him and his face is retarded. He was a cool orc. Not to mention Grond, the battering ram of the Mordor forces, truly a spectacular sight to behold. And lastly, the Mumakil, all wreaking havoc on the Rohirrim. But do the Riders of Rohan back down? Hell no! Looks like the Oliphaunts got more than they bargained for; especially as one spear, courtesy of Eomer, brought down two Mumakil. And then Legolas joins the fray, and single-handedly brings down an Oliphaunt and all its passengers, and ends the spree with the death of the beast. And literally everyone in the cinema laughed at Gimli's "It still only counts as one!" Classy. And then the constant cycle between the Black Gate and Mount Doom, as Gondor and Rohan fight Mordor, and Frodo and Sam fight Gollum, with a two against one on both sides (although Frodo pissbolts for the Sammath Naur soon after it begins). Truly magnificent, especially when Gollum makes true the Nine-Fingered Frodo and takes the Ring into Orodruin for the last time. Frodo's topple surprised me, but I knew he wasn't gone like Gollum. The Black Gate was every bit as marvellous. Aragorn charges for his enemies. No one else does anything. Then we see a pair of midgets run forth, and not until they're gone does everyone else hit show time. Then the Hobbits get trampled a bit. Oh well. The hole opening up, swallowing the Morannon and the Mordor forces, was awesome; sucks be to the orcs. The Nazgul swoop and plunge, and we are in true awe of the eight dying. But all of this is in true shadow of the real destruction: down comes Barad-Dur, the Downfall of Sauron the Sorceror, with Mount Doom exploding. Words cannot describe the magnificence of this. For the previous two films, I had not thought much about Sean Astin as an actor. I didn't much think of him as one of the best. But in this film, he more than redeemed himself. His cry of "Let him go, you filth!" prior to his battle with Shelob, and then his assault on the tower of Cirith Ungol, and everything after the destruction of the Ring, was marvellous. I could go on, but I can't for now. I'd like to add in more, there's so much more I'd like to say, but I can't. So in conclusion, I'd be giving this film 99.5 out of 100. It is truly a work of art
10.0~The best ever basicspc Sign in Permalink If this movie does not clean up at the Oscars there is no justice in the world, three hours has never passed so quickly and the way the stories were intertwined was fantastic. Peter Jackson has done a great job with the first two movies but has saved the best too last. The acting was wonderful and the special effects were seamless, Thank you Peter Jackson for the best ever movie experience.
8.0~a beautiful ending lagudafuad Sign in Permalink The return of the king is a nice ending to a beautiful trilogy, wining eleven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director, this movie is just too good an ending and if you are watching this trilogy, just look forward to the ending where you get to see, the ring destroyed (in the most unbelievable twist, that is if you have not read the book) and Aragon rise to the throne that he was meant to be upon. Here is what The Fellowship of the Ring movie was heading to, an ending that will remain the minds of movie watchers for years to come. The movie has a massive number of visual effect shots that triple and double that of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers respectively, these shots can be seen clearly as the movie nears the end with the battles at Rohan which were quite filled with many CGI implementations and look forward to when Aragon goes searching for new recruits, there you will another set of visual effects The film and the novel differ so much but that doesn't deter the film from its professionalism in the master art of storytelling, from the hand of Peter Jackson. The movie show cases an intense directorial work, which you just have to be impressed about. The actors were just charming but in this movie three people stole the show, Elijah Woods (Frodo Baggins), Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee) and Viggo Mortensen (Aragon). The movie tale continues from where Two Towers left up, Frodo and Sam are nearing Mordo and getting close to destroying the ring of power. The other members of the fellowship (which have united by the end of The Two Towers) went out to save Gondor from the hands of Sauron's army, the battle at Minas Tirith. As all this is going on, Elrond (Hugo Weaving, Agent Smith from the Matrix and V from V for Vendetta in 2005) approaches Aragon and tells him, the only way he can win this fight to save Gondor is if he wills the sword Anduril and claim that, which he has been running from; claim his Kingship. Hence the name of the film/novel "The Return of the King" Making over a billion dollars from the box office, The Return of the King, sold more tickets than its previous two counterparts. Although The Fellowship of the Ring is considered by most to be the best of the three, this movie ranks second. After you are done reading this, it is not complete yet till you go and get the DVD Extended version box set of The Lord of the Rings and make sure you get the novels also. The Oscar wins for the movie at the 76th Academy Awards in 2004 were: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Visual Effects, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Make-up, Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. www.lagsreviews.com
8.0~Excellent film, though somewhat disappointing pennysp4 Sign in Permalink !Mild Spoilers! This movie was one of the greatest films I've seen in my entire life. The special effects were amazing, the acting was excellent, and the music was superb. Peter Jackson did some changes, which, I think, made the movie far superior to the book.(when Gollum sets Sam up;it made Gollum more sinister. It didn't happen in the book, but not surprising for Gollum.) However, some of the scenes cut out of the movie were the most important; such as the Houses of Healing. The Scouring of the Shire isn't even the movie; one of my favorite parts of the book. They also added things that DID NOT need to be added. (such as when Frodo sent Sam away. As if one would choose sickly lookin' Gollum instead of faithful Sam. Oh my gosh, that part was just ludicrous.) If you like emotional scenes, filled with blubbering and wailing, you'll like the Frodo and Sam parts of the movie. It's like they're crying in every single scene. Now, I can understand Faramir's teary eyes, when his father says he wishes he'd die instead of Boromir. But, red eyes and tear-stained cheeks grate on my nerves when I see them every few minutes. Too emotional, to my way of thinking. Also, the battle scenes were better than Helm's Deep, but I didn't like it as much. In The Two Towers, Helm's Deep is the deciding point if the good guys will win or lose. In TRoTK, the demise of the Ring is the factor. The battle is not as urgent as in Helm's Deep, when the Rohirrim are fighting for their women and children. The absence of Aragorn was disappointing as well. Gandalf as an inspirational leader just doesn't click. The end part dragged, as I think some other people stated. They could have made it SHORTER, and put the IMPORTANT parts instead. This movie had its strengths as well, though, such as the humor and battle sequences. All in all, I think it was a good movie. I enjoyed the solos performed by Viggo and Billy Boyd. However, I think that the Special Edition DVD will be a far better movie, since there are no time restraints, and we can see the parts of the movie that needed to be seen. i look forward to purchasing it.
10.0~Utterly Amazing Movie sup-4 Sign in Permalink A great film with an amazing cast and astounding production. Its so easy to believe that the film was shot in Middle-Earth with real elves, nazgul and volcanos. Certainly one of the best movies of all time. If you haven't see it yet, make it the next movie you see.
10.0~LOTR - Return of the King jayrockgop Sign in Permalink Best one of the three... I enjoyed every minute of it! Excellent screen play... Awesome CGI!
10.0~The best of the trilogy, the best in it's genre and one of the best movies ever! axismladen Sign in Permalink LOTR 3 is one of the best movies ever made and all the Oscars it got were completely well deserved! In fact, i would add a couple. Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen and Bernard Hill all deserved a Best Actor nomination. And i would also mention Sean Bean who's performance of Boromir in the first part was completely underrated! It was a great performance and i can't believe he wasn't nominated! I am usually a big fan of the book's. I've noticed that some people complain about Peter Jackson completely changing the dialog and some scenes. It's true. He did do that but i think it's actually better this way. Don't get me wrong, the book's are magical. It's just that certain scenes and dialog would look and sound dull when seen on movies. Peter Jackson knew it and he had to make a certain changes. I'm glad he did! Visual's are revolutionary for the time and great for today, writing is great, directing is great, acting is great, cinematography is great, make up is great, costimography is great, fighting choreography is great,... and so on... and so on... All in all, this movie is just brilliant!!! One of the best movies ever to be made and definitely the best movie in it's genre. Deserves all the award's and all the hype it got!!! A TRUE MASTERPIECE!
10.0~best of all time jhunts5 Sign in Permalink When I comment on "Return of the King", in my mind I am commenting on all three in the series. I view it as ONE MOVIE, not THREE. This story was magnificently portrayed on screen. Each actor played his/her role as though their's was the most important role. I was not disappointed with a single character. The visual effects were stunning. Granted, this is one of those films that is best appreciated on the big screen. And Jackson's interpretation of the Orcs and other creatures was rather disturbing (as it should be). The word done on the sets left you feeling that you had entered a new realm. If I had three thumbs they would all be up. Now after saying that, I must say that if you are not a fan of this genre, you may not enjoy the film. I have friends (gasp) who actually fell asleep during the film. I cannot understand such people except to say they have very little imagination.
10.0~Pretty awesome.. Rolsrois Sign in Permalink A few things about lord of the rings:the return of the king; except the fact i hate Frodo (well that's just me personally), because he's such a fanny, the movie isn't bad at all. its actually a very good way to end the triolegy. but the ending, really? there were like 8 different endings to that movie, showed us what happened with every da*n characters from Legolas to Frodo. we don't care! 40 minutes of ending, that sucked, and pretty much destroyed the expectations. also, too many dialogs, i understand that there's plenty of plot, but still, they could have cut some of them and leave them for the really-big-fans-ill-watch-LOTR-for-7hours. i suggest, watch it, cut the movie 35 minutes before the ending. Rols Rois, out :]
10.0~This movie will change it all chriscrescente Sign in Permalink Wow!, there wouldn't be enough words to do justice how good this whole trilogy is. I think it will definitely change the way Hollywood works, for better. First, it must have been very risky for the producers to embark on making not one, but three films with such a high budget, without knowing how the outcome would be. Had the first one done poorly on the theaters they would have lost more than Waterworld. All in the trilogy was very well taken care of. There are no special effects defects, the computerized creatures (Smeagol/Gollum, for example) look very real, the characters are very well personified by the actors. The storyline is perfectly told. Sure, some people complain about the changes from the original books that were made in the script, but I think they are necessary. For one thing, the feminine presence would have been highly missed. The aesthetic aspect is also remarkable. This movie is candy for your eyes. Yet it's not just a watch for the special effects movie, it's one of the greatest stories told, and it really gets you inside the feelings the characters are facing throughout the journey to destroy the ring. For one thing, this movie has already changed the way Hollywood makes its films. Now it's no longer necessary to have an ending on a "part 1" the ending can be in part 2 (as in kill bill) or in part 3 (LOTR). Also it will prove that blockbusters can (and should) be bigger risk takers in getting out of the too rigid Hollywood formulas, and especially being more careful with the script and the quality of the story to be told, because after all, without that you don't get a good movie, no matter how many special effects and high rated stars you stuck in it.
10.0~Worthy end to a worthy trilogy. TheBabblingFool Sign in Permalink It's weird to think that this is the last Lord of the Rings film, when I remember so vividly seeing Fellowship of the Ring 2 years ago. I was a bit worried on how I would take this film because I was slightly disappointed with The Two Towers. But RotK brings back what was lacking in The Two Towers, a sense of danger. Yes in this movie, the characters are constantly jumping out of frying pans and into the fire, only to jump out of that fire, into a bigger, hotter fire. Also gone is that unintentional humor that plagued The Two Towers and ruined the mood. I've seen this movie three times in the theater, my reaction the first time seeing it was I was thankful I read the book, or this movie would seem to go on and on and on. For those who thought Fellowship had the never-ending plot...this movie would drive you nuts. This movie is overstuffed, battle sequence after battle sequence, obstacle after obstacle, ending after ending. But it's safe to assume if you're watching Return of the King, then you have seen the two previous movies, love the characters, and could watch them no matter how long the movie is. The battle sequences are spectacular, just a mass chaos of a battle sequence, that blows the heck out of anything the Helms Deep battle had. I think my only gripe with this movie is that it should have had more time to clean up its special effects. There are some impressive FX, but the vast majority I could spot, and point out to others. I think the praise to this movie's special effects is a bit undeserving...but the Ringnuts mob would argue otherwise. Other than that, everything is here. The great acting, the great script, the great score, the mind-numbingly beautiful sets and costumes, which all add up to a great movie, a befitting end to the great trilogy that is Lord of the Rings.
7.0~More of the same o_willemse Sign in Permalink I loved it! No doubt about it, spectaculair effects, battles etc. But, and there's a big but, the movie doesn't add anything new to the trilogy. In the first part we could marvel at the wonderfull world of Tolkien that Peter Jackson so brilliantly captured on the big screen. In part two, there was action, battles and magnificent special effects. But what does part 3 have? More of the same. It had to be made, to complete the story and Peter Jackson did a great job. But especially the last hour was almost boring. After the twentieth happy-ending-swelling-music-scene, I was almost begging for the end. Still, I loved it, but maybe that was more because of the first two movies, or because of the book.....
10.0~Built from love and devotion... dickyork Sign in Permalink Emotionally charged tour de force - Truly Tremendous Trilogy - Roller coaster of action-packed eye candy - Picture of motion that surpasses belief....the last truly great movie of our time? No matter what any of us say about Return Of The King and it's two preceding chapters, the truth of the matter is that no movie trilogy has ever come in such a complete package and told such a complete story. This is because of the way the films were shot and the story being widely acknowledged as one of the greatest ever told. People are allowed to criticise and pick fault - everyone has there own opinion. Those who miss the obvious and are blind to the love and devotion that seeps from the celluloid at every turn of the glorious plot, I pity. Not one line of cheese is uttered - the performances make even the elvish hyperbole acceptable, so even from depths despair to great joy every line seems real. Yes the book's been changed and there are significant cuts but the spirit remains and that's the point. It's been a long time in coming but we now have the greatest movie trilogy of all time to watch when we have read the greatest of all tales ever told!
10.0~You gotta see it! dhagash Sign in Permalink As we stood in the bitter cold night of chicago, waiting for the theatre doors to open for the first show of the final chapter of the epic triology; I was wary of the track record of the great directors of hollywood to disappoint fans with movies like Matrix revolutions, Terminator 3 and arguably Starwars episode I. But this movie was a class apart. It is a near perfect mixture of drama, action and humor one can expect. The crew making the triology deserves hats off. They have created another gem of a movie to put this epic in the most memorable movies of all time, something Matrix nearly missed. Movie is very long but could be even longer, considering the amazingly complex and enormous world J.R.Tolkien has created. I love the way almost every character was given ample time to develop in the movie and take place in minds of all the viewers. The war was not monotonous (cf.Matrix, Terminator3, even starwars)It had new strategies, new weapons and a wide variety of warriors. The sets are mind boggling. In short... if u like action and stories of courage, this is the movie to watch.
10.0~Question about the contents of Extended Edition tristanrettich Sign in Permalink I have bought every other Special Gift edition of the Extended version so far. And each one seems to be a much better movie. Much more well rounded off. I just have some questions about the most reesnt edition. DOES IT HAVE THE SQOUERING OF THE SHIRE?!?!?!??!?! lol I KNOW I KNOW.. i cant spell but, I was SOOOo disappointed when the first edition did not include it!!!!!!!!! And when i realized that the extended edition was coming, I have been crossing my fingers ever since I watched this movie. please tell me! lol And what other new scenes were included? does it have """SHARKY""" "The world is quiet here"
10.0~WOW, Great Movie/Trilogy! rmanogue Sign in Permalink Fellowship and Towers were great, classics! Return of the king was, I would have to say... better! I think they created a truly great Epic by shooting them at the same time. That in itself really led up to the final chapter and how "real" it was. Though the last 30 minutes could have been cut to 15, I understand why they did it. That is a lot of book to fit into 3 movies... Don't walk, RUN to see it. If for no other reason, see it on the big screen... UNBELIEVABLE!!
10.0~Worth the wait giallanza Sign in Permalink After returning from the midnight premier at 4AM, I am really looking forward to seeing the extended edition DVD. This was worth the wait. I don't think Tolkien fans will be disappointed. It is nice to see a film good enough to cheer for.
7.0~Extended Edition is definitive aaronclawrence Sign in Permalink Return of the King, Extended Edition, is a decent improvement on the theatrical release, except for a couple of small mis-steps. The EE improves the flow of the story immensely, succinctly explaining a lot of points that before seemed a little arbitrary. It extends some crucial parts of the movie to greatly improve the sense of time passing, such as Frodo and Sam crossing Mordor. It includes the much-missed conclusion to Saruman and Wormtongue's story - not in the same style as the book, which depended on the unfilmed (and unfilmable) Scouring of the Shire, but in an appropriate way that stays true to the spirit of the book. (In fact this scene is a good example of the very effective way that the writers collapsed multiple book scenes into one movie scene. Kudos.) The extended cut also gives a lot more personality and interest to some characters; notably Denethor, Steward of Gondor, but others as well. The battles feel more grueling due to subtle extensions here and there. It's still not quite perfect; I still think the role of the dead army was too much, detracting from the efforts of the living warriors. This was probably not easily correctable in the EE, since it would have meant filming some quite substantial additional battle scenes, and further the writers had clearly made a decision to go away from the book version here. Still, I would like to see that improved somehow. The Paths of the Dead itself is extended, but most of this is unnecessary and frankly cheap. Looking back now, the theatrical edition is much superior both for suspense and lack of cheese. I would rather have seen the spooky and sad scene with Bregor's (?) skeleton lying at a the sealed door of some unknown chamber. And if I'm getting fussy, a bit more actual darkness would be nice! There are other niggles, but they decrease in importance and probably only reflect my opinions and personal vision of LotR. In terms of story balance, the EE of RotK was what should have been originally released to theatres. Unfortunately, this would have been impossible as it is an hour longer, and many casual viewers already found it much too long. In any case, the final Extended Edition of Return of the King is absolutely stunning. Where I had previously felt the movie strayed a little too far into traditional "Hollywood blockbuster" territory, the EE now feels balanced, complete, and above all moving and true to the spirit of the book. I thank Mr Jackson, New Line Cinema, JRR Tolkien and everyone else who contributed. For myself, this is the best series of films ever made, and I am quite happy to call Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King a masterpiece, as is the book it was based upon. Film and book snobs be damned, this is an amazing movie.
9.0~Best one from the SERIES! brookewhistance Sign in Permalink This is the ultimate brilliance. A cinematic feat that satisfies at every level.
10.0~One of the best movies of 2003 daleapam Sign in Permalink I have seen this movie and love it. I own a copy, and watch it often. In fact, I love the whole trilogy. Peter Jackson has done an excellent job portraying the books correctly. Elijah Wood also did an excellent job portraying Frodo Baggins. In fact, all the actors and actresses did an excellent job portraying each of their characters. Mr. Jackson did a wonderful job finding all the right actors to portray some of the most beloved characters in history. Some of my favorite characters are Arwen, Legolas, Galadriel, Gimli, Eowyn, and Sam. And although I'm arachnophobic, I love watching ROTK. Although I've seen the DVD version, I haven't seen the extended edition. But I think that the extended edition will make it even better.
10.0~A MASTERPIECE f-hansen Sign in Permalink Tolkien would be pleased and proud, that Peter Jackson has visualized his books in this grand scale. It is a masterpiece from both. The Return of the King is the best movie of all time. It has all the elements, from the book and that is an undertaking like no other from PJ and his team. This movie deserves to win, at the academy awards next year. Tolkien & Jackson are the kings who have returned.
8.0~The Return of the Epic Fantasy superoatbran Sign in Permalink A good film trilogy is a crescendo if you will emanate for a moment. Slowly building until exalted into resounding pop culture benevolence. Thus making a bad trilogy a decrescendo, that of course the viewer giving the original a super thumbs up, fingernail even extended and the other two installments just a momentarily grunt and sigh, i.e. The Matrix. What can be said for a great film trilogy then? What metaphor could be used and justify its mean. Total speechlessness. To say nothing at all. And although that defeats the whole purpose of this comment box, the entire Lord of the Rings series completely gives resonance to this statement. Sure we can nitpick, we can even say What if and if they did this or that but you know what? It's not our decision. We're not the filmmaker, we're the viewer. And what a treat these films were, not since the original Star Wars did an epic and more importantly fantasy gives us something to reward our eyes upon. Although in this author's mind, the middle of the three was the best accomplishment. Much like the Star Wars' trilogy, the second act is the pinnacle of the storytelling. Mostly because we usually know, as the viewer how the third picture will end but the second is always the mystery. It's dark, it's powerful and it contains the heart of our passions. But this is a response to the third film, not Two Towers. What can be said for Return of the King though is it ends this trilogy better than how it began. Fellowship was an acquired taste, the theatrical release anyway. I did not have appreciation for this series until watching the extended cut which brought justice to LOTR's comparison to Star Wars, when it was the very story to inspire such a space opera to the film's creator, George Lucas. The friendship of Samwise and Frodo blossoms to importance within this chapter. Before I just felt odd being moved by two homo-erotic hobbits. Samwise represents the viewer, Frodo representing the dreamer in all of us of greatness and extraordinary achievements. Ultimately the viewer, (Samwise) carries the dreamer, (Frodo) to greatness. This is the best message in the entire story. Not of friendship or resilience but that in all of us we can accomplish everything we wish. Such as Peter Jackson's telling of this story in not just one great film but three. Sean Astin deserves every accolade this film will receive. He carried this picture much like his character carries Elijah Wood's Frodo. Sure Andy Serkis did wonderful things with Gollum and Viggo and Ian are just as impressive with their roles as Aragorn and Gandalf, respectively. But they are creatures, kings and wizards. Sam is the every man, he is in all of us. Naked all the layers of this picture: the special effects, the epic battles, the turn of time storytelling, the CGI characters, the score, the fantasy and there you'll find what really matters; the heart. The heart in all of us to become what we were destined to be.
7.0~AWESOME!!!!!!!Best Ever? mookieperez Sign in Permalink Wow, I don't know about everyone else but who's with me for LOTR The Return of the King as the best one yet, and maybe the best of all time? All the fight scenes were unbelievable, the acting was top notch, the writing superb and the special effects were also incredible. It's been a while since I've seen a movie this good, not since Schindler's List or Lawrence of Arabia has a 3 hour movie made me feel this good afterward.
10.0~Words fail me - A Masterpiece stagwithabeard Sign in Permalink Each year, since the release of 'Fellowship' I have spent my days counting down to the release of the next installment in what is, IMO, the greatest series of films ever created. Last night, I sat in a state of pure ecstasy as the climatic finale to this epic of epics played out in front of me. Utterly breath-taking, utterly moving and utterly brilliant. I had planned to write the usual 1000 word review on the topic, talking about the effects, the script and the scenery, but my words cannot simply begin to do justice to Jacksons interpretation. All words now fail me except one - Masterpiece. sTag.

10.0~the greatest cinematic achievement ever! integrityfirst Sign in Permalink Without a doubt the greatest cinematic achievement in Hollywood's countless years!!!!! Everything about this movie is perfect, including the acting! Ian McKellan and Sean Astin do especially well. Of course it does help to have a director like Peter Jackson behind the camera. He shows so much skill as a director in this movie and was very deserving of the Oscar given to him. In this movie Jackson has created something so moving and brilliant that I hate for this to be the last of the trilogy. I am looking forward to more of his directing. This movie is at number 1 on my list and the first and second one follow right behind it at 2 and 3! It was deservedly given the title as best picture of 2003, and 10 other Oscars. The cinematographer was shamefully neglected and didn't receive even a nomination! ***** of *****!!!
10.0~A fantastic conclusion to a great trilogy Tweekums Sign in Permalink After a brief prologue showing us how Sméagol came to get the ring and how he came to be the pitiful creature we know the film proper starts where The Two Towers left off; Sméagol is continuing with his plan to lure Frodo and Sam to their doom in Shelob's lair and Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are reunited with Merry and Pippin at Isengard. When Pippin looks into the palantír, a sort of dark crystal ball, he sees the city of Minas Tirith under attack, unfortunately he himself is seen by Sauron. Galdalf takes him to Minas Tirith when he rides there to warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise an army large enough to assist in that coming battle. I thought that the battle of Helm's Deep was impressive but it seems a mere skirmish compared to the battle of Minas Tirith, here there are thousands of Orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant like creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under their giant feet. All the time this battle rages Frodo and Sam are journeying deeper and deeper into the land of Mordor to Mount Doom in order to end Sauron's reign once and for all. This is probably the best film of the trilogy, I can see why it raked in the awards, the only weakness was the epilogue once the quest was completed the film could have ended at the crowning of the king rather than going on to their return to the Shire... even though I'm aware that this was in the book. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job bringing such an epic story to the screen, he was of course assisted by a fantastic cast who really brought the characters to life.
7.0~Very Good, but... Weathership Sign in Permalink Alas, not having read the novel, I was very excited when I saw the trilogy. A great spectacle, indeed. The great adventure-and great expectations...were all realized... But.... As I look back on it, this film is a huge achievement, but that's the problem for me. Big spectacular sfx and complicated scoring distract from the story at times. And although action and acting are carried out here on a fine story-telling scheme, I was left a bit empty. For me, the emotional trek was always not "who is going to live or die?", but "how much computer power was needed?". Fantasy films can be bit overdone and full of themselves, and I suspect that this is somewhat the case here. For real, human drama, sans all the cgi and such, see what I thought was the best film of 2003...Mystic River...
4.0~the weakest part in the trilogy dragokin Sign in Permalink Overall, The Lord of the Rings trilogy will be remembered as a milestone in the history of movie making. But when analyzing each move separately, i must admit that this was the weakest. My dissatisfaction doesn't stem from comparison to J.R.R. Tolkien's books, because i think that a movie should always be viewed as an independent piece of art. I was merely thinking about what i've seen. Apart from the fantasy world of the Middle Earth, everything that stayed in my memory were endless battle sequences and Frodo crying most of the time. The former was necessary because of the scale of the conflict portrayed, but the second is a mystery to me. I understand that Frodo is showing true heroism by taking an assignment that is obviously too much a for a small hobbit. But there were other means for showing him being overwhelmed with emotion. On the other hand, i guess that the trilogy would have never gotten the funding without grand action sequences. I may reproach Peter Jackson about his artistic integrity, but i was not there when he negotiated the funding with producers. Still, since the first two parts were already more than successful, i think he had some possibility to negotiate the finale and make it less like a blockbuster.
10.0~one amazing picture cmacdaddy73 Sign in Permalink The outstanding conclusion to an amazing trilogy. Movie making does not get any better than this film. As a hole the entire crew of LOTR made an amazing three movies, everyone did their job and everyone did it well. From acting to cinematography to costume/set design to special FX to sound FX to the music/score, few have done it better. The movie just completely engrosses you and cannot get enough, some people say that the ending is drawn out, I say that it ends the only conceivable way that I can see the movie ending (disregarding the Scouring of the Shire, it only turned out to be slightly upsetting). I am an avid Tolkein fan and I like to think that he would be extremely pleased with what Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens did in order to convert his story to the big screen. This film is a enthralling and a real pleasure to watch. It is just so good. Well deserving of every single Oscar it won.
10.0~...FANTASTIC! svensen Sign in Permalink Without a doubt, the best, grandest, largest and most enthralling epic of all time. Do whatever it takes to see this film. The story is great, the production is amazing, the special-effects are beyond all imagination and well, after this, everything is going to be an anti-climax.
10.0~"Simply Put, An Amazing Story" jim1212 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's vision of LOTHR is brilliant. The story takes me along with and takes me to places I've never been. The characters in this story are so unique. My favourite part of the story has always been ROTHK. The film is truly an epic. I hope that future film projects can possibly lead Peter Jackson to film "The Hobbit" as well. I am wondering though what "King Kong" will be like as well?. With the upcoming theatrical release of ROTHK and the future special edition as I well, I can truly say that I really enjoy these films (and others as well) and I would recommend that any movie fan check these out. Adding them to your collection allows you to re-visit Hobbiton once more and perhaps never leave?
10.0~Fantastic end to a brilliant trilogy. thribble Sign in Permalink A film I've been looking forward to for as long as I've been looking forward to this one very rarely meets expectations. RotK exceeded everything I expected and beat everything I'd hoped for. I could not find a bad thing to say about this film. If you enjoyed the other two you will love this one. I would have turned round and watched it again if they would have let me.
8.0~The DVD will be better Sisiutil Sign in Permalink Don't get me wrong, RoTK was 3.5 hours of rollicking good fun, and a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. On that note, it's also a better trilogy conclusion than Return of the Jedi, The Godfather Part III, or the next Star Wars movie (which none of us have to see to know it will be disappointing). Some favorite moments for me: Theoden's inspiring battlefield leadership; Legolas taking out an oliphant single-handed (and Gimli's perfect response); Eowyn and Merry, of all people, taking down Sauron's right-hand Nazgul, the Witch King; the wonderfully drawn-out denoument, which had me in tears for nearly a half hour; and the unflagging heroism of all the hobbits, who really come into their own in this movie, ESPECIALLY Sam! I was left thinking Mr. Gamgee would have stared down Sauron himself if he'd had too. Next time I need a gardener, I know who I'm calling. But I still think the extended version of the movie we'll see in about a year on DVD will be a much better film. Based on Jackson's commentaries on the two previous extended DVDs, he sacrifices character for plot in the theatrical releases. Unfortunately, that strategy costs him dearly in RoTK. I know everyone's going on about how the battle at Minis Tirith makes Helm's Deep seem like a schoolyard shoving match. But I found myself looking at my watch during the MT fight. I never did that during Helm's Deep. You know why? I CARED about the people at Helm's Deep. In The Two Towers, Jackson was brilliant at making us care about the people of Rohan--remember the mother reunited with her two children? The old men and boys being outfitted for war? The fear on their faces? We don't get to see any Gondorians the same way. We're also NOT shown or told, as clearly as it was for Rohan, how hopeless this battle is for Gondor. As spectacular as the Minis Tirith battle is, it eventually becomes just another example of Hollywood special effects porn. If I'd wanted that, I would have just rented Bad Boys II. I don't know if Jackson will address this problem in the extended version, but I hope so. One other big problem, which I'm certain will be addressed on the DVD: Eowyn and Faramir. In the Two Towers, Jackson introduced and really built up the importance of these very appealing characters. They get short shrift in RoTK. Eowyn gets a two-sentence brush-off from Aragorn--not much payoff for all that romantic tension built up in the previous movie. It's a good thing Mortensen is so talented and delivered the dialogue with such angst, or he would have come off like Seinfeld's George delivering a Middle Earth version of the "it's-not-you-it's-me" line. David Wenham (Faramir), meanwhile, has the unenviable task of spending most of the movie doing a pretty good impression of a corpse. I know there were a lot of characters' stories to finish off, but given their importance in TT, it was disappointing to see how little these two fascinating characters mattered in RoTK. Jackson should have trimmed the MT battle a little and given us more of these two very human stories. Still, it's a very good if not great film, well worth seeing. The REAL movie, however, won't be out for nearly a year.
10.0~Epic Final radupaulm Sign in Permalink This is the best movie i ever seen...great fantasy movie
10.0~Sarumann? kimmeu Sign in Permalink I was a little disappointed at the midnite premier here in Tromsø, Norway at the end of the movie as it didn't have the 'real' ending as JRR Tolkien had written in the book with Sarumann's and Grima Wormtounge's wrecking at the Shire, amongst other things.
10.0~best of the trilogy! shepardjessica Sign in Permalink As the evil gollum is still trying to take the ring from frodo,he is being corrupted by the ring, but that doesn't stop him trying to get to mordor.peter Jackson did an excellent job directing this film,and its by far the best out of the three. I personally think that Viggo Mortenson was the best(acting and character wise). The film captures all different kinds of themes such as action, adventure,some horror(thanks to the giant spider)and of course friendship.Why do i think this is the best? Well i think the story got better every time,and the way it was filmed was better than the first one(the fellowship of the ring)i.e the colors where very dark and misty and much like the first and second film the cinematography was great!All of the battle scenes were done very well. It looked real and all of the orcs were very frightening! What also made the movie good was the music almost every scen had different music that went along with it perfectly.All the characters where portrayed very well by each of the actors. But personally Merry and Pippin were kind of annoying by the third movie.But oh well. This movie was so good that i was actually sad when it ended the first time i saw it, but now that i own the whole trilogy i can watch them any time and its not as sad. I think that if you say that you don't like any of these movies you are in denial because they are just amazing! And if you haven't seen these movies you need to go to the nearest video store and rent them right away and see for yourself how spectacular they really are. I could go on about this movie forever but i wont cause there is a word limit, so i'll just leave the review with these final words: The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best!
10.0~This is the most brilliant movie I have ever seen. geek_boy Sign in Permalink I was in geek heaven the whole time. The script is delightful, feeling and full of wonder. The acting is superior to the first two movies. The cast has gelled wonderfully. Jackson is the first director to properly shoot three movies at once, and with good success and he will live in history for doing so. I can't say anything bad about this movie. 100/10 for being 10x my expectations.
9.0~Massive conclusion of a saga-with an add on ending. 9/10. spaceas Sign in Permalink At first the movie picks up the threads where the Two Towers ended. This is done at personal/individual levels-we follow the protagonists as events grow more massive and Middle Earth. However, the Saruman subplot is noticably absent. War with Saurons' armies is joined, and huge battles are fought, using ground breaking CGI. Meanwhile Frodo, Gollum and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring. This is an excellent movie, and a magnificient tale well worth watching, though I wonder why there is a long (20 minutes or so) add on ending that does not really add anything substantial to the movie ? They could have saved this for the extended version I think, and included the Saruman clips instead. Anyway, this is an excellent movie, and arguably the best in the trilogy; it does not feel too long despite 3h30min runtime. Go watch it! 9/10
10.0~The Best Trilogy Since Stars Wars & Godfather Blackace Sign in Permalink First of all, for the people who are bashing this film and giving it 1's & 2's, please delete your User Id's from IMDB website as you are not a true movie fan. If you truly think the LOTR series was bad, then please (pretty please) show me how YOU could make the movie better. That's what I thought. On with my short review. The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is without a doubt the best conclusion of any trilogy movie I've ever scene. Even better then the last Star Wars movie in different ways. Not only is the story extremely well told and acted, but the whole cinematography is absolutely breath-taking. The lighting and shadow effects are beautifully done and the camera work is some of the best I've seen in long time. This movie should get at least 5 Oscars and maybe 9-10 nominations. The Academy have snubbed movies like this again and again each year even though critics have screamed praises for it. LOTR:ROTK definitely deserve some awards this year. Many people have complained about the endings being too long or not authentic with the book. To them I say =oP!! Give it a rest. I thought the endings were very well done. The various cut scenes could have been smoothed together a bit better, but overall the ending(s) were fine. I would have liked to have seen endings for Gimli & Legolas as well, but what was provided was good enough. There's no doubt that this final movie will be a huge success when the DVD is released. Unlike the Matrix Trilogy the went from great to bad, LOTR when from great to stellar. Peter Jackson definitely deserves recognition for all this hard work with these 3 films. I say, "Bravo!!" to him and his staff on bringing the LOTR Trilogy to life on the big screen. I'm sure Peter J. will be sought out by every movie studio from now on. If you haven't see this movie yet, don't walk, but RUN to the theater and see it NOW. Nuff said!!
4.0~Lacking conclusion to an otherwise great Saga SupraP123 Sign in Permalink A horrible conclusion to an otherwise awesome saga. The first two movies were good but the way Peter Jackson adapted this conclusive third film ended up having too many plot-holes. The first movie was amazing, and as it went on it went slightly downhill with the second; although it was still a great movie. This third just didn't keep up. I don't understand how it's the higher scoring of the three on many sites and praised... it was horrible in comparison. What about those ghosts? Why didn't they just go to the ghosts to begin with? They slaughtered everything. It was comical. Stupid.
9.0~Incredible trilogy. johnlehmann Sign in Permalink What a perfect ending. I especially love the Director's Cut, which lets me live in Middle Earth just a little longer. Performances across the board were moving. Each actor truly disappears into the role. The set and cinematography are unmatched, and hold up 15 years later. A masterpiece!
8.0~good simute-06326 Sign in Permalink Really good. enjoyed watching it. would definitely recommend to watch it with ur family n friends
10.0~A timeless classic that should be part of every child's introduction into the world. Necessary to the education and growth of any individual. aurorajpatterson Sign in Permalink A timeless classic that should be part of every child's introduction into the world. Necessary to the education and growth of any individual. A well written trilogy filled with sarcasm, adventure, and excitement, turned into perfectly adapted movies. Some characters importance might have been exaggerated but that can be easily looked over because of how well it adds to the story-line of the movies. These movies are easily some of the most quotable movies ever made, making several memes that lasted for years, and teaching the next generation about the importance of reading Tolken's work. If you haven't read the books I definitely recommend you do, they definitely add to the overall experience, and quite possibly get you even more hooked.
10.0~One story to rule them all . . . renvecci Sign in Permalink Like many, I read the books, then word reached my ears that films were being made, I thought it was just going to be yet another Hollywood (overloaded with C.G.I. and really fake awful acting with an all star cast to attract people to come see it) film, so I checked out the trailer and some lord of the rings sites and as I found out how un-American this was I began to become exited and eagerly anticipated the release of the 'Fellowship of the Ring'. Like anyone else who has eyes ears and even a spec of sanity would say I want to see the two towers! so finally Return of the King is released and frankly nothing can come close. Star Wars is a great, semi-original story and is fairly unique in that it is just a film story and not a book converted to the big screen. After reading the books several times and watching the movies several thousands of times, I still see the films as though they were totally rewritten and only based on the books rather than 'converted'. Any Tolkien fan or more academically involved in Tolkien and his Lord of the Rings will know that calling it a 'Fantasy Sci-Fi Adventure' for greasy and spotty teenage boys is simply preposterous! It is a complex story that has many links with our own world's history and human dilemmas. I hope audiences can watch Lord of the rings without prior judgement/expectations/prejudice, but with open minds and most importantly to enjoy and stupendously well cast/scored/produced/adapted film. Worthy of high recognition in all records. Well done to all involved!
10.0~Great... but not the best of the three. orangejam_gurl08 Sign in Permalink yes, the movie's so good apart from the ---other--- movies. but still for me, the best among the lotr trilogy is two towers. sfx-wise, nothing can beat the three esp the moria(1), hornburg(2) and minas tirith(3). sound-wise, still two towers. but action-, acting-, and dialogue-/emotion-wise... hands-down, RETURN OF THE KING. it might be a long movie but it's worth every penny, every sip of cola and every piece of popcorn!
10.0~My opinion KIANAMARIE03 Sign in Permalink Great Move. Although the movie was slightly different than the book itself. The special effects and the intensity of the characters were remarkable. I would recommend this movie to all my friends. The movie got better and better since the 1st part. I have watched part 2 about 10x and will do the same with the 3rd. I hope they come up with the trilogy to buy it all at the same time.
9.0~What a finish! dirtychild Sign in Permalink Return of the King was an excellent send-out of what should be one of the greatest movie trilogies ever! The story in this "episode" largely focuses on Sam and Frodo's journey to reach Mount Doom in an attempt to destroy the "One Ring". Meanwhile Aragorn, Gandolf and co continue to battle Sauron's forces so that Frodo can complete his quest. After the mainly singularly focused (with a dash of horror) Fellowship of the Ring and its complicated follow-up, The Two Towers, with huge battle-scenes - The Return of the King, in my opinion, blends what was so good about the first two films and combines it into one climatic powerhouse finale. Whereas Frodo's quest is more character driven with a horrible sense of dread, Aragorn and Co's are more about the huge battle sequences. All the acting / casting is just great - it gives the whole film a certain mature weight. The SFX are incredible - I'm not a huge fan of CGI stuff - but the effects in this movie are getting fairly realistic (it doesn't look like "cheap" CGI effects - hello Star Wars!). The NZ scenery is spectacular as ever and I love the Aussie contingent in terms of acting. Although I thought the ending was incredibly soppy and probably could have been trimmed - I think that this episode takes the cake in terms of the Lord of the Ring trilogy.
10.0~The new benchmark for epics neilmeyer Sign in Permalink This movie sets the benchmark for the genre. The attention to detail, the fantastic views with the timeless story are very well matched. Peter Jackson and the cast draw you into Middle Earth, the camera and special effects crew make you believe in it and care. A fantastic transfer from the book! It's such a shame it's now finished...
10.0~A great change in film. Bozo Sign in Permalink My entire life I have wanted nothing more than to work on movies. I thought about it day and night and made it my mission to learn by watching and doing. Throughout these years I have seen hundreds, possibly thousands of movies, but nothing has come close to matching the incredible power and beauty of the Lord of the Rings movies. Peter Jackson has taken one of the most popular literary works of all time and made it into one of the most moving and passionate motion pictures ever made. From frame one to the end of the credits, Return of the King is a triumph beyond all others. It has the ability to excite as well as stir great emotion. After all these years my thoughts on great cinema have changed. Now when anyone asks me what my favorite film is, I will now say, "Return of the King."
8.0~One of the Best Ever Movie seoserviceinindia Sign in Permalink It was a pleasure to watch this movie. Story line-ups are awesome, graphics were amazing and the movie direction is superb. We recommend this movie to everyone. It's not just one time watch, loved it a lot! The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences w have seen. Again a great one to watch!
9.0~A nerve-wracking journey culminating in great satisfaction goldilocks_78 Sign in Permalink "I AM NO MAN!" I don't think I know any other movies from which you could just quote one short line and it will send shivers right through me  to the extent that tears may even start to well in my eyes. This movie trilogy is a huge emotional thing for millions of Tolkien fans who have built up our expectations through years of nerve-wracking waiting time, and Peter Jackson knew that. Although I saw the theatrical version when it came out in December 2003 and was thrilled, I just watched the extended DVD for the very first time two days ago. As for the two forerunners, the extended version is a great relief. It makes me very happy when they have included scenes that contribute to the emotional development and character bonding. I love it when dialogue is not only fancy lines being thrown around, but actually contributes to the depth and understanding of the story. And I love it when details are taken straight from the book. It was good to finally get to see moments that were missing in the theatrical version, particularly Aragorn using the palantír, Merry swearing his oath to Théoden, Gandalf confronting the Witch-king, Faramir's encounter with Éowyn in the houses of healing, and Frodo and Sam marching with the orcs. However, I sadly had to accept that one of my favorite moments from the book was never included. It is where Sam sits in despair in the tower of Cirith Ungol, humming a tune about the Shire, and then hearing Frodo's faint voice answering him from up above... This is a beautiful moment, but I guess it didn't fit in with the atmosphere. The movie is good on the capturing the climaxes. Shelob, the battle of the Pelennor Fields, and the Mount Doom scenes are perfect. However, as with the first two movies, I get the sense of the movie rushing too fast through the action, and we miss the sense of how much distance and time the characters really lay behind them. It is probably the way it has to be when making such a story into a movie. But the movie also captures some of the small moments, and conveys in a touching way how also the small and seemingly insignificant creatures have an important place in history. The interaction between Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is beautifully done in this sense. One of many visually mesmerizing scenes is the little hobbit overcoming his fear of heights and climbing up and lightening the beacon of Minas Tirith, which in turn alarms Rohan that war is on its way. After the Two Towers, I was quite nervous about the third installment. Both because the second one was an ever so small disappointment and because there was so much of the story left to tell. In both senses I think the Return of the King made up for this. Moreover, it certainly came to its right in regard to character development. Samwise finally demonstrating to be the true hero of the story (thanks, Sean Astin, for living up to my favorite LOTR character). Gollum no longer being annoyingly funny and cute, but finally evolving into a terrifying, horrid creep showing his true dark sides, preciousss. However, I have a few small complaints: Firstly, the music score was really overdone several times. I think the smaller, emotional moments, particularly the Frodo and Sam moments, could have been more touching and powerful without that accompanying music score that had too much pathos. Secondly, I don't approve of scenes that undermine the power and wisdom of Gandalf, degrading him into a cool old fighting wizard, such as hitting the steward of Gondor in the head with his staff. Everybody knows, he would never have done that. I could still write several pages about what I liked and what I disliked about the Return of the King, but this review has to come to an end. The bottom line is that whatever the worries throughout the first two movies (and particularly the second, which went out of its good concepts in my opinion), this one made up for it. And I guess that's it with this being the final installment, finally we get the idea of why the characters have been portrayed the way they have through FOTR and TTT  namely, to be able to show us the full depth of their development throughout the story. And now they have become who they were born to be, and it all makes sense. I just love that feeling; when it all makes sense. Thank you, Peter Jackson & co., for giving me the three most exciting Christmases of my life.
10.0~The Best of the Three! I can't wait for the extended edition! ben_seager Sign in Permalink Everyone needs to see this in the best theater they can find! The effects are absolutely stunning! This may be Peter Jackson's version of the books, but I'll take it - and come back for seconds, and thirds, and forths, . ..!
1.0~LOTR 3: The Video Game nekanderson881 Sign in Permalink Many critics cite the 1952 film "The Greatest Show of Earth" as the poorest Best Picture selection in Academy history. That dubious distinction should now go to "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," which makes DeMille's circus epic seem like the greatest show on earth in comparison. It was not only the Academy, but also the once-relevant New York Film Critics Circle that chose this film as the year's best. It's a wonder that the ghost of Pauline Kael didn't use her after-life influence with the All Mighty to strike the entire group dead. This video game-like film goes from one chase scene to the next with little in the way of plot development. I've seen all three films and don't have a clue what the fellowship of the ring is, or the significance of the two towers, nor where the king was returning from. Director Jackson failed to include much in the way of plot exposition in nine plus hours of film! The computer-generated Gollum was the most interesting character in the film; at least he wanted to kill off those annoying hobbits. Ian McKellen is distinguished in his knightly role and added a touch of class to the otherwise endless stream of special effects. The female stars of the film, Tyler and Blanchett, have so little screen time that it doesn't make sense to even have them in the film. Apparently Tyler's character is present merely to suggest that Mortensen's character is heterosexual. Why Blanchett has such an annoying smile on her face each fifteen seconds she is on screen is a mystery to me.
10.0~Biased by the book ableape Sign in Permalink It is difficult to not be biased when reviewing films like Lord of the Rings, especially since the source material has been so popular for so long. Having just finished reading the last page of the volumous book a few days prior, I was anxious and prepared to see Peter Jackson's last take on the third book, Return of the King. Even considering my high expectations, I was still blown away. It seems he has saved the best for last. Not only did I feast my eyes on the sweetest visual candy, I was taken on an intensely emotional rollercoaster. While the second film may have seemed slower-paced than the first, this third film is faster, and ultimately more exciting than the first or second, even given its 3+ hours run time. But it could also be a bit draining. Not that that's a bad thing. Just be prepared. The film opens with a flashback that gives Andy Serkis (Gollum/Smeagol) a chance to develop his character as well as appear without computer enhancement. But once the computer graphics are kicked in, they give life like some supreme being. (Upon first seeing Gollum again, I actually believed he was real for a moment. An improvement over last year's award-winning model, and money well spent.) Throughout the movie, many others are given chances to deliver classic lines and develop their characters further, and they do it superbly. We even get to hear Pippin (Billy Boyd) sing, surprisingly with a beautiful voice, as well as Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen). The sheer scale of the computer-generated armies are jaw-dropping. Battle scenes are plentiful and satisfying, including a sequence with Legolas and an Oliphaunt that is particularly rousing. However, Aragorn's ghost army seemed a bit unnatural (excuse the pun), but maybe that was the intent. Since this isn't Jackson's first experience with ghosts, one might expect better. One of his earlier films, "The Frighteners", expertly blended true horror with true humor, a feat most people fail to recognize, let alone duplicate. To point out another possibly minor flaw, Denethor's odd behavior goes a bit unjustified in the film. Yes, he just found out about his favorite son Boromir's death, but it's still puzzling that some seemingly minor scenes and dialogues were included, yet the "real" (book) reason why he was so wacked in the head was not even eluded to. Granted, having to cram and wrap up multiple major plot lines built up during two previous movies is valiant, if not impossible, so Jackson's artistic liberties with the book are excusable when necessary. (For example, there is no appearance of Saruman, and the Shire remains unscoured.) Perhaps the Special Extended Edition DVD will expound upon this, and other unanswered questions. In the end, men cheered and women cried. Overall, a highly enjoyable ride. If this doesn't sweep the awards, it'll at least sweep you off your feet. 9.5 out of 10.
10.0~Breathtaking... tobu Sign in Permalink What a better way to conclude this amazing trilogy with a breathtaking finale. I have never felt such an real experience of fantasy as in the case of the LOTR trilogy. After having watched this finale it took a few days to realize that it was just a fantasy. The Frodo-Sam relationship was just so well played that I felt their friction and love. The battles were unbelievably exciting that at times I felt that my own life was at sake. Althoug the story was over a few days, to me it felt real-time. The film cast simply brought a master piece of art onto screens and did it with elaborate precision. After reading the books everyone had their own images of how it all looks, but I was so surprised to see in general how the movie was similar to how I thought it all out in my mind. This trilogy and especially this finale is certainly a multiple-watch movie, better said, a master piece!
7.0~Great movie one of the best trilogy's of all time mpiya2013 Sign in Permalink Loved the historical anecdotes, graphics and general tightness of the storyline, quite an enthralling watch. Great movie one of the best trilogies of all time. The acting was impeccable and a lot of humor to spice up the action. The movie basically pops your eyes, excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion. Not only has Jackson boldly and faithfully brought J.R.R. Tolkien world to life, he's created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time. One thing though the movie is both the longest film in the series and the most confidently paced, striking an ideal balance of combat and camaraderie.
10.0~The Movie leodor8 Sign in Permalink The last part of the lord of the rings trilogy was even better than the excellent two first movies. Positive:fantastic action,emotional depth,the feeling of closure,loyal to the book,excellent CGI Negative-nothing This movie is in my considerate opinion one of the best movies I have ever seen and concludes a brilliant,amazing-awesome trilogy.congratulations to Persy Jackson and all the cast.well deserved the Oscars.best movie 2003.no doubt about that.I think that Tolkien would be proud. Gandalf and Aragorn lead the World of Men against Sauron's army to draw his gaze from Frodo and Sam as they approach Mount Doom with the One Ring.
10.0~The greatest movie experience of all time. slucasfamily Sign in Permalink SPOILERS INCLUDED!!!!!! I felt breathless and mixed with fear, grief, excitement and most of all awe through the entire movie. My favorite scene is when Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli jump out of the boat with the army of the dead. It was just incredible. I loved that I was able to experience every possible emotion there is to feel with this movie. At the end when Aragorn is so shocked to see Arwen I thought it was incredibly brilliant to allow him to still be human and just GRAB her and kiss her instead of making him come across as the King who has to be more formal. The roller coaster of emotion is really felt when Theoden is confused when he looks into Eowyn's face and realizes that she is on the battlefield the audience giggled and in the next moment in tears as he passes. My first experience with this movie was during Trilogy Tuesday. I think New Line is awesome because this is truly the way these movies need to be seen. I wish that it could be released every year as a Trilogy on the big screen. The fans would absolutely sell it out!!!!!!
9.0~I know im Late Robin_17 Sign in Permalink I know im maybe 10 Years late to write a Review about this Awesome Movie. I only say it an absolute perfect ending for this whole Trilogy of the Lord of The Rings. There is so much Action throughout the Movie, and the Ending Scene is just fantastic, soo emotional.
10.0~Wonderful closure cruise_777 Sign in Permalink Apart from the ending which I don't totally understand and is a bit too happy-ending-like, I thought this film was an absolute joy to watch. While I keep thinking about the visual effects in films like the Matrix, I did not have this feeling watching ROTK. For me, the technical aspects and the story were in a perfect symbiosis and showed us how films in the future will probably look like. Way to go Peter Jackson!
10.0~Best ride in movie history allanwynpritchard Sign in Permalink This is by far the greatest movie trilogy ever made. I should end the comments here because that's all that need to be said. No trilogy has been so brilliant throughout. All other major trilogies have had weak links. Star Wars had the Return of the Jedi, Matrix had a story that didn't make sense in the end and the Godfather part 3 was awful. I have never seen a film where I am care so much to what happens to a group and character and be engaged in their battles as much as this. Never have I been through such a degree of emotions in a film. Happiness, sadness, laughter and tears. Peter Jackson and the crew have excelled themselves and the only bad point to the trilogy is that no matter what any of them do in the future, it will never meet the high standards set by this trilogy. Peter Jackson has made JRR Tolkien a very proud man and has looked after his baby with respect and care and for that I thank him. People said the movie was an impossible achievement to do, but Jackson succeeded. Bring on the Hobbit and Peter Jackson's next project King Kong.
10.0~my favorite movie of all time Dhruvayadav44 Sign in Permalink If you want a movie which you can watch many time this movie defiantly for you. watched this movie plenty of time and never get bored. watched this movie in 2008 First time and get felt on it. my friend not like to watch Hollywood movies but my choice are different from them. often like watching movie. movie have nice story + every character has their own important. should also watch 300 movie I'm not big big fan of science fiction movies so not much like. friend this was my if you want to watch this movie you will never be disappoint so you should defiantly go for watch this movie this is my personal though.
10.0~This film is a triumph well done to all involved! jackie-94 Sign in Permalink Ok, first and foremost this film is brilliant, epic, emotional. There are not many films around where I would say such things because it would be over the top. I think what sets this film apart is the fact that it was based on such a solid foundation;Tolkien's book was itself a fantastic piece of literature. The action to detail and the characterisation are just superb, this is not a film were the characters are second to the action, which itself is brilliant, instead it is a mixture of the both, the characterisation and the detail to the characters exemplifies the action because you actually care about the characters. I cannot recommend it high enough, just go to you local cinema and watch it, I'm sure you'll love it..
10.0~Finally Movie Magic Again! gsbarwick Sign in Permalink I was 10 when I saw star wars and that amazed me to no end. I am now 35 and have for many years been left wanting for the same cinematic experience but to no real avail. This may sound a bit harsh as there has been some excellent work since but none really had reached the same level of emotion in me. Now I am glad to say that Lord of the rings has done it again for me and it has been a real and rare treat that each movie has been better than the previous. You can tell the difference when a movie is intended for a mature audience, Lord of the Rings is mainly for adults whereas Harry Potter and all the star wars films were targetted at kids/teens. The dialogue is not cheezy either and presents a solid story that is easy to follow (but not quite as good as the book though) Kudos to Peter Jackson and all who worked on this film and also to JRR Tolkien for a truely legendary story. Its a long movie and make sure you dont have to leave for a quick visit to the bathroom as you will most likely miss something important. Bring on King Kong, Bring on The Hobbit!
8.0~Brilliant, and yet not so brilliant... montymarmotte Sign in Permalink In short, a very, very good film which would have been the trilogy's best and have gained a 10, had not it not gone on so long. I get the feeling Peter Jackson didn't want to end the series, and so made the final film last as long as humanly possible. In the end it just gets tiring. I really will not be watching the extended version, which may well stretch to five hours. Why couldn't they just do a Kill Bill on it? Oh well, I don't want to try to put you off, at 7/10 it is still well worth a watch, just don't try to watch the whole trilogy at once. Not without a family-sized KFC bucket, at least.
9.0~Thank You Peter Jackson! pgwhite95 Sign in Permalink This movie is simply amazing. There are really, not enough words to describe The Return of the King. In particular the extended, director's cut edition is remarkable. Having a movie that runs over three hours is one thing, having a three hour movie that doesn't loose momentum, or attention to detail after those hours are over, is why this movie won best picture. In addition to this movie being a remarkable piece of art, it is also a treasure for the entire family. I had the pleasure of watching this movie with my kids, both a boy and a girl. They both loved it. It has "violence", yes! However, it's not senseless shoot-em-up violence. My kids were literally glued to the screen, which is saying a lot because most movies don't keep your attention like this one. The story is a sincere, honest, and profound look of how industry and war, were affecting the "little-people" of this world. I'm glad to have my children watch a movie with an actual message. I found it funny hearing my kids say they feel better being small, and that they want to be Hobbits when they grow up. I'd just like to say thanks to Peter Jackson for making this film.
9.0~Perfect Fantasy stealth4933 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings is perhaps the best book to turn into a movie by todays standards. It has all of the elements that would make a great fantasy, with the sword fights and battles straight out of king Arthur. It has a little something for everyone. And, now that special effects have progressed to the point that they are at now, it is possible to pull of a movie like Lord of the Rings. And, in the end, all three movies ended up just as Tolkein had intended them. Sure, there were some things left out( such as Tom Bombadill), but the overall plot and fun was not sacrificed. This is a movie that Lord of the Rings purists and people that have never picked up any of the books can both agree on. I would definitely recommend everyone go see this movie as it is the pinnacle of a fantasy, and probably the best one to date. It is also the most successful book adaptation, beating Harry Potter by a mile. It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest movies made in modern times, and one of the great exercises in special effects.
10.0~No one could really understand the epic majesty of this film. marvsan2000 Sign in Permalink I am a fan of Tolkien and his works,and I am a fantasy writer myself. I started reading the books after watching the trilogy,FOTR was excellent and adventurous,TTT was full of action,and ROTK the final installment was a combination of the two and a glimpse of Braveheart. ROTK captured Tolkien's imagination,the city of Minas Tirith is it is as it was,the battles were majestic and medieval,the story is and soundtrack kept my heart pounding. This film inspired me,this film is filled with wonder and awe,it is the best fantasy film of the 21st century and will be remembered as one. I hope that there will be film versions of the Silmarillion soon and other prequels of LOTR.
10.0~Great film, but you can see where bits were missing! tracie-anderson Sign in Permalink As I said this is a great film, but I'm waiting with baited breath, fingers crossed etc... for the extended version - I want to see what it should have been like! Small comment and I know it's because it was easier to film that way, but the battle of the Pelinor Fields, just wasn't up to much - there were no fields and the orcish army marched straight over a plane, nor what most people would call the Pelinor Fields, I think. The music is, of course, fantastic and climaxes with Annie Lennox singing "Into the West". Well deserved all of the Oscars received - of course it's not a 'stand-a-lone' film it's part three or a very long film and as such the trio get a fantastic rating from me (particularly the extended versions - with the missing bits replaced!) Well done all concerned.
10.0~Faithfully Flawless Snoogens Sign in Permalink What can I say about Peter Jackson? After the respectfully good, but somewhat 'alternative' accomplishments of Braindead and People under the Stairs, the man has turned his attention to one of the most fiercely supported pieces of literature EVER. And he has delivered more than anyone could ever have expected, here's why. Books are not films, and vice-versa, by this I mean that I cannot understand people who can compare, say, LA confidential the novel to the film, they are both huge accomplishments in their respective fields, which gets more respect? The movie, obviously, the written word is nowadays neglected and the silver screen is bolstered by millions of £s or $s depending on where you are reading this, as a result there can be enormous liberties taken with translations from one context to another. In the case of LOTR, this would have been fatal, because of this it has been contentious to make a film of these books due to the fierce critique that director/producer might receive but kudos to Jackson for taking this burden in the style of Frodo himself and casting it into the molten fires of mount cinema. The first 2 films were great, but I was almost nervous going in to see this movie. The previous month I had fought against the odds to get a ticket for the first showing to the Matrix Revolutions, only to be shot down by ambiguity and an ending so clichéd there was literally cheese oozing out of the cinema when I left. I spent the hour before LOTR opened its doors nervously pacing and talking with friends about the possible implications this movie could have it made a mistake like the Wachowski's opus did. Thank f**k it didn't! Jackson showed all of us how Book-Film translations SHOULD, nay, MUST be done, this was the finest telling of Tolkien's private epic there could ever be, Tolkien himself could not match the drama and suspense created by Jackson during this film. (Spoilers, Watch it) As the film came on and the familiar title screen showed it's face, I was wondering what would be shown first, maybe a flooded Isengard?, or maybe a falling Osgiliath, or maybe, like the book, the promise of Minas Tirith, these all came but not after Jackson had waved his own Movie-Making wand of genius over the story. The film began with a fantastic Soliloquy featuring Andy Serkis telling the tragic tale of Gollum/Smeagol and how he came to be, this was originally in the book 'The Hobbit' but it's inclusion here is so relevant to the ensuing story and the theme that the 'Quest will claim Frodo's Life' that it serves to make the film more accessible to the viewer than the warbled and slightly erratic story telling of Tolkien himself, again, Jackson makes a contentious decision that comes off so well, I immediately forgot my nervousness prior and began to embark on the most involving and absorbing 3 hours of any movie I have ever seen. Jackson does make several omission to the story but I believe they are shrewdly chosen to up the pace and effectively make the film 'Better', the exclusion of the 'Scouring of the Shire' means Jackson has more time to tie up the loose ends of the story and we can effectively forget the whole Saruman situation. This has been criticized but, having read the book before just hurling random criticism at Jackson I believe the whole scene is too indulgent and strenuous on screen-time to warrant a film outing. This is beyond all my hopes, the finest example of a concluding chapter to any film I have ever seen, I would urge anyone, anywhere to watch it and experience it. Better than the book and better than the dream.
10.0~Best Movie Ever ryo_the_stampede Sign in Permalink Best Movie Ever.....whats with that fruity orgy at the end? Gallum is sweet. Samwise is sweet. Rudy Rudy Rudy....Gandalf is sweet. Legolas is sweet. Aragorn is sweet. Killing Elephants is sweet. Aerosmith is sweet. If you didnt like this movie you are bad at watching movies and shouldnt watch anything but dongs in blenders. Sweet Movie.
9.0~great story line and acting braganzaalan Sign in Permalink Love the actors in the film. very interesting to see the detail and effort put into making a great sequel. its an amazing movie and i can watch it over and over
10.0~POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD! -9/10- popoman9999 Sign in Permalink At first i just wanna say that i've given this movie 10/10, not like i wrote up there 9/10, now let me explain on what i've based my decision; well first of all i've watched the first two movies a short while before the third so i could compare them very well, so i sat down and started watchi ng the movie expecting something unforgettable like the first two movies, it started ok but after like 15-25 mins i noticed that i'm starting to get bored i didn't realize what's going on so i kept on watching the film and when the war was about to start it kinda jumped me up and i began getting into the movie gradually, well the war began and at first it was exciting to watch coz of all the cool effects it offered but after 10 mins it started to get boring more and more coz there was nothing unique about it like there was in the battle of helm's deep in the second movie, the characters began to act stupid as the war was in the middle of the heat, but the journey of frodo and sam with the gollum disturbing their peace added a lot to the pace of the movie and it was interesting to watch, but the movie changed into a good and smooth pace after the end of the war in gondor when aragorn decided to march to the black gate with all the army that had left and to take sauron's eye attention on them so frodo and sam can safely pass to mount doom and destroy the ring, well before i'm getting to the end of the film i wanna say that one of the most beautiful lines in the trilogy was when aragorn was talking to the army near the balck gate when they saw all the thousands of the orcs marching to battle them and for me it was great coz it showed the ture hero spirit of aragorn after he was such an outsider the whole movie, after everything ended and the ring was finally destroyed and after sam showed once more what true frienship means after he carried frodo up the mountain and pulled him up over the lava pool of mount doom, everything ended sauron was destroyed and then came the 15 mins of whom i gave this movie 10/10, and it was the ending ladies and gentlemen, the beautiful ending, it was so beautiful for all the characters this 15 mins only made me to give this movie 10/10 i was almost crying sitting and watching it, it was simply ultimate of all ending i've ever seen in a movie, there's no way to describe this beautifuly made masterpiece ending sequence, and the huge 15 mins it lasted it brought up memories from the trilogy and it was beautiful to remember, but you will have to watch the film to see what i'm talking about coz this trilogy is definately a must see for every movie lover, Peter Jackson has done a magnificent masterpiece that will be remembered forever and really don't think that a movie will be able to atop this film for years, haven't seen anything so beautiful and deep since "The Godfather", this film definately deserves to be in the top 5 movies the the Top 250 list... for the ones who haven't seen this film yet trust you won't regret it, for the ones who have seen it and didn't like it i hope you will rewatch it and try to understand it deeper to see the true movie magic of it, and for the ones who has seen it and loved as much as i did, way to go people you have a true movie brains :)!
6.0~Decline of Substance Angry_Arguer Sign in Permalink This is your only spoiler warning... What made the first two interesting was how they imitated a minimum of sources. Here, all sorts of minor elements are borrowed from...guess what? The 'Star Wars' trilogy. The elephant charge is from 'Empire'. Troll design comes from the Rancor. The concept of "distorted fathers" is obvious. The romance is from the original 'Star Wars'. Heck, they even throw in the funeral pyre from 'Jedi'! Outside of Lucas' concoction, there are other lesser elements that are liberally stolen from. The siege is shot like 'Starship Troopers' as is Nazgul's death. Eowyn kills the Ringwraith like 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'. The catapult POV is from 'Army of Darkness'. The breed of pleasant music and slow-motion threat? 'Face/Off' Even without looking into other films in the world, there is so much internal referencing that this movie isn't anything new. More elephants, bigger armies, bigger fortresses, another giant monster, it's that simple. The designs here are the weakest of the trilogy, even the makeup and effects aren't impressive anymore. Sound design has degraded to B-movie levels. The characterizations are less advanced this time. Gimli and Legolas are once again comic-relief. They haven't had anything to do since 'Fellowship'. Similarly, Arwen is given more though she wasn't needed in 'Towers' while Blanchett, the best actor in the bunch, is pointlessly used here. Even worse is the level of gloss thrown on everything, something we've been seeing since 'Pearl Harbor'. The gloss will date this series in the same way that we see 'Taxi Driver' as amateurish today. While violence in 'Fellowship' was raw, here it is blurred out either by shaky camera or choppy editing. Cheap. Shore uses more cues from his 'Towers' score and less from his better 'Fellowship' soundtrack. Jackson must still be caught up in the juvenile idea that music tells you how to feel. Shore is smarter than him having worked with smarter directors. Final Analysis = = Midrange Material
10.0~A Grand Finale to the Greatest Movie Trilogy of All Time bburns Sign in Permalink The trouble with most film trilogies, is that part 3 can't possibly live up to the standards of parts 1 & 2. For instance, "Godfather Part III"--despite having a better screenplay than part II--was doomed due to bad acting and poor direction. And "Return of the Jedi" was sabotaged by the presence of Ewoks--who served no useful function in the plot--and by a hackneyed ending. Not only does "LOTR: Return of the King" avoid these pitfalls, it is actually superior to the first two installments. The main thing I liked about this movie was the way the city of Minas Tirith was presented as a city whose buildings, streets and battlements were all carved out of a mountainside. Although the city was shown several times throughout the movie, I was awestruck each time it was shown. I also really liked the CGI effects (and this goes for the whole trilogy). I know that most of the visual effects were CGI, but I rarely *saw* that they were CGI (the only exception being the beacon bonfires; you can't set that much wood on fire without any smoke). But visual flash alone wasn't what made this movie for me. There was also the fact that all the characters were 3-dimensional even in this shortened theatrical release. In "The Two Towers" you only got that from the extended DVD edition. Particularly, I liked John Noble as Demethor, the leader of the most powerful free country in Middle Earth who is done in by his mad lust for control and utter refusal to take his allies' advice or make sensible war plans (one wonders if Peter Jackson & co were making a comment on the current leader of New Zealand's most powerful ally). The only problem I had with this movie was the overlong epilogue. And given the epic nature of the trilogy, I am not about to hold that against the film. The greatest movie trilogy of all time deserves to have an auspicious ending, and "The Return of the King" is just that. 10 out of 10.
10.0~Best One bisconerfamily Sign in Permalink I was a little nervous about being disappointed with ROTK. I thought it was going to be like Two Towers. I was on the edge of my seat during the entire movie. It went by really quickly for me. I really enjoyed it and felt it was the best of the three.
7.0~Good but should have stayed truer to the book primevalsoup Sign in Permalink This is a great film and a massive achievement. Well done to the Jackson Team for bringing Lord of the Rings to the big screen and doing it very well. There was an alteration to the story that upset me but does not seem to bother anyone else I know so for most people in the world this film probably qualifies for an 8, 9 or 10. Spoiler below I've read the books (twice) and the content covered in this film includes my favourite moment in the books: During the battle outside the city of Gondor, things are looking very bleak for the good guys. They are holed up in the city, the gate is broken down and Ring Wriath number one starts smack talking with Gandalf. The Riders of Rohan turn up and distract the Ring Wriath King and he goes back to his bird creature - no Orcs get into the city. The riders turn up and do really well but(following the King's death etc which plays out pretty much the same) the new King, King Eomer, realises that they're all still stuffed but resolves to fight on to the death honourably. THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE is this moment, when the battle turns in favour of the good guys. it relates to the UNDEAD people. Aragorn turns up with the ships, having conquered them from the pirates. IN THE BOOK Aragorn had used the undead people from under the Mountain to capture the ships. That is all they do. It is not even established if they are invulnerable or not. Anyway, the ships that arrive at the battle outside Minas Tirith/Gondor are carrying soldiers who were recruited from along the river by Aragorn. Therefore in the book it is Humans and elves and a few dwarfs that risk their lives and finally prevail. IN THE FILM the ships are still carrying the UNDEAD INVINCIBLE people. They are like a super specialised weaponised virus/nerve gas agent that wipes out all the orcs and saves everyone (though despite this Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to risk their lives anyway - mostly to look cool I think). Why does this matter? It just takes away a lot of the emotional investment in my opinion. When there are characters fighting for their lives in a desperate battle, one really feels for them in their situation. When they actually win one feels part of the victory - these characters overcame the terrible obstacles and all the suffering etc was worth it. When the undead people win the battle, it just doesn't feel like the good guys really did it. It's like they cheated. If Aragorn had turned up with special anti Orc Nerve Gas, then the fate of the battle was already determined the moment he had got hold of it. Therefore the emphasis of the story should have centred around the acquisition of this nerve gas. The battle could have raged while Aragorn and co battled ridiculous odds to get the gas, killing Balrogs singlehandedly etc. Then once secured, the transport to the field would have been in the knowledge that so long as they arrived in time everything would be OK. If this were the case, Aragorn would have commandeered a few more riders from Theoden for his quest for nerve gas and the purpose of the other Riders going to the battlefield would have been a delaying tactic (like the subsequent assault upon Mordor by the allies). In both book and film getting help from the dead was like a short side story and relatively little significance seemed to be placed on it. The consequences of this 'little extra help' is out of proportion. Apologies for this rant on a subject which most people would not even notice existed. The absence of the reckoning of the Shire - well that was a great part of the book but an acceptable omission. It would have been a great incentive to buy the extended version if it was in there. Unfortunately it was not. And the end did seem to drag on, but then maybe if I had not read the books it would have seemed like an appropriate dragging on.
10.0~An Epic fantasy adventure ever made aman-ismail Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson one director, one trilogy amazing combination, A Director who made us live each and every moment of the LOTR, No one could have made it better. the whole cast and crew was lucky enough to be a part of such an amazing journey and delivered world class performance, Frodo(Elijah Wood) is just too good as an hobbit carrying the burden of the ring, Gandalf ( Ian McKellen) is just unimaginably powerful, Aragorn ( viggo mortensen ) being the king of minas tirith is too awesome to resist, the other character like Legolas and Gimli the old rivalry turned friendship is fun to watch. overall a movie made once and can never be made again and shall stay that way for long years to come in fact words fall short writing a review about such an epic fantasy adventure. I wish there was 11 to vote...
10.0~M.A.G.N.F.I.C.E.N.T Adeir Sign in Permalink I almost cried when "The End" appeared on the screen. As was the case with the former two parts, this one is again a movie that has it all: story, actors, characters, emotion, action, scenery, music, effects, cinematography... Everything wonderfully done with great respect for the viewer, whether that one read LOTR or not. You can't comment on ROTK alone, you have to see the movies as a whole. And in that light LOTR is without any doubt the future classic motion picture for the twenty-first century (and beyond). I don't think I will enjoy cinema this much in all the years to come, unless I lower my standards. Fantastic.
10.0~The Film of the Century alejo2k Sign in Permalink When I refer to this as the film of the century I'm talking about the whole trilogy, because that's what it really is, just as it was a single big book before its big screen treatment. I think anyone can write volumes about how great the film is in every aspect: acting, script, photography, costumes, special FX, etc. I think it's a waste of words because the film speaks for itself in all its spectacular grandeur. Nothing that can be said would describe it accurately. Just go see it if you haven't. It is sure to be a real classic that will be talked about for many decades to come, and the reason is very simple: it has no time, no space. It is all about one message, one of good overcoming evil, and friendship, and unity between all the peoples in the world, therefore there will always be need for these stories and they will never fade from our minds -to quote the film- as long as there's good in this world that's worth fighting for.
10.0~Why Movies Are Great. JackBauerPowerHour Sign in Permalink The anticipation for this was huge. Alot of people, including me were expecting this to be a classic just like the first two were. So does this deliver. Well duh, of course it does. Epic films come and go. Since the dawn of moviemaking, man has tryed to create the perfect filmgoing experience, usually through a big budget and a huge premise. Some films have succeed like the Star Wars which all amazing, But other films basically, you realize that they lack the main ingredient of a film: heart. "The Lords of The Rings: The Return of the King" is the third and final chapter of JRR Tolkien's masterpiece about hobbits, men, dwarves, and elves fighting for the future of their home, Middle-Earth. There are two ways to rate "LOTR:ROTK". One is rating the film. other is rating the trilogy as a whole. THE FILM: Peter Jackson continues to amaze. The former horror director is now a certified genius. He presents the tale in a bold, exciting way, and we watch, with our jaws at our feet. While some fans may be dissapointed because some important things were lefted out from the books. As the previous two, the camera work is just wonderful, cinematography is breathtaking and Howard Shore's musical score is superb. PJ makes the wise choice of using visual effects to help tell the story. The effects are probably the best I have ever seen. Using a combination of real location(shot in New Zealand) and computer effects, Jackson creates a world so lifelike and fantastic, that we believe we are seeing another world, not just our world changed. On those effects: Gollum, quite possibly the most remarkabled special effect ever, not because of how realistic it is(he is very realistic), but how emotional he is. Andy Serkis was on set as Gollum every day. He spoke Gollum's lines, he did his movement, he made his facial expressions, basically everything. visual effects are make-up. The real movie magic is in the performance, which is just awesome. The acting is also very good. Everyone delivers, especially Sean Astin(who I still can't believe wasn't even nominated for an oscar). He transformed Sam from a shy hobbit to a loyal, courageous warrior. He truly takes center stage in this movie. He was truly robbed. THE TRILOGY: In one word: Brilliant. Overall:LOTR truly lived up to the massive hype and it deserved all the awards it got. The second greatest film of all-time, Flawless, Absorbing, Spectacular, Masterpiece, A Classic, an achivement beyond words. EVERYTHING IS JUST PERFECT. JRR Tolkien would be proud. Can't wait for the DVD. 10/10 and A++
10.0~One of the best Films. Qty2378 Sign in Permalink I have found myself sitting in the audience to see LOTR's Return of the King about 5 times. It was a surprising film. The music was amazing. The actors were very into the character. It was like the book. I would have liked to see Saruman in this 3rd part especially but I will be seeing him in the extended version. Peter Jackson was the perfect man for these 3 movies. I really didn't mind the 4 hours I spent sitting there because it was a master piece. I couldn't believe it was over. The ending was better than I expected it was amazing. I saw myself crying (yes crying). I gave it a 10 because it was the best. The performance Viggo Mortensen gave was extraordinary. A real king I thought. Elijah Wood signed up for the best role of his life. He gave it his all and I was really impressed. Very good movie go see it once or twice. Gollum was a great accomplishment. It was all amazing.
10.0~Come on, people, it was the end of the line!!! RiffRaffMcKinley Sign in Permalink Yes, it tests your bottom. Yes, it gets sentimental, boring, and weird, but how could you not enjoy this movie? (If you follow the movie law of averages, 60 bad minutes out of a 200-minute movie still equals a really good 140-minute movie). Truthfully, when I watch the DVD, I do skip through all those parts with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum (except in the tower of Cirith Ungol-- "Not if I stick you first!"). However, it was really stunning and it had an almost inspiring ethereal mist about it. Also, if you watch it on DVD for the first time, the extended version is definitely what you should start off on if you plan to go back and watch the original theatrical as well (they cut a few minor, but good, things out). To the point, this movie is certainly something Tolkien would have had positive things to say about. And isn't that why filmmakers turn books into movies in the first place?
10.0~The GREATEST film ever made tbass2k Sign in Permalink The bottom line is this....for all the nitpicking about this movie, for all the minor complaints that a person might have, a movie couldn't be more perfect than this movie. Return of the King is a movie dream come true for me.
9.0~A great movie with lots lots lots of action lucasesmeijer Sign in Permalink This movie is perfect as a end of a great franchise! The plot continues perfectly and the battle scenes are better than before. I still think that The Two Towers is the best LOTR, but this one is of great quality too. All the actors really show everything they can and together with all the great visual effects, this is a movie to remember for the rest of my life. I really think everyone should have seen this movie and the other films by the end of their lives. I cannot stop saying how much I enjoyed this movie. I rate this movie 9 out of 10 because its just one of the best movies I have ever seen. Some people told me to rate it 10 out of 10, but of course, there is no perfect movie.
10.0~LOTR ROTK Review Al_The_Strange Sign in Permalink After the last two Lord of the Rings films, the journey of so many heroes has come so far, and it all leads up to this. Darkness falls upon all of Middle-Earth. Huge armies of orcs march upon the kingdoms of men. The One Ring comes closer to its evil master. Could this be the end of the world, or the start of a new beginning? This final chapter in the film series starts off with an incredibly moving sequence: the heartbreaking tale of Gollum's origins. From the on, it picks right back up where the last films left off, chronicling the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they tread in dark and dangerous territory, combating orcs, one giant spider, and ultimately themselves as they approach the threshold of Mount Doom. At the same time, the film presents some of the biggest and most epic scenes ever committed to film: the Battle of Minas Tirith. It is a huge spectacle that fills up the entire screen with thousands and thousands of orcs, men, war machines, lumbering beasts, Nazgûl, cavalry, massive elephants, and even ghosts. It is a long struggle that fills up most of the movie's runtime, but it's always awe-inspiring. As if that's not enough, the film then brings the battle to the gates of Mordor, for one grand climax. Even in the calm before each battle, the film remains as captivating as its predecessors, thanks to its style and storytelling prowess. If there's anything to truly complain about, it would be the lengthy denouement. Overall, however, the experience of The Return of the King has never failed to invoke feelings of awe. At this point, the characters of the film are well-established and intimately familiar, but the film does take its time to explore more of the familiar faces and elaborate on fresh new characters. They all come together to contribute to the multiple conflicts, tying every strand of the plot to one epic climax; it's a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant, and provides satisfying closure all around. Many liberties are taken from the original novels, but for the big screen, it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. Themes of war, corruption, addiction, good and evil, and adventure all prevail. As before, this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. All the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles (especially Viggo Mortensen, who stands out more in this film than before, but it is always a pleasure to watch Ian McKellen as Gandalf, along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies). Writing is superb. This production boasts some excellent sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are huge; at its time, it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. Despite aging a bit, the effects are still impressive. Howard Shore's music score is as masterful as ever. Return of the King delivers the best possible payoff for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (and it might even outshine the Hobbit saga in the end). Not only does it boast some of the biggest battles, but it is also a film with power and beauty. It has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites (was my number-one favorite for quite a few years), and the Lord of the Rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle, storytelling, and style. If you watch the Extended Edition of this film, you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes, which offers a lot of excellent substance. Among the additions, there are longer battle scenes, a scene showing the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue, an extended encounter with the Army of the Dead, a parley with the Mouth of Sauron, and more. I think most of these scenes are really awesome, and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing. 5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)
10.0~this is what filmmaking is all about babydiva_2000 Sign in Permalink What can I say? This is the best movie EVER. Watching it only reminds me why I decided to go into filmmaking. I mean, I'm so jealous of everyone who was able to participate in the making of the trilogy. There is nothing I wouldn't give to have been able to be a part of this masterpiece. I know that one day, you all will be seeing my name on works of art such as this one. I was moved, drawn in, my heart raced, I mean, almost every emotion within me was experienced while watching the movie. There is little more that I can say about this movie. It was just amazing...breathe takeing...REALLY DAMN GOOD. It will put up stiff competition for the OSCAR for best picture this year. That's all I can say. WOW!
10.0~The village burning and the eagles, what do they mean? DawnofEarendil Sign in Permalink Okay, so in the EE there is a new scene when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli come out of the dead city and they see this village burning and the boats leaving at the bottom of the hill. Aragorn gets down on his knee and starts to cry. Is that where he is from or what is the significance of the village? I was thinking that that is where he is from since it is said that he is from someone around there. Also, what is the significance of the eagles at the last battle? Pippin or Merry(cannot remember) says, "Look the eagles." I do not recall either of the hobbits ever encountering the eagles. So what is the significance of them?
10.0~Differs from the book, but it's perfect! Arsenicem Sign in Permalink I was really hoping that they could make the last movie a worthy ending. And they really succeeded. It might differ a bit from the book, but I think that really was all for the better. This is a brilliant movie and an fantastic ending to the trilogy. Well done to all who were involved in making it. All the scene's are fantastic in every way, from the battle scene's to ceremonies, it's overpowering. When you finally step out of the cinema you'll be realizing your back in reality.
10.0~The Best Movie Ever leopovoas Sign in Permalink This is the best movie ever made, it is a masterpiece. I wish i could thank Peter Jackson to just tell him how much of a masterpiece this movie is. It is the movie that inspired me to make movies and it is my favorite movie. Unless you don't understand the story you will like it. The whole trilogy is worth watching, but this one is the best, even though it is really hard to decide. Peter Jackson is the best director I've ever seen and this looks like this is going to be the best movie for a long time. I don't know how you can not like lord of the rings but I'm guessing it is cause people don't understand the story and get bored of it because its too long, but trust me, stop reading this and buy the whole trilogy and then buy the whole trilogy's extended edition.
10.0~If it doesn't win the Oscar - the Academy's a joke! nancy-54 Sign in Permalink Granted - I'm a bit biased - I love Tolkien and believe Jackson has done justice to the series. However, I believe that anyone who sees this last film in the trilogy will marvel at its fluidity, wonder at its marvelous scenary and special effects - and more importantly - fall in love with the world that Tolkien and Peter Jackson have created. Though this is a lengthy movie - I never once "felt" the length during the viewing at the theater. The acting was marvelous, the editing superb! I had tears in my eyes within the first hour simply because of the magnitude of what Jackson has done. I can harldy wait until next year when the extended DVD comes out. My husband and I are huge movie fans - and I believe this is truly one of the best movies I have ever laid eyes on. It deserves the Oscar and I would recommend anyone who loves a good movie to go see this - in the theater - and without delay.
10.0~The best Middle-Earth saga movie (Very little spoilers) t-viktor212 Sign in Permalink The Return of the King stands as one of the best LOTR, Tolkien-based and fantasy movies of all time. First of all, it's the only LOTR movie that doesn't feel too long even in its extended edition. It keeps you excited literally for all the 4 hours of lenght of the film. I think having an extended edition of return of the king is partly compulsory, because it has added some scenes that are important for the continuity of the whole story (E.g.: Saruman's fate). Secondly, I felt that CG was very much improved since the previous film. Here, CG creatures felt much more real than in "The Two Towers". Overall, this movie certainly deserves being one of the films with most Oscars ever, it just deserved all of them!
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King WubsTheFadger Sign in Permalink Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger The third and finale film in The Lord of the Rings series is the best. Peter Jackson left the best for last in this epic of all epics. The scale of the film is huge and the battles and set pieces are massive. This film is a masterpiece that needs to be experienced. The ending is touching and brought chills. The acting is once again amazing. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Bernard Hill, Bruce Hopkins, Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, and David Wenham are all amazing. I have to stress once again that they are also perfectly cast in this film. The pacing and runtime is perfect. The battles in this film are grand, spectacular, and massive. Pros: Amazing story throughout all three films, a wonderful and touching ending, amazing acting, perfect casting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and the battles are amazing Cons: None at all Overall Rating: 10
10.0~The trilogy to end all trilogies SlyGuy21 Sign in Permalink The only trilogy that even comes close to this is the original Star Wars trilogy. A perfect example of an adaption being made by the right people, at the right time, for the right reasons. A modern Hollywood epic that I don't think will ever be matched. Each film in this trilogy is stunning in it's own way. The characters mature and change as the films go on, it's paced perfectly, it's edited perfectly, the special effects still hold up to this day. There are still scenes, and lines of dialogue that give me goosebumps when I think about them. It's not a perfect adaptation of the books, but it's still so engaging, so timeless, so grand in scale that it really doesn't matter. Everyone involved in this could have retired afterwards, as an exclamation point to the end of their careers. It destroyed the Oscars as if they were nothing. All three films combine into one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the 21st Century, if not all time. Absolutely phenomenal, it honestly brings me to tears in some cases when I think about just how freakin' good this trilogy is.
10.0~Awesome gandalfwiz10 Sign in Permalink When I first saw the Fellowship of the Ring, I was amazed, especially by the special effects, makeup, and cinematography. Ever since then, the world of Lord of the Rings has sucked me in like an unusually powerful vacuum. The richness of the world and characters is amazing. The best thing is, I find the movies just as good as the books, which are one of the best I've ever read. The story is mostly the same, but it is tweaked here and there. The way Peter Jackson arranged everything is absolutely amazing. The acting is superb, Elijah Wood is continually the vulnerable Frodo and Sean Astin the ever loyal gardener. Ian McKellan shows exactly why he IS Gandalf. Viggo Mortenson is the best hero I've seen. Legolas is plain cool. Gimli is full of laughs. Perfect. Absolutely amazing. The story however is the real winner, which shows why it won 11 Academy Awards. Peter Jackson knew well enough than to mess it up. He is an amazing director. You will find that it the final part of the movie, you will be awed and amazed. The special effects trump everything I've ever seen, the cinematography and makeup is stunningly real. This movie is a winner for all that, but a reason also why it is even more than than is because of how hard it is to translate a book at complex and lengthy and loved as Lord of the Rings into a movie that will come up to everybody's standards. It was the perfect translation from book to screen. That is something I have never seen done so well, from such a book like Lord of the Rings. A visual masterpiece of epic proportions. The only thing annoying is the aftermath of everything. It stretches a bit too long. Overall though, it is easily the best movie I have ever had the pleasure to see.
8.0~An exceptional film that went on just a touch too long scooby-drew Sign in Permalink It seems churlish to find fault with such a visually superb film and engrossing film, but there was at least half-an-hour at the end which could really have ended up on the cutting room floor without anyone noticing. But now I feel bad for criticising the last part of what will go down as one of the finest film trilogies to be made in my lifetime.
10.0~FilmCreature Reviews 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' FilmCreature Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is the spectacular finale to the already fantastic first two movies in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This one is the best. Aragorn takes the lead role this time, as he faces his destiny to become the king of Gondor. Gollum (motion-captured Andy Serkis) is becoming a big problem for Sam (Sean Astin), as Frodo is beginning to trust the creature more than Sam himself. And Pippin (Billy Boyd) pledges his allegiance to Denethor (John Noble), the crabby and evil stand-in leader of Gondor. Denethor doesn't have the best attitude in the world, such as when he tries to burn his own son alive. The ending is very long, but it isn't bad. The entire movie is riveting, magical cinema, and I ate up every minute of it. The Return of the King is a masterpiece, and of course it grossed hundreds of millions no doubt (more than that, actually). 4/4
10.0~"Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?" ackstasis Sign in Permalink For the past week, I'd been pining to complete my rewatch of "The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)," viewing the films for the first time in years. This wait, however arduous, was nothing compared to the 360 days I originally endured between 'The Two Towers (2002)' and 'The Return of the King (2003).' The drought came to an end on December 26, 2003: I remember the exact date because it was the first night of release, and I'd been counting down for the past year. We bought our tickets weeks in advance, waited in line for over an hour, and my brother emptied a packet of jelly lollies over the row in front of us while trying to get the damn packet open. And so it is that Peter Jackson's trilogy-to-end-all-trilogies finally came to a close, in truly spectacular fashion. With the armies of Mordor marching on Minas Tirith, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must recruit the aid of alternative reinforcements if the land of Gondor, ruled by the callous steward Denethor (John Noble), is not to fall before the Great Eye of Sauron. Meanwhile, this epic conflict is contrasted against the image of two little hobbits, Frodo and Sam, dutifully trundling across the wastelands of Mordor, two innocuous Halflings carrying the weight of a million men. Once again, the film excels at these stunning contrasts. The death of Denethor, a powerful, intimate moment of self-realisation, unexpectedly bridges into the Battle for Minas Tirith, the loss of one man suddenly absorbed into the slaughter of thousands. A word of warning: arachnophobics should be weary of Frodo's excursion into Shelob's Lair, a magnificent work of grotesquerie visual effects, topped only by the "insect pit" in Jackson's own 'King Kong (2005).' Andy Serkis, as the computer-generated Gollum, once again brings pathos and fragility into the role of the tormented former Ring-bearer. 'The Return of the King' has perhaps the most unforgettable final hour I've ever seen, as the fate of all that is good comes down to a scrappy scuffle on the edge of a fiery precipice, this one-on-one conflict somehow more "epic" than the entire Battle of Helms Deep. But Peter Jackson isn't done yet. While excising Tolkien's somewhat anti-climactic "Scouring of the Shire," he nevertheless brings the trilogy to a graceful, and wonderfully satisfying, close, his leisurely winding-down approach doing justice to one of the richest fantasy sagas ever told.
10.0~Outstanding! xxrotini Sign in Permalink Jackson transfers the spirit of Tolkien (in movie form) onto the big screen. Serkis is incredible as Gollum, Wood (and the makeup he wears has he becomes more weary) portrays the struggle of burdening the ring beautifully, and the end of the action is sped up but still done to a T. I do not mind the inconsistencies, and people who complain of multiple endings shouldn't be angry: Jackson used about 1/20 of Tolkien's ending, and I was very grateful he cut this short. The quest to destroy the Ring is of utmost importance and Jackson transferred Tolkien's vision to the big screen. Jackson has a time limit, unlike Tolkien who could be as sentimental as he wanted to be without a page limit. 10/10, 4 stars, all my thumbs up, what have you. I went in expecting the greatest trilogy/action/fantasy/adventure movie of all time and left with all these--the power of all three, the beauty of the battle, the mystical creatures and settings, and the wonder of their peril--being fulfilled.
7.0~A Good Movie but Not as Great as The Hype Valyrae Sign in Permalink This is a good movie. There is no question about this fact. Many people however are getting over-crazed with the praise. This film is lacking a few things which prevent it from being fantastic, including: Saruman is NEVER in this film leaving a huge gap in the plot (they simply say he's lost all his power). The final two battles are virtually back to back with all the scenes with the Mouth of Sauron removed making it seem anti-climactic. The last 30 minutes are slightly cheesy and dull making people wonder when the movie will end. Arwen is again edited rather badly making her whole purpose and decision confusing for non-die hard fans. The CGI is generally fantastic but during the Minas Tirith battle, some of the shots of warriors being felled by arrows were so clearly computer generated that some audience members started laughing. The orc army that's flanked Aragorn's final army just seems to go away after the fall of Sauron. The army attacking from the front fall into the ground but the flanking forces just dissapear with no mention of them. The attacking Dead Army overrun the orcs at Minas Tirith in 20 seconds then are gone. Again, a bit anti-climactic.
9.0~The best trilogy ever made. cmivie Sign in Permalink When I first learned that the LOTR trilogy was going to be made, I was very excited. I had waited a long time for it. But, then I heard that a guy named Peter Jackson was directing and I became worried. I thought that New Line made a mistake in hiring Jackson because he was only known for horror films and he had never had a hit film. Well, I was wrong. Peter Jackson has given us the best trilogy ever made. Yes, LOTR is better than Star Wars (episodes 4,5 &6). So, is ROTK better than Two Towers? No. Is it better than Fellowship? No. However, I am sure that many feel that ROTK is the best of all three and I really couldn't argue with that. But to me, Fellowship is the best, but Two Towers and ROTK are very a very close second and third. ROTK has an epic battle scene that you must see to believe. It is so amazing that I will gurantee you that ROTK will win an oscar for special effects. The acting is once again solid, and Sean Astin does need to receive an Oscar nod for his performance in ROTK. I won't put anything in here to spoil it for anyone. Just go see this movie and enjoy the three plus hours.
10.0~Utterly fantastic!!!! ranneh Sign in Permalink This movie has to be the best ever film made out of Hollywood. Not many people at the start of this trilogy of films would believe it was made in Wellington, New Zealand. Peter Jackson, a kiwi himself, has made many movies in his time and with the help of the cast and crew, has made this his most popular and successful one yet. He knew the book and is a huge fan of Tolkien's work, so this film was going to be a handful filled with so much action and battle, but I feel he has made one great job, and has proved that some things aren't impossible. Unfortunately, I haven't read the books myself, so I don't know what has been missed out or added to make this movie. But from what I have heard from fans of the books, its not a bad copy. "The Return of the King" has got to be my favourite out of them all, for the fact it has everything- action, romance and every now and then a bit of comedy. Jackson must have thought hard about who was going to play what part and how he wanted it played, and I cannot see any other actors in the roles- they are PERFECT! All that's left to say is that these films are the best made ever!!!!
6.0~Enough already sommerjd Sign in Permalink I'm exhausted. This is one long, long, loooooong movie. The major siege--once more against an unpronounceable, impregnable fortress--is absolutely spectacular visually. The problem is that the movie drags on for another 45 minutes or more after that with at least 4 scenes that appear to be the conclusion only to be followed by yet another final scene. Here's the problem: Clearly LOTR, unreadable as it was, has made an indelible impact on all epics that have followed. But because this definitive film version hasn't been released until now, the movie appears to be derivative of other films that are actually borrowing from this source. I understand that "Star Wars," for example, certainly echoes LOTR, but because it got there first, the stuff we're seeing here is familiar (a knighted British actor of some repute plays the Gandalf/Obi Wan role; the Gollum is as obnoxious as Yoda and speaks similarly; the oversized attack elephants are simply flesh and blood versions of the AT-ATs; the furry dwarf sidekick serves as comic relief akin to Chewbacca; the two secondary Hobbits parallel R2 and Threepio, etc. ). So Peter Jackson has an insoluble problem: if he sticks to the books, which apparently he has from what I gather, much of what he shows us will echo things that have been influenced by this original source. However, they still seem overly familiar (e.g. how many times do we have to see characters "die" only to reappear later on?). And if he abandons the books, the fans of the books will object. But then these movies are basically designed to appeal to the 14-year-old boy in all of us, and they do accomplish that. The critics seem enthralled by the films, but then most film critics were once 14-year-old boys, weren't they?
10.0~A fitting conclusion for a fantastic epic! lols802 Sign in Permalink Frodo is struggling to control the power of the ring and poor Sam is feeling the grunt of it while Gollum/Smeagol is still under suspicion. The rest of the Fellowship prepare for the war that threatens Middle-Earth. These are perilous times... As I sat in the cinema I would not allow my eyes to blink in the fear for missing anything. In some movies this suggests that the story is too busy and confusing, but Peter Jackson is able to do it without it becoming too overwhelming. Many people may not feel the need to go watch this because of its length. but I assure you I never felt the time, all I was worried about was seeing the special effects, scenery, plot thickening and the characters :-) I give this movie a 10 (it deserves it) but I feel that it does not tie up all endings and in parts it certainly does not follow the book, but I don't care, I just got to see 1 story & read another. It will definitely be sad not to follow the characters on any more adventures. Over the 3 years it has become a tradition to go watch LOTR. But ROTK is a movie that can be treasured forever and I do not regret watching these films. I just hope everyone out there who has not watched them, takes a chance to put their feet up and have fun riding the emotional rollercoaster! You don't know what you're missing.
10.0~wow....WOW SamuriKnight Sign in Permalink What can I say other than the movie was completely awesome. And was better than the 1st and 2nd one combined!!! Deffinitely worth seeing in the theater multiple times! The movie stayed very true to the book, except for a few minor things that just could not be put in because of the time it would have taken to do so. Like Saruman was not in it at all....but that didn't bother me too much in the grand scheme of things. The movie stayed very true to the characters. This is a must see as soon as possible for any Tolkien fan!
10.0~Unmatched lordofswords Sign in Permalink Even though I have a thirst for movies, Fantasy the top of them, The lord of the rings Trilogy has been the best set of movies that has been created and i think will never be matched. Perfect actors, flawless acting, unbelievable soundtrack,directing and a stead combination of both action and story. The third and last installment, the return of the king is incredible. If i really had to pick one out of the trilogy it would be this one. Peter Jackson truly made J.R.R. Tolkien proud. The scenery is most breathtaking, the creatures all unique, voices and looks of their own. The movies are all interconnected and fill up all gaps leading some people to ask "well what happened to __________ that happened in the last movie?" I know that when i have children i will pass these movies down the generations
10.0~A fitting end to a great trilogy. mhasheider Sign in Permalink The last installment in the LOTR trilogy finally is here and it didn't let me down one bit. Out of the three movies in the series, "The Return of The King" provides a lot of entertainment and excitement for three and a half hours (not to mention worth the price of admission).
8.0~great in many ways; a few flaws JamieWJackson Sign in Permalink (Warning: very mild spoilers) Oh, comments? Maybe people will have some. Like probably thousands on IMDB.com... so I'll be very terse. Visuals and soundtrack: marvelous. Action scenes: very impressive; no complaints. Pacing: a bit too much setup, and definitely too much denouement -- and too drawn out. Acting: very good. Sets: wow. Locations: wow. Dialogue: too melodramatic for me in many places, but not horribly so; some lines hard to hear clearly. Gandalf: cool as always, but he gave me "combat Yoda" flashbacks at times. Dragons: wicked. Giant elephantish creatures: very big. Mad king: quite mad indeed. Integration of CGI and live action: continued flawless with brief periods of brilliance and/or inspiration. Themes: loyalty to a great cause, vividly realized here; power corrupts, also vivid; redemption, a tad overplayed here IMO, but still a trusty theme; the worth of quality friends, well done; heroic battle deeds, bleah, I thought they were too implausible -- but still fun to watch; girls and halflings can fight too, well, OK, I guess that's obligatory these days. Wouldn't want to be sexist or heightist, eh? And finally, Spider: arachnophobes, you will want to see a different movie, or rent this and skip the spider part. TRUST ME. :-) 8/10 (you guys voting 10 need to watch it again in a few months or years; it's great but not perfect)
10.0~Edge-of-the-seat-goodness bugs5382 Sign in Permalink I was very well indulged by the movie preparedness on how it leads the "final" battle for middle earth. Some parts of the movie I did not expect. This is different from the previous two where I could sorta guess what was going to happen next. in my option this "Edge-of-the-seat-goodness" really is true. You must see this. Top movie for sure! 11 out of 10 stars (if I could vote that). :) Good job Peter Jackson!!!
10.0~The ultimate testament to the goodness in humanity TheNabOwnzz Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just a movie, it is a beacon of hope, an array of light, if you will. In more concrete terms, it is quite possibly the greatest film ever made, out of the greatest trilogy ever made. The Return of the King defines the 'magic' of the motion picture arts like no other. This kind of picture is the reason why we watch movies. The emotions going through you as you are experiencing this utter piece of art are quite indescribable, and need to be witnessed first hand. Peter Jackson has created a monument, to be standing tall for years to come, as a motivational piece for humanity. Since there are no new characters that need to be introduced in Return of the King ( Except for Denethor if you haven't watched the extended edition of The Two Towers ), Return of the King focuses solely on Sauron's attempted destruction of Middle-Earth. This is not, however, a weakness, because the character arcs of characters like Pippin, Sam & Aragorn are being developed more than ever in this last entry of the trilogy, resulting in great character changes due to drastic events. The acting is, like the entire trilogy, once again near flawless. Sean Astin & Elijah Wood as Sam & Frodo in particular stand out, while the corruption of the Ring tightens its grip around Frodo, with Sam always being there to save him from it. It is a friendship so real, of which the likes is rarely ever depicted on screen, at least not on this level. The make-up on both hobbits truly makes it look like they have crawled through barren wastelands for months on end, and Sam's melancholy references to the Shire, a forgotten period it seems, are truly as poignant as they come. There is a constant sense of hopelessness in what they are trying to do, but they kept on going anyway, due to an iron will of sorts. It is really this mentality that moves large portions of audiences. The screenplay is ofcourse once again phenomenal. There are many different storylines & character arcs, and to be invested in all of them is truly top notch filmmaking. As i've stated in reviews of the previous films, this is probably also due to Tolkien's superb literature, but the dialogue, the character arcs, it is all perfection. As stated before, in particular Sam's motivational speeches to Frodo are literary masterful, as are the pre-battle speeches of Theoden and Aragorn. One is too short on words to properly compliment Howard Shore's incredible work on this trilogy. The diversity of his score, his use of leitmotifs, the raw emotional power, this is definitely and undisputably one of the greatest scores ever created for motion pictures. It is weird to image the LOTR films without his iconic score, which, for a very large portion, added extreme layers of emotional intensity to this picture. Like the previous entries, Return of the King is once again aesthetically pleasing. There are a couple of sets that might have been average looking, but when you look at the technical marvel of a set that Minas Tirith was, these minor shortcomings can easily be neglected. The shot of Gandalf ascending this titanic city while Shore's score plays is just one of the many examples of the goosebump and emotion inducing ride that Return of the King is. The final shots of Frodo & Sam lying on a rock on mount doom are also some examples of visual beauty. With everything that has happened, and with the constant sense of hopelessness hanging in the air in this particular picture, this whole fictional world truly does seem to be at risk, and there is rarely a film that makes one so firmly root for its protagonist like this one manages to. When Aragorn & Theoden charge after their respective speeches, you wish as you were charging with them, and actually feel like you are doing so. These are some of the most likeable, well developed and complex heroes ever created, and it is sad to leave them for a time ( At least until the next viewing... ). The battle at the black gate, intertwined with Frodo, Sam & Gollum's struggle for the ring, are another marvel of tension filled filmmaking. The slow motion usage in the battle is not there to look 'cool', but to draw out tension and emotion in the audience. The battle sounds fade, and only Shore's melancholy score plays, as if certain characters were meeting their doom in this battle. The fantastic close ups of the facial expressions of our heroes after Sauron is annihilated is of course also a phenomenal kind of acting. The many ending sequences are sometimes falsely criticized, since one has to keep in mind that we have witnessed a life changing story for our characters, and Frodo's inability to cope with a coming back to his previous and normal life further adds another layer to the complexity and the humane message of this film. The coronation, and the setting out for the Grey Havens also result in one of the both most satisfying & sad movie endings ever created. Furthermore, it is the kind of picture that should have no loose ends lying around, as every single character was set up to be something in the end, which is what has happened. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is capable of invoking emotions in audience that are never felt during any other film ever made. It is a genuinely humanist story about hope, brotherhood, friendship, and seeing the good in humanity despite all of its corruption and death. This is ofcourse all very resonant to the real world. Featuring great acting, character development, writing, cinematography & a phenomenal original score, Return of the King is a state of mind instead of a film, and my personal pick for the 'Greatest of all-time'.
1.0~I am glad that the 'rings' are finally over fa7999 Sign in Permalink Stupid movie, already slightly better than the first 2 installations. At least we did not sleep for more than an hour during the show and caught the ending. What's the fuss about these movies? Spectacular views? Well, why not take a tour in Australia and experience the views first hand?
7.0~Its Very Good movie but if some one watch this movie need to be watch previous parts. extraworkformail Sign in Permalink Its Very Good movie but if some one watch this movie need to be watch previous parts. if you watch this part you don't understand movie plot you must watch its previous parts. which was released in 2002 and so on. its adventure and interesting movie. if you want to watch movie for weekend that's you can select this movie.
10.0~Heartrenching....left me breathless. Samilla Sign in Permalink Through all the suffering and sacrifice,.....one moment especially stands out for me. The serene look on Frodo's face at the Grey Havens, he will finally have peace. For all of us who took the journey with him, at last all is well with the fourth age.
10.0~Breath-taking... Awesome... ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!!! BroadswordCallinDannyBoy Sign in Permalink WHAT A MOVIE!!! THE SETS!!! THE MUSIC!!! THE VISUALS!!! THE ACTION!!! An amazing achievement in every sense of the word. The lack of action and slow pace of the The Two Towers is made up for here. The fight with Shelob, the rescue from Cirith Ungol, the Siege of Minas Tirith, the crossing of the plains of Mordor, and the destruction of the RING. ALL HERE!!! All amazing! There can be said nothing negative of this film. I was absolutely blown away in the theater. The Siege was done so well and is one of the best action scenes ever. Also, the end was amazing. The book dragged on a bit with the Shire and Saruman, but none of that is here. The destruction of the Ring destroys all evil, like it should! And the sequence when the Army of Gondor is at the Black Gate and Frodo, with Sam and Smeagol, are in Mount Doom is absolutely jaw dropping. The music, Aragorn's speech (almost like Henry V), and the action are a terrific culmination and serve as a truly breath-taking climax. However the film amazingly well done overall and easily the best out of the trilogy. The crew behind this film worked their butts of as there is no sign of sloppiness. It is all very well done, from beginning to end and it provides an awesome end to a great trilogy. 10/10
10.0~only 10? pdube Sign in Permalink What? I would have given a 12 on this movie... It simply is awesome. When you think that most movies adapted from a book leave some after-taste, like something is missing. With Return of the King, there is no such bad feelings about it. Far from that. It simply is the best movie I've seen with lots of emotions and larger than life scenes that leave you breathless. 12 thumbs up!
10.0~One of the best movies ever made thegodfatherofmoordrecht Sign in Permalink The Return of the king is one of the best movies ever made. It's the best of the three Lord of The Rings movies. The Return of The King is just a brilliant movie, nothing more nothing less. This movie just deserves to win the Academy Award for Best Picture...
10.0~The end of the fellowship, the end of a wonder of the cinematic age. mark-397 Sign in Permalink And so it finally ends. This film is quite simply the most awesome spectacle in the history of cinema. The claim for best film, well that's for each viewer to decide. Fantasy fiction has always been very close to my heart. For me fantasy isn't an escape from reality, it's a dramatic crucible in which we can melt away the mundanity of our lives, to find that shining centre, the bare essence of our humanity. Other viewers may not hold such fantasy landscapes so dear, it's simply a question of taste, of where we are from and where we are going in our lives. If however you have enjoyed the previous two visits to Middle Earth, I can assure you that this final voyage will leave you breathless and awestruck. Peter Jackson and his creative cohorts have crafted their adaptation standing in that uneasy country, between the letter of Tolkien's words and the inescapable demands of the cinematic medium. Some of the depth of the book has been sliced away. These segments have been long discussed across the Internet, I won't detail them here. For me though, this trimming was about finding the shinning heart of Tolkien's work, not slavish and blind devotion. In a number of cases I believe that Jackson's changes have improved upon the books. If you love the book, you must learn to love the film on it's own terms, but love should come easy if your allow yourself to be swept along. I am left though with a depressing thought. Next year at this time, I won't have another excursion to Middle Earth to look forward to, only a shadow falling out of memory and time.
10.0~An epic movie eowynofrohan-2 Sign in Permalink This was a really good movie. Peter Jackson is a great director. He gathered a great cast of actors and actresses. They all played their characters really well. Orlando Bloom is a talented actor as well as the rest of the cast. he is the first person that I have heard of that has gotten a role in a movie straight out of Drama school. I have read all 3 books and they are the best books that i have ever read next to the Harry Potter books. Even though it might not happen i would love to see someone make a movie of these other great J.R.R. Tolkien books.....The Silmarillion and both books of The Lost Tales. If they do end up making them i hope they get Peter Jackson to direct at least one of them. I look forward to seeing more movies directed by Peter Jackson.
10.0~A true spectacle with an emotional depth. John9173 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a spectacle in every sense of the word. Its climatic battles, with much going on, will at times make your jaw drop in awe. In the first hour or so, I really was beginning to wonder what the praise for this movie was all about. But as soon as the battle at the Pelennor Fields really began to kick in, I was then falling in love with this movie. I have not read the books, but I think that makes for a benefit in a way. I could not judge it against Tolkien's work, so it allowed me to enjoy it more. Sean Astin deserves an Oscar for his performance. His dedication to Frodo and his mission as the brave Sam is heart-breaking. On the slopes of Mount Doom is where his stunning performance really shines. He is one of the reasons The Return of the King has an emotional side. The emotional depth of this movie is quite stunning. The ending of the movie, when the ring is finally destroyed, swept me away. The music kicks in in full force, thanks to Howard Shore, and the hobbits become heroes as Sauron and his dominion are destroyed. All is at peace, and it is a beautiful thing to see. This movie has it all: climatic battles, excellent performances, and an emotional depth. It is the best movie of the year, and concludes the Lord of the Rings trilogy with a bang. This trilogy might just be the best trilogy ever made, largely due to this final part. It makes me wonder whether I'll be seeing something put to film as entertaining and enthralling as this in the rest of my lifetime. Thank you Tolkien. Thank you Peter Jackson. Rating: 10/10 (excellent)
10.0~An incredible experience! Logansneo Sign in Permalink There are a very few films that have the ability to captivate and utterly involve you in them in such a way that allows you to forget about anything else except what is occuring on screen. Rarely in my life, and certainly not frequently in my adult life, have I been completely swept away by such an immersive and brilliant tellling of a tale as the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been so able to do. But with the release of the final chapter in the series here, this stunning series comes full circle, and I am left feeling more satisfied leaving a theater than I have ever before in my life! I know that everyone want's to know how good Return of the King is, but I don't want to limit my vision to this one amazing film because it doesn't do it justice to limit my perception to the final chapter without including the two previous brilliant works in the series. I feel that Return of the King takes the glorious foundation and inner structure that Fellowship and Two Towers had laid out and builds the most epic film series of all time! The truest, greatest realization of an absolutely moving literary masterpiece!
10.0~2 thumbs and 2 big toes up! bawagner Sign in Permalink This is the single best movie I have ever seen. I give it 2 thumbs and 2 big toes up! I can't wait until the extended edition comes out and I'll just sit on my butt and watch all 3 extended editions back to back. The only thing that I have to say to Peter Jackson is, "PLEASE MAKE THE HOBBIT!" I want to see the battle of five armies.
10.0~Wow Bradd06 Sign in Permalink This movie was simply stunning, I'm not sure if I'll ever again see such a powerful, while at the same time soft touching movie. It combines the emotional aspects of Fellowship with the battle effects of Two Towers, in a cinematic masterpiece. Jackson has outdone himself. I don't mean to idolize, but this'll be on I'll talk about for weeks to come. I'm planning on seeing it several more times. The downfall, it's the last, sadly concluding this epic. Does anyone know if they're planning to do The Hobbit? To end this, I can't express within the limits, my gratitude and love towards this movie. Can't wait for the extended dvd! This movie gets a 10!
10.0~Can you judge this film on its own? rannoch1 Sign in Permalink Having waited a year, I went to see this at the best movie theatre in the area...and WOW! The power of this film was breathtaking. The question that everyone asks of course...which is best, one, two or three. Now that I have seen three I find I cannot answer this. Of course on technical or artistic merit one can look for flaws or excellence...but that is not to judge this overall. For me, Return of the King completes something very special, and the awesome nature of it is created, especially by Two Towers. Indeed having seen RotK, Two Towers suddenly seems a better movie. So none are best, they are collectively one of the greatest films ever made. Hail to Peter Jackson and his team... ...one lingering thought - I wonder if Peter Jackson has the vision and capability to unravel the great tale of Dune!
4.0~Confusing kimpalonen Sign in Permalink It had the same issue as the last three Harry Potter movies. They were entirely too catered to an audience that had read the books, which by now are complicated AND confusing. Lord of the Rings has it's own share of autistic males naming their pets after hobbits and playing the role play games, but this movie is simply not aging very well.
10.0~absolutely amazing experience. sherwinmarshall_7 Sign in Permalink This movie has everything the final chapter of a trilogy needs it is absolutely amazing in every single aspect that i am finding it tough to even find one fault in it. The acting was astonishing right down to the all the bad ugly looking creatures,absolutely amazing special effects and Peter Jackson deserves one big round of applause for this filming masterpiece. In this movie Frodo and Sam(Astin and Wood) did amazing jobs considering to their roles and kept their friendship going and merry and pippin also played their roles amazingly well when they were handed bigger roles in this third and final installment of the trilogy.Bloom,Davies Reprised their roles exceedingly well and there is no movie at all without Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen).he did everything possible needed of him and he met each and every one of those expectations great job done their. Ian Mckellen also does a very good job and there was no movie if it was not for the special effects the battles were astonishing in this movies which makes me want to keep watching the movie over and over again. All said and done this is the finishing touch to an absolute masterpiece and the final block of the puzzle to The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.The acting was made to perfection and if i was given the chance i will praise this movie over and over again together with the previous two movies. This movie provides entertainment to every person around and it deserves the credit it gets. Overall i will give this movie a 10/10. An unforgettable masterpiece in my opinion.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) - My Precious, This is a Masterful Final Chapter! nickmesafilms Sign in Permalink Finally, after a series of magical books by J.R.R. Tolkien, and after the first two movies in a series that redefined cinema, "The Lord of the Rings" series finally comes to a close, with "The Return of the King". I'm so pleased to be saying the following words. This movie is not just the best in this magical series, but it's also mostly one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. The final story picks up where "The Two Towers" left off, where Frodo and Sam are still traveling to Mordor, while Gollum might set them in a trap to capture the ring at last. Then, Gandalf and the gang are still trying to defeat the wrath of Sauron, and finally be able to destroy this deadly ring. Thanks to the incredible masterful directing by Peter Jackson, and thousands of artists and technicians, they all help us dig deeper into this magical world that, only at the movies, we can be able to escape to. The performances are just brilliant and electrifying to watch on screen. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just brilliant, continuing their roles as Frodo and Sam, and they still have a lot of heart and soul into their on-screen friendship. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen improves once again with fine and brilliant performances. But out of all that, it's Andy Serkis that should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2003, for his work as Gollum. Serkis has portrayed such a brilliant character, and the visual enhancements made to create him was all quite super. From an opening flashback involving Smeagol (a.k.a. Gollum) that's super thrilling, to a final setback, Gollum is by far the best character in this movie. Although this movie is set during a long 200 minute run-time, I was just distracted for what this movie had to offer, that I didn't care about how long it was. It has everything you'd expect to see. It's got heartbreak, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and magic. The special effects are exhilarating, from beginning to end, and it made me wanting for more. The beautiful art direction and costumes made me feel like I escaped to a more beautiful place. The cinematography is challenging in such perfection, and the original score is really with a treat. I also adored the wonderful sound effects, and the memorable film editing. The love stories are touching, the friendship scenes are heartwarming, the fight scenes are groundbreaking, and the finale blends with a perfect mix of heartbreak and hope. I could tell you a thousand reasons why this movie is excellent. This is a movie that loves movies. It's a movie that keeps you wanting for more. All this movie needed was a talented director, a brilliant cast, groundbreaking special effects, incredible art direction, amazing music, and an inspirational storyline. This is such a crowning achievement in cinema. It's one of my all-time favorite movies, and I'm glad this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003. "LOTR: The Return of the King", in my review, "an epic and groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece".
10.0~Promises Made - Honoured in Full mrgordonz Sign in Permalink Before I saw ROTK, I read probably close to 100 online reviews, and with one or two exceptions, everyone raved about this movie. Now I know why. This is a spectacular movie on its own. But when ROTK is seen in the context of being the concluding third of the LOTR trilogy, it defies description. There were moments when I felt my chest tighten in awe. No-one steals the show - every last actor is nothing short of superb. But for me personally, Samwise Gamgee deserves honourable mention. For the pedantic purists who want a "Harry Potter" style, page-by-page, line-by-line adaptation, you may be a little disappointed. For the rest of us, it doesn't get any better. ROTK was everything I hoped for and more, and I relish the thought of seeing it many more times.
6.0~Good popcorn fun, albeit overrated pizzaranman Sign in Permalink This movie is a landmark in special-effects wizardry, and within the trilogy is easily the best (it's the only one with closure). I enjoyed almost every minute of this movie, but it is still not a top 10 movie by far. -Plotwise, it is a simple good vs. evil battle that we've all experienced before. Even though the story was written decades ago, and written quite well, it still doesn't have the depth. You can add characters and subplots to your heart's content, but the movie does not become deeper as a result, just more confusing to people that haven't read the books. -Besides war imagery that can possibly be connected to WWII, LOTR does not employ any symbolism, deeper meaning, not even a good authorial shot or coded dialogue. After finishing this trilogy, there is nothing else to think about - Not that this automatically makes a good movie, but it sure helps, and LOTR doesn't have any at all -The ending was long and drawn out. As soon as the main plot was resolved, the movie should have ended. The audience is instead treated to the hobbits dancing and giggling in slow-motion for another ten minutes. I really liked this movie. It was fun to watch, and it kept me entertained for 3 hours. It was definitely worth the $9. Still, this is not a top 10 movie, no matter how you want to phrase it.
10.0~LONG, but incredible ghostface18 Sign in Permalink I believe some critic was talking about this movie or another LOTR and its the first time I actually agree with him. He said, and I paraphrase,"This film is less of a movie and more of any experience." The Matrix series has NOTHING on this movie. The entire LOTR trilogy is an experience that no other movie or trilogy can ever compare to. This movie does have amazing effects, but it is less the effects and more the cinematography, acting, and story. Now, this is a VERY long movie, but when I came out of it, it seemed like my world had been altered. Never before had I seen a longer movie, but, never before have I seen a more amazing movie. There are one or two scenes where the "blue screen" is distinct, meaning the background does seem fake, but two scenes out of the whole movie doesn't mean anything. If this movie gets any negative comments I will be very surprised. This movie, along with its prequels are already classics and will forever be classics. I couldn't believe the box office amount on opening day, $37 million nationwide, but now I can see why. The only movie that will come close to this series is Harry Potter, which is excellent also, but the epic of this movie is nothing less than breath-taking. SEE IT!!!!!!!!!
6.0~Good, but not brilliant freddie-dobbs Sign in Permalink This was the weakest link in the the lord of the rings trilogy. not to say that this is a bad film but it just seemed to drag on far too long for me...the scenes involving Frodo and Sam climbing mount doom seemed to go one for an age, i thought that what was a very small piece of a huge ensemble was given far too much screen time. this may be just because it is the final instalment of a trilogy but i felt that there was too much emphasis put on trying to wind down the story which i believe made the film seem slightly laboured. however the quality of the previous two films is to class the lord of the rings as one of the truly great movie trilogy and also a brilliant adaptation of a book which, granted only reading it once at a reasonably young age, i found a bit overrated and seemed to drag on more so than the return of the king.
10.0~Honour, Valour, Pride..... frixosmasouras Sign in Permalink There are no words that can describe what I have been through when while watching this movie.... But I shall try :) Will Aragorn and his friends deliver you ask? Will Peter Jackson deliver? WIll Minas Tirith deliver? WIll the finale of the most awaited climax of all time stand up to what its meant to be? YES! Jackson delivers a sword through the heart of every hardcore fan out there. Spoilers have been spilled all over the world, so I am not about to start blabbering about the movie, all I am going to say is that the end is stuff that movie history is all about!!!!!! For the last fifteen minutes I could not stop crying, specifically from the time that a specific line was delivered I was emotionally moved....the line is "For Frodo..." Mark my words, fans out there...this is the stuff of legends, all around great performances, CGI to die for, THE EDITING IS SUPREME!!! Hail to those who have edited this epic! (sorry for the caps, I don't seem to be able to control my self!) All in all, everybody should watch the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, because it acts as one movie. Three acts!!! And Return Of The King is one HUGE finale!!! Hail to you Mr. Jackson.... And now we wait for the Return Of The King Kong :) (now that was lame!) If Tolkien was alive he would be a proud man....
10.0~One of the Best efohara Sign in Permalink One of the best movies I have ever seen. I was not disappointed by the treatment of this series. The casting and commitment by the actors is spot on. I lived the experience right along with the characters. I am moved to tears by the valor and courage displayed and the message that it is found in the unlikely places. Even though it is fantasy junkie eye candy, the message of Tolkien's work come through loud an clear. New Zealand is a feast for the eyes. Every time I see it I want to go and see this wonderful land for myself. The score is vast and so much a part of the experience. Indeed it is another character in the film. Do not miss this one.
8.0~If you don't *really* love Frodo and Sam . . . (SPOILERS) sithprincess4 Sign in Permalink Overall, I liked this movie. However, it was far from what I was hoping for. The most important thing to know is that, contrary to the title, this movie belongs to Frodo, Sam and Gollum. If anyone else is your favorite character, you'll be a little disappointed. I acknowledge that Peter Jackson did a wonderful job in bringing these cherished characters to the screen. But when some of the characters are barely there, it seems that some poor choices were made. I won't go into a lot of detail, but I'll try to cover the basics. First and foremost is the complete deletion of Saruman, of which everyone was already made aware. All we know of Saruman in this movie is that he's locked in his tower, and for some unexplained reason, has no more power. There is no mention at all of what happened to Grima. We barely see Faramir, except for a few scenes with his father. The romance between Faramir and Eowyn was nonexistent. David Wenham did a wonderful job with the little material he had. Hopefully, all of his scenes will be restored on the extended edition DVD so we can see some happiness for him after all of the horrible things he endured. Eowyn does have more to do in this movie than in Two Towers, especially during the Battle of Pelinnor Fields. However, she seemingly disappears at one point (since the whole Eowyn/Faramir romance was cut out) and is not seen again until near the end. Aragorn is in it more than Eowyn, but not by much. I expected much more with him, since he is the titular king. The same holds true for Legolas and Gimli, as they are off with Aragorn. Arwen is in a little bit more than in TTT, but not by much. Merry and Pippin needed more to do, although Pippin fares a lot better than Merry. Gandalf does have a decent amount of screen time. Elrond has a few scenes as well. A few of the characters shouldn't have bothered to show up, including Eomer, Galadriel and Celeborn. Their screen time was negligible. It was just disappointing to see the movie skewed so heavily toward Frodo, Sam and Gollum when there were so many other characters whose stories also needed to be told/wrapped up. The special effects were amazing and didn't overwhelm the story. I especially liked the army of the dead. The last thing I will mention is how the ending dragged on way too long. There are a couple of false endings, and I thought that the movie could have ended at least once without leaving the audience hanging. But it kept going. And going. We didn't need to see Sam get married. We didn't need to see Frodo and Sam after they returned to the Shire at all. Knowing they both lived and would be able to go home is enough. RotK is still definitely worth seeing, of course, but just be aware that Frodo and Sam will be taking up most of your time.
10.0~The first great cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. JamesHitchcock Sign in Permalink I am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck me as being among the worst films ever made. I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has disappointed me. The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the kingdom of Gondor. The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen, even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding. Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard Shore's memorable musical score. So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo Mortensen or Bernard Hill. Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed? Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.
10.0~ROTK lifts all three even higher! moonglum66 Sign in Permalink I had read that Elijah Wood thought that ROTK was better than the first two, put together. Well, it is true in a sense, until you have time to reflect on them all - because ROTK makes them both better! I can recall muttering oaths under my breath during the fight with the Balrog in FOTR. And again with the Balrog and pretty much all through Helm's Deep in The Two Towers. But I muttered, laughed, cringed, jumped and cried through 95% of this movie! Return of the King begins in an unexpected place, quietly wraps an arm around you while you watch the opening, then grips you tight as you soar through the rest of the movie. Woe to you if you fail to visit the facilities during the previews! You may find yourself dancing in the exit corridor, unwilling or even unable to tear yourself away to make that mad dash! Watch it, and watch it again. You will not see anything better in this century. Well, except the extended DVD!
9.0~Thoughts, that don't spoil much Requiemesk Sign in Permalink Well this is certainly a good movie, however (without giving too much away) I felt it had some moments of great 'unrealism' similar to the Two Towers when gimli and aragorn single handedly defeat hundreds of urukai and orcs without breaking a sweat. I havent read the books recently, and these moments may of also occured in the books as they did in the movies but I just find them as cheap and degrading to the overall integrity of the film. I will only mention Eowyn against various creatures, and a couple of eagles against nazghul mounts. Totally unrealistic, and this let the movie down for me. Oh and not to mention the 'hill pirates' (you'll understand once you see them) are stupid.. and a single one could probably win all the battles by itself. The first part was more relistically portrayed because of the smaller scale of things, but by the latter episodes with an ever increasing amount of foes the cheap option is taken without there really being a good reason behind why the main characters are invulnerable. A fantasy series that handles this problem better is A Song of Ice and Fire. Overall I liked the Fellowship the most and The Two Towers last, with Return of the King fitting in between. Smeagol/Gollum is great as always!
10.0~The Journey Ends with Unique Movie. Shyinx Sign in Permalink I mentioned place of the movie on my lists at below. Movie: Unique (#1) Screenplay: Perfect (#1) Film Editing: Perfect (#3) VFX: Perfect (#1) SFX: Perfect (#1) Cinematography: Perfect (#2) Overall Acting Performance: Very Good (#6) Original Scores: Perfect (#1) Art Direction & Set Decoration: Perfect (#2) Makeup: Perfect (#2) Costume Design: Perfect (#1) Blu-Ray Restoration: Perfect (#4) _________________________________ I am a big fan of Middle-earth and I know as a true fan of Middle-earth there will be no better movie. And also I know there is no better movie for a true Middle-earth fan. This movie is the best movie of the all time. This movie is the best movie of the future also. I am not talking about all of the people must love and say this movie is the best of all time. This movie is not about the war of men and orcs or any other peoples. This movie about the insignificant people versus the worlds biggest thread ever. That thread is actually unbeatable. "You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory." Saruman "Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch." Gandalf Both dialogues from the first movie. One of them telling us evil side is unbeatable and the other one tells we have a Hobbit.
10.0~The Most Emotionally Satisfying Movie I Have Ever Seen! cinephile-27690 Sign in Permalink I would give this a 4/10 the first time I saw this, I thought the battles went on too long-now I am thinking...what was I thinking? This made me feel so excited I thought my heart would pop! It's 200 minutes long so you may need to take some breaks and you must see the first 2 movies to get it but this is beyond fantastic! In fact, it won 11 Academy Awards and became the only fantasy movie to win Best Picture! I personally think it's one of the best fantasy movies ever...period! I also like Fellowship the 2nd best and Two Towers in last place, but they are all good. Enjoy Lord of the Rings, it is a masterpiece of cinema!
10.0~Epic gashokit Sign in Permalink One of the most successful film both critically and commercially. Easily one of the best movie.
10.0~Thrilling, Gripping, Visually Exciting Conclusion to the Trilogy noralee Sign in Permalink "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" is a terrific demonstration of CGI and special effects made to serve a thrilling story of good vs. evil. I came in fully expecting that the "Return of the King" aspect would be the story line that would draw me in the most, but found that was given short shrift with a lot of that left out from the book, given over more to cinemascope-worthy battles that are the best since the early "Star Wars" movies. If I hadn't read the book recently, let alone re-read the appendices several times to be sure I was getting the prophesies and genealogy straight, I would never have figured out what was going on with Aragorn as the heir to Isildur, as much of what he does to convince doubters is missing. I also was a bit disappointed in Viggo not quite living up to "LOTR: The Two Towers," but I don't know if it was his acting or the dialog, especially in his "rally the troops" a.k.a. "another Crispin's Day speech," or if I found his traveling down the Paths of the Dead less frightening, and less motivated, than in the book. His Elvish-language song at the coronation was a nice touch. Second to the battles, the lighting of the bonfires along the mountain tops was both gorgeous and exciting. I am relieved that Eowyn and Faramir's romance shows will show up in the DVD because the sudden appearance of Arwen with an approving father in Minas Tirith is simply a befuddled resolution to the triangular tensions. I am sympathetic, however, about having to leave some things out in a rushed conclusion due to the length as I did have trouble sitting through to the credits, what with the extensive previews tacked on as well. But the Gollum/Smeagol vs. Frodo and Sam competition was instead the more gripping, perhaps because the power of evil is so intensely represented by the close-up interior and exterior struggles of these almost-four characters trekking to Mordor. I didn't mind the multiple endings that others have complained of as I respected the loyalty to the source material. Howard Shore's music was martial without being bombastic, and Annie Lennox's vocalization fit in surprisingly in the over-the-credits song. (originally written 12/28/2003)
1.0~Dull, dull dull. pbellemare Sign in Permalink I know all the fans of the books loved the LOTR movies, but I never could stomach the books, never got more than 125 pages into the first one, even though I tired a dozen times. The books were tremendously dull, and uninspired. the movies were very true to this vision. Think about it for a few minutes, what exactly happened over the course of about 10 hours of film ? A few creatures went for a walk with some computer animated "battles" along the way. Big whoop. Dull, bored me to sleep. If I could write ten lines about how dull this movie series was, I might inspire you readers to the same amount of dis-interest that these movies make arise in me. I was enthralled by a lot of the scenery shots, but the dull color palette used in most of the scenes was just as unappealing as the dull plot. I'm not going to bother comparing this to another series of movies, because I can't think of another instance of such patently dull movies being so universally heralded. I wish some really good books would be afforded the lavish treatment these dry tomes got.
10.0~Our fellowship pkavartinas Sign in Permalink I've seen the return of the king only yesterday and one thing is for sure. No other Christmas will be ever the same. I feel sad but not alone. It's like a big global community now, when we are all gathering under one ring. WE are the fellowship of the ring now. (Sorry for my English), keep on dreaming
10.0~Good, better, Return of The King louisraaschou Sign in Permalink The final movie of the trilogy, captures off it all and finalizes the best trilogy in cinematic history!
10.0~Greatest movie ever! ryan_frith Sign in Permalink WOW! The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is amazing. Return of the King was an excellent film. Sure, it wasn't straight from the book, but hey, it's a movie, not a book. It was perfect. I was so pleased with the way that Peter Jackson portrayed the film. I had heard that he had a sign in his office saying to the effect, that "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy would beat Star Wars, guess what, it did.
10.0~This trilogy is supreme satisfaction! Hanngall Sign in Permalink This will be a short review, not because I do not have time but because of the magnificence it brought to me is in my mind forever more. I remembered seeing this in the cinema of my hometown in Sweden, it was the best of my life. I had goosebumps throughout the whole movie. A must see for those who have not. Even now, I feel like a kid again watching it. My childhood of sword-plays with sticks in the forests,pretending to be fighting an army of orcs is a truth while watching this with surround sound. The costumes, the characters, I salute Tolkien for this glorious work and salutes Jackson for the splendid adventure he has captures on the cinema screen!
4.0~This one was definitely the best of the three qg59 Sign in Permalink I would have probably given this at least a 9 rating if it wasn't so long. There were some points in the film when i began to get bored. Maybe its just because I'm not a huge fan of the fantasy and sci fi genre. One thing i did really like about this movie when i wasn't bored was how thrilling it was. From the battle scenes to Frodo's and Sam's adventure to destroy the ring. Vigo Mortinson was awesome in this movie. Not only his acting but the way he displayed the character had me believing he was, whatever it is that he was. Maybe thats another reason for the only 8 rating was that i was somewhat confused as to what the whole setting was. I suggest this movie to anyone who has 3 and a half hours to waste, but don't put off something too important to watch it.
10.0~The Best Finale of ANY trilogy ever made!!!!! RightWingGuy Sign in Permalink I don't know about anyone else, but I absolutely loved this film. I'd watch it every day if my parents let me. It is so amazing: the music, the acting, the battles, and everything else in between. I just don't know where to begin. ***Spoilers*** The movie opens with a flashback of Smeagol, and how he got the ring, and Deagol, his "friend" who he choked to death to get the ring. We see how Smeagol went mad, and turned very ugly. It is a sad way of showing his past, but it had to be done. It takes about 10 or 11 minutes for the title, "The Return of the King" to come on, but that didn't seem to matter to me. In the Extended version, which is over 4 hours long, we see a scene with Saruman that was cut from the theater version. This scene is so awesome, you'd have to buy it to see what happens. As we progress through the movie, Pippen looks into the Palatir that Saruman had, and sees a glimpse of Sauran's plan. We see the battle at Osgiliath, and we see Faramir meet Pippin in Minas Turith. We see the villainy of Gollum, and how Gollum is poisoning Frodo against Sam. If this movie has one weakness, it's when Frodo sends Sam home. In the book, they were always together, except when the Orcs took the unconscious Frodo into the tower in Mordor. The final battle in Minas Turith is a great one. And it is well worth your time. The music of Shelob's lair is the best ever, and it is somewhat scary if you listen to just the music from the soundtrack. Frodo and Sam are soon reunited, and Mount Doom is very close. I'll let you watch the rest, to find out what happens. This is a very long movie, so if you have a lot of time to spare, watch this movie, and you won't be disappointed. 10/10. #2 best movie.
9.0~An Awesome Epic Concluded k-king2 Sign in Permalink Great movie. I had not read the books prior so did not have any expectations on how things should or should not be. The battle scenes were excellent. I also agree with several other's comments that Sean Astin should be up for an Academy Award. His performances in TT and RoTK have been simply outstanding. Sam IS the Hero of this trilogy imho. I was deeply moved when the people of Gondor paid their respect to the Hobbits. The Shelob scenes were outstanding, looked real. My only complaint is with the ending, not that it went on longer than expected but that it was deliberately cut to make you think it was over when it was not. This is and most likely always will be the greatest Epic ever made. I think it is unfair to compare it to other trilogies because LoTR is really not a trilogy, but simply one huge movie. LoTR the movie(s) is truly in a class by itself. Thanks to the thousands of people who worked so hard to make LoTR what it is!
10.0~Wow!!!!!! ash1bhalla Sign in Permalink OK, I've always wanted to review a film online, but now here I am, and I don't know where to start! Yep, that's how utterly amazing I thought ROTK was. I've said it millions of times to myself and now I say it publicly - Peter Jackson is a GENIUS!!!!! I have to admit though, when I went to see the first film, I wasn't overly-enthusiastic, as I hadn't read the books - in fact my dad, who is a HUGE fan, had to practically drag me to the cinema. I really wished I'd read the books then, `cos, even though I thought the scenery etc. was amazing, I didn't really know what was going on. But I went home, read the book, bought the DVD and then figured it out!! Then, I bought a small copy of the trilogy and read Two Towers and then ROTK!! I don't think I've ever seen a fantasy film - or any film at all, come to think of it - that made me cry; in ROTK, I cried, I think 10 times throughout! Now, I'm not one for crying in films unless there's something really powerful about it - so I guess that tells you something about the impact this film had on me! Some of the scenes that made me cry were: 1)Faramir's suicide charge - I just thought it was really sad to see such a good man rushing out to almost certain death just because it was his father's wish. It was even sadder to see him go unloved - I mean, Denethor just sat and stuffed his face!! Having Pippin singing made the scene even more heartwrenchingly amazing. 2)When Frodo told Sam to go home - I felt really sorry for Sam, `cos he'd been so loyal to Frodo through everything and that's how Frodo treats him! Mind you, I guess it was Gollum's fault, really. Oh, while I remember, I thought Sean Astin - and I know I'm not the only one to think this - was absolutely AMAZING in this film!! He - along with the other hobbits, especially Billy Boyd - really came of age in this film. 3) When Sam says to Frodo: "I can't carry it [the ring] for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you." - Just to see so much care and compassion for Frodo's plight was amazing indeed. Oh, by the way, I loved the way the ring made Frodo's neck look like it was blistered and bleeding - that was a really ingenious touch, PJ!! 4) When Pippin finds Merry on the battlefield - Again, there was a real sense of love and friendship between Merry and Pippin - it was really sweet to see Pippin staying with him like that! 5)The Grey Havens - When I went to see ROTK the first time, I took 2 of my friends, and we all cried like anything at this bit. I think the main reason I cried was because it suddenly hit me that it was all over. Anyway, moving on; I thought the best thing about ROTK was that you see all these touching, moving moments away from the battle - sometimes, it's so easy to let a battle overwhelm this; but I think Jackson got the balance absolutely perfect in this! That's not to say the Battle of the Pelennor Fields wasn't amazing - I was absolutely gobsmacked by the sheer size of it. I was initially worried that it wouldn't be as amazing as Helm's Deep in Two Towers - but, oh boy, how wrong I was!!! Loved the ghosts of the oathbreakers by the way!! But my favourite scene - apart from Faramir's suicide charge - was actually Aragorn's coronation. When he was singing that wonderful Elvish chant, I got goose pimples all over me!! Of course, this was spoiled slightly when I nearly cracked up as I imagined singing it in choir at school - it's not that we're not good, but it just seems a little weird. The other totally immense scene - although it seems so simple - was the ride of the Rohirrim - it's amazing how something so simple can look so effective on screen! Out of 10?? Well, obviously 10 if you have to keep to the scale, but if not then I would have to say something like infinite to the power of infinite going on for infinite!! I think you get the picture of how much I loved it then!!! Hannon le, (Thank you), Peter Jackson PS: Please film The Hobbit - I read that for the first time when I was about eight and I still love it SO much - I'd love to see it on film!!!
10.0~Beautiful, Magic, Awestrikingly Magnificent duskeye Sign in Permalink This is the greatest film I have ever seen, bar none. No question. Absolutely unbelievable in every regard. This film is without equal - and it will almost certainly NEVER be equalled. The acting is first rate, the story is intensely moving, extremely emotional, multi-layered and textured. The action is the best I've ever seen - ditto the effects. The battle scenes are brain-explodingly wonderful. I can't find the words really. I have never experienced anything like this ever before and may never again. The actors were ALL born to play these roles. Peter Jackson was born to direct this masterpiece. Memorable scene after memorable scene, classic line after classic line, victories so moving you'll jump out of your seat and yell "HELL YEAH!!!" I can't stop thinking about this film, rest assured I'll be seeing it over and over. So many favourite parts - when Aragorn leaps out of the boats with the cursed soldiers, when Legolas brings down an Oliphant, Gandalf whipping Denethor's butt, Eowyn's incrediblly powerful performance in her showdown with the Witch King - "I AM NO MAN!!", when Denethor falls burning to his death, but my very favourite has to be Sam literally carrying Frodo up Mount Doom - tears streamed down my face for the first time ever in a cinema. This movie is GOD. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, your work here is done. And it is good. Amazingly good. Biblical, even. This should go to Number One on the top 250 list immediately, without a doubt. Thank you, thank you, thank you. THIS is the way movies were meant to be. The defining film of our generation. And as a trilogy, LOTR is absolutely leaps and bounds ahead of any competition. Sorry Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Godfather - meet the new yardstick for all others to be measured by. Magic.
10.0~The best in the series, a fitting tribute! Tundrayeti Sign in Permalink I won't give anything away bickering over minor details... Overall this is the best of the three. Enough said. My only real complaint during the movie is that my eyes kept drying out because I forgot to blink. :) I'll be able to be more objective after I see it 6 times or so, but for now... This is undoubtably the best movie ever made. See it at any cost!
10.0~The Best Movie a Movie Can Be!!!! ricoda-1 Sign in Permalink What a great end to Tolkien's adventure story. I as a reader of the Lord of the Rings am greatly satisfied by the hard work and great performances the actors as well as Peter Jackson have made. Though the movie cuts parts of the book, the story still is whole and nothing is cut without good reason. The endings at the movie aren't dragging at all like others believe. The movie had to end all the stories of all the characters. A Great Opus from Peter Jackson. One of the Greatest movies of all time.... NO DOUBT!!!!!!!!!!!!
6.0~Disappointing conclusion fdpugh Sign in Permalink This episode of the series was the most disappointing, not because of any lack of eye candy, which was good, but for the focus and the changes made to the conclusion. I was really into the first film, the second filled in the important place between what should have been a great beginning and action packed end... This one fell short of the grandiosity I perceived in the books. Peter Jackson is brilliant in bringing the books to life as well as he did, but this was honestly over hyped. It was probably the ending that put the nail in the coffin. Being a fan of the books I expected something a little better, but it was perhaps my girlfriend of the time who put the right perspective on it likening the end-scene to a homosexual punchline.
10.0~Amazing Movie vipgrinders Sign in Permalink And so all good things come to an end. For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement? Well, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects. And then there's the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.
2.0~Much weaker than we'd expected or hoped for ... faithandrichard Sign in Permalink WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! What a disappointment the 3rd film is. We greatly enjoyed films I and II but this is a massive let-down. There seems to be little or no character development in ROTK, and this exacerbates the latent weaknesses is the first two films. I'm afraid that a lot of this is because of perverse alterations from Tolkien. First, Aragorn. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now, Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead (Elrond never turns up at Dimholt). And when he takes the paths of the dead he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them. Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. Result? We're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? Aragorn's character been denuded of a sense of who he is. Second Sauron. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why didn't Jackson develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!) Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur. Now this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron's not actually the worst form of evil - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. Tolkien's point is that evil in many guises takes human form: something that Jackson shouldn't have missed in today's world. The same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). Arwen is drippy throughout. Eowyn is changed in the film. Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair (as they would of course) so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'. As for the hobbits . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as Sam is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. Bilbo was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh - this is kindergarten film production. I expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good at all. Peter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R. Tolkien, down.
9.0~A Fond Farewell anselmdaniel Sign in Permalink This review contains spoilers. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the sequel to The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The movie is the concluding movie to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The movie premiered in 2003 and features the same cast from the previous movies. The movie continues where the previous movie left off. Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Gollum, are lead into Mordor. The trio are beset with internal conflicts started by Gollum. The three encounter more creatures of Mordor along with a giant spider known as Shelob. This perspective is the main story of the Lord of the Rings and it is great to its conclusion here. The pair of Hobbits were completely different characters from the beginning of the trilogy to the end. Frodo and Samwise go from isolationist hobbits to embracing the adventure and sacrifice needed to bring The One Ring to Mount Doom. It was heartwarming to see these two friends not give up on each other when hope seemed lost. Both Sean Astin and Elijah Wood, do a good performance here. I could see that the two are proud of their performance. The other plot concerns the defense of Minas Tirith in Gondor as Mordor seeks to end the age of men. This story follows Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, King Theoden, Eomer, and Arwen. This story features a desperate defense of the multi-layered city of Minas Tirith and a quest to give more time to Frodo and Samwise. This entire story is incredibly epic. The directing by Peter Jackson is some of the best with the Battle of Pelennor Fields being a highlight. There is nothing that this story does wrong from a narrative or visual standpoint. The battles in this movie are worth the price of an admission alone. The only weakness of the movie is perhaps the ending being overly long. I could feel that this part of the movie became almost pointless. Once The One Ring was destroyed, the movie, transitioned into its epilogue. The movie let the audience see the characters one final time before concluding. This conclusion brought a somber conclusion to the story rather than an abrupt one. The story did however focus on Frodo and his reaction to the end of the journey. This helped the story conclude as we could see the effects the journey had on Frodo Baggins. I personally enjoyed this conclusion towards the end. The extended cut is highly recommended over the theatrical cut. The extended cut offers many cool scenes and develops an already rich world. The extended cut is still only for fans and anyone watching the movie passively will not get much out of it. I highly recommend The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Four stars out of four stars. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is one of the best movie trilogies. This trilogy will truly stand the test of time as both a cinematic and technical marvel. Although the weakest movie is The Two Towers this is not a weak movie by any stretch. Each of the movies contributed to each other in meaningful ways and Peter Jackson should be applauded for keeping the three movies at such high quality. Four stars out of four stars.
1.0~Exemplifies the difference and the fall melandlaurel Sign in Permalink The difference between art that comes out of the studio system, and art that comes out of a lifetime; if only we could develop a moving image pillar that was not driven by base profit, we might see an expression of Tolkien on "film" that was decent. The fall? This is the beginning of the end for our civilization; when art is so corrupted that people can no longer even tell the difference, our "way of life" is over; anthropologist, alien or otherwise, will mark the success of these films (and of George Bush, and of television) as the harried and quickened end of "the West," not unlike the fall of Numenor...not that you would know anything about that from these "adaptations..." What a disgrace! How dare Jackson call this Tolkien!
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King maGraDz3 Sign in Permalink My biggest beef was on so much missing about Aragon, and I found most of them in the DVD. One of the vital elements in the Fellowship's strategy is to draw Sauron's eye away from Frodo, and here Aragon's role is crucial. The "last debate" in the movie is totally inadequate in explaining the suicidal march to the Black gate but the DVD makes it very clear, with the additional scene of Aragon revealing himself to Sauron though the Palantir. He is the bait that Sauron cannot resist. Another important aspect is that Aragon comes into the city of Minas Tirith first and foremost as a HEALER, not as a king. The kingship comes afterwards. This is again brought out in the additional scenes in the DVD, although still missing a lot of details from the book. Still disappointing, even for the DVD, is that so little is given to the story of Eowyn and Faramir. The dialogue through which they come to accept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire book. The few shots in the DVD that trace the development of their relationship are far from adequate, although that's a least a slight improvement from the film version. Another disappointment is Aragon's arrival at the Pelennor Fields, which is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the book: amidst the despair of the Rohan and Gondor soldiers in witnessing the approaching black ships, Aragon's standard suddenly unfurls at the main mast: "There flowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but seven stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought of mithril gold." The treatment of Gandalf's confrontation of the Witch King in the DVD departs from the book, in which the two are locked in a face off, then Rohan's horns are heard and the Witch King swings around and leaves. What in heaven's name is in Peter Jackson's mind when he had Gandalf's staff broken by the Witch King. But this did explain a mystery that has been bugging me for a year – why Gandalf had to snatch a spear from the guard when he saved Faramir from the pyre of Denethor. Enough on the DVD.I shall be remiss if I do not pay tribute to Peter Jackson for the wonderful film he and his dedicated crew have created. Most inspired is the lighting of the beacons to summon help from Rohan. In the book, this is observed by Pippin in the ride to Minas Tirith. To satisfy Pippin's curiosity, Gandalf explains the background to him in a somewhat factual manner. Jackson turns this into one of the most exciting moments in the film, with aesthetically superb shots of the 13 beacons (yes, I counted them) being lit up in succession, accompanied by beautifully rousing music score, culminating in Theoden's heroic utterance of "Rohan will answer". Watching this has to be among the most uplifting moments one can experience in a cinema. Most poignant is the Faramir's suicidal attempt to retake Osgilaith, under the orders of an unloving father. Starting from the soldiers of Gondor filing out of Minas Tirith in what looks almost like a funeral march to the letting loose of the swarm of arrows by the orcs in Osgilaith, every image of this scene is so hauntingly heartrending. It reminds me of John Woo's favourite scenes, although here, the music is Pipppin's actual singing rather than adapted background music, rendering the tragic mood even more devastating. Directly opposite in mood is Rohan's charge in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. Even if this mission is, in a way, equally suicidal, the spirit is sky high, radiating dauntless heroism and lust for battle. This scene also reminds me of the legendary battle scene in Spartacus (1960) which is universally recognised as the model in depiction of battle strategies. Rohan's charge in Pelennor Field, no the other hand, exemplifies heroism unsurpassed. Although ROTK is first and foremost the King's story, we should not forget, in the overall scheme of things, the ring bearers (no typo here because Frodo did acknowledge Sam as a fellow ring bearer in the end of the book). Elijah Wood and Sean Astin (particularly Astin) have played their roles to perfection. Towards the end of the quest, when Frodo's strength was almost fully spent, to hear Sam say "I cannot carry it (the ring) for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you" and not be moved, one will have to be a hopelessly and irreversibly hardened cynic. The background music, incidentally, is "Into the west". It is certainly a good sign that the general audience worldwide has reacted favourably to the long aftermath following the destruction of the ring, indicated that their capacity to appreciate has not been impaired by the proliferation of Hollywood style slam-bang endings. Viggo Mortensen's line to the Hobbits "My friends, you bow to no one" is delivered with sincerity and conviction. The final scene at the Grey Havens is graceful, touching, stylish. However, there is one shot that I must mention: Galadriel's final enigmatic, alluring, half-smiling glance at Frodo before she disappears into the ship. Cate Blanchett is among the most versatile actresses around today and in LOTR, she is Galadriel incarnate.
8.0~A worthy ending, but could have been (a lot?) better wolfgangw Sign in Permalink Minor spoiler about the style(!) of the ending: (no spoiler if you have read the book) Near the end of the film when everything finally comes together and the fate of the world hast just been decided as a viewer you get a wonderful nice feeling, suddenly you just have to love this trilogy. Then there's one of those mandatory 'we are threw it, yeah!'-scenes dragging on a bit long with maybe a little bit too much of almost constant slow motion and bright glaring white light all around. Then there's another one of those. Then this wonderful feeling you just had just starts to give way to slight annoyance. Then there's another celebration. Then another. Then some more talking. Then some more. Then general hugging and sniffing. Then some more. My god, when cutting this film didn't anyone notice something? Like 'maybe we should really stop at the fifth ending?'. That's the reason samuran had to be cut? Sadly this overdoing it a bit and almost ruining great moments with stuff that doesn't really work very well is a bit symptomatic for this third and final part. That really doesn't mean that this isn't a very good movie and shure it can be absolutely great for you. I just felt that it also shows a a little tiredness of the moviemakers. There are great character scenes and fight scenes especially Sam and the spider (really really creepy and thrilling scene) then the war elephants (great fast paced entertainment). Still to me the battle of Helm's Deep just felt more structured and more emotional then the the one of Minas Tirith. Also that everything done before the dead arrive seems to be almost unimportant because the dead sweep completely unstoppable threw thousands and thousands of enemies anyway... On the character side there could have been a bit less weeping and hugging. But without any doubt there are enough great moments left to make an at least very good movie.
10.0~Part 3 of the longest movie ever made! raphaklopper Sign in Permalink The longest movie ever made, so long that the director had to divide it in three parts, and that's why people call a trilogy. 10 hours of a phenomenal spectacle that will leave anyone with tears and a heavy heart after the magnificent end. In "The Fellowship of the Ring" we start with the journey of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) towards to Mordor, lair of the dark lord Sauron. And we see the great training and union of the Fellowship of the ring, an alliance of all the living beings of Middle-earth on a mission to destroy the "One Ring" and thus save the world from the darkness. In "Two Towers" we have the beginning of the Great War between humans and orcs, with the army of Saruman (Christopher Lee) marching against the kingdom of Rohan. And Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) along with the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) joining in the battle. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are getting closer every day to the lair of Sauron, now having the help of the strange creature Gollum / Smeagol (Andy Serkis) who wants by all means his "precious". And finally in "The Return of the King" we have the spectacular ending to the trilogy / film. Since the beginning of the film we felt the feeling that everything is coming to an end. Frodo and Sam finally reached Mordor and try to find a way to infiltrate into the enemy territory and Gollum / Smeagol plans to take the ring from Frodo, who becomes increasingly heavy. And on the other side we have the beginning of the great battle that we expected since the first movie, the showdown between humans and orcs in the battle that will determine the fate of the world with all the characters we have learned to love here together in this fight to the uncertain ending. Peter Jackson (director-writer) brought to life the masterpiece of books, "Lord of the Rings" by the genius JRR Tolkien. This can be the best adaptation of a book to film ever made, if the book is already a masterpiece in the world of books, Jackson made a masterpiece of cinema. The gigantic story that was told in six books, in film it was told in one film. A film of more than 10 hours, it had to be divided into three parts forming the best trilogy already made. I say it's just a movie because all three movies work as one, from the beginning to the end we realize that. Since the first film (or first part) we have the magic of Tolkien's working here, along with Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens (writers) have recreated and remained faithful to Tolkien's work and the film managed to raise the themes of friendship, courage and while it has always had religious references in the book and the film manages to convey everything in the greatest perfection. Not only the writing is phenomenal, but the visual effects are stunning giving a gigantic scale the movie, so well detailed visual effects that make everything look so realistic. And the effects are not only stunning but also that the soundtrack that is simply magnificent. A trilogy that works as a single film that is a true masterpiece. A landmark in film history thanks to excellent writing and direction of Jackson and fantastic performances from all the cast, "The Lord of the Rings" is the epic fantasy stunning in every detail and be loved by all. 10/10
10.0~Carved into our hearts kenan-866-103123 Sign in Permalink The ending of an epic saga which warm our hearts and carved itself in it to be a long lasting nice memory of an magical world filled with all kinds of evil and good.The carving is still in me,many years have past since this movie came out but it is still one of the best movies I have watched.The ratings on this site prove it also.If you are a sci-fi lover, you sure will love this one.Peter Jackson has done an excellent job on directing this movie and he turned the imagination from the books into reality.For me, this one is focused on friendships bonds which are stronger than any armor. These bonds come in hard times and if they last, they will last forever. The strong friendships between Frodo and Sam touched our hearts and we felted like we are there, somewhere in the lands of Middle Earth, helping them in their journey.Many good movies come and go, but this is the type of movies that stick to you for a long long time.And always brings as back in this magnificent journey. Excellent!
10.0~Literally Took My Breath Away Daelock Sign in Permalink What can I say that hasn't been said? This movie is a gorgeous piece of what films can become. Everything falls into place flawlessly, the cast delivers performances for the ages(I personally think Viggo Mortensen should at least be nominated for an Oscar for his role as Aragorn)once again showing that the casting job could not be better filled by anyone. It's all been said, anything I put here would be redundant and you've probably already made up your mind as to if you're going to see the movie or not(or in some cases how many times you're going to see it), but to those who aren't, perhaps, just perhaps, you should. This movie deserves all the praise it's getting and much more.
3.0~Don't waste your money to see it. rma123 Sign in Permalink Advertising, advertising, advertising and there is no contents. Nothing new than Star Wars - Return of the Jedi. Horrible commercial trash.
7.0~The third movie as well as the third best dstephen4 Sign in Permalink I'd rank the movies as best to worst, in the order they came out (Felowship, Two Towers, Return of the king) Return starts well enough but then it becomes kind of mired. This might be due more to Tolkien than the current filmmakers. After watching, while being somewhat disappointed, I flipped through the book when I came home. I had not read the trilogy in quite a few years, partially on purpose since I wanted it to be somewhat fresh for the films. Unpon skimming the third book again, I found that the book itself is pretty long winded and boring in parts. Pages after pages of hanging out in bogs trying to get to mount doom are just not that exciting, translating it to film doesn't really improve it either. So I think it was maybe mostly due to the book, but the pacing just seemed horribly off. Besides the book problems, having to edit out a lot of the book did not really help either. The movie would have been redeemed for me by seeing things like the scouring of the shire and the houses of the healing, but I guess they figured that would be even more falling action than they already had. Houses of the Healing was kind of important because it is where Eowyn hooks up with Faramir, since both are there being nursed back to health. My guess is such things were left out, while I'm certain that the female writers would have wanted them put in(the Faramir/Eowyn romantic conclusion, that is), because the film already seemed to have like 3 endings as it was. Instead all we get is a glance and a smile between Eowyn and Faramir, which makes no sense unless you know they hook up. Otherwise you'd be wondering why Eowyn is not more upset about her obsession Aragorn getting the elf chick. In spite of those complaints, which I'm sure others have also voiced, I tried to watch this one as I did the other films - independent of the books but rather a work of its own. As a work of its own something is still off and there still is just not enough "meat" to it. Its overly long in the boring parts and the parts that I enjoyed, such as getting the undead army, seemed overly short. I enjoyed this movie more the second time, in a DVD watching in order after viewing the first two extended ones (yeah, that is a whole day right there basically ;) ) My guess is that I'll enjoy it even more come december with the extended edition. I'm hoping to heck that the extended edition includes a lot of the scenes I want in the film, rather than making Sam and Frodo's trek even LONGER. Two Towers also did not do that much for me in the theater initially, apart from gollum being so cool and impressive. He was already in the second film so much, though, that by the third one he was old hat. He seemed just like another actor by then, which I suppose is a testament to the technology ;) I don't know why the first film seemed like the best to me, it may have been because the life of the hobbits was such a good starting point as well as the back story/introduction of the ring. The extended version extra hobbit scenes were especially wonderful. The first film just seemed to really pace itself better and hold my interest more. My one regret with that one was the missing Tom Bombadaii stuff (SP?) and the wight mound, which explains where they got their swords as WELL as someone who is basically God-like who can't even protect the ring. I thought this was important, Frodo mentions that they should give it to him while Gandalf wisely counsels that it would mean nothing to him and he'd leave it on a stump or something (this is all from the book, where tom took it and put it on and it had no effect on him since he is much older than it even.) But I digress. I gave the third one a 7 though I'm likely to rate the extended DVD higher. The first one I'd give a solid 10, with towers taking around an 8.
10.0~Stirring stuff whistlestop Sign in Permalink Eagerly awaited, this film did not disappoint. More, more, I cry - they're never too long for me. But why were so many tantalising glimpses from the trailer absent in the film? I'm looking forward to the DVD EE to add to my collection - maybe they'll appear in that. I was also disappointed that Aragorn's powers as healer and the romance between Faramir and Eowyn were not shown; and of course by the lack of Saruman. The whole spectacle is breathtaking, the music sublime, and the locations perfectly realised. Can't wait for the Hobbit!! 10/10
9.0~What an achievement... oriyon8 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best fantasy films ever. The finale of all three films this is the type of ending any tale should have. A detailed triumph and it only worked because this was one huge 10 hour epic. This also launched the careers of many of it's tireless cast. This is similar to the star wars in mythic heroism. I'd suggest anyone, with the time to spare, to watch the films in order ( probably not in one sitting ) and be swept away to middle earth. But the finale is definitely the crowning jewel and the most exciting chapter. Action adventure films will judged against this film in the future. i shy away for a perfect score because of length and 1 story line i feel was dragged a little too long. but other then that it was an amazing accomplishment.
10.0~Worth every cent slipstream3d Sign in Permalink The best of the trilogy... if you've seen the other two you cannot go without seeing this one. A perfect cap to the best film adaptation of a book I've ever seen. Worth every cent of my opening-day (he he, 9:00 AM showing!) ticket, without a doubt.
10.0~Crazy, baby!!!!! senorita_belle Sign in Permalink The best story and movie by trilogy ever made. It can said that LOTR 1 and 2 become one movie. You know, I cried at the end of the story. I followed the story and movie from the first time. Not just the movie, also books, articles, news, etc. So, I'm very glad but sad too that it was over. Esp. For Frodo and all of Middle Earth. I was touched by the scene when all of Middle-Earth with Aragorn and Arwen as king and queen kneeled for four Hobbit. I felt very touched of it. I can see a hard fight by Frodo for carry The One Ring. And the evil Gollum I want to kick his ass. Poor Sean! He cried. I can see to that Frodo was very missed Shire and very glad that it was over, no evil power anymore. IT WAS OVER! Big perfect special effect! No doubt. I felt that I was inside the battle. More fantastic than Battle of Helm's Deep. Very big chaos. Strong Eowyn as a woman. Happy ending story. Aragorn and Arwen get married and they became king and queen. Peace Middle-Earth. But, I cried again when Frodo leaved Shire. Pour 3 little Hobbit. It was a wonderful story!!!! Oooooh..... I think I want to cry again.
10.0~Cinematic Brilliance Matt_Layden Sign in Permalink SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! My friend asked me if I wanted to go, I said okay, but he didn't want to leave until 7:30. Of course I knew we would get bad seats, and we did. 3rd row from the very front, far, far left. My neck still hurts. I had nothing to eat or drink, people were talking throughout the opening scenes. Yet this did nothing to distract me or harm the movie in any way. Let me start off by saying and you can quote me on this "Move over Star Wars, there's a new trilogy in cinema" This movie (movies) are amazing. Lord of the Rings is the best trilogy out there and will be for some time. The matrix's last installment full flat, I have not seen Godfather, Evil Dead is a cult classic trilogy and Star Wars just lost the top spot. I seriously believe Jackson will get Best Director and this movie "deserves" to have Best Picture, even though the Academy will fuck it's chances over and this will be one of the biggest snubs ever on the Oscars. I'll begin with the CGI. If you thought the first two had great CGI, you haven't seen anything yet. Gollum, of course looks amazing and it is so believable that he is a character on the screen. "He is there, you believe it, he is not cgi" The way he talked to himself was better than the way it was presented in The Two Towers, the water reflection was so beautiful and imaginative. When he is atop of Frodo and bites his finger off, it was amazing; I was actually in awe, CGI on top of CGI. The battle, what an amazing battle, if you thought the battle at Helm's Deep was amazing, cool, the best, then you are in store for something spectacular. You will get your socks knocked off. The battle scene is the absolute best battle scene ever created. The bodies, the emotion, the action, the excitement, the chills, the suspense, the cheers, the tears. This battle had it all. The men who were cursed, beautiful, how they tore that motherfucker down. In Fellowship of the Ring, we see Legolas climb atop of a Cave Troll; yes it did look fake, cheesy. In Two Towers, we see him do some weird stunt to climb back onto his horse, it also looked weird and fake. In Return Of The King, he takes down the elephant and all the men on it. This wasn't fake, this wasn't weird or cheesy. It looked beautiful, it looked real, it was amazing. He did it with ease as well, and as he counted his victims, brings down the big boy, gimli (serving as comic relief only) still states that the one only counted as one. The acting, was utterly "uber" great. Aragorn IS the king, he is the man, the legend, Mortesen is the one and only person who can play him, who can bring him to life, he is Aragorn. Everyone did their part, and boy did I ever hate the "filler king" He p*ssed me off so much, I actually liked it. Merry and Pippen, were extraordinary, this movie is where they shine. Sam, I think everyone knows what a great actor Astin is, and what a GREAT job he did with Sam, I honestly believe that he should be up for supporting actor. He almost made me cry, the emotion was utterly amazing. Hate, Anger, Love, Fear, Sadness. He brought all of these emotions into this character and he did it extremely well. Frodo...what can I say, you are a troubled young...err..old hobbit. You are tired, you cannot go on...you trust the untrustworthy, you are fearful of a giant Shelob. You have courage and find the strength to go on and destroy the ring, only to be consumed by it's evil power, and want the ring for yourself. Agent Smith/Lord Elrond...one word, GREAT. I believed Liv Tyler should of had at least 5 more minutes of screen time, but with the time she did have, she made me believe that she truly was in love with Aragon and willing to become mortal. The direction, Peter Jackson is my new Favourite director. Yes, I have seen his previous films before he did Lord of the Rings, yes I loved them, but this "EPIC" trilogy, has made him the man. Only a true fan of Tolkien and Lord of the Rings, could of brought this masterpiece to film, creating another masterpiece. You honestly deserve to win best director, for conveying epic battle sequences, strong emotions, bringing something fake to life (Gollum). I don't know anyone else who could of done this, and if he is not behind the camera for The Hobbit, then it should not be made. The characters, one of the things that I love about the books/movies are the characters. Their fears, their anger, their courage, their optismistic approach on life. Eowyn (sp) Not very convincing in Two Towers, but amazing in this installment, I could not believe it. She is a warrior. Everyone cheered when she took off her helmet and said "I am no man". Then stuck that sword right into the f***er. Merry and Pippen have love for each other and you can feel it, when they say goodbye to each other, you can feel their pain, there sadness. Gimli, was really funny as well as Gandalf, who is just as always, excellently portrayed by Ian Mckellen. Everyone cheered again when Gandalf took over command of Minus Tirith (sp). The movie itself, was just brilliant. It deserves everything it gets, and should get more. I felt sad when Frodo was back at the Shire, in his little home all alone, a huge adventure had just happened, how can you go back to your normal life? You made courages friendships, with man, drawf and elf. Now you're back with hobbits, I saw their expressions in the pub, just before Sam got married (yeah all the girls cheered) I know how they feel, The adventure was EPIC, the adventure was Amazing, it's sad to watch the movies all in a row, I know I will cry when I do (not only because my ass will hurt from 9-13 hours either. My uncle asked me a year ago, what movie has changed my life, what movie made me look at movies in a different way. I didn't know the answer yet, he told me for him it was Star Wars, his whole generation loves Star Wars. Well, there is a new generation. Lord of the Rings has and will change the way we look at movies today. It has a new following (yeah, someone dressed up as a hobbit). I will have these films on DVD, Extended Edition. a friend today asked me four questions. Was it good? YES. Good enough for Best Picture? Yes. Good enough for Best Director? Yes. Where did you sit? In a bad spot. 10/10
10.0~By far the best of the trilogy supersonic1425 Sign in Permalink There's so much to say about this film, but I'm sure someone else has already said it better, so I'll just add my quick opinion. This is quite possibly, the best film I've ever seen in the last couple of years. The original first got me to read the books, and by the 2nd one, I had finished the books. I knew what was going to happen in this one all along, and yet I was still extremely satisfied. I can only say this. If I knew what was going to happen, then I can only imagine that it will be much, much better for those who don't know what happens.
10.0~All you have to decide............. robinanng Sign in Permalink is what to do with the time given to you...(Gandalf) The crazy week before Christmas and I have spent 7 hours in the theatre ( 2 viewings), not to mention more time coming here, reading people's reactions. I have to drag myself off this computer, and my head out of the ROTK book again!, and get Santa done some time. Just can't seem to let it go...... I posted a comment after the first viewing. Unfortunately IMDB put it on the ROTK gaming site. After my second viewing I have different stuff. Loved it more second time around as my anxiety of what was left in and what was left out (from the books) was over. I relaxed and cried and cheered and adored it. (Spoilers ahead) Humble disagreements: 1. Faramir should have been more fully realized in movie. He was a grand character I missed seeing more of. 2. The scenes of the pirate ships coming in- should have been more dramatic, it was a awesome, tear jerking part in the book. 3. Somehow condense the final endings, but I don't know how, as they are important and were very good. Just choppy or something. 4. Get rid of the few comic lines from Gimli/Legolas. They work in the context of the book, but in the movie, take away from the dramatic impact of most scenes. Those few minor things aside, I loved: 1. The Beacon Fires; blew me away. 2. The scene with Faramir and his dad- then following-Pippin singing that melancholy tune as Faramir's army rides to their slaughter. 3. Gandalf and Pippin in the hall talking about death-gave me hope! 4. The rallying cries of Aragorn and Theoden pre-battle. Very powerful and moving. 5. Eowyn and Merry on the horse, the looks of horror and fear on their faces when they view the vast army of orcs before them, and Miranda Otto's dialogue to Merry, "Have courage for your friends." Very moving. 5. The Characters; not one performance was less that fabulous, making these movies what they are. Special kudos to Sam in this third part. I adore these books, I loved the movies. I am sad the adventure is over.

10.0~The Greatest Film of All Time GANDALFtolkienJW Sign in Permalink This movie wraps up three years of epic storytelling. It began with The Fellowship of the Ring, continued with The Two Towers, and finally ends with The Return of the King. Not only is the Lord of the Rings the greatest trilogy ever made, in my opinion, but it is also the most emotional, powerful, and visually satisfying story ever to be brought to film. These films should go down in history as the most epic movies of their age, past ages, and hopefully for many ages to come. The Return of the King is easily the best of the three. It could stand alone as The Greatest Film of All Time in my book. I was emotionally moved (I CRIED) by the whole thing and its powerful ending. Peter Jackson is a genius, and I salute him. Hail King Peter Jackson!
10.0~the greatest in the 2000s usernamekeithnathanielalyanase Sign in Permalink The greatest! Ultimately rewatchable again and again super fun for the whole family resolves the whole trilogy nicely.

10.0~A long awaited end... thniels Sign in Permalink ...not just of this trilogy but also a milestone in movie making. ***possible minor spoilers*** This third installment was as beautifully rendered as those preceding it but also a wonderful tying of a knot bringing the story together. We met Shelob in the most realistic giant spider ever to have thrilled a movie audience. We got to see brilliant acting from a CGI figure in a two sided and expressive Gollum. Massive battles and orcs actually performing before the camera instead of simply being slaughtered. We saw many things we already knew well from the books and dreaded to see spoiled. But none were. What we didn't see and what surprised me much was the demise of Saruman and his sneaky vengeance. The book has an interesting effect on the reader in this part in that the climax seems to have passed and all is well, when suddenly Galadriel's prophecies come true and hope is seemingly lost. A true roller coaster climax. Must we wait for the DVD to see that? This is where one movie making milestone is set. With this trilogy the DVDs supersedes the theater version. We've had extended versions and extra material before, but never such hefty focus on the DVD media as this. In some ways I find this a pity. The cinema screen is on the smaller side, how small is not the TV screen compared to this? There have been many scenes left out like this one, but none that I have missed this much. The entire trilogy considered, this was an immense joy to watch. Characters were true to the book and to my own private visualizations formed over countless readings since my childhood. There were aspects of the story that could never make it to a movie and passages that had to be left out and I really think Peter Jackson made a good job of doing that. Sure, he made a few wrong turns and left out important details and added some that I find distracting but few were alarming and I am happy not to have had to be the one to do it. A few details readily in mind are these in particular: 1) The monsters, i.e. vargs, trolls etc. were sentient beings in the story. This is not in harmony with them being pictured in the movie as domesticated animals in orc service, like the orcs riding vargs in battle. 2) I always saw (and maybe wrongly so) the oliphants (and the [po]tatos) as a subtle link to our world. Something recognizable that would bring a bit of a chuckle reading about them and suggest to us that Middle Earth was not an entirely different universe from ours. The oliphants in the movie, however, are humongous and simply unbelievable in their weird appearance. I would much rather they had been plain old vanilla elephants. 3) Frodo was a burdened character but not a weak one. He had the weaknesses of a hobbit, true, but nothing that wouldn't turn to his advantage once in a while. In the movie the heavy load of carrying the ring is by no means evident and soon you grow tired with always seeing a debilitated Frodo where in fact he should be simply worn-out. He could easily have been made stronger without jeopardizing the sympathetic bond between the characters. All short comings aside, this was a once in a lifetime experience. I have never had a movie have this effect on me as this trilogy had. Thomas Nielsen
10.0~Unbelievable (minor spoiler) MDMeridius Sign in Permalink I'll make this short. For both other films, I found myself being very critical and not crazy over them until I saw them more... and I liked them more and more. I have only seen this film once, and already I love it more than the others. It's a near-perfect finale. The performances, the scope of the story, the emotions, the wonderful themes of loyalty and good vs evil, and more, combine to make a masterpiece. Having read the books and being a huge fan, sometimes it's hard not to be too critical, but with this film I didn't find myself questioning the screenwriting or direction at all... or the effects. My only gripe I think is how Denethor is handled. This is a common gripe i think and let's face it... if some details had to be cut, which they did, he was what had to go. But to add to that, what I think SHOULD have in fact been cut was the jumping off the cliff in flames...Unnecessary and kinda goofy. Running further into the tomb or whatever it was would have been plenty, just as if not more dramatic, and more like the book. So, even with any of my gripes included, this movie rocked. A full Four Stars. If this doesn't clean up at the Academy...
10.0~The best film i have ever seen! gerhardpojendan Sign in Permalink This is the best film! Wonderful landscapes, great mythology and good actors!
10.0~awesome 11_anne_07 Sign in Permalink This movie was absolutely amazing! I went on opening night at 12:01am and let me tell you, the theatre was packed!!! I'm so glad to see all these dedicated fans... I'm not alone! haha. Let me tell you, I had HIGH expectations for this movie and Peter Jackson didn't disappoint! It was awesome. The artwork in this trilogy NEVER stops amazing me. And the actors... WOW! Especially Elijah, Sean, Andy, and Billy. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is DEFINITELY an AWESOME ending to this trilogy. If you guys haven't seen it yet GO NOW !!! Hope you'll all enjoy it as much as I did. I'm really hoping that LOTR will finally get the Oscar that it so greatly deserves.
10.0~Definitely worth the sore butt themarina1 Sign in Permalink OK. So 4 hrs (after all the adds and the previews...) without a bathroom break break was really long. And yes, it was hot and crowded. Yes, the lineup was an hour and 30 mins long and yes, my butt was really, really sore. It was all worth it. What was started 3 years ago is over. Finally? No. I'm going to miss the excitement of seeing what comes next (even through I already knew) the bottom line is that this was a great finale to one of the greatest epics of our time. Go out. See it with your kids. Introduce them to movie making the way it should always be. Enjoy. 10/10
10.0~Say 'friend' and enter Edu-16 Sign in Permalink Comments on the now completed film - not just ROTK. Say 'friend' and enter, else let your prejudice prevent your respecting what is categorically the greatest cinematic achievement to date. Imagine having the arrogance to believe that you have the vision and imaginative energy to put together a ten hour film that does justice to the seminal work of fantasy literature..... Take a step back my cynical friends and measure this extraordinary accomplishment against the mountains of uninspired patronizing Holywood rubbish with which we are daily assailed. Consider the sheer hotspur and determination required to see the work to it's conclusion and to remain consistent and steadfast to the vision over many years. Think of the thousands of actors and technicians with whom you must have the energy and communication skills to share your vision. No. No one has come close to this as an achievement. Even if the end product were merely 'so so', I'd be saying the same thing. But regardless of the quibbles that you are bound to have with something this provocative - Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings' is a far better movie than anything this long has a right to be. LOTR is comparable in breadth and success with Wagner's Ring Cycle, or the Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel and with Tolkien's original novel of course. To bring together convincingly all the elements required to make the film a success is no less a worthy achievement than these 'gesumptkunstwerk'. Many criticisms arise from judging the three movies separately. This is incredibly unfair imho. The ending of ROTK is not too long when considered the end of a ten hour movie. Similarly, the final Opera of Wagner's Ring cycle is fairly pointless without the proceeding three, and is rarely performed or judged on it's own. (Now Im not a Wagner nut myself - but this doesn't stop me from appreciating what is an incredible work of art.) It's a shame that small, rather petty prejudices - born often out of loyalty to other movies as much as basic 'fantasyphobia' - prevent some (a tiny minority for sure) from appreciating the film for what it is. I'd ask the cynics to take the time and effort to stand back and admire LOTR from an objective distance. For some this is a long walk. However the view, like the location in which it was shot, is breathtaking.
9.0~Great eye? NonSaCoS Sign in Permalink This is a great movie, it's not the best one of the three but still. Peter Jackson has done a great job making the film but there is one thing that's making upset and that's this "great eye". Its not a eye here, more like a light that searches on the ground, it made me laugh the first time I saw it. I have no idea why he made it look like that but I guess (hope) he had a good reason. The scean where Frodo and Sam destroyed the ring are really good better then I ever could have hope. The big spider was really nice too, not only nice graphics, she looked just like I had imagined when I read the books. I gave it 9/10, one of the best movies I have ever seen.
10.0~excellent movie kung_fu978 Sign in Permalink As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street. We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise. That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created. The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words. If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out). As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.
10.0~Absolutely Incredible caliburnknight Sign in Permalink This is movie-making history for all the right reasons. I'm definitely going to see it again! I'm a huge fan of fantasy and this trilogy tops the lot. I'd have to say that of the 3 films, ROTK is the best as it has a bit of everything here; so many different emotions are felt, FOTR follows closely behind, as it is a great introduction to all the characters and it has the feel-good feel of Hobbiton to begin with and the ethereal feelings of Rivendell and Lothlorien. TTT isn't quite as good as the other two when put side by side, but take nothing away from it - it's still brilliant! I have all the books, The Hobbit included, but haven't read any of them yet. I've got part way through The Hobbit. I just wish that Peter Jackson and his team could have done four films with The Hobbit being the first, but I suppose that was asking too much! Maybe we will see it in the near future. So, back to ROTK. Some people have said the ending was too long. Well, I don't think so - it was definitely required. Plus, I can't wait for the extended DVD! The battle sequences were so impressive, especially the Mumakil. There was humour in places with Legolas and Gimli. The witch king was great - the essence of evil. And when he died, it was though his soul had been crushed - loved that bit! The scenery and photography was the best I have seen in any film and the sets were magnificent, perfect. The actors all had their parts to play and they played them to perfection, especially Sam, although the others were fantastic! So, all in all, the Return of The King will live long in the memory. May this masterpiece become the greatest movie of all time. That accolade would not be too high, would it?
7.0~The World's Longest Ending! masked_reviewer Sign in Permalink After a brilliant run - The Return of the King is a fulfilling yet disappointing experience. The biggest challenge was: how do you top 2 great movies? The cracks begin to show in this almost perfect moviegoing experience. It feels like they rushed this one. In between the horses galloping out of a castle here and galloping to another castle there - I sense some fatigue on the part of the filmmakers. There's more time spent in setting up the big battles than telling a story. The problem with Pt. 3 is that the same tricks don't work anymore. They've turned into cliches. The Return of the King reminded me in different parts of Rawhide, the 7th Voyage of Sinbad and Braveheart all rolled into one. The majesty and grandeur has by and large become a teary overwrought, sentimental affair. How many times can you handle Frodo shivering like a junkie and crying with Sam? There are more scenes of people hugging and crying in this movie than I can count. The storytelling has given way to endless battle scenes ad nauseum. The battles are definitely exciting but look similar to part 2. More disappointingly, the characters haven't progressed much in general with some exceptions. The result is everyone looks more cardboard and cartoony than usual. More backstory or added layers would have been welcome instead of the Universal Studios Theme Park approach. I liked them as fantasy characters but seriously portrayed. And why did they dump Christopher Lee? There seems to be no reason except that he had no real contact with anyone. At 3.5 hours - they could and should have found a place for him in there. Instead, the scenes are overlong and Peter Jackson tortures the audience with false ending after false ending. This Lord of the Rings episode is done to excess, but still stirs the heart in places. I do wish they'd lopped off 90 minutes, but there you go, warts and all. Still a tough act to pull off.
10.0~The Greatest Movie of All Time prabhatrayal Sign in Permalink It is one of those films that never get old. It is a brilliant adaption of a great novel. I think Lord of The Rings is the greatest film of all time. I will give you the reasons. This is about the whole trilogy and not just a single film. *********MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD************** Reasons:: 1- People used to say, it was unfilmable. The novels are really complex. You will need multiple readings to understand them completely. The world that Tolkien created is huge, there are dozens of characters and each one of them is important. To know more about the some characters, you will have to read The Silmarillion which is one of the most complex books ever written. So you simply can't make a good movie because you have to take care of many things. You have to remove unnecessary things, give the characters proper screen time and take care of the details.Many people tried to convert the novel into a movie, but no one could do it like Peter Jackson did. He gave importance to each and every character and you can't really complain about anything (I still wish to see Tom Bombadil) And it's a single movie divided into three movies. 2- Brilliant direction, Acting, Music, makeup, editing, cinematography, adapted screenplay, jaw-dropping visuals (I am yet to see a battle as big as battle of Pelennor fields and helm's deep ) and almost everything that makes a movie great. 3- It's emotionally powerful - If scenes like "My friends, you bow to no one", "Go Home, Sam", "Boromir's Death", "I can't carry it for you but I can carry you" "Home is Behind, The World Ahead" and "For Frodo" don't make you cry then I don't know what will. Its not a serious movie, there are also some funny moments. 4- It's visually spectacular - remember Minas Tirith, Fell beasts, Epic Battles, Helm's Deep, Isengard, Balrog and the best one "Gollum" played by Andy Serkis? He deserved an Oscar for that role. 5- Acting is brilliant and every character plays his/her role wonderfully. I loved Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom the most. 6- It gives me goosebumps every time I watch it. Some awesome scenes are - You shall not pass, King Theoden's Speech, Ride of Rohirrim, and Aragorn's speech in front of Black Gate but there are many more. I have watched the whole Trilogy (Extended Edition) more than 25 times and I am yet to find a movie which is better than LOTR. Some movies are better in terms of direction, cinematography, screenplay etc. but LOTR is a complete package. It's 11 hours of awesomeness. When I watched it for the first time, I was in 9th class and I started having dreams about middle earth. I dreamed about fighting for Aragorn. It had a great impact on me. Some people think it's lengthy, but I wish there was more. My friend didn't watch it for 3 years saying it's too long. After 3 years, he watched the complete trilogy, and He wouldn't stop talking about it. So if you are one of those who haven't seen it. Take your time and watch it. It is a MASTERPIECE.
7.0~A little long-winded in setting the finale up, but the second half is utterly spectacular jimbo-53-186511 Sign in Permalink The final part of this epic trilogy sees Gandalf, Legolas, Aragorn and others battling Sauron and his evil army. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam with Gollum in tow are heading towards Mount Doom to destroy the ring. Frodo and Sam's task seems straight-forward, but the pair are blissfully unaware of Gollum's plans and the danger that lies ahead for them. Jackson has clearly upped the ante here and anyone who thinks that the first two films are big spectacles really needs to take a look at this film; it's visuals are arguably more striking than the previous outings and the special effects are perhaps bigger and better than the previous films. It's clear when watching this trilogy that Jackson is a good filmmaker and seems to have a love for filmmaking in general. Many people will see this as a positive, and to a large extent it is, but I can't help but feel that sometimes he gets a bit wrapped up in the effects side of things and less so in the narrative. This, to me, is more evident in the first half of the film where it takes an awfully long time to actually set the story up (complete with needless flashbacks which just confused things more than anything). Although the setup is overlong thankfully the story arc involving Frodo, Sam and Gollum was much stronger, more focused & much more interesting in this film than it was in The Two Towers. Frodo effectively ends up torn between the two of them most of the time creating a rather interesting dynamic between the three of them which was always engrossing to watch. Where the film truly comes good is in the battle sequences that we see in the second half of the film and all I'll say is that they do make it worth your while sitting through the rather elongated setup to the story. Although there are battle sequences in the previous two films they are nothing compared to the spectacular battles that you'll see here - the battle sequences are bigger in scale and much more exciting and intense than in the previous two films and once battle commences it is utterly sublime. TROTK is a very good end to a good trilogy and my only real gripe with it lay with its long-winded setup - it's seems that upping the ante with bigger and better effects has the knock on effect of a longer screenplay. At the end of the day although it is a long film it's never boring and it does at least reward the viewer's patience with some exciting and nail-biting set-pieces in its closing stages. As a side note I'm also pleased that Jackson finally got his best picture Oscar for TROTK after being nominated for the first two films but failing to win it.
1.0~The final installment in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy jjdeagle Sign in Permalink This film won 11 Oscars including best Picture. The Return of The King is an awful film. At well over three hours, it is an exercise in boredom. Orlando Bloom and Viggo Moretensen are completely miscast. The story does not make sense and the characters are contrived. It is like playing a bad video game. So many actors are wasted in this colassal disaster. Peter Jackson, winner of the Best Director Academy Award, seems as though he thought that his film was too precious to edit. The film goes on and on and on. Weak acting all around. The film relies on special effects to cover for a script that is completely pretentious. The musical score is like listening to someone scratching a chalkboard.
10.0~The Greatest Film of All Time!!! Elijahs_Girl Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is by far the greatest film of all time!!! It is a mixture of every genre imaginable. I plan to see it many more times. The battle scenes are epic and the acting is just incredible. I cried like a baby at the end of the film. I must say to all, that once you see this movie, you will never be the same.
6.0~The hype kills it. The best of the series, but not a great movie, and not in the league with the likes of "The Godfather" -- how cliched a statement is that? It's true. MovieAddict2016 Sign in Permalink Before I review this good movie, I have to get something that's been bothering me off my chest. I went with eight people to see "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King." All eight of them found it "good" at best. We all thought it was too long, with too many passages of dialogue explaining what was going to happen ("I ride to Minis Tirith at dawn to face the enemies of Middle-Earth!" -- just do it already!), too many scenes that most definitely could have been cut or edited, and we all found that the ending of the film stretched on too long and we didn't need to see Frodo and Sam fondly gazing at each other ninety times before we got the idea that they have an affection for each other. (Brotherly love or...something else?) The thing is, all the "Lord of the Rings" movies are good. But none of them are great. Filmed by Peter Jackson with an epic feeling that betrays J.R.R. Tolkien's light-hearted tale, the films try to take a somewhat light idea and turn them into epics -- a problem, since the entire world is fantasy, and it is hard to take anything in the film dreadfully serious. (I thought it was just I, but some other critics have noted the same problem.) This is the best "Lord of the Rings" movie. Even though it sounds as if I am complaining about them, I am not. I'm complaining about the way movie geeks flock to the cinemas and spread word that it's the "best film of all time," then post these comments on the Internet and try to boost the film's rating on IMDb. (Some fans have been caught in the act of making multiple usernames to do so.) I find it almost laughable that anyone could argue that the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is the best of all time, or that it is the better than "The Godfather" (because that film stands as the number one film on the Internet Movie Database, there are heated debates from "Rings" fans claiming that "The Godfather" is trash and their favorite film is not). It's all opinion, of course, but I sometimes wonder whether the fans of "The Lord of the Rings," those who claim they are superior to "The Godfather," have even seen that film. I also wonder whether the strict fans that claim it is the best film ever made have actually seen enough films to qualify for that assumption -- if it is their favorite film, fine, but to say it is THE best film of all time is entirely their opinion, although they seem to take it as a fact. Have they seen the films of Fellini? Kurosawa? Scorsese? Coppola? "Citizen Kane"? "Casablanca"? "Taxi Driver"? "Sweet Smell of Success"? "To Kill a Mockingbird"? "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"? "Chinatown"? "Apocalypse Now"? "2001: A Space Odyssey"? The list goes on! Their definitions of classics range from the time of "Star Wars" to present cinema. It may sound like an old argument but it's true -- greater films are harder to find nowadays, and just because "The Lord of the Rings" seems like an achievement of some sort, it does not make it the best film of all time. I can name many better films. But, then again, it's my opinion, I suppose. Now that I'm done with my rant, there's nothing left to say. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) venture closer to Mordor to destroy The One Ring, while Gollum (Andy Serkis) plots to murder them both and take the Ring of Power for himself. (We get to see Gollum's background in the film, too, which is something that will satisfy Tolkien's fans that have read the stories.) Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) returns to the throne of a kingdom (hence the title of the film) to claim his position as heir of Isildur, but first gathers together Legolas and Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) to help battle the Orcs venturing closer to their castle, along with Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), who opens a can of whoop [butt] in this movie. This is the darkest film of the trilogy. You may have thought "The Two Towers" was dark, but "The Return of the King" is almost evil -- Frodo gives audiences the creeps a few times. When he says, "The Ring is mine," and grins at Sam with the Elijah Wood grin, a shiver goes down your spine. The film picks up pace starting with the giant arachnid battle, about halfway through the film, and continues down the path of mild greatness until the last twenty minutes, which never seem to end. It is as if Jackson was afraid to close his film for a final time and kept dragging the scenes out -- I don't need to see Frodo and Sam admiring each other more than twice! As the credits rolled, the audience poured out of the theater. "Wasn't that good?" I heard someone say. "No," was the reply. "The Return of the King" is a very good film, and certainly the best of the trilogy, but don't be fooled by the hype -- this is not one of the best films of all time. It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- some day, someone's going to realize that what they're going on about isn't really there at all. And finally all the film fans will be able to say, "Y'know, I never really loved the movie all that much anyway." But for now, I guess we'll all have to put up with more unearned hype. I liked this movie. I liked it a lot at certain points. But I would never, ever call it great. That's just me, I guess. 4.5/5 stars. John Ulmer
6.0~How dare they cut out Christopher Lee!! genrommel Sign in Permalink I am going to keep this short and sweet. As per the now common LOTR receipt we have exotic shots, sweeping battle scenes, fabulous acting and wonderous special effects. Never the less this film never ends! Just when you think it has ended and you feel satisfied the screen fades to black and we're back at "the shire" once again. Peter Jackson is an excellent director but why do have to see a useless plot point such as Sam's home and family when all of Christopher Lee's scenes, including an elaborate death scene, are left on the cutting room floor? Jackson claimed the choice was a simple matter of viewing time. Yes the film is too long and needed to be trimmed down. sadly it would seem they made all the wrong cuts which puts a severe hampering on this final installment in the trilogy.
10.0~An excellent ending for an excellent adventure Milhouse_Van_Houten_ Sign in Permalink I had high, high hopes and expectations for this movie. As a fan of both the books and the movie, I was anxious to see this tale portrayed beautifully and truthfully on the big screen... and boy, did it deliver! At no time did I feel let down or unsatisfied, the whole experience wrapping up the adventure nicely. I can't wait to see it again, and again and again! P.S. I wonder if they'll have an extended edition? I didn't mind the length of this movie (hey, I didn't want it to end), but if it gets any longer, I'll need to bring along a cushion!
7.0~good, for a "blockbuster" seth-meiser Sign in Permalink as blockbusters go, this was above average, but as a Tolkien loving boy, my hopes were slightly dashed by the exclusion of amazing scenes and beautiful duologue which is specific to the book. all in all my least favorite of the three films, and ironically rated the highest. peter jackson is not what i would consider aptly picked to direct these movies. there are many awkward and quick camera changes and some bad green screen work in all three movies, a signature, in my mind of a less mature director. I'm sure people would like to point out all of the other films he has directed but few of them have been in the vein and trend of sweeping fantasy epics. viggo mortensen plays an amazing lead man with support from Rhys Davies. theodons character is also brought to life vividly from the pages of the book. and there is some marvelous cinematography in many scenes. another minor grievance i have with the movies follows the tarrantino philosophy: why add back scenes left on the cutting room floor? you should have made the movie you wanted to the first time around. i am particularly harsh of movies, so to receive a seven is a blessing this is a positive review, so please, no angry emails. i enjoyed this movie nearly more than any other which came out in its year.
10.0~The most rewarding movie experience ever. daimon1313 Sign in Permalink The credits were rolling. The epic orchestral arrangement blasted through the theatre. And I found myself wanting to read every name that was involved in making this masterpiece of a movie. I read Tolkien's books when I was in sixth grade, nearly ten years ago, when my teacher assigned us to read THE HOBBIT. From that point on, I was hooked. No other fantasy story has ever lived up to the scope of Tolkien's vision, and I found all other fantasy wannabes paled in comparison. When I learned that this fantastic story was being made into a trilogy, I was apprehensive at first, then excited. I was curious to see how it would be brought to the big screen, how this story would finally be brought to the masses. I will skip praising the greatness of the first two films. That goes without word. But the Great thing about The Return of the King is that it makes the first two films even better. Peter Jackson's vision of an epic story is finally in its full form, and when viewed in its entireity, this has unarguably become the greatest trilogy ever filmed. Name me one trilogy where the final film was the best one of the bunch.... There will be those out there that are p***ed because certain parts of the book have been cut out. That is to be expected though. How many people are willing to sit in a crowded theatre for 4+ hours? Not many, Myself included. I will happily wait for the extended version on DVD, that I can watch comfortably in my own home. The Return of the King seems to be the most emotional movie ever. Elation, sorrow, joy, terror, amazement, awe, sadness, confusion, and dumfounded all come to mind. The acting was absolutely incredible, these guys act like they were born to play these characters, and if sean astin does not win an award, there is a vast conspiracy in the movie agency. He made me feel so much for Sam and Frodo. The directing was groundbreaking. Where else can you find a movie where when most of the audience knows exactly how it ends, and yet is still able to build nail-biting suspense? And that ties into the action/special effects. I am notoriously not in favor of large amounts of special effects, but peter Jackson manages to keep the action grandiose, and still at a personal level with the main characters. I am still in awe of how he was able to seamlessly blend in the close ups with the vast battle field sequences. Now, was this movie perfect? By no means. I could sit here and nitpick it to death. But the infinite small details do not matter, because after all, it is the feeling the film gives you inside that matters most 10/10
10.0~Breathtaking! g-bodyl Sign in Permalink The Return of the King is the best movie ever made to the best trilogy ever done. This movie deserved the eleven Oscars it got including the Editing. Without the editing, this movie would've been over four hours long. Even though this movie is about three and a half hours, it dies not feel like it. The scenes are intense and can tend to be emotional. Gollum is the show-stealer again. As the ring is taking Frodo away from strength, Gollum uses that to get the ring back eventually and drive Sam away. It was kind of sad to see Gollum die along with the Ring in the fires of Mt.Doom. Aragorn deserves to be king of Gondor. He was amazing in this movie(played by Viggo Mortensen). I am glad that Legolas and Gimli were used for comedy. With all the drama and action, there needs to be a bit of comedy before the action overwhelms the movie. The acting is perfect. I liked most of the characters. It was sad when Theoden died. He was great in this series. The music by Howard Shore is even better. You can hear some Celtic tunes during some scenes. I loved the song, "Into The West" by Annie Lennox. The effects and the CGI is excellent especially during the battle scenes towards the end. Peter Jackson really put his name into the record books. This is the best fantasy epic, in fact the best movie of all time. I rate this movie 15/10(if the rating system went any higher).
10.0~For those who don't get it... ChrisW42 Sign in Permalink Having read some of the comments regarding 'The Return of the King', there are one or two that I find quite startling. Firstly, I couldn't believe that anybody would go to see this film without having seen the first two in the trilogy. 'The Two Towers' doesn't include a recap of the events in its predecessor, and neither does this one. How on earth could you expect to enjoy the film on the same level? These are not three separate stories: they are one tale told in three episodes. The multiple endings are not meant to wrap up a standard two-hour movie: by the time the extended version is available it will be the closing act of what is effectively one film that is eleven hours long. (One of the book's final chapters, 'The Scouring of the Shire', was omitted from this adaptation as it was not the main climax to the story.) Mention of the book leads to my second point, regarding those who accuse Peter Jackson of plagiarising the works of George Lucas. These claims obviously hail from those who have never read a literary classic in their life, and believe that there was no such thing as fantasy before 'Star Wars'. 'The Lord of the Rings' (in case you didn't know) is a novel by J.R.R. Tolkien that is split into three volumes; they were published in 1954 and 1955. Furthermore, it was written as a kind of sequel to 'The Hobbit', by the same author, published in 1937. Peter Jackson, whilst taking some necessary liberties with his version, has stuck closely to the original. So it could be argued, for example, that the respective 'demises' of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn while, in each case, witnessed by their younger companion are heavily influenced by the events in the Mines of Moria in 'The Fellowship of the Ring'- and not the other way around. 'The Lord of the Rings' can represent many things to many people, but there are two meanings of the title that are universally acknowledged: it is one of the best trilogies you will ever read; it is also probably the finest one you will ever see. Congratulations to Peter Jackson, his co-writers, cast and crew for creating an amazing movie-going experience.
10.0~Earth's Gift to the Universe ellisonhorne Sign in Permalink 10 out of 10! The world of film-making can be as complex as the stars, just ask any good producer/director. However as a viewer, film conveys the power of storytelling nothing else can match. And when movies are as good as the "Rings" films are, the power of story becomes timeless--past, present, future, are all embodied, the life-force is revealed, the human soul is enriched and evolves. Such are the Rings'. I hope everyone has a chance to experience these highest examples of what film has to offer the human experience. Peter Jackson is a master, bringing all the elements together as only a master can: story, sets, editing, photography, actors, music, lighting, costumes, and most of all, directing.
10.0~A Perfect Ten joekay Sign in Permalink About half an hour removed from seeing "Return of the King" movie for the first time, I am quite convinced of it being "a ten," but also of its place in cinematic history: one of the greatest adventure film of all time, right up there with Empire Strikes Back, which I often declare as my favorite movie of all time. It is a wonderful adaptation of Tolkien's tale: all three were pretty good at this, but "Return of the King" stands out. Battles are more spectacular, tensions are going through the roof, and even acting performances were quite sublime; it's a quality not many look for or expect out of fantasy action films, but one that highly improves them nevertheless. The movie hits at all levels: action, suspense, mystery, joy and sadness among many emotions that it resonates. We laugh and (some of us) cry with the characters. We love the good and disparage the evil. The battles not only entertain us but also enhance these human elements of the tale, and that is something that's done quite rarely. Three and a half hours flew by, and I was left quite mesmerized. And then wanting to see the deleted scenes that will eventually be added to the upcoming extended version. But first of all, I will go and see it again on big screen.
10.0~Now I See What The Hype Is All About... lonestarangel007 Sign in Permalink When the first LotR came out, I was one of the few people who didn't know that it had. Seriously. I remember some trailers on television about a movie about a ring, but that's it. Even the second movie went unnoticed by me. I still had no idea who Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, or Viggo Mortensen was. I was totally clueless about two of the greatest movies of all time. When the third one came out, I actually noticed a lot of the hype about it. How could I not? I still didn't think the movie would interest me. Plus it was 3+ hours long, and I wasn't going to sit for that long in a theater. That all changed when I caught "The Fellowship" on television. I absolutely fell in love with the movie, and I rented "The Two Towers" the next week. Now I couldn't wait for "Return of the King" to come out on DVD (I still wasn't going to sit in a theater for the whole thing). When it finally came out... to put it simply, there is no way to convey simply how breathtaking that movie was. It was... AMAZING. I fell in love with it at once. Th plot was wonderful; I liked how there were two separate journeys going on, with one common goal in mind. The actors were terrific. There's no doubting that this one is the best out of the three. I guess it is because the whole trilogy is just one BIG movie split up into three parts, and the climax is "RotK". If you don't understand what all the hype is about and haven't watched the movie, please do. You will soon understand.
10.0~Bah to Naysayers chirpie Sign in Permalink Saw the midnight showing last night. I was worried about what audience I would get. (It's good to have an enthusiastic crowd but I didn't want hecklers...) They were all great. Bah to all the naysayers. I was glued to my seat. Surely there were improvements to be had but I was having way to much fun just watching the movie. For every Elephaunt (misspelled I'm sure) crashing into another I was feeling like a kid again. Grinning ear to ear. I'll consider myself lucky since I never read the books and don't have the burden of my imagination to contend with like others do. I'm sad it's all over but soon I'll have a wonderful DVD trilogy sitting on my shelf that I can revisit any time I darn well please. Kudos to all involved. I had my fun, and only wish I had this much of a rush everytime I stepped into the multiplexes.
10.0~The Great Epic of our Time MayorWilkins502 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings is the greatest 9 hour movie (12 for the Extended Editions)of my lifetime. The performances are amazing. Knods to Sean Astin (Sam), Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and Bruce Spence (The Mouth of Sauron in the Extended Edition. The battle sequences are jaw dropping and you never want them to end but of course they do. Some of the best Sequences are (SPOILERS!) the Eowyn v Witchking battle, the Mouth of Sauron, The Battle of Pelinor Fields and The Black Gate opens. The only pity about return of the king is the fact that Christopher Lee is missing from the film. But when the Extended Edition comes out, this will be fixed. As for those who complain about the long ending, they really don't understand first that that is how the book ends and secondly, no one wanted it to end if they really loved it as much as I do. And remember that if this were accurate to the letter of the text, the Scouring of the Shire would have taken at least 15 minutes more of the time. But personally, I think that the movies are better than the books and they are true classics. Nothing will ever come close. 10\10
10.0~Great galloping Oliphaunts. . . Carnimirie Sign in Permalink ********SOME SPOILERS THROUGHOUT****** I went to see this film for the first time by myself, because one of my good friends who wants to see it with me tends to talk at the movies. Knowing this, I snuck off while she was away on vacation, so as to experience it once by myself, uninterrupted, so that later when we see it together and she does talk, I'll only be irritated rather than furious. But as I was leaving the theater, dazedly shaking my head, it occurred to me that my friends, who have never read the books and knew nothing about LOTR until I forced them to watch the first 2 parts of the movie trilogy, were going to ask me, their resident LOTR geek, what I thought of Peter Jackson's Return of the King. And the answer was, I really didn't know. I would in no way say that the film was bad. It was great. It had its moments of non-greatness (which I'll detail in a bit), but for the most part it was every bit as mind-blowing and fantastic as almost everyone is saying it is, and the whole trilogy is way up on my list of all-time favorites, and I can't wait for the extended DVD to come out (I agree with the person who commented that it will be nice to see which of the choppy bits --yes, there are choppy bits in a 210-minute movie!-- get filled in in the extended cut). But when asked, did I LIKE it, I would open my mouth and nothing at all would come out. Maybe I felt like it was "above my likes and dislikes", as Sam would say, but it just seemed the wrong question to ask about this film. So I went and saw it again. And now, I do like it. A lot. Nearly all of the bits that they tweaked from the book were done with great cinematic effect and without hurting the story. Most of the bits they left out were completely understandable as far as time and pacing went. Of the bits that they made up, the one where Frodo sends Sam home is the most effective. The others. . . Well, I did my Nitpicker's List for TTT, so I'll do it again for this one. Once again, in no order of importance: (1) Missing or changed lines from Tolkien (very small but memorable): Gimli saying "Well-earned? I can hardly believe that!"; Pippin saying "...until my lord release me, or death take me, or the world end"; Merry asking Piipin, "Are you going to bury me?" (2) It's a fabulous shot, and Frodo's face looks particularly angelic and beautiful in it, but how many times can you do the "slow-turn, closeup and wide-eyed stare over the right shoulder" thing before it becomes just a little bit hackneyed? (3) While I have no problem at all with all the "endings" --after all, these scenes were (with some tweaking in the coronation scene) ALL in the book (and Peter Jackson has left out the longest "ending" of all in the Scouring of the Shire), I don't feel that it was necessary to shoot them all in slow motion. There is enough heartstring-plucking stuff going on in all of it to smite the whole audience in real time. (4) No Scouring of the Shire. Saruman and Wormtongue are pooh-poohed and abandoned in Isengard. Hmm. (5) Eowyn is really the only character in the whole trilogy that the filmmakers have almost totally missed. Not Miranda Otto's fault --after listening to her comments on the extended DVD of TTT it is evident that she was never really given a direction for Eowyn and was constantly struggling to identify her character. Too bad. (6) Hopefully the extended DVD will show Eowyn giving up on Aragorn and turning to Faramir instead (not to mention Faramir's, and Merry's, recovery). (7) The scriptwriters hit people over the head every which way to explain why the Lords of the West ride out to the Black Gate after the battle of the Pelennor Fields. It's a diversion, to draw Sauron's attention away from Frodo and Sam. But even Gandalf says that Sauron won't bite on such a tiny threat. However, in the book Gandalf knows that Sauron knows that his enemies have the Ring and that one of them claims to be Elendil's heir. Therefore, if he sees a warrior doing something stupid like riding with a tiny force to the Black Gate and challenging him, Sauron, to come out, then that warrior has probably got the Ring on him. THEREFORE, Sauron will send EVERYBODY out of Mordor to go get it. Perfect explanation, provided by Tolkien --not used by Peter Jackson. (8) When did hobbits, who Tolkien goes out of his way to describe as terrified of even the smallest heights, become expert climbers? (9) The whole "Arwen is dying" thing. Although I can see how the scriptwriters sort of painted themselves into that one with the Arwen story as they made it up for TTT. You couldn't really have Elrond riding up to Dunharrow saying "You know, I wasn't going to help you save the world because I didn't want my daughter to marry you and die, but since she's chosen to be mortal whether I like it or not, uh, here's this sword." Speaking of which, Elrond can fight. If he's come all the way to Dunharrow, why doesn't he stay and help? (10) Hopefully the extended DVD will explain where the horses go that the Lords of the West ride out to the Black Gate. Is it me, or did I miss something? They ride to Mordor on horses. Aragorn and company ride up and address the Gate on horses. They see the Orcs coming, ride back, and Aragorn gives his troops a rousing speech from the back of his horse. Cut away to Frodo and Sam, then cut back to Aragorn, who hears the Eye calling his name from the Tower, stands mesmerized for a bit, then looks back at Gandalf, and with a soft smile dedicates this charge into certain death "for Frodo", then turns and rushes at the enemy --on foot. His troops all yell and RUN after him. Where did the horses go? In the DVD, does a Nazgul sweep down and scare all their horses into throwing their riders and running off? And do the Orcs then give all their enemies time to say "D'oh!", dust themselves off, and reform ranks? Hmm. And that's it. Still a great movie. I still cried the second time I saw it even though I've read the books a gazillion times and had just spotted a major continuity disaster. Sam in this film becomes the most like the Sam in the books and is fantastic. Elijah Wood's face is priceless. The effects and spectacles and all the bells and whistles are staggering. I loved Pippin's little song. I'm still going to go with my talking friend and see it for a third time as soon as possible.
10.0~When 3 and a half hours pass by in a flash... microbert777 Sign in Permalink ...and not because you are asleep. I have already seen this movie twice now. Although I admit to being something of a Tolkien fan and perhaps even more of a movie buff, I think the best testimony I can give to this film is the quickness in which time flows while watching it. And I intend to see it at least once more before the end of the year. Peter Jackson's crowning triumph to this trilogy has elevated the mark for fantasy film making so high, that it will be decades (probably closer to a century) before it can be bested. The blood, sweat, tears, and yes, love that went into the making of this epic has reached its inevitable climax in this film. If you have any sort of emotional investment in the two films leading up to this one, you will not be disappointed. Mr. Jackson, along with the help of so many others, has crafted a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Even after it is released on DVD's, it could be re-released in theatres every generation and capture a whole new audience. Our children and our children's children will benefit from this work of art as much or more than we will. Mr. Jackson certainly feels that way because of a certain liberty he has taken with all three films. Some filmmakers are renown for injecting themselves into their films, as Mr. Jackson did when he burped his derision at the critics during the first film. But he has taken this one step further by giving his children their own cameos in all of the films (they are noticeably older in this one). Only an artist supremely confident in his skill and the skill of his aides would do this. I think they will grow to be proud of their father's acheivement and appreciate that they have been immortalized in so special a way.
10.0~almost perfect dickbub@hotmail.com Sign in Permalink Spoiler free review I have read many reviews, at least 80 in the last two days and my expectations which were already high, even rose after doing that. Now that I have seen the film I have to admit that it was one of the best I have seen over the past few years. I think this film was equal to the fellowship of the ring and superior to the two towers. It was less ill-paced than TTT and it had the same warmth as FOTR. The only thing that annoyed me a little bit were the omissions made but I look forward to the EE and if the missing scenes appear there it will probably be better than the first instalment. I agree with most of the reviewers on this site, but there are some nitpickers and naysayers I want to ask a question. If you write that you found the first two instalments were crap why do you go to the movie theatre and watch the third too which you clearly knew would go in the same direction as the others did? And why do you watch it only one or two days after the release, witch means that you must have reserved the tickets at least a month before? I think I can give you the answer by myself. You are fans of the films but you just can't confess it! Maybe you have to increase you self-esteem by smashing down the movies which are acclaimed by the biggest part of the audience or by showing you nonconformity (which seems to be very cool and a duty nowadays). Or may be the lord of the rings just isn't enough `sophisticated' for cognitive capacity and you don't want to show in front of your friends that you liked it. It would not fit to your image. At any rate if you only go to the cinema to see and maybe write down in which scenes you could spot the blue boxes and some lights of the studio lamps in the eyes of the actors or something like that and for that reason try to make this movie look ridiculous then you can do that but don't come here to complain if you have nothing to say about the real quality of the film or how it affected you. I think Peter Jackson and the whole staff did their best to bring Middle Earth to life on the big screen and if the CGI doesn't look appropriate in every scene it's only because of the technical limits and we cannot reproach him for that. This books are fantasy. They do not have the ambition to be very sophisticated. I think one can say that they are the greatest achievement in fantasy literature but Tolkien didn't have the intention to place them among Immanuel Kant or Friedrich Nietzsche or even Aristotle in the `deepest books in history hall of fame'. He wrote the books with the single purpose of escapism and because he wanted to tell a complex and beautiful story which he found, didn't exist at that time. The same is with the films. If they are to childish for some viewers then they should watch Citizen Kane (which is my favourite film of all time) or Satyricon, and leave Jackson's trilogy aside. He made it for the fans (and maybe for his wallet to ;-)) and we should be thankful that it was realised by someone who was capable to catch the spirit of Tolkien quite good. So what I actually wanted to say is go to see the movie, enjoy it and decide for yourself if you like it or not. If yes, you can be very lucky about this Christmas gift if not, don't mind and have a nice Christmas time as well but do not misuse this forum for egoistic reasons! My rating (9/10)
3.0~too many close-ups flemingsd Sign in Permalink Mr. Jackson let us all down on this one. I sat through all three of these films before it hit me. I wasn't really enjoying them. Every dramatic moment was being thrown away because it was filmed as a close-up. Over and over again, the epic context was stripped away and all we got was big, blue eyes. People say they liked these films, but I don't think they know what they are missing. I sat there disappointed as each great moment in these stories passed by without soaring to any great emotional heights. It was flat as cardboard.

10.0~Sublime Alfonse Sign in Permalink You know a film like this is good when it goes on for over 3 hours and you still don't want it to end. I'm glad Peter Jackson won an Oscar for this film because it is, in my opinion, the finest film I've ever seen. People can wax lyrical about acting over special effects and gritty independent films but no-one has ever had the vision to put something together like this trilogy, and this final film in particular - it's simply stunning. I only hope and pray that someone gives Peter Jackson the money and facilities to make "The Hobbit" because any further addition to this series would be more than welcome. Warning: if you haven't seen the other two episodes in the trilogy, you will spoil the film experience of a lifetime by watching this first.
10.0~Perfect way to finish the trilogy Leofwine_draca Sign in Permalink Finally, the last movie in the series. Finally, Peter Jackson makes his intentions clear. Now we realise that the first two movies in this series were just the build up to this epic of a film. A masterful masterpiece, a flawless work of cinema whose only fault is that it seems too short. I don't have much to say about this; I don't want to spoil anything. But this is the big one. It completely blows the other two great movies out of the water. Suddenly, everything is more adult, more dramatic, and ten times the emotion. You could call it an emotional roller-coaster ride; certainly Jackson touches the nerves and heart-strings on more than one occasion. The centrepiece of the film is the battle for Minas Tirith, a huge war scene which features amazing special effects unlike anything ever seen before. An army of 300,000 riders on the heroes who defend their city with courage and spirit. Dragons fly down from the sky, huge boulders are tossed back and forth, and an army of trolls and oliphants are sent in to obliterate the heroes. Everything is dark and gruesome; Jackson reveals his origins by including many graphic and gruesome deaths which somehow make the 12A certificate a bit of a joke. Men are decapitated, crushed, impaled, and burnt. Heads fly over city walls and the viewer just sits and gapes at the magnificence of it all. The casting is excellent. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen come into their own. Billy Boyd is given serious stuff to deal with now, not just comic relief: his singing over the death of the soldiers is extremely moving and a stand against all generals who sit back and send their men to certain death. Miranda Otto comes into her own. The new character of Denethor is great, just as in the book. Legolas and Gimli are still there, although on the sidelines as always. But the real emotion comes from Elijah Wood and Sean Astin: this pair are brilliant, and their final journey to Mount Doom will bring tears to anybody's eyes through the heartache involved. Gollum is a force to be reckoned with this time and cannot be forgotten. After the slow build-up of the initial hour, things explode in cinematic heaven. The battles are amazing, topped by the arrival of the ghost army, sheer brilliance. Shelob is a wonderful special effect and extremely frightening. There is so much to love and thankfully the powerhouse ending doesn't disappoint. The only problem with this film is that it properly ends about 30 minutes before the credits, and Jackson fills the final 30 minutes with endless mawkish sentimentality which becomes truly sickening. Sadly, it doesn't spoil what's come before; I just tune out at this part.
4.0~More of the same desertdweller Sign in Permalink This movie is basically just more of the last hour of The Two Towers -- lots of CGI enhanced action with a lot of characters that have the same name as characters in Tolkien's books. One of the best characters, Gollum/Smeagol in The Two Towers is largely muted in this installation. In fact, Peter Jackson seemed to give up on character development altogether for the third film. Which is fine if one is only going in for a 90 minute film that doesn't have anything to do with one of the great novels of the 20th century. Unfortunately, The Return of the King doesn't fit that paradigm. My disappointment is only increased due to the fact that Fellowship of the Ring promised great things to come.
10.0~Jackson Five Jarofclay74 Sign in Permalink ... as in five stars for Peter Jackson's latest installment in the Lord of the Rings "trilogy". What a spectacular film! Visually stunning and breathtaking action sequences. The scriptwriters remain mostly faithful this time around to the source material. My main concern lies with the decision that was made to omit (in the theatrical version) the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue (the latest was such an interesting character in the second movie and was underused in the films). I certainly look forward to the extended edition set!
10.0~Simply the greatest movie I've ever seen. seventh_samurai54 Sign in Permalink I saw Return of the King on "Trilogy Thursday", and I was very nervous the whole day. The Fellowship of the Ring is a brilliant, intimate first chapter of the trilogy. The Two Towers is a geared up action spectacular second chapter. The final chapter of the greatest trilogy ever, is without a doubt my personal favorite of the three, and easily one of the greatest movies ever made. There is too much to say about this film. I can't even believe what Peter Jackson and every body that has worked on this film has done. They've created a classic film that will be remembered forever. Every actor in this film gives 100%. Most notable is Sean Astin as Sam, Frodo's faithful companion. Sam is easily my favorite character in this film. I don't know what else to say about this movie. It's epic. It's moving. It's the greatest movie ever made. I know that's a very bold statement, but I stand by it all the way. This film will live in my heart forever. Go see it, then go see it again. Thank you Peter Jackson & Co. for bringing to life the greatest adventure of all-time.
10.0~Incredible viewing experience ... 10/10 Churlish Sign in Permalink (Opening night, post-midnight showing, 5:00am) Only a very quick set of reactions, because I'm really tired: the film was amazing, incredible, mind-blowing, and every bit worthy of its hype (and then some). Personally I loved the long series of endings that seem to be the sticking point for most casual viewers All that went before redefined the word "spectacular." I was prepared for the alterations from the book, so I wasn't as annoyed as I was by The Two Towers. Would I have made different choices regarding the major changes Maybe; But then again, I could never have accomplished 0.000001% of what Jackson & Co. did -- even if I were given twice the resources that they were. Of course I missed the obvious scenes (EE or unfilmed): the confrontation with Saruman, the Houses of Healing, the Scouring, etc. Overall, however, I was thrilled with all that was retained. For the record, I also love the book and have read it numerous times. Contrary to extremist dogma, it IS possible to love both the book and the films.
10.0~This movie touched me njoseph-1 Sign in Permalink Fellowship Of The Ring was a tremendously great movie. It had the advantage of a peaceful introduction showing us the life of Hobbiton, before the impending doom of Mordor which only helped to re-inforce just how fragile life really is. The Two Towers was a dramatic second installment to this trilogy, the place where the ground usually starts to cave in. Luckily, this was not the case in the series. After seeing Return Of The King, all I can say is "wow". I went into the theatre fully expecting to see a movie that would top both FOTR and TTT. I got even more than I expected. I was very appreciative of the extra 30 minutes. It helped to wrap up the story properly. I have to admit that tears came to my eyes on several occasions during this film. The acting was real, the story was unparalleled.
10.0~The Everlasting Ending to the greatest fantasy trilogy of all time!!! capt-andy-hawk Sign in Permalink I cant believe it, i never heard of the books or movie after release of fellowship of the ring or two towers! Only in 2003 when the Return of king was about to release, when I watched the DVD of LOTR:FOTR expecting some fairy and gnome tales instead it was really interesting and wow, really from jolly hobbits to elves to dark forces, i loved the direction and the characters, then saw two towers on DVD, I watched the two movies over thrice, when the Return of King hit the cinemas, I grabbed the first show tickets and hit my seat early as possible, I had to admit it was the best movie i have ever seen in the cinema, At the End of movie I was surprised to find more than three hours passed! With an amazing story in such smooth flow, I appreciate Peter Jackson's direction and the way he has brought the characters and script out right from the lengthy Novel by J.R.R. Tolkien, outstanding performances by Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood, but more over all actors were gr8 in their respective roles. with outstanding visuals and battle scenes making this movie memorable. this all only motivated me to read the LOTR trilogy novels. A must See!!
10.0~Wonderfully made and the best movie of 2003 meghnasri-97601 Sign in Permalink The movie was so epic and it had a great ending. What made this movie so epic was the lack of courage this movie shows. The acting was wonderful, the battle scenes were epic especially the final battle. Peter Jackson is wonderful director and Elijah wood and Viggo Morterson are so good. This movie shows you should never give up and keep fighting. The critics and audience will enjoy this movie. Though the movie is very long, the movie has great special effects and the movie has epic battle scenes. This is 2nd best movie of all time. 10/10
9.0~Wow...I'll say it again...WOW showgirl626 Sign in Permalink I can't even begin to understand this movie's detractors. This movie was fantastic, spectacular, awe-inspiring... Though I have to admit that - to me after multiple viewings over a short period of time - it's a bit ponderous (not as light and magical like "Fellowship" that I've watched probably 100 times, and I'm still looking forward to my next viewing), but it is a stellar flick. Yes, the movies didn't stick like glue to the books, but they were far closer than I would have ever given Peter Jackson and his team credit for being able to do. The ending in RotK (theater version) skipped a big piece of the book's ending, but that would be the only big issue. People have complained that this ending took too long, but I disagree. Seeing this movie end was like saying goodbye forever to a good friend, and I was sorry that it was over. That's perhaps the first time in my adult life that I was so genuinely caught up in a movie (or trilogy, in this case) that I was genuinely sad when it ended. Yes, it took a bit of time to wind down, but I thought that was a nice, gentle way of easing the viewer out of 3 years' worth of agonized waiting to see how Peter Jackson would treat the trilogy's conclusion. I think it was a far better way to send the trilogy's fans off than the old wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am methods of most movie makers in this CGI world. It was a long journey to get to the end, and the way it was filmed was beautiful and sublime, a quality sorely lacking in movies that are top-heavy with CGI in this day and age. I heard so many people say with immobile certainty that these films will be dismissed as inferior in a matter of just a few years. As computer graphics improves, the failings of this movie will become ever more apparent, some say. While I agree that there were some parts of the movie(s) that were quite obviously CGI, I'm that much more impressed that this movie (all three of them, in fact) were able to hold me so rapt, in spite of these CGI "issues." That kind of stuff usually pulls me right out of a movie because it's so distracting. Kudos more to Peter Jackson and Company for making something so wonderful, in spite of the fact that Mr. Jackson's vision was a bit more than current computer technology can handle. So what? How can anybody say that these three movies will be so summarily dismissed as substandard in a matter of a few years? Is the Wizard of Oz considered trash? Its special effects are laughable by today's standards, and yet it's still considered a classic. Is Dracula (Bela Lugosi's Dracula) considered trash? Its special effects are even worse than the Wizard of Oz, yet any horror buff still considers this movie great. Or (God forbid...she's about to say something bad about STAR WARS! Blasphemer!), how many of you are willing to forsake the first (er, the fourth...whatever) in the Star Wars series even though there are some glaring problems in the special effects department by today's standards? In fact, since we're mentioning the Star Wars franchise and "today's" technology, the special effects in the last 3 (the first 3...oh, dammit, the PRE-Darth Vader ones) were pretty cool, but still couldn't make up for horrible scripts and non-existent character development. Anyway, back to the trilogy at hand... I think brilliant story-telling transcends special effects. And this movie was brilliant. It deserved every Academy Award it got. In fact, I think the Academy should go back and give special Oscars to several of the cast members. Each actor did a wonderful job (which, by the way, surprised me a LOT...before I watched the trilogy, I would only have given Sir Ian McKellan credit for being able to pull off such an epic role), the story was engaging, the cinematography was stunning, and Peter Jackson pulled everything together beautifully (another surprise to me, considering his humble directing background). The Fellowship of the Ring took my breath away, and made me want to re-read the LOTR trilogy all over again. The Two Towers left me again reaching for the books. Same story for Return of the King. I loved all three movies, and they shall probably always be among my favorites of all time. To the naysayers, I say you're being too hard on this movie. Enjoy it for what it is: a gorgeous work of art. I think Tolkien would be proud. Thanks for reading.
10.0~Extended version is a Masterpiece! LOTR series extended versions together vie as the best films ever made. peterredding-79-955199 Sign in Permalink This review is of the BluRay extended version (263 minutes, not 201 minutes). The theatrical version and the extended version are 2 different films - and this applies to all 3 of the LOTR films. I saw the theatrical version twice, and felt dissatisfied. After seeing the extended version I understand why. The extended version is coherent, flows seamlessly, is genuinely moving & involving, is true to Tolkien's original, and is a complete and enthralling story. It is long, but never flags and captured my interest for every single minute. I've read Tolkien's story about 80 times since I first purchased it in 1962. Tolkien has an extraordinary ability to evoke visual images in the reader. I have very strong visual images of Tolkien's world, and I was amazed at the uncanny resemblance between my images and what Peter Jackson has produced on screen. That's a tribute to Tolkien as much as Jackson, and Jackson and his team deserve full credit for doing the impossible - making Tolkien real. There were 2 notable omissions in the series of LOTR films - 1. The Old Forest & Tom Bombadil (The Fellowship of The Ring) 2. The Scouring Of The Shire (The Return of The King). I understand why these may have been omitted. For me, the strongest visual imagery I have is of Bombadil. It also captures the real spiritual essence of why these guys are fighting to destroy the ring. The Scouring Of The Shire represents to my mind an essential counterpoint to the very first scene in The Fellowship of The Ring 'A Long Expected Party'. These 2 scenes are like bookends to the whole thing. No doubt including these scenes would have required another 60+ minutes. That said, this film and the other 2 (extended versions only) do stand as a complete and satisfying whole as they are. I rate this film and the other 2 as masterpieces in their extended versions. The three together in extended versions must vie as the best films ever made - an extraordinary achievement. PostScript: .IMDb should separate out reviews of the theatrical and extended versions. They are clearly different films.
10.0~the lord of the rings kavaldi Sign in Permalink the best movie i've seen. The final battle for Middle-earth begins. Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of Mount Doom in order to destroy the One RingThe Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War II.[1] It is the second best-selling novel ever written, with over 150 million copies sold
10.0~how much I love the movie...just amazing... Annufenelle Sign in Permalink I loved this movie so much. The special effects were astounding and the actors could bring so many emotions to the screen. All of the characters and the way they were portrayed was too great for words. I now have a shrine in my room dedicated just to Lord of the Rings. If it is possible, the movies surpassed the books. I cry every time I see any of the movies, but I must say that the Return of the King was the most emotional for me. I hope everyone reading this feels the same that I do. The settings they found in New Zealand were just as amazing as the acting. They were absolutely perfect for this trilogy. Another thing that really got me was how real Gollum was. Not just the digital form of him, but of the personality Andy Serkis put into him. He's so believable, and you feel so bad for the mutated creature you probably promised yourself you were going to hate before the movie started.
10.0~excellent. bozaslan21 Sign in Permalink I've never seen a series like this. A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible? I have always loved the original "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. They do not make films like these anymore. As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where "Two Towers" ends, so brush up before seeing it. I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective. I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done "right". And when it happened, it was. I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level. The cast comes through once more. The musical score retains its beauty, elegance and power. The special effects, notably Gollum again, are nothing less than breathtaking, and simply move the story along. The battles are monumentally huge and exciting. There are some liberties taken with the story, especially during the end with the homecoming, and yet, everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself, the story provided a breather. And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years. It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no "Rings" movie in 2004. I will miss this talented group of actors. As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. This film is so much more than a simple "fantasy" epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been. I will miss looking forward to a new "Rings" movie, but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story, bathroom humor, or a "Top 40" soundtrack. George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fan base. Each film has earned a "10" from me for the last two years, which for me to give is a rarity. This one, however, is as equally deserving as its two predecessors. The Academy had better not look over this film for "Best Picture" of 2003. To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them.
10.0~Rings' conclusion defies sequel traditions, powerful to end btro Sign in Permalink Here's a review I wrote for the website I work for... Take note Hollywood, a new bar has been set. Peter Jackson's vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's timeless `Lord of the Rings' trilogy is now complete, and there never has been a more consistent set of movies - a more magnificent and captivating sequence of epic filmmaking sure to make an impact the world over for many ages to come. With 'Return of the King' Jackson gives moviegoers the final pieces to a beautiful puzzle, filled with more emotional and gut wrenching moments than the first two movies combined, and a masterful conclusion to a trilogy that is sure to stand the test of time just as Tolkien's novels have. 'Return of the King' completes the story of mankind's final stand against the ultimate 'eye' of evil in Middle-earth - Sauron. While the Hobbits Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) make their way ever closer to Mount Doom in possession of the One Ring - an item to which Sauron's life force is bound - the master of Mordor sends all the power he can muster to the kingdom of Gondor in an attempt to eliminate the race of men. In anticipation of such an attack, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) uses his kingly heritage to rally the world of men - both living and dead - to resist the armies of Sauron in an attempt to give the brave Hobbits enough time to complete their quest. The resulting battle upon Pelennor Fields outside the White City of Minis Tirith is undoubtedly the grandest onscreen m'lée ever produced, making 'The Two Towers' skirmish at Helm's Deep look, as has been said before, like a petty bar fight. The clashing armies are large, their collisions terrifying and their acts of defense desperate. The weapons sent out under the dark cloud of Mordor include Orcs, Trolls, Oliphants, and Nazgul, fell beasts of the air whose blood-curdling screeches will chill every bone in your body even more so in the trilogy's final installment. With sequences such as this giant battle, Jackson and company have yet again outdone themselves in the world of cinematography. Just as the introduction of Gollum and the battle of Helm's Deep in 'The Two Towers' went beyond the Mines of Moria and its Balrog in 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' the third installment in the trilogy seems to be a step ahead of the second film thanks to sequences like the lighting of the beacons, the grand battle in Pelennor Fields and ultimate end of the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Only one word can really be used as an accurate description of just outstanding the cinematography is in 'Return of the King' - Oscar. And while the third film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy may not sweep the major categories at the 2004 Academy Awards, one of those trophies should find its way to Peter Jackson's mantel. After putting seven years of his life into this project, one that is yet to be completed if you are a fan of the special extended edition DVDs, Jackson's shot at earning Best Director this year is better than ever. Jackson should be commended, because releasing three sub-par films in as many years is almost unheard of in Hollywood. But with 'Return,' Jackson has managed to create what many would argue are some of the best pieces of filmmaking ever made. He didn't do it alone, though, and be sure he'd be the first to tell you that. Everyone involved with the project - actors, actresses, producers, special effects team members, stunt doubles, cinematographers, writers, extras, composers, everyone - has achieved a victory of sorts with the release of this film and the conclusion of what is a marvelous trilogy. Unlike the franchise films of the recent day - see 'Matrix Revolutions' and the latest two installments of George Lucas's 'Star Wars' saga as references - the acting in 'Return of the King' is top notch. Ian McKellen once again makes us feel as if Gandalf actually walks our earth, as the pacing and deliverance of his lines and the subtleties of his actions bring to life one of Tolkien's most infamous characters. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin superbly portray the emotions of two struggling Hobbits laboring on a journey to certain death. And their guide Gollum (a.k.a. Smeagol), a computer-generated character based on the movements and also voiced by Andy Serkis, outdoes himself in what is his encore performance. In fact, Serkis gets his chance in 'Return' to appear on screen in human form during a glimpse into Smeagol's past. Other outstanding performances are many, but Viggo Mortensen as a now kingly Aragorn, Billy Boyd as the vocally-gifted Hobbit Pippin, and most definitely Miranda Otto as the courageous lady of Rohan, Eowyn, are worth much more than a mere mention. Fans of the original novels are also sure to be pleased with Jackson's adaptation, as we finally get to see characters like Denethor, Shelob and the Witch King in the flesh. Those same fans are also sure to be already eagerly awaiting next winter's release of the special extended edition DVD of 'Return of the King,' as some of the book's more memorable moments were filmed but not included in the final trimmings of the theatrical version. Even with the omissions, there is certainly enough left to allow you to experience every color on the spectrum of emotion - from the movie's malicious yet insightful opening sequence to the film's final reunions and goodbyes. You will laugh. You will cry. You will gasp for air. You will hold your breath. You will find yourself stiff as a board with intensity, clutching the armrests or your date as if your life somehow hinged on destruction of the One Ring and the ultimate fate of Middle-earth. 'Return of the King' carries with it a rating of PG-13, and if there is any doubt in your mind as to why this is by the middle of the film, pay special attention to the how the Orcs of Mordor use their heads - or should I say, those of others - in the siege of Gondor. The rating is certainly justified and necessary, as is the film's length. But thanks to a seamless stream of scenes that flow like the Brandywine, you won't once look at your watch. The running time of 'Return of the King' is 201 minutes - that's three hours and 21 minutes - but in all honesty, your experience of the final chapter of the trilogy may not seem long enough. You will be sad to see it end when the journey is finally complete, and the worst there is to say about this movie is that it does, in fact, end. But take comfort in your heart and mind when you hear Sam take a deep breath and say, 'Well, I'm back,' that you have just witnessed one of the most timeless movie trilogies of all time. 'Return of the King' is a valiant conclusion to the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy; a "precious" masterpiece by which all future epics will be measured.
10.0~A complete ending to a highly anticipated trilogy. rykskelton Sign in Permalink I never thought, when I went to see `Bad Taste' in a film festival in Hamilton, New Zealand, those many years ago, that the director of that low-budget hilarity would eventually be making The LotR's trilogy to an eager world-wide audience. Let me say that the first time I saw RotK, I didn't think it up to par with the first two parts. However, after a second viewing (where I didn't sit as close to the screen) and some time to digest it all, I rate it just as good. In reality, I don't consider this to be a single entity, just the third section of an extended movie. Therefor, saying whether RotK is better or worse than FotR or TTT, doesn't make sense to me. As a complete story, they are incredible in depth, breadth and scope. For those of you out there who give it negative reviews, take a bit of time and think about whether or not you could pull off something so huge and to satisfy so many. A point to note: A number of reviewers comment on the trilogy not being true to the book, and state that an adaptation should not change or modify the original, merely visualise the exact words and scenes already created. Firstly, let me point out that the Miriam Webster dictionary defines adaptation to mean "modification of an organism or its parts that makes it more fit for existence under the conditions of its environment" or "a composition rewritten into a new form". This second meaning hits the point home. Note the words "rewritten" and "new form". It is a director's job to ensure that they bring to the screen a fresh, exciting and thoughtful version of a work. In that regard, Peter Jackson has succeeded. Give him his due. Just a mention to those of you who give Shakespeare as an example of something that should never be re-interpreted, I have seen a number of productions of the bard where scenes are cut or rearranged to allow for the director's vision to shine through. I don't judge these as being bad, just a new way of looking at things, and I enjoy being exposed to differing points of view on how things are interpreted. Personally, I hate seeing movies that are an exact replica of the book. Why on earth would I want to see the movie then???? Okay, one last gripe, and notice my gripes are about the negative reviewers, not the movie itself (despite the fact that all movies have flaws). The ending is NOT 35-45 minutes as one reviewer stated. It is approximately 23. Considering the trilogy is about 9 1/2 hours in length (more when you consider the EE's) this amount of time is not excessive. It equates to around a 4 or 5 minute ending on a 2 hour movie. Allowing the audience to experience a satisfactorily wrapped ending is obviously NOT what some viewers want. I thought it a pleasant change to actually have a movie end without loose ends or parts unexplained. (another recently concluded trilogy that introduced many irrelevant concepts and failed to explain even the relevant ones will remain unnamed). All in all, a thorough job well done! In some ways different from the book, but better because of it! Peter Jackson and crew, I hope you get all the credit and reward you deserve for this incredible feat. Many thanx from a fellow Kiwi, albeit uprooted. I can't wait for King Kong. P.S. Peter, maybe you should consider doing `The Hobbit', as the rumours indicate there is a lot of interest from the movie-going public.
10.0~Truly indispensable! EijnarAmadeus Sign in Permalink The last chapter of the biggest and best trilogy ever been captured on film, and it is; very worthy! Viggo Mortensen kicks ass together with Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin and the rest of the good-guys. We continue off course where we left them after THE TWO TOWERS and we are really just loading up to the finale battle. We follow Frodo, Sam and Gollum in their travel to Mordor to destroy the Ring where Gollum seems to a have a sort of lack of concentration when he suddenly turns against Frodo and his mate again, wanting the Ring for whatever it'll cost him..well, but this time he uses a more clever and slick way to get closer to the Ring. The finale is great, simply stunning! Threw fantastic special effects and stunning battles we follow our men into wild fights to save Middle-Earth from being taken over by the evil Sauron. Sauron is, nor human nor living being..he is just a eye watching, watching threw Middle-Earth with its powers and greed. So Aragorn leading hordes of men into insane battle with their blades raised is simply brilliant! It is..top entertainment yes it certainly is!! THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies is truly something for themselves. They're huge both in budget and movie ways. The movie is almost hard to explain with words, big scene after big scene appears on the screen and I sat smiling under the whole movie, enjoying it. STARS: ***** 5/5 (just see it!)
10.0~THE BEST EVER SEEN i_know_u39 Sign in Permalink The Lord Of The Rings - The Return Of The King is the best movie I've ever watch after Titanic. It contains plenty of beautiful screen from New Zealand and Peter Jackson (The Director) has done a wonderful job in making this movie. After watching it I wanted to watch over and over again because I love smeagal/Golumn......... If you are not able watch this movie.....It is a waste because it might never bee shown in cinema again.... This movie made addicted to its funny screen and adventure screen , that is what so great of this movie.
10.0~A parable for the human condition. Grumpy_Old_Man Sign in Permalink All in all, I've seen these films a combined total of nearly 30 times. I used to have the books read to me as a kid. I'm no geek, but Lord Of The Rings is almost in my blood. I won't waste your time with things that others have said, only to provide a few extra ideas. I read a comment on here that stated the first Lord Of The Rings film was a road movie, the second was a war movie, and the last was a movie of friendship. I think these comments are largely true, though I think of this last movie as something even bigger, a parable for the human condition, the dark truths that plague us all, and how we must all face them. The technical aspects of this film have been discussed many a time - perfect sets, costumes, photography and visual effects abound. 'Return' is a crystal ball (palantir? :P) into another universe. The effects deserve special mention. Gollum needs no other mention except that, during one shot on the winding stair, where Gollum is deceiving Frodo about Sam, that he looks *completely real*. One thing to note is that the first film thrived on its' single-minded narrative, whilst the other two split off into three branches. This film functions much better in this regard than The Two Towers, mainly thanks to the hectic pace of the story. Though the first 40 minutes are a warm-up (essentially the last parts of the Towers book), once we arrive at Minas Tirith, the rest of the movie builds into a nearly nonstop, incredibly intense set-piece. The enemy is marching on the capital of the land of men in hundreds of thousands, and there is no other road except to stand and defend the city. Even in winning this impossible battle, the war cannot be won. All is up for grabs, and every one of our heroes shall reach moments of destiny. Acting is fantastic across the board. I was especially convinced by the depiction of Denethor and Faramir - such a horrible and accurate portrayal of a broken family. To see John Noble portray the deranged steward in this film, as compared to the brash, stubborn man in the Osgiliath scene in the longer Two Towers cut, is to understand your own dad. To see Gandalf running down the walls of the white city yelling "Do not give into fear! FIGHT!" is to get chills. To see Aragorn finally move from quiet everyman into a wise, powerful leader, is to grow yourself. One nitpick I have is with the diluted script. A few of my favourite moments in the book (the Witchking showdown and the Mouth Of Sauron encounter) are slightly too Hollywood for my liking, rather than Gothic pitch-black as originally thought. There is not much breathing room either, though this really only adds to the power of the final work when you go back to watch it again...I personally intend to watch these films many, many more times. Some would say a trilogy of this scope is too big to sum up, but the message is clear, and more relevant than ever - we must all stand up, together, against the evils and mediocrities of this world and our nature, in friendship and love, even onto our inevitable death.
9.0~Recommend this movie !! deepak554 Sign in Permalink I like the fantasy movie and specially like The Lord of the Rings. This movie in appear Legolas ! He is very handsome and quick in action He riding a shield, shoot an arrow to monster ! This is thrilling situation. and This movie appear Gollum. He's a successful role He's a dual personality.. "My precious~ My precious~" Gollum's line is very impressive. This appear movie in Battle,variety Magic, Monster etc.. and It was a very impression movie. also It was contained Love story! This movie is an exciting movie I'm recommend this movie :-D
9.0~Great Conclusion to a Great Trilogy! ralphie-319-889820 Sign in Permalink This was the epic climax to the awesome LOTR trilogy. The action was indeed amazing, and had great deal of special effects thrown into it. I remember Legolas' first arrow being launched smoothly into an orc, what a marvelous scene. Then I looked and he was launching another arrow in a similar fashion, then another one, and another one! Sure it looked great, but it was so repetitive I got bored. Every battle in this movie is almost exactly the same: swords swinging, arrows launching, and people screaming, I just can't see what was so special about it. I also could not get through my head the final battle scene. Honestly an army of the undead destroying the orc forces, gee that must have been a difficult victory. It was so predictable and unfair I simply hated this movie. For all of the action attempts and turning a really old trilogy into a movie, I was considering giving this film two stars, but then I remembered the conclusion. Frodo and Sam were being saved by a bunch of hawks or something and everything seemed to be at peace - not a bad ending. Then the story stretches into farewells and goodbyes, good luck and god bless - OK I can tolerate this. Now Bilbo is going into a boat and heading off to god knows where - When is this bloody movie going to end? By the time I got out of the theater it was nearly half an hour after the part where the movie would have made an effective conclusion, my behind sweating like an oxen from boredom. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you are amazed by a couple of special effects. I don't know how this movie did so well, I think one critic said it was a good movie and it spread like wildfire or maybe there was simply nothing else to do but worship elves. Whatever the reason, I do not want to see this ever again!
9.0~Fantastic movie danyazaki Sign in Permalink This is an extraordinary trilogy with an outstanding cast. People who are interested in action/adventure movies are bound to like Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson has portrayed this movie in a very thrilling way. Though some parts are not included but the included parts are shown in a detailed way which enables the viewer to understand the story even if he/she has not read the book written by J.R.R. Tolkein. All the actors have acted naturally, which makes the film even more intriguing. New Zealand was perhaps the best setting for the movie because of its mountains, forests and other natural beauties which has made the movie to look even more extraordinary. Thumbs up to Lord of the Rings!
10.0~Brilliant layla70 Sign in Permalink Totally and absolutely wonderful in every way. I could go on and on about the beautiful cinematography, how the story was summed up in a very satisfying way and how spectacular the battle scences were but I think that my summary says it all. See it for yourself.
10.0~Amazing! A true vision of the book. Nearly letter to letter moviecriticle Sign in Permalink I loved it. If the seats in the theatre had been better it would have been a fantasy. Transition from scene to scene was smooth and painless. The action sequences were close up and very detailed. Peter Jackson carried on with the quiet humor from the first two movies added in a very dry subtle way. My only negatives are that gimli was portrayed a little to useless.
10.0~`Farewell. So ends our fellowship. I will not say, "Do not weep;" for not all tears are an evil.'  Gandalf (RoTK) sweetrupturedlight Sign in Permalink I have tried many a time to verbalize my feelings for this story to many, and have failed miserably. My family, friends, all seem to find it rather odd that I have become so interested in something that is after all, but a book firstly (albeit a brilliant one), and then a movie. It took me a while to see these movies. Whilst I was initially interested in seeing them, I became swayed by many things, and ultimately skipped TTT because I had not seen the FoTR. Ever since seeing the Return of the King, I have become engrossed. I spend hours researching' what others thought of this movie, reading comments, critic's reviews, and my favorite parts, reliving the movies, over and over again. I have seen the FoTR and TTT so many times, I fail to be able to accurately relay the number, yet every time I seem to marvel at something different, or rejoice in the same. Therefore in reading the numerous reviews, to those reading this one, there are many words to say. I have been inundated with the same points, immersed in the same arguments. People tend to get so heated in their love of, but particularly their dislike/hate for this trilogy. For those who love it, there is praise, perhaps unbiased, heaped onto this movie for various reasons. Beloved characters, wonderful scenes, breathtaking direction. For those who hate it, I make the analogy of the worldwide pop idol competition. For anyone who had seen it, it seemed that the judges were more interested in besting the next one with a weird range of verbal insults, that there was no real constructive criticism imparted upon the contestants. This is how I tend to view most, not all, of the hatred channeled towards these movies. The haters' seem to be so busy trying to deny and refute the hype made my media and fans alike, that none of their reasons for disliking the movie seem genuine at all. Don't get me wrong; not liking something is a person's prerogative, but with that dislike comes valid reason. All I have read deals with how hateful Peter Jackson is, how long the movies were, how much they hated some character or the next, or simply how they just couldn't get' the movie at all. To those who prescribe to the latter reason, all I say is - read. Read the book, and then revise your thinking. More often than not, those who don't like the movie, lack literary understanding, or just haven't bothered to try and understand why others seen to have got' it. Whilst I acknowledge the faults that came with each of Jackson's installments, I can only help but rejoice in them. I see them in context, and with reference to the original text. People keep on harping on how long the movies were, but didn't they mentally prepare themselves for a 3 hour episode? Also, whilst hating the first, you find that the very same people have gone back to see the second and third installments. Willful torture? I just don't get it. I loved them; I make no secret of that. Faults and all, I think that all three, the RoTK being my favorite, is the best trilogy ever made. I have read about comparisons to The Godfather and Star Wars. Haven't people learnt about the different genres of filmmaking? There is no way that the three can even be compared! After this lengthy treatise, I say to those that read this and have not yet seen RoTK, or indeed the FoTR & TTT. Open your mind, relax your mind, prepare yourself, and go and see them. I remember being incredibly touched and overwhelmed as I watched the one scene in particular where the beacons were being lit as Gondor called for aid. I felt emotion envelop me as I fought the urge to clap as the tears rolled down my face. There is nothing better, I think, than leaving a cinema and being forced, or not, to think about the movie you have just seen. That means it touched you, and this trilogy definitely will. A special mention, though it seems like I will mention ALL, goes to the actors. Viggo Mortessen, who will be a dashing, brave hero for centuries to come. He embodied the soul of Aragorn and like Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice); there will never be another to portray the role of Aragorn, son of Arathorn, heir to the throne of Gondor. The Hobbits: Frodo, Sam, Merry, and my favorite, Pippin. A beautiful portrayal of the heartache and humor they brought to the original text. Liv Tyler. An actress I never really praised, but will now. In context of this role, she was beautiful, bringing a calm serenity to the character of Arwen. Many disliked her, I didn't. Once again I viewed her in context of her part, and cannot imagine another. Whatever faults there may be with her portrayal, they are owed to direction, and not acting. Sir Ian McKellen & Cate Blanchett who owned their respective roles with conviction and heart. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies and Andy Serkis To the rest of the actors, director, full cast and crew, well done! I truly hope all your hard work and vision will bear fruit at this year's awards ceremonies. But if they do not, the fans solute you for a job that was exceedingly well done! The Fellowship has ended, but it will live on in many hearts, forever.
10.0~A vision finally realized. MikeG-1221 Sign in Permalink This was a great film. I've slogged through comment after comment for "Fellowship" and "The Two Towers," wondering what the fuss was. I won't go into it all again here, but I was disappointed by both the first and second movies. This movie, however, not only blows away the first two movies in the series, but also stands on its own as a masterpiece. All of the problems in the first two movies disappear, as if Peter Jackson finally realized the great vision of LOTR in one spectacular movie. The action in this movie moves swiftly and brings the viewer right in, right from the opening scene with Smeagol. The direction captures the feel of climax immediately, and doesn't let go until Frodo accomplishes his mission of destroying the ring. In a movie like this, special effects generally stand out over acting. But a few performances in what is a solid ensemble shine majestically over the rest. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin capture the anguish of carrying ring and the struggle between the weight of their quest and the toll it takes on their friendship. Wood's body language and facial acting say more than any dialogue could have possibly said. The big surprise for me in this movie, though, was Viggo Mortensen's performance. Whether it was because of Mortensen himself, or because of the fact that the first two movies obliterated much of his dialogue, his performance in the first two films didn't stand out. In this movie, he takes the mantle as the title character and infuses his character with strength and courage. Almost every moment he's on the screen, he exudes charisma and strength, qualities that are hard enough to reveal in a book, let alone a movie. The triumph of ROTK, however, is in the plotting and action itself. In some movies, characters dominate the story, while in other movies, characters are swept along by events. LOTR is clearly in the latter category, and Return of the King thrusts the viewer into the action early and doesn't stop until the ring is destroyed and Frodo and Sam are rescued. The writing team finally gives up on sticking in tons of cute Gimli lines and avoids long speeches that seem out of context and almost jarring. Every character in the movie reacts to the heft of the quest. If you loved the first two movies, I'm sure you'll love this one. If you didn't like the first two movies, I'd still recommend "Return of the King." Unlike many of the rabid Rings fans, I'm reluctant to bestow awards left and right after walking out of the theater. However, Peter Jackson's direction is award-worthy, without a doubt. No fantasy movie has ever captured the combination of splendor and gothic darkness of the fantasy genre more than this movie did. ROTK is clearly an epic, even though the first two movies were not. This is movie is a perfect 10 out of 10. I'll let time be the judge of whether or not this movie is an all-time great, but this is definitely the best movie I've seen in 2003.
7.0~Too big for its own good. eugeniaandino Sign in Permalink If you have read the book, it's almost impossible to judge this as a movie that can work on its own; it's too tempting to comment on it according to whether it is a visual version of the novel in your mind or not. But that is not the point. The Return of the King has three distinct aspects that differ greatly in quality. There are the action scenes and the spectacular look of the film; the script, the plot, and the editing; and then there is the emotional relationships between the characters. The visual aspect and the action scenes are faultless. Battles with lots of different weapons, Nazgul screeching, a reasonable amount of blood, hideous Orcs, oliphaunts, you name it, it's there. But it's never too gorey, or so fast that it's confusing to follow. How-the-story-gets-told is a bit less perfect. There are a few flashbacks that seem completely pointless to the overall film (because nobody really needs to see those scenes to understand anything that happens later) and a few useless flash-forwards (because there was no need to anticipate what's in them). Moreover, the way the movie jumps from scenery to scenery (trying to tell what is happening in three places at the same time) does not flow as well as it did in The Two Towers. The worse element in the film is probably the emotive one. The actors are very intense (to the point of overacting on occasion), and their lines are sometimes better, sometimes worse. But the problem with all the emotional scenes is that they are too similar: the external world turns down the volume and moves in slow motion and the characters look at each other in the eye with devotion and desperation. It does not matter if they are two teenage friends or two lovers or an (adoptive) father and daughter, if it is a moment of triumph or of mourning. I will probably change my mind if I see the movie again, but overall it seems too irregular.
10.0~3hrs 20 minutes of movie magic. bubs1 Sign in Permalink Right. This comment is for the 0.0001% of the population who base their life on rap music, and judge how good a movie is by how many people get shot, mutilated, how much blood is spilled, how much bad language is spoken, or how stupid people behave in movies (ie Jackass). If this is you, then.... This movie is NOT FOR YOU. If you CANNOT sit in a theatre for 3hrs 20mins staying still and QUIET while a movie is being shown on the big screen with a classical music theme then GO AWAY and watch something else. Believe me, you will be doing the rest of the cinema goers a huge favor, as they will be watching the finale to the greatest movie trilogy of our time. SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD. This movie is not suitable for young children for the battle scenes. The battle scenes are intense, and excellent. If you or your children HATE spiders, you might find yourself covering your eyes for about 15 minutes or so, as there is a HUGE one in the story. Apparently, Peter Jackson based Shelob on a New Zealand Funnel Web spider. Scary stuff, for sensitive viewers, but don't let this be the reason that holds you back from seeing the film, if you have arachnophobia. The orchestral score played during the Shelob scene adds a certain creepiness to it as well. Some of the scenes in this film can only be described as EPIC. The battle of Minas Tirith, The Lighting of the Beacons, and the Riding of the Rohirrim spring to mind. Once you see them, you'll know what I mean. Sensitive viewers may also like to bring a few tissues with them into the cinemas, as you will probably be needing them at the end of the movie. Peter Jackson has given the world the best movie trilogy ever made, and the bar has been raised for all other directors to follow suit. If they can remains to be seen. This is a movie that requires multiple viewings on the big screen to absorb all the detail. How beautiful is the South Island of New Zealand!!! The LOTR trilogy is expected to earn somewhere in the vicinity of $4 BILLION DOLLARS after the DVD run of ROTK. Not bad for a little known New Zealand director who read the book when he was young, and said " That would make a great film one day. I can't wait to see it" At 3hrs 20mins it's long but very well worth it. Thoroughly enjoyable. A masterpiece. Rating 10/10
9.0~amazing isidoramagazin-86894 Sign in Permalink My favorite movie! best movie ever made. photography is amazing. so is the acting.
10.0~Epic mc_art Sign in Permalink Wonderful on every level. Love the characters and special effects. One of the biggest, most massive battle scenes ever put on the silver screen. A great end to a monumental epic. A thrilling final chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy concerning the epic conclusion to Peter Jackson's enthralling look at temptation, greed, power, and good vs. evil. This is a glorious final chapter. From Gollum's dance of glee at the foot of Mount Doom, to the final battle sequence against the orcs, Peter Jackson stuffs this film with memorable scenes and unforgettable landscapes that fit his epic scope. Although not the best in the trilogy (that belongs to 'Two Towers'), definitely a fitting conclusion to a decorated series.
10.0~Excellent Movie shwesq Sign in Permalink Many years ago I read The Hobbit and the three Rings. Afterwards I read them again. I need to do it a third time. While I admit the movie leaves out the problems confronting the hobbits when they return to the Shire, it is an excellent movie. The three movies are more than I could ever have hoped for. I cannot imagine this kind of undertaking, and I deeply am grateful for those who did it. As for the actors, I liked them all. Sean Astin was my favorite. He displayed such caring and a range of emotions that is amazing since he is not English, but is American. His superb allegiance to Frodo who sometimes rebukes him displays the fine qualities of good friendship. But for them all, thank heavens I lived to see them.
10.0~Movie of the century. heno-59170 Sign in Permalink Simply the best movie that i have ever watched! Genius adaptation of the book, neverending story of good and evil.
1.0~Supreme boredom harryplinkett14 Sign in Permalink If the first film bored you to tears and the second one bored you to death, the third film will not affect you because you are now numb and totally disinterested. We have even more of those pointless scenes with Sam and Frodo, more battles and more CGI. And how many endings can a film have? There's a huge battle and then they tell you there is another one. And it's still not over, because there are a million loose ends. And then they go back home. And then Bilbo leaves home. And then Sam has children. Is that the end or is there more? I can't even remember. I fell asleep during one of the particularly tedious scenes with Sam and Frodo. This is not a film. It's a pointless sequence of scenes and an exercise in CGI that resembles a video game - one you can only watch, but not play. And I still don't care about a single bloody character in this film!
2.0~Lost Magic jos-destrooper Sign in Permalink This movie has lost all the magic of the two parts before. Why not show the battle of the cavalry of Basamir against the thorgs and their archers? Why not show the battle against the human pirates? Why the travel for the Ring and Frodo is so long? Why are the battles so short? Why is there no confrontation between Nahzul and the white wizard? Why do all the Nahzuls (the flying monsters) suddenly disappear? Why is there no real battle between the army of the dead and the enemy? This movie concentrates too much on the bringing of the Ring to its destiny and not enough on the battles. And what happens to Sauron or Sauriman?
8.0~A wonderful movie qazeeassad Sign in Permalink This is one of the awesome movies that I want to watch again and again and I will never tire to see it... I urge you all to watch this movie to have a real taste of movie. Very nice acting by very wonderful actors. Stories that will make you wonder, "What will happen next?" Hope you feel awesome at the end of the movie, just like I feel awesome every time when I watch the movie. Recommend it to your friends as well. I do recommend it to my friends who have still not seen it. Hope you like it. Enjoy!!!
10.0~close to fantastic (spoilers) domhimma Sign in Permalink Firstly there's no denying that all of the films are great, and as a fan of the books it annoys me when other fans slate the movies JUST because they don't hold completely true to tolkien's books. I understand that people get bent because their favourite part of the book as been missed out (some of mine have), but ultimately nobody could have hoped for a better adaptation and most of the decisions to leave things out or change things have been for the good of the FILM. My only major grime about the film was that i found some of the pacing of it weird (i had the same problem with two towers but that was sorted out in the extended version) for instance the apparently short time between pelennor fields and the black gate but as with towers i expect the extended to sort that out. Sweet-ass-justice parts of the film include - when aragorn jumps off the boat, when the eagles attack the nazgul, eowyn and merry killing the witch king, gandalf gettin down and dirty on the walls of minas tirith and the charge of the frickin' rohirrim which i think is my favourite part (the way the orcs start fleeing just before they hit them is so cool) To summarize - this is should totally get huge amounts of awards at the oscars because it/they blow other films out of the water on all accounts even though the extended versions are the definitive. 9/10
10.0~The greatest movie of ALL time Wanderer255 Sign in Permalink This is my absolute favorite movie of all time, better then any other movie out there. it won so many awards, it was very long, especially the extended version (4 hours of lord of the rings goodness :) ) the battles, the romance, the stunningly perfect music. if you don't take my word for it, and all fantasy lovers will love this movie. And if you have the theatrical version, get the extended edition, believe me it is worth it!!!.......so what are you waiting for....go and buy the movie right now, you will not regret it. also, if you haven't seen the first 2, get them first, they are totally excellent too. Peter Jackson did an excellent job in making this movie as well as the other members of the crew.
10.0~One of My Favorites...A Film Classic! bp7677 Sign in Permalink It's been awhile since my last viewing of ROTK in the theatre (beginning of February). I saw it a total of four times, which may not be much for a film of this caliber, but that's alot for me, because I usually do not like to see even the best films more than once in the theatre. As an avid fan of the books and huge admirer of JRR, I was skeptical as to whether the final film would deliver. I loved the first two films, but Two Towers digressed from the original story a little too much for me. Nevertheless, Return of the King blew me away--what an experience!! After seeing it for the first time at the 7:00 showing, I returned the next morning for the 11:00 am showing because it was so wonderful! Seeing it the second time proved helpful, for the first time I was so blown away that I missed some things. The third and fourth times were no less entertaining...it was fun seeing it again with a theater full of Tolkien devotees. Especially excellent in the film was Faramir...his sad reaction to Denethor's comments (while he was eating) broke my heart and almost moved me to tears! (At that time, I had never cried in a movie.) Pippin's singing simultaneously with the Gondor cavalry riding towards Osgiliath. What imagery and symbolism! One of my favorite scenes is the lighting of the beacons--beautiful scenery and music and it prepares the movie-goer for the battle as well. The battle at Minas Tirith was awesome--especially when Theoden is encouraging his troops and when Aragorn is leading the mysterious army from the mountains. Finally, I absolutely loved the "crowning ceremony"--Viggo has a good voice! The acting continued to excel, except Elijah Wood as Frodo had some pretty repetitive lines that did not allow him to give much dimension to his character. It is obvious that Viggo M put alot of work into becoming the essence of the complex character Aragorn. Congrats to PJackson and everyone involved for the multiple wins at the Globes and Oscars--your hard work finally paid off! I strongly urge everyone to view this fantastic film if for some strange reason you have not yet done so. 10/10
10.0~Best Movie i had ever seen connectvhome Sign in Permalink This movie is one of my favourite movie in my whole life
5.0~The biggest problem of all is lack of character development ... hosr2 Sign in Permalink I went to see ROTK for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws, want to concentrate on major issues surrounding Jackson's character development. ARAGORN is the first big problem. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills, not as Sauron wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead. And when he goes under the Dimholt he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them. Now Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. As a result we're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? There's simply been no character development of Aragorn. He's been denuded of a sense of who he is. SAURON is the next big problem. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why on earth didn't Jackson then develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!) Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur. Now this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron is a personification of evil. He's not actually the worst - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. The whole point, and if this isn't obvious in the world today then Jackson is even less astute than I imagined, is that evil in many guises takes human form. OTHERS The same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Notable exceptions are GANDALF and SARUMAN (both well acted). Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). ARWEN is drippy throughout. EOWYN is changed in the film. Miranda Otto was excellent. But Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'. As for the HOBBITS . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as SAM is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. BILBO was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh - this is kindergarten film production. I expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good. Peter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R. Tolkien, down.
10.0~One of the best movies made arthurharris30 Sign in Permalink One of the best movies ever made with amazing battle's and good graphic. This movie is most probably the best out of the trilogy and is a great way to end it. The movie has great acting and a lot of answers to past story lines it shows the same great characters and contain death to a few main characters also. I would advice anybody who has not yet watched this trilogy to take time to watch it and if possible to watch the extended versions of the three it adds to 12 hours with the three (extended versions) but is worth every hour
1.0~As God is my witness that was one silly movie! mabanangel Sign in Permalink "As God as my witness. As God as my witness they're not going to lick me. I'm going to live through this and when it's all over I'll never be hungry again nor any of my folk. If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill as God as my witness I'll never be hungry again." This is what I was fully expecting to come pouring from Sam's mouth as he and Frodo were collapsing for what seemed like the 200th time on the way to get rid of the ring. Or was that the Heart of the Ocean? From some of the music and the similarity in the scenes between throwing the ring into the fire and Heart of the Ocean into the sea I wasn't sure. I didn't know if I was watching Gone With the Wind, Titanic or some Hobbit movie. And, if they had cut about an hour of Elijah Woods pained and soulful looks into the distance and the eyes of his friends, they could have made the movie a manageable length. Just a wee bit TOO much drama! What a disappointment.
10.0~Late comment but feelings can not be surpassed... mehmetemintulu Sign in Permalink is it possible for a film to be perfect? I mean no mistakes or can a film be criticized in no way? or Can a film include everything from war to love?and can all these subjects be processed in a perfect way they have never been before ?Just one film; really there is just one film in all these properties.. The Lord Of The Rings...Although all the three movies are excellent,Return Of The King has more of that.After I watched the film 3 years ago,I couldn't regain consciousness for two hours.I don't think this film is a movie; it's a work of art. &#304;t's for sure that this film is the best of the rest including matrix, fight club,scawsank,gladiator so forth...
10.0~just amazing oaliurrahman Sign in Permalink The best fantasy movie series ever. when i watch these movies, the lord of the rings and the hobbit movies, i am like entering into the fantasy world. watch these movies. it will worth
8.0~Great But Not Perfect tabuno Sign in Permalink 19 December 2003. The ending trilogy was intense and compelling but not quite perfect. A reality-based motif would have even brought this imaginative fantasy. The eerie, haunting black corridors of Mount Doom and the pervasive evil as well as presence of heart-break female roles were missing. Such magic would have captured a the Excaliber quality essence of Middle Earth. The music, the dizzying reeling battle scenes, the cinematography were richly transferred to the screen. Yet, the epic nature of Dr. Zhivago was never fully realized but as a fantasy it is the best to come along. Eight out of ten stars.
10.0~The Best Trilogy Ever Conceived! ShinKyo81 Sign in Permalink After watching the three chapters of "The Lord Of The Rings", I'm able to say out loud that Peter Jackson has created one of the best productions in history. His talent and how he has involved crafting the 3 movies have erased any possible doubts about his directing skills. Because back 3 years ago, there were lots of criticisms about letting Mr. Jackson direct what was one of the most ambitious projects in the movie world. And they also criticized the casting of known actors as Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler... IMO, I'm sure nobody will surpass for a long time what LOTR has achieved as a trilogy. His conception was somehow brilliant and risky at the same time filming the whole trilogy in one year and a half, nonstop, in New Zealand, away (luckily) from the Hollywood influences. But Peter Jackson knew exactly what he had to do. He knew what New Zealand's landscape could offer to recreate the Middle Earth, he took the most outstanding and skillful crew to assure that the movies will make justice to Tolkien's novel and satisfy the fans. Nobody knows how much work the LOTR crew has done for the sake of the trilogy, but watching the films, you get the idea: you usually don't step into the cinema and watch a movie that is as detailed as the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Far away from being a Hollywood popcorn movie, all three movies evoke emotion, fear and worship. The first chapter, "The Fellowship Of The Ring" was introductive, setting up the story and the characters. "The Two Towers" was the transition between the beginning of the novel and the epic end that was told in "The Return Of The King". The last chapter of the trilogy, IMO, is the best one, for so many reasons. First of all, it's the book that I enjoyed the most. So, I was willing to see several parts from the novel translated into eye-candy. Also it's the end, the conclusion, so it has to be huge and epic. I've been astonished by "The Return Of The King", the plot is brilliantly taken from the book, with several retouches for movie's sake. After watching the whole trilogy, you realize it was a good idea to leave the last TTT's chapters for the last movie. These changes are necessary for the movie, because being faithful to the book doesn't mean to copy everything on it. The cast is awesome in the whole trilogy, but I think they're superb in the last movie, because the characters are evolving and each one of them is unique and deep. The SFX are great and very authentic, plus the score is brilliant. Howard Shore has surprised me with his geniality. I'll probably say nothing new about The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, but I've got a statement: we're so lucky to have lived the conception of one of the best trilogies ever made, and I think that it'll be remembered for a long time. Definitely worth a look! 10/10
10.0~Wonderful, absolutely wonderful! spider_webster Sign in Permalink I have seen this movie more than three times and it never gets boring to me! I just love it! And though it might not be, in my opinion, the best of the three Rings, but it's definitely worth your time to watch! Again, like FOTR and TTT, it has great CGI effects and great acting. In my opinion, the extended/special addition is better as it gives more outline to the story. Storyline rules as usual and the directing is good. But I particularly like the scenes where they battle at Minas Tirith because it is a very climatic area of the movie. Of course, there are scenes that don't make sense sometimes but no movie is perfect and this one is the closest to perfect I've ever seen! Overall, I'd watch this one if I were you. There's more action, and less talk. Scored: 10/10; PERFECT!
10.0~A magnum Opus in fantasy movies. Deserves the Oscars. fahad_riaz Sign in Permalink This movie and the whole trilogy deserves all the praise it has received. I had been worried about seeing it because of how much Peter Jackson re-wrote "Two Towers" and presented scenes that undermined some of Tolkien's fundamental ideas. This time, Jackson followed Tolkien more closely and the worst that can be claimed are sins of omission. It's a real shame we didn't get to see Christopher Lee in this move; he totally rocked in the previous films. Telling us to wait for the "extended" version isn't right. Maybe Jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in ROTK to give Lee some film time. That said, all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. The one new thing that I would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great Tolkien artists Alan Lee and John Howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of FOTR to the final scenes of ROTK. This historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. The LOTR enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years, and this final installment was a crowning achievement
9.0~The movie that establishes LOTR as the best trilogy ever! Dragonsouls Sign in Permalink First off I'm rating the 3rd part of the trilogy, if I were to rate the trilogy as a whole I would give it a 10 because nothing compares to LOTR. Starwars? can't say the first trilogy compares, those films were made over 25 years ago, and the 3rd episode is not out yet so I have to exclude the 2nd Starwars trilogy from the comparison. The Return of the king is the greatest out of the 3 movies. The FOTR introduced the characters and had classic scenes in it, but not as exciting as the ROTK. TTT started out slow, although it had the best non Cgi battle ever in the battle of helm's deep. The ROTK is Jackson's best film in terms of his directing. I thought he did the best job at pacing the movie, creating the largest Cgi aided battle ever, and having such tremendous actors to work with. Every character in this movie seems like they are born for the role, and you really get to care for these characters like no other film, what more can you ask for in a film? jaw dropping visuals, balanced special effects, blends Cgi and realism like no other movie, and of course top-notch acting. This movie sets the standards of future films. In my mind it tops out Matrix and the Starwars flicks, I mean, seriously, what films, blend in all of the essentials of a perfect film? Great Acting, amazing sets that should be considered a sin, if they knock them all down, and demolish such beautiful sets. cgi used sparingly, and a Cgi character(Gollum) that probably deserves the best supporting actor oscar. Jackson gets your blood pumping and plays with your emotions. Just when you think something is going to happen, just the opposite does, I can't remember being on the edge of a seat for so long. One Flaw....any time you adapt a story from a book, important parts are cut out..and people that complain about the running time, shouldn't go to the theatre to see such long movies. **** 4 stars
10.0~Yes, super film that! bwallwork Sign in Permalink It's all over--all three and a half hours of it! Taking a big bottle of water is a bit of a mixed blessing--You'll stay hydrated, but may spend the last two hours wishing we still had intermission! This film concludes the trilogy in the way we anticipated. It weaves the threads of the previous two films together into a seamless tapestry of tears, triumph and tragedy. The writers have taken the book and converted it brilliantly to film. To the people who say "It's not like that in the book!", I say--if you want the book verbatim, read the book! Leave the film to the people with the imagination to enjoy it for it's own merits! I have read the books dozens of times and believe that the way this film has been done is the best way it could have been, with value added! Gimli's sense of humor and Gollum's conniving are welcome additions, and it is clear the actors have a passion for the story to equal that of their fans. The scope and intensity of the battle of Pelennor fields is breathtaking. King Theoden's speech gave me shivers and made me feel like jumping on a horse and riding to my death with the rest of the heros. This film belongs in the IMDB top 10, and the trilogy must rate as the 2nd best ever!
10.0~A class example of how to make a fantasy epic highkite Sign in Permalink "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is a visually stunning reach into the imagination. It is a deep and complex journey into the unknown, the dangerous and the inescapable. The previous two installments, "The Fellowship of the Rings", and "The Two Towers" present elements in which this film connects them together to quietly and subtly present nostalgia as the journey finally ends. The "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is by far the most cinematically beautiful trilogy ever created, so it's no surprise that this final chapter in the saga goes out with a bang. This is a tale about courage, survival, fate, and friendship. More pleasant to watch than the previous film, it is a bold ending to a bold adventure. In this final installment, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must realize his destiny as the king of men and gather his army for the final fight of Middle Earth. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Voiced by Andy Serkis), formerly known as Smeagol, lurk through the dark cities and mountains in order to reach Mount Doom and destroy the ring once and for all. Complications arise as Frodo suspects Sam of betrayal and theft, while Gollum plans to murder Frodo and take the ring back. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) rides with Pippin (Billy Boyd) to Minas Tirith to warn the humans of the attack, while Arwen (Liv Tyler) realizes she is to become a mortal and have a child with Aragorn. The story comes to its final climax as Frodo reaches the core of Mount Doom and Aragorn, together with his army leads the Mount Doom army away to set a clear path for Frodo. From minute one, you get sucked into the insanely arousing visuals. The stellar special effects and the epic battles that include incredibly intricate fighting scenes, along with stellar sound, to make the epic battle realistic and fast. The most complex and stunning CGI creation is the creature Gollum (who we see transform from human to monster in the first 10 minutes of the movie). His fish-eyes move around and his body language sways and we forget that he isn't real. And as he attempts to steal the ring and frame Sam, that feeling sets in as though we've been watching a villain kill the main protagonist. In some ways, he has more character traits than a lot of the human actors in the movie. For example, when he talks to himself while looking at his own reflection in the water, he exhibits countless emotions and we know the torment he is experiencing. Peter Jackson combines CGI and real settings but we never know it. We cannot tell whether a pathway is computer generated or built, whether a door that leads to a lava pit is trick photography or just a different setting. He is able to direct in such a way that the city of Minas Tirith looks both impossible to build, but very convincing. Even Mount Doom seems realistic and we question whether it is a real volcano or just another one of Jackson's genius visions. Not to mention the final battle of Middle Earth, we're constantly thrown into moving mammoths, flying humans, arrows appearing out of nowhere, rocks falling from the sky, people running, swords swinging. And it's all done in one single scene. Our eyes widen with excitement and disbelief, and we can't look away. Not far away from the complete CGI fighting, Frodo and Sam walk up a set of stairs as a shortcut that Gollum showed them to get to Mount Doom quicker. Sam's becoming restless but still gives all of the food to Frodo. Gollum is becoming more impatient, and Frodo is walking into the dark side. We question whether or not Frodo will make it to Mount Doom, and whether Sam will be able to help him. But even if they do make it, will they make it back? We want hope, and no character better than Gandalf offers that to us. He says "I see Frodo. He is alive" as he smiles and cheerfully pats Aragorn on the back. There are many scenes in which the audience feels emotion for the character, the situation and the outcome. For example, Denethor (John Noble) finds that his son had been killed and summons his younger son into battle. Upon his son's return he loses his mind and starts to burn himself and his son alive in an attempt to rid himself of guilt. In another very powerful scene, Pippin stands in Denethor's presence as he starts singing a song. This song parallels beautifully the beginning of the big fight, as the Orcs fly and run towards the castle. The directing is undoubtedly superb, and every aspect of the visuals is brilliant. There isn't even a need to comment on the details since from one look at the movie it is a given. "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is an incredible gem and a wonderfully directed film. This final film is a perfect example of how a fantasy epic can work in every way possible.
10.0~The Best Finale To A Trilogy That I Have Ever Seen Cadburyboy101 Sign in Permalink I saw this film in 2008 for the first time and have since watched it over 30 times as i just can't get enough of the LoTRs trilogy. I loved the film so much and the LoTRs is now my all time favourite film series. It lives up to its previous two films and leaves you wishing for another film. I totally recommend watching the LoTRs trilogy as all three of the films are absolutely phenomenal. The Return of the King is a great film that rounds of the trilogy nicely, it has the quest to take the ring to mount doom and many battle scenes with orcs surrounding minas tirith. The fellowship carry out the rest of the journey separately as they do not stay together until the end.
