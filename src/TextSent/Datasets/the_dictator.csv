4.0~Didn't meet expectations jordan2240 Sign in Permalink I did not find this to be nearly as funny as "Borat" or even "Bruno." There were a few amusing parts, but nothing that caused uproarious laughter for me or anyone else in the theater, and many of the jokes fell completely flat. I was quite amused, however, by the preview for an upcoming Will Farrel movie where he slugs a baby, so this particular visit to the theater did provide some enjoyment. I rate "The Dictator" below average because I thought it provided fewer laughs than what an average comedy should. As with any SBC film, you should expect a few gross-out scenes, but in his previous films, they actually provided some humor. Not so with this one. I won't be so anxious to see SBC's next endeavor.
8.0~Very funny in both silly and satirical sense MarcusJ13 Sign in Permalink The Dictator is a film slightly different from Sacha Baron Cohen's previous work but it does take advantage of its scripted nature. Baron Cohen plays Admiral General Aladeen who travels to New York to speak to the United Nations. While not knowing his brother and rightful heir to Wadiya has other plans. Straight away there are jokes that come thick and fast. These jokes open with the silly, this was a move I preferred as a satirical outlook right away would be detrimental to what is supposed to be a fun film. Baron Cohen does very well in the role and seems more naturally funny than he was as the character of Bruno. In non mockumentary mode though the laughs do not come as thick and fast but when they do it is very hysterical. Anna Faris does brilliantly in the role of Health food shop owner and Aladeen's only form of support while he is a fish out of water. The key strength of the film is probably its ability to have Aladeen able to be funny with any other character on screen. The satirical aspect is not as in your face as it could have been and it does make for as equal opportunity as you can get in terms of targets. Some may feel there is an agenda being played at plenty of times within the film but it doesn't feel preachy and just tends to take a swipe rather than bombard its targets. All in all the film succeeds at what it needs to do providing both the zaniness required to add to the satire.
5.0~Sometimes funny but I wish they'd spent more time on the movie than the marketing. Sergeant_Tibbs Sign in Permalink Borat is a distant memory by now, but a fond one even if it isn't the laugh riot it was the first time. I don't know why Sacha Baron Cohen is still trying to do these low-brow types of satires when I know he has the talent for so much more, both comedy and drama. Taking on a more conventional style of comedy, The Dictator ends up pretty generic. It goes for cheap blows and on-the-nose laughs and tries too hard to be shocking. It can be funny at times but only when standards are dropped quite low. I didn't have much expectations but it's unsurprisingly disappointing. It is entertaining enough to pass the time but I wish they'd spent more time on the movie than the marketing. 5/10
8.0~A Nutshell Review: The Dictator DICK STEEL Sign in Permalink I had visited the Republic of Wadiya in North Africa, and it was great. Especially when the host is none other than Admiral General Aladeen, the Dictator himself. Sacha Baron Cohen seemed to have outdone himself with his latest character creation after the likes of Ali G, Borat and Bruno, and together with director Larry Charles who did the previous films in mockumentary style, their latest collaboration took a more fictional turn with Cohen, Alec Berg, David Mandell and Jeff Schaffer contributing to the narrative, which in one work I'll summarize as: Wicked. It's been too long since I went to the movies and laughed as hard as I did today, and I'm thinking it's probably since the mo-lei-tau days of the 90s in Hong Kong Cinema that something as irreverent as what's included here, can tickle my funny bone so hard, that it was an incredible laugh a minute for what felt longer than its 83 minute run time. OK, so sue me if I am laughing at everything that's politically incorrect, crass, rude, vulgar, racist, sexist, disrespectful and just about violating every iota of human decency. It's an outright comedy, so I guess having to lighten up with the silliness on display isn't really a crime committed. Sacha Baron Cohen seemed to have outdone himself this time. When you were probably thinking with his Borat and Bruno films earning him some form of notoriety, here comes yet another creation that's just as no holds barred despite being scripted. Probably the best comedian in film at the moment, you got to salute his marketing and publicity machinery for getting him just about almost everywhere in character to earn that mind share, given that the Admiral General is a new character that hasn't appeared in the television shows that Cohen had done in the past. Modelled after the late dictator Gaddafi of Libya, everything and anything about dictators - their wealth, harem of women, and having whatever they say as law - get made fun of through wonderful satire, even if the story's wafer thin, the laughs specifically designed were incredible. And it centers around the necessity of Aladeen to travel to New York to address the UN General Assembly, only for a plot hatched to replace him with his own decoy to sign off a new democratic constitution for his fictional country. But trust the Admiral General to survive outside his comfort zone, team up with a once political exile (that he thought had been executed), and to find genuine love in the form of an environmental activist, while in the running against time to regain his rightful place as leader of his country and prevent his losing of grip on his country. The villains are clear, and very much pointed at oil companies, and the Chinese, which in the film became the butt of many jokes which I suspect some may not find it amusing. But in any case, The Dictator boasted the likes of Ben Kingsley (who would have thought!) as Aladeen's uncle Tamir, and another comedian in Anna Faris, who frankly in another movie would have been a marquee. Here she's clearly over-shadowed by Cohen, though that could be due to her character being there as the butt of some of the sexist jokes, and nothing more than to further reinforce the notion that dictators are lonely at the top, and all they really need, for the good of the world, is a good cuddle, love and attention, at least for his Dictator, who got the world's attention through his plans to own a few nuclear weapons. Other stars appear as cameos, such as Megan Fox playing a prostituting version of herself, and Edward Norton too in a somewhat similar role. Yes, Edward Norton. Really. Even for the harshest of Sacha Baron Cohen's critics will have to agree that The Dictator does have its moments when it goes for the jugular in making fun of the politics of our time, the corruption that's permeating through what we like to think of as a fair system, and of course, the notion of democracy itself, by drawing some unlikely parallels between the woes of today's world against that of the democratic system. It's satire at its best, with excellent writing and flawless delivery all rolled into one that makes The Dictator truly memorable, especially when it knows when to pull its punches, and when not to for maximum effect. Apparently our censorship tolerance level had been tweaked to relax a little here. While Sacha Baron Cohen's other two films Borat and Bruno were rated R21, with the latter having to suffer the removal of certain scenes, this one got away with M18, despite having male genitalia on display, and same sex kissing which would have automatically earned it R21 status many moons ago. So if you're game for a rip roaring rowdy time experiencing some outrageous comedy that will tickle you silly, then make a beeline for The Dictator, before he decides to take your head off for the lack of support. Highly recommended as one of the craziest film comedies of this year by arguably one of the best comedians in recent times who's not afraid to make fun of everyone and everything in no holds barred fashion.
1.0~even for an absurd comedy there's a line and this one crosses it far too much friendlyclown Sign in Permalink awful script awful acting it's awful from the beginning to the end, but i was surprised that sir ben kingsley agreed to take part in this one sad to see him in the cast. if you are a good viewer you will see the whole summary of the film. i'm not saying ''don't expect much'' i am just saying ''don't expect anything at all'' i don't like writing bad reviews but i tried my hardest to write at least something, anything good about the film but i couldn't find any. of course we know it's an absurd comedy and we put our logics aside before watching the film but we cant ignore horrible acting and weak plot, i mean you could have at least shown us that you made some effort and some thinking about making the film. really disappointment
6.0~Not-so-great DICTATOR; woeful misfire for Baron Cohen george.schmidt Sign in Permalink THE DICTATOR (2012) ** Sacha Baron Cohen, Anna Faris, Jason Mantzoukas, Ben Kingsley, John C. Reilly, Kevin Corrigan, Bobby Lee, Fred Armisen, (Cameo : Megan Fox as herself) Lackluster satire from Baron Cohen as ruthless fictional terrorist leader Haffaz Alladeen of Wadiya (as in what-a-ya-kiddn'-me!) whose attempt to deliver a fiery speech at the United Nations has him replaced by his idiot decoy and the fish-out-of-water despot trying desperately to fend for himself in The Big Apple with the unlikely help from organic food store owner Faris (again sadly misused and robbed of her naturally comedic talents). Hamstrung screenplay by Cohen, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer has more misses-than-hits and the static direction by the usually on-target Larry Charles is woefully inept. A misfire for Baron Cohen and co.
7.0~I believe in free press, fair elections and equal rights for wo... I can't said that! freemantle_uk Sign in Permalink Because of the success of the Borat and Bruno Sasha Baron Cohen has been become a house hold name. But the price is that he can not use his faux documentary anymore. Now Cohen has created a new created a new comic character and sets out to tell it in a more traditional comic narrative. The oil rich North African nation of Wadiya has been ruled by the iron fist of a brutal bearded dictator, Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen). But he is a lonely soul, looking for someone to cuddle. Aladeen also plans to make a nuclear bomb and NATO are ready to attack his nation. Added to the mix Aladeen's uncle and adviser Tamir (Ben Kingsley) plans to overthrown him so he can bring in the horrors of democracy and opening the country's oil reserves to the outside world. When in New York Aladeen is kidnapped by an assassin (John C. Reilly) so Tamir and use a double to sign a new constitution. But Aladeen escape and finds an unlikely ally, activist and environmental store owner Zoey (Anna Faris), some Aladeen could use to get back his seat of power. There were three moments where I was laughing like a hyena, the helicopter scene, the bridge scene and Aladeen's final speech. The main reason why they worked is because they had a smart, edgy satirical take to them and I was roaring with laugher throughout. For the rest of the film the jokes were hit and miss. Cohen had great chemistry with Jason Mantzoukas as Aladeen's ally and it was clear that some of the bits were improvised. Faris too was solid, but Kingsley felt very out of place who did not bring anything to the table. The crueller jokes also fell flat for the most part. There are laughs to be had from when Aladeen is in the shop, early scenes when he is running the country and some of the shock humour, but other shock jokes were added because that was what the filmmakers thought that was what the audience expected, not thinking on whether it was a good joke or not. The main example is the Chinese businessman who shows off his power by getting male celebrities to give him blowjobs: it was just there give the audience a controversial joke even thought it was not funny. The plot itself follows typical Hollywood, following the route of what the character wants, i.e. power, but he needs is that love. But this is a film that should have played more with conventions, particularly that they made out that Tamir was actually wanted to bring democracy because he cared about people and human rights, not because he only cares about his own self-interest. When the Aladeen was reflecting on his loneliness I felt like he should be sing "I'm so Lonely". Also some of the best jokes in the trailer should have been in the film: those being the Megan Fox and the diamonds, America being the birthplace of AIDS and my favourite, "I am for free press, fair elections and equal rights for wo". There are funny moments in The Dictator but it is miss as much as hit in its humour and targets.
5.0~Borat in a fiction film kosmasp Sign in Permalink Actually one of the segments that really worked in Brüno was when he was "trying" to solve the problem in the middle east. I'm not sure how real that was, but it felt genuine and it worked as a joke. Here he tries to take it to a whole other level with this tale of a dictator who is not exactly what he seems to be. While I only discovered right before I went to see the movie that this time around he didn't opt for making this a mock documentary ("mockumentary"?), he decided to go fiction. That doesn't stop him from having celebrities popping up left and right making fun of themselves (don't watch this for Megan Fox though, her appearance is not much longer than what you see in the trailer). Most of the times not even having a dialogue and you do wonder why some of them did it (the joke's not that good, but then again I might be wrong about that in your eyes). The movie has a few moments (like a late in the movie speech by the Dictator himself, that is anything but subtle and describes a political situation some might feel is too close to home), but other moments don't work at all. You decide what you think
7.0~Not as funny as Borat, but Sacha's hilarious once again i-Shuvo Sign in Permalink Following last year's impressive performance in Martin Scorsese's critically-acclaimed Hugo (2011), British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen is back doing what he does best with yet another satirical caricature to add to his ever growing list. For his latest endeavor, The Dictator (2012), Cohen has once again reunited with director Larry Charles (Borat, Bruno), in a film that benefits much from an uncharacteristically straightforward narrative. The Dictator's narrative is a little bit more scripted than Cohen's previous efforts, which saw him interact with real people - often with hilarious results. In addition to the riches-to-rags story beat, there is also a Rom-com element to the film as Aladeen is helped along his journey of redemption by Zoey, which makes for some humorous moments. You needn't worry about it being too scripted though; Cohen's unique brand of offensive humor is on full display from the outset as sexist, racist, and vulgar gags abound. Saddled in-between are a number of outrageous, cringe-worthy sequences that have long been Cohen's trademark. These often occur with scientist turned partner-in-crime Nadal, and the chemistry between Cohen and Mantzoukas is evident. Admittedly, not all the jokes hit their mark - the celebrity cameos (including Megan Fox) don't have the intended impact, but the audience reaction is for the most part well-calculated. The hilarious usage of overblown music tracks such as Moment Like This is just one example of the excellent comedic timing which permeates The Dictator throughout. If you don't take Cohen's latest role too seriously, you may likely find Admiral General Aladeen to be another fantastic character to add to Cohen's catalogue. Assuming you're not easily offended, The Dictator is laugh-out-loud comedy at its best.
8.0~This is not a Borat nor Bruno, this is different. iamtherealhero Sign in Permalink First of all, i am tired of sick of people complaining about the movie being so unrealistic, this is a comedy movie for Christ sake, let it be that way, so the movie starts off with Aladeen being replaced by his double on his way to USA on his powers, Aladeen then works out how he can get his place back, tbh i first thought that this movie was disappointing but it's not, later when i got into the plot, i went into the movie and started enjoying it. This is absolutely brilliant stuff and shows off every bit of stereotypes on both the places. Go with a light heart inside, enjoy with it and come out with a lighter heart. 8/10 for this.
3.0~A comedy desert with rare oases of humour geodrake-71-627198 Sign in Permalink I'm a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, getting hooked during his early 'Ali G' days on Britain's Channel 4. His humour is always crude, vulgar, childish and extremely silly. Yet at times it is also heavily satirical, aimed at those, like racists, who deserve such treatment. By remaining so convincingly in character, always pushing the limits of bad taste, Baron Cohen is often downright hilarious. 2004's 'Ali G In Da House – The Movie' was a let down as his trademark windups and improvised humour were replaced by a mundane script. 'Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan' in 2006 capitalised on what made that character great by focussing on real life prank interviews with only a small scripted element. This was so popular that Baron Cohen's third alter ego 'Bruno' got his own film in 2009, which for my money was even funnier than 'Borat' as it skewered some very worthy targets, I.E. homophobes and celebrity/fashion culture. Baron Cohen also took roles in other titles, including playing 'Adolfo Pirelli' alongside Johnny Depp in 'Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barbour of Fleet Street', released 2007. But after using all three of his famous characters, and becoming too well known to be able to pull pranks, what solo projects could Baron Cohen tackle next? Sadly, the answer is 2012's 'The Dictator', where he plays 'Admiral General Aladeen', the brutal, childish ruler of fictional Wadiya. Predictably, Aladeen has to travel to America to address the U.N. regarding his 'peaceful' nuclear programme. There, he is left wandering New York incognito after a botched assassination attempt that sees his idiot double 'Efawadh' (also Baron Cohen) take his place as ruler to do the bidding of Aladeen's Uncle Tamir, who's played by Ben Kingsley. Why an actor of Kingsley's ability keeps ending up in demeaning roles like this is a mystery. His low point was surely playing 'The Evil Hood' in the dire live action 'Thunderbirds' of 2004. Anyways, Aladeen is befriended by American left wing activist Zoey (Ana Faris, best known from the 'Scary Movie' franchise), who fails to recognise him as the dictator she's been campaigning against in a rally outside the U.N. building. He also enlists the help of former Wadiyan nuclear scientist Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) whose execution Aladeen had ordered on a whim some years before. It turns out that all Aladeen's execution order victims were smuggled to the U.S. by the Wadiyan resistance. The rest of the plot concerns Aladeen and Nadal trying to prevent Efawadh declaring Wadiya a democracy in a speech to the U.N, so that Tamir can get rich selling oil to outsiders. Inevitably, along the way Zoey and Aladeen fall in love, he defeats the plot against him and after a change of heart brings (cosmetic) democracy to Wadiya. You'd be forgiven for thinking this is a recipe for success, after all playing outrageously unpolitically correct foreigners is Sacha Baron Cohen's forte. Whilst there are some genuinely funny moments, like Aladeen's 'Munich Olympics' Wii game in which the player guns down Jewish athletes; 'The Dictator is badly let down by a poor script, the same problem that crippled 'Ali G In Da House'. In 'Borat' and a lesser degree in 'Bruno' the script was just a frame to hang pranks from. So it didn't matter how fluid it was. Whereas 'The Dictator' is all scripted, thus requiring decent plot, characterisation and professional direction, none of which it gets. A lot of humour generated by the Borat and Bruno characters came from watching real people's reactions to them. Naturally this humour is missing from 'The Dictator'. Instead, visual slapstick and dialogue are used, to weak effect. For every joke that's funny, such as Aladeen trying to throw away a newborn when he sees it's a girl, there's about five others, like the Chinese official paying male Hollywood stars to fellate him, that fall flat. The satire is spelled out to such a degree that all mirth is wrung out of it. More damage is done as the writers try to give Aladeen a sympathetic edge. All he really wants is true love, the one thing his power and wealth cannot get him. Sure, he can pay Michael Bay reject Megan Fox for sex, but he can't make her cuddle afterwards. Sacha Baron Cohen's other creations have no redeeming characteristics at all, that's part of why they're so amusing. Humanising Aladeen detracts from his entertainment value and sits awkwardly alongside gags about him molesting fourteen year old boys who subsequently commit suicide. Is this someone the audience is meant to root for? I was made to laugh out loud during 'The Dictator', just not nearly as often as I'd expected. Hopefully Sacha Baron Cohen will put more thought into any future projects of his, or stick to appearing in other people's films.
6.0~Mostly boring, but funny parts were pretty darned funny marevans79 Sign in Permalink When I asked the lady at the concessions stand if The Dictator was any good, she said, "well, it's mostly boring, but the funny parts are really funny". She was so right. There are many boring popcorn scenes in this movie. I have hated every single Sacha Baron Cohen movie I have ever seen (with the exception of Sweeney Todd). However, this movie was pretty decent. The funny parts are what make this movie worth seeing. Anna Faris was decently funny. And of course, all the cameos were awesome! Of course, I wouldn't pay full price to go see it. Wait till your local theater has a discount day. :)
6.0~Outrageous and over the top just as expected as Always! avadheshbagla Sign in Permalink Every Since "Ali G" from the big Ben and "Borat" from Kazakhstan (where by the way i have been to and is nothing like in the film!) and the recent gay fashion designer "Bruno", Sacha Baron Cohens sense of humor and character comedy is either liked by one for being so outrageously over the top or is simply crude and sick! I have actually quite enjoyed his over the top characters! This 1 though gives u the feeling that hes actually trying to make these outrageous (which cannot be described) work very hard unlike say in Borat where it worked naturally somehow for him. It does have some outrageous parts and fun (doing a spoof of Sadam Hussain having fun is itself unbelievable) but kinda feels like u have seen the jokes bf4 in another way. Yet for the sheer gusto by which Sacha goes abut playing An Arab Dictator aka Saddam! is worth seeing 1nce perhaps? Hez a very different kind of say Austin powers. Its mindless yet there seems to be an attempt at creating some heartfelt moments but then goes back to what he knows best int the end, tried and tested. See this 1 if u r a fan or wait for his next which is apparently a spoof on James Bond! Don't see this if u have a weak stomach for theatrics, there are scenes here which will just make u sit back and say what the hell is happening!
9.0~Different format to what you were expecting, but Cohen delivers as always davideo-2 Sign in Permalink STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) is the tyrannical dictator of Widiya, a fictional Middle Eastern country, who has the world in a flurry over his alleged nuclear weapons plot. He is convinced to attend a UN conference in New York to take part in a negotiation, only for his traitorious aide Tamir (Ben Kingsley) to hatch a plot to have him abducted, depersonified and have an imposter take his place, who will meet the UN's demands so trade sanctions are lifted. Following a daring escape, Aladeen and his sidekick Omar (Sayed Badreya) must foil the dastardly deed and expose Tamir's duplicity. With his three TV creations now all given the big screen treatment, Sacha Baron Cohen has had to draw up a new comic character for his fourth cinematic outing, in the shape of Aladeen, a blatant, colourful send up of the recently deceased Colonel Gadaffi. It would appear his face has become too well known to employ the method he's used in his last two films, with the risk he would just get recognised and the gags wouldn't work. So, re-teaming with Borat director Larry Charles, Cohen's returned a little to the style of his first Ali G big screen adventure, while never losing the style and feel of the last few films that have made him famous. Once again, Cohen goes for the jugular with a none stop battering ram of none PC, near the knuckle gags that also show their more intelligent side by exposing the hidden hypocrises and prejudices that exist within 'the American dream', all existing within the frame work of a timely subject matter. While this could be off putting and uneasy for some, it only serves to make it all the more hilarious for everyone else and so the target demographic is met. If you've liked Cohen's work so far, you'll know what to expect and are unlikely to be disappointed, or left anything other than a gibbering, hysterical wreck. ****
10.0~A wonderful film that motivates everyone to be a good person jeremycorbyn Sign in Permalink I loved this film, it had many laughs and jokes, I couldn't stop myself laughing to the extent I nearly choked to death watching it at the cinema! This film clearly shows diversity is our strength and it showed Islam is peaceful religion. This film should be showed to all Islamophobes out there. The main character was a truly honourable man. The main characters beard even inspired me to grow one myself because I got that connected to the main character. Although there were many beards in this film, this film didn't have too much masculinity in it though to the point it was toxic so I really liked that aspect and I adored the female lead character who had hairy armpits showing that women can be beautiful and hairy at the same time.
1.0~Utterly horrible and unfunny - Sasha Baron Cohen has become a victim of his own success lornloxor Sign in Permalink Just wow, how did anyone involved with this film think this was a good idea? Borat and Bruno were funny because of the reactions of the unwitting participants and how they revealed something about people's hypocrisies and so on. You really thought anything could happen at any time with these films. The Dictator on the other hand is completely scripted and the writing is just...bad. It's half political farce and half romantic comedy and this combination just doesn't work. The romance in the film didn't work at all and the political farce wasn't witty or intelligent in the slightest. The acting was also quite terrible. Sasha Baron Cohen of course needs to go a bit over the top with his character but this was just too much. Anna Faris was a black hole where comedy goes to die. Also, how did Ben Kinglsey agree to be in this film? Does he need the money that badly? The movie relies heavily on stereotypes which could be very funny but in this movie the stereotypes are just way, way, way over the top where they become humorless. I laughed once during the film at the bit about Aladeen changing the dictionary definitions. And I wanted to laugh. Borat was genuinely hilarious and Bruno was a bit worse than that but it was still very funny at times. Not the case with the Dictator. Even Aladeen's monologue about American politics felt more like an afterthought which they probably hoped people would upload to Youtube to get more publicity for the film. The success of Borat and Bruno have probably made it hard for Sasha Baron Cohen to make another mockumentary type movie and therefore he had to make a completely scripted movie. The previous films relied heavily on Cohen's ability to be completely unashamed whilst doing hilarious things to real people who were unaware of his act. When it's a scripted movie, this formula doesn't work anymore. They were really trying to imitate the style of his earlier films while doing a scripted movie. The humor is really just repulsive and provocative without the laughs. Most of the time I was just staring at the screen in utter disbelief wondering how they thought this would be funny. All in all, what a terrible mess of a movie. The plot is horrible, the performances are dull and unfunny and the jokes are crass without any payoff.
6.0~Political satire, laughs and racial jokes in abundance... paul_haakonsen Sign in Permalink Well, "The Dictator" is definitely a movie that is not suitable for just anyone, and if you are particularly sensitive about racial jokes, political jokes, political incorrectness and the likes, then you should stay well clear of this movie; because it is one long parade of all those things from the start to the very end. Needless to say what to expect from this movie, as it is Sacha Baron Cohen at work again, so if you are familiar with "Borat" or "Brüno" then you know what you are in for here, just aimed at a higher level in a way. The story was actually quite good, and aside from being funny and full of jokes, there was also a deeper touch to it, as the main character of dictator Aladeen (played by Cohen) went through somewhat of a spiritual journey during his stay in the United States of America and changed his person, or at least tried to. The comedy and humor in "The Dictator" is crude, raw and right in your face. There is no velvet gloves here, and it is just dripping with satire, sarcasm and political incorrectness. And I must say that I loved it, then again I also do have an odd sense of humor. The comedy is not really the type that will have you laughing all throughout the movie; there were some good laughs here and there, but the comedy works so well because Cohen uses it as the common Joe would use it, just amplified to the extreme, of course. And the way that Cohen is able to take the situation of the world today and incorporate in the comedy and in the political incorrectness is just brilliant. If you liked "Borat" and/or "Brüno", then you should definitely check out "The Dictator", because Cohen is back and in great shape. Good entertainment, good story, good costumes, and heaps of moments to make you curl your toes up and go "oh no he didn't!", this is somewhat of an acquired sense of comedy, but great fun for us that like it that way.
8.0~Spot-on satire dfranzen70 Sign in Permalink Yes, of course you will like this movie if you liked Borat. The Dictator is about another foreigner who's in America but utterly clueless about the ways of the States. In this case, more is good; the movie more than makes up for the travesty that was Bruno (shudder) and manages to again inject quite a bit of satire at America and its denizens. Sacha Baron Cohen plays Hafez Aladeen, ruler of a small African nation that's sort of a stand in for Iran. They might have nukes. They might be weaponizing their plutonium. No one knows. The UN issues an ultimatum (that's how you know it's satire): come to New York and explain yourself to us or we'll take corrective measures. Aladeen, as counseled by his associate Tamir (Sir Ben Kingsley), finally concedes and heads to the Big Apple, strutting around the city astride an elephant. He's all about showmanship, Aladeen. At any rate, he's abducted almost as soon as he arrives at his hotel but escapes his captors - but sans his trademark beard. Now, you just don't go around cutting people's beards off, unless you're part of the Amish Mafia, and even then there are repercussions. So here we have Aladeen, alone on the streets of New York, desperately trying to get back into the hotel where he is to give his speech. Of course everything goes awry. Somehow he finds himself at a co-op run by Zoey (Anna Faris), a stereotypical no-armpit-shaved feminist (hey, I didn't write this script) who believes in diversity and kindness and giving people a chance, all things that Aladeen deplores. So he gets a job there. Why? Because as the plot would have it, her company has the contract to supply the hotel with food. Nice coincidence, no? Unlike Borat, The Dictator does not rely on the unscripted reactions of average Americans; it's an honest-to-goodness movie. And it is really, really fun if it catches you in the right mood. And you don't mind being grossed out (hint: watch for the cell phone/birth scene). As you might guess, as Aladeen (or, as he is known to Zoey, "Allison Burgers") plots to return to the hotel, give a grand speech about how dictators rule and democracies drool, and rip up his country's ostensible new constitution, he is gradually falling for Zoey. Wouldn't you know it. Hey, any lady who teaches you how to self pleasure must be a keeper, right? At least he doesn't have her beheaded. Look, a lot of the comedy is juvenile, more so than man-child Adam Sandler, but somehow Cohen makes it really work well. Aladeen has lovingly oppressed his people for years and plans to keep doing so, UN be damned, but adviser Tamir has other plans. Ordinarily, you'd side with Tamir, wouldn't you? Eh, not so fast, my friend. Trust me, there's a darn good reason to not like Tamir and his motives. The movie plays on American's post-9/11 fears and its heightened senses of both security-as-theater and, well, insecurity. Maybe they really ARE out to get us! There's a hilarious scene in a tourist helicopter in which two fellow riders confuse the conversation that Aladeen is having with his compatriot Nadal for a plot to bomb the U.S. Why? Well, two Middle-Eastern-looking men who mention "bin Laden" and "9/11" and "9/11 2012," with one of them wearing a back brace that, to the untrained eye, looks like a suicide bomber's attire. Too soon? Nah, it's not, because Cohen's satire is so on target. There's a speech given at the end that compares the wonders of dictatorship to the restrictions of democracy. You have to see this speech. If only our leaders saw it for what it was and would act accordingly.
8.0~Very funny, very clever barbara-364 Sign in Permalink On one level, this film is extremely funny slapstick, but it's very clever too. For me one of the funniest bits was when Aladeen hangs on a wire above the streets of New York and gets rid of a health drink which he says has as much potassium as three bananas and then he gets rid three bananas from another pocket, in case the drink didn't work. He also voids himself of his pooh (he's been a bit constipated) to make himself lighter. Of course it lands on someone's head. Aladeen lists many of the 'advantages' of having a dictatorship in his speech to the United Nations. Some of his arguments, I noticed particularly the point about allowing banks to gamble with people's money and having the prisons mostly populated by one ethnic group are actually features of certain western democracies. I was laughing all the way through this speech! It's a laugh out loud film, although some of Aladeen's apparent exploits as a dictator, talked about, not demonstrated, were a little bit too near the knuckle for me. I particularly loved the way he made up names for himself out of notices and the way he took over the running of the shop. The whole film is clever and i probably need to see it more than once to appreciate all of it.
7.0~The political commentary is witty and humorous but many of the film's grotesque jokes misfire! Hellmant Sign in Permalink 'THE DICTATOR': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sacha Baron Cohen co-wrote and stars in this political satire about a fictional Third World dictator fighting to overcome a plot to turn his country into a democracy. Larry Charles, who also directed Cohen in 'BORAT' and 'BRUNO', directed the film but this is not a mockumentary (for a change) like those films. It was co-written by Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer and co-stars Anna Faris and Ben Kingsley. The film is very funny at times with spot-on political commentary but it also misfires with laughs, frequently. Cohen plays General Hafez Aladeen, the dictator of the fictional Republic of Wadiya. He has kept the people in oppression there while reaping all the countries' resources and building nuclear weapons. While visiting the UN Headquarters in New York, about his countries' suspected nuclear weapons, Aladeen is kidnapped by a hit-man (John C. Reilly) hired by his uncle Tamir (Kingsley) to kill him. After surviving the assassination attempt he discovers that his uncle has plotted to have a double (also played by Cohen) sign a document which would democratize Wadiya in order to make it's oil fields available for business. Aladeen befriends an activist named Zoey (Faris) and takes refuge at her co-op while he plots to stop his uncle's plan. Like I said the comedy is hit and miss, some of it is hilarious while other parts are just dumb. The political commentary is witty and humorous but many of the film's grotesque jokes misfire and are just disgusting to watch and boring. I'd like to see Cohen branch out a little and try his hand at comedy that's not so dark and full of violence and dick and fart jokes. If he could pull off something more lighthearted and still be humorous that would show real talent. This movie offers more of the same styled jokes that filled his previous two films but to less successful results. Not having real people in mockumentary style situations might have hurt the film as well. Still the commentary on America and the film's main message about how were as much of a dictatorship as most Third World countries really works and Cohen's efforts are still admirable.

6.0~Slapstick Comedy but nothing too special...beats Bruno anyway! The_creator2010 Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen returns to chuckle the audience with another wacky character, a "Mockumentary" fictional portrayal of a Dictator by the name of Aladeen. The republic of Wadiya is summoned by the oppressive ruling of Aladeen, who's portrayal of a disruptive and in-human individual is far from mundane. Although Aladeen is as egotistic and ruthless as they come, his hilarious persona sees him travel to New York to clear up an apparent accusation of his holdings in Wadiya. The South African oil rich country he dictates has had eye brows raised for strong rumors concerning a mass holding of nuclear weapons. America, being the most convenient (sarcastic)country to voice its opinion, calls for Aladeen to voice a clear explanation for these accusations. It is when Aladeen arrives in New York for a conference that the trip goes awry and where the elements of his true character and comedy combine. He is soon found a lost puppy when an incident involving his kidnapping sees him left on the streets of New York with his signature beard being removed leaving him unrecognizable but vulnerable to the public which could be a bad thing in terms of his reputation. Aladeen, who would rather shoot himself in the head than see his beloved Wadiya turn into a Democracy state, is fighting for his country and leadership as Tahir replaces Aladeen with a foney Dictator, who in time, will agree to a Democracy free republic. The Dictator offers a decent cast. Ben Kingsley plays Tahir, a corrupt friend of who in truth wants rid of him, leaving himself to take the throne of Wadiya. Anna Faris is Zoey, a helpful individual who runs a food store in the heart of the city. Oblivious to the man without the beard, she offers to help Aladeen with work and offers him a job in her store. Minor cameos include Megan Fox, and a bit-part role featuring the always hilarious John C. Reilly who is Clayton, the head of security at a Waldorf hotel who assures Aladeen of his safety. So what does the Dictator offer in difference to Sacha Baron's previous creations. It was nice to see a scripted concept from Sacha. Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006) was brilliant and will go down as one of greatest comedies of all time. But Brüno (2009) over stepped the mark in terms of the sheer desperate attempt to make the audience laugh, failing to accomplish what Borat had done in terms of originality. Sure, the character was gay and we found his feminist personality fun at first, but all in all it was highly forgettable. The Dictator succeeds in keeping you entertained, offering some hilarious, yet unexpected moments in the movie where you will be like "Did that just happen"?. Obviously, like Borat and Bruno, it gains notice through its level of controversy. Sacha does indeed over step the mark relating to real life Dictators and he does it with hilarious originality. The Dictator is nothing special but is worth a watch, especially for its cheap laughs and outlandish character. I was delighted to see Sacha Baron descend from the concept that brought his British persona to life in Hollywood. Ali G Indahouse was the first fictional character from Sacha in what was hugely successful in Britain. To see Sacha reform to script writing once again was enjoyable and makes for a decent watch. Overall: Don't be fooled by Bruno or Borat, very different and surprisingly humorous Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/
1.0~Borat was great, Brüno was good, The Dictator is awful! Bento_de_Espinosa Sign in Permalink After Borat I had a lot of sympathy for Mr. Cohen. Even though his jokes are very flat and simple, I actually found him funny. Brüno was more like a worse copy of Borat, but still OK. So I still found Mr. Cohen sympathetic. Now, with The Dictator, all that sympathy is gone. Even though I knew he is Jew I could never imagine he would use his religion to make jokes in such a patriotic and primitive way. I'm not religious and I really don't care what religion someone belongs to. I'm also not patriotic, I find patriotism something simply ridiculously infantile. But with The Dictator it is as if Mr. Cohen had a mission to show to the world how impeccable Israel and the Jews are. Woody Allen is a master of comedy for the very reason that he is notably critical about the religion and the family roots in which he was born (see Deconstructing Harry or read his books). I hoped Mr. Cohen would be similar. But it's obvious that Woody Allen is for intellectuals and Sacha Baron Cohen for the flat-headed. The Dictator is a very flat undifferentiated hymn of praise for Israel for the politically and religiously simple-minded ones and therefore not really a comedy.
4.0~Not going to waste time with a massive review but... KeironG Sign in Permalink Compared to his former films such as Borat and Bruno (Ill leave Ali G out..., better best forgotten as some naff pop group used to sing) this film is a lot weaker in terms of outrageous humour, yes there are parts of the film that begin to push towards Sacha Baron Cohens uniquely outrageous films of the past but then they simmer again as if he has been ordered to behave himself this time round. Either way, yes its OK as a film, it has some funny bits, some dull bits, to be honest in hindsight I'd definitely wait for the film to come down in price before I even considered buying it. Better spending the money on something else or go watch something at the pictures instead :)
10.0~Something original and fresh hlollipop Sign in Permalink I am really sceptical when it comes to the comedy genre, most of movies nowdays are written in so many bad ways, and with forced humor. I found this one really funny, probably the best movie in comedy genre that I've seen thus far. You'll find it funny especially if you are a person who like memes and Rucka Rucka parodies on youtube :)
3.0~Hairy Potter..... FlashCallahan Sign in Permalink Haffaz Alladeen is the bizarre dictator of the oil-rich African nation of Wadiya. Alladeen is as egotistical and ruthless as dictators come, executing anyone who disagrees with him by using a "head chop" signal. Alladeen is summoned by the UN to address their concerns about his nuclear program, but there he is kidnapped.... I love SBC, ever since he played Ali G, in the eleven o' clock show, his characters are great in small 10 minute segments. When they have the transition to the big screen, they have mixed results. The Ali G movie was awful, Borat was amusing but ran out of steam in the final act. Bruno was more of the same, but smutty for smutty sake. And now we have a new creation. And it's more of the same. We have the distasteful jokes, nudity and borderline racism, that should be offencive, but you cannot be bothered to be upset by it. as it's a comedy, I laughed twice throughout the film, the rest was pretty tedious to watch, despite the fact that Aladeen is quite the endearing character. Support is good from the always reliable Faris, and Kingsley just phones it in as usual (give back your Knighthood...please). It plods along in a predictable way, and gets more and more mundane as the film goes on. The writing is tiresome, and apart from the one of two genuinely funny parts (the helicopter scene), the writing was inane and seemed to target teenagers, rather than an adult audience. Now I know that some teenagers like more intelligent fare, but this is making money, and it's far from intelligent. SBC, you are great in supporting roles, such as Hugo and Sweeney Todd, but this sort of stuff, really tarnishes your reputation as a good actor.
7.0~A dictatorship has never been this hilarious. leoxatzian Sign in Permalink On the one hand, Sasha Baron Cohen's "The Dictator" is a political satire that, much like most of his comedies, is simply not for the easily offended. On the other hand, people who don't mind watching a movie where international politics, dictatorships, religious groups and even entire cultures are endlessly being mocked for the fun of it will have nothing short of a great time. In conclusion, while those who don't enjoy offensive humour will find this to be an unfunny and tasteless movie those who do will simply have a lot of fun watching it.
5.0~Baron Cohen lost his brain vschilberg Sign in Permalink Cohen had a brilliant idea, Ben Kingsley in his cast and enough attention by the media for this one. first off, I expected this movie NOT to have the best parts revealed in the trailer already...sitting in cinema I felt like I saw it before and kinda knew whats gonna happen anyways. Too bad that he seemed to have lost his special feeling for extraordinary jokes and edgy humor. People younger than 20 might find this movie still amusing, but after having seen Borat and Brüno, Cohen should have at least put in more effort to create a story and fill it with good jokes and not stupid, improvised looking conversations. Most of them are trying too hard and feel honestly made up 5 seconds before the take. Maybe it was also pressure from the studios to create this movie in time or a midlife crisis the British culture figure is going through. Any 5 min Ali G clip is better than that. Not worth the money.
9.0~my notes sstrunks-05245 Sign in Permalink One of the funniest movies ever. laughed almost throughout the entire movie. everything he said made me laugh, he just sounds so funny. lots of arabic-specific humor that was hysterical. sacha baron cohen is a genius (4 viewings)
3.0~Doesn't work andyedmonds Sign in Permalink I think Sacha Baron Cohen should stick to the style he used in Borat and Bruno as they were FAR funnier than this effort.To me that's where his skill lies and he has cornered the market on his own unique genre so why change. It would be like watching Michael Moore try and make a fictional action thriller. The jokes in this film just don't work and why Ben Kingsley agreed to play such a lame role is puzzling. He must have bought another holiday home on the French coast. The whole film has a kind of Ricky Gervais vibe to it whereby someone genuinely funny at what they do tries to branch out and do something for the mass market. They are out of their depth and I believe Baron Cohen is with this piece of work. He has borrowed so many boring over-used story lines like the whole double identity leader scenario PAleeez! and the fact that love conquers all in the end was just commercial bile to this viewer. There are no big laughs like there were in Borat and Bruno and even his attempt to shock the audience with full frontal nudity brings on a yawn of familiarity. On the surface I can see where the original idea would have brought about some excitement but the end result is an average un-funny movie that no doubt will bomb at the box office and be out on DVD next month.
7.0~Provocative yet Irresestable. uttiyo-sarkar56 Sign in Permalink Quite Hilarious in some parts, also being very insulting and racist in the other parts, along with the great funny acting and non-stop entertainment from Sacha Baron Cohen and the rest of the acting crew, The Dictator is a very funny movie which is quite perfect for time-pass and having a good entertainement of 90 minutes which will surely make you enjoy it and make you laugh very much from the very start to the last. The Story which is written by Sacha Baron Cohen, Alec Berg, David Mandal and Jeff Schaffer, is about an cruel and funny dictator Admiral General Alladin(Sacha) in the country of Wadiya who rules the country by his own rules and regulations and thus is questioned by the UN to stop this dictatorship and is invited to visit America where he does go. But after going there he gets kidnapped by a man and after his body double gets his place and is being controlled by his Uncle Tamir(Ben Kingsley), he must find a way to get his place back and save Wadiya from being a democratic country. Sacha Baron Cohen is the vocal point of this movie and the movie is extremely funny because of his antics in it by being an Idiotic Dictator Admiral Alladin who is cruel but lonely and dumb at the same time and his antics in this movie are really funny but a lot of insulting has been done in this movie to a number of celebrities. Ben Kingsley also did a fine job by portraying Tamir who is Alladin's sly uncle who is trying to get everything to himself by kidnapping Alladin. Jason Mantzoukas also did a funny and fine job as Nadal who is a scientist in Alladin's Nuclear Bomb Creation Centre. The Director Larry Charles has done a decent job with his crew but to be honest Sacha Baron Cohen made this movie his own right from the beginning to the end and has really put in a lot of work to make this movie. Although the director managed his crew well and did well with the more inexperienced actors and staff. The music in this movie was quite funny and the Arabian music used in it is quite unique and is funnily synchronized with the sequences. The Story in this movie is a fresh one and unique and this movie although being a bit of a slapstick movie, nevertheless manages to make you laugh and enjoy it from the beginning much to the antics of Sacha Cohen, But this movie is really Insulting to many celebrities and other respected people around the world and Its very controversial, but its good to see that all the celebrities did not get offended. Otherwise this portrayel of this crazy dictator is quite superbly shown. Well, This movie is definitely a much watch for comedy movie lovers and is a good movie for time-pass for anyone which will entertain anyone and also Sacha Baron Cohen's antics throughout the movie along with the acting of the supporting cast will surely make you laugh throughout the movie, therefore this one can be watched for time-pass and entertainment. My Rating: 6.5/10
8.0~Surprisingly good e_nnadi Sign in Permalink A movie where you can be free to laugh at stereotypical jokes even with a friend or your girlfriend from a different culture, just to get away from all the racial tension these days.If you're hypersensitive to racial jokes do all of us a favor, do not bother watching it.Even with the crude and sometimes uncomfortable humor, its still a pretty good movie. Though most people prefer Borat to this movie, in my opinion i kind of prefer this. Though you might feel guilty afterwards after laughing to the stereotype jokes.However people should remember it is a satire and they should not take the jokes so seriously as some of my friends have.Its just a movie, kickback, relax and enjoy the show.
1.0~I wasted 83 minutes of my life :( max-98-131038 Sign in Permalink Just Another Israel/Mossad production... This movie really sucks! Every comedy scene would either be too obscene or too politically biased. No story no logic, to obscene for family or kids. This idiot Sacha Cohen tries to mimic Arabic through the movie, making no sense. Sick humor. I really wish i could have just sat and done nothing instead of watching this nonsense.

6.0~Bruno > Borat > The Dictator. But still good... rm-190-480176 Sign in Permalink It seems to lack the controversial, audacious and bold aspects that Bruno and Borat had. It's good for some laughs now and again, but it's also fairly hit and miss. A few gags seem a little too forced, and a few are just unnecessary - not controversial, but rather just in poor taste - but all the things are there to make it a rather enjoyable film experience, with a tight plot and likable characters (yes, even the Dictator himself). The humor of Cohen remains crude and topical, but the character of "The Dictator" seems like one much less memorable than "Bruno" or "Borat". It even has its own little love story (and it's still a better love story than Twilight).
2.0~Not Funny gregberne11 Sign in Permalink I loved Borat and even though it was not as good I also really liked Bruno. Maybe he only had enough creative comedy energy for those two movies though because The Dictator is just a really unfunny movie. The character is stupid and the stunts he pulled were very lame, like when he spilled the urn at the Oscars that was predictable and obvious and not funny at all. This movie was a huge mistake for him to do.
8.0~Not for all, but hopefully most. grotes-que Sign in Permalink This time, instead of making a mockumentary, our beloved "BorДt" made a comeback to the screens with a new, entirely fictional film. Political satire, absolutely bad taste, vulgar, and childish slapstick humor. If you liked even a little bit his earlier works (Borat & Brüno), this you have to see. This film has a new style compared to his earlier works, and definitely is not your typical cheesy, dramatized, Adam Sandler type of comedy. I admit, that it not might be for all viewers. If you like black/adult humor, go for it! I give it a good eight out of ten.
5.0~Dictator Lacks Borat Syndromes! shafiq-siddiqui81 Sign in Permalink Those who are familiar with ALI G, Borat and Bruno, must definitely be waiting for the new and much awaited movie of Sacha Baron Cohen named "The Dictator". There is not second thought that the actor is amongst the finest comedians and can take up any script and add "life" to it by using his tremendous efforts. This particular movie "The Dictator" receives a mix reaction from the audiences. Let us discover more about this laugh riot. "The Dictator" revolves around a plot that is based on the bestselling novel "Zabibah – The Kingdom", penned by Saddam Hussein. The movie tells the tale of a ruler (Dictator) who lived a jeopardized life trying to make certain that democracy would never enter his land. Sacha Baron Cohen portrays the role of Admiral General Aladin along with the much talented and amazing actor Ben Kingsley as Taamir. As far as the performance of both the actors are concerned, they both do justice to their roles – without a doubt. But one can not go overboard when the script is weak. Same happened with "The dictator". The well known writers Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer could simply not let the audience gag. On the contrary Larry Charles (director) tries really hard to do justice and he definitely saves himself on that ground. Cohen is an amazing performer and his conviction is seen on the screen, he is one committed actor but the role that is played by him in this particular movie lacks conceiving power. He manages to provide some great laughs especially when he discusses about "Osama Bin Laden" and his death. Ana Faris is competent and adds what she is capable of. This is amongst first of those American movies that makes audience laugh at 9/11. This is definitely a bold step in itself. On the whole "The Dictator" is receiving multiple reactions, for those who have high hopes with the movie will be definitely disappointed and for those who will take it as a normal or usual fare will in one way or the other might like the movie. The movie offers few nice jokes, not good enough, and the rest of the jokes range from filthy to terrible and obtuse. Advise: Before going for this movie, throw away the expectations that were born after watching "Borat" or even "Ali G". Life will be good, if the expectations will be lesser.
5.0~If you've seen Sacha Baron Cohen then you know what to expect estebangonzalez10 Sign in Permalink ¨I love it when women go to school. It's like seeing a monkey on roller-skates. It means nothing to them, but it's so adorable for us. ¨ Like all of Sacha Baron Cohen's comedies, The Dictator is irreverent, offensive, and makes fun of pretty much every stereotype out there. He had huge success with Borat, a film I found extremely funny and smart, but the joke has gotten repetitive in his next films Bruno and this one. There are some hilarious moments in The Dictator, but there is also a lot of stupid and gross out jokes that made me want to stop watching at times. Cohen has gotten to the point where he needs to explore new themes and stop being so repetitive. He has proved he can make smart comedies with a sharp satirical tone; he makes fun of the crazy stereotypes our society has and despite making us laugh he also pulled our ears and made us think about our own conduct and behavior. In Borat he used this satire to the extreme, but it kind of has got lost in his latest films which try to entertain with cheaper and dirtier laughs. There are some great moments that work really well in The Dictator and had me laughing really hard so this movie wasn't terrible either; it did have some genuinely funny moments. Like in Borat and Bruno, Cohen got Larry Charles to direct his latest film. I really was hoping this film would be funnier because the trailers looked great and the publicity behind it by Cohen was quite funny as well (who can forget the Ryan Seacrest incident during the Oscars where Cohen showed up in character as the dictator and dumped ashes on his suit?). I think it's time for Sacha Baron Cohen to explore new themes because he has proved in the past to be a great comedian. Hafez Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) is the oppressive and wealthy dictator of the Republic of Wadiya (a made up Middle Eastern country). He rules the country with a very fierce hand and oppresses everyone. The film works as a satire of some of the Middle Eastern dictators we've all heard about in the news and Cohen got his inspiration for his character from all of them. But Cohen also makes fun of Americans and the stereotypes they have of the Arabs as well; this is best expressed in John C. Reilly's character. Aladeen is forced to travel to the United States after being threatened by the United Nations for having a nuclear program. Along with his adviser and uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) they arrive in New York the day before the meeting, but what Aladeen doesn't know is that Tamir has other plans for him. He has brought a Dictator look alike and is planning on killing Aladeen and having the imitator take his place and announce that he will change the constitution of his nation and bring back democracy to the people of Wadiya. Meanwhile Aladeen is taken hostage by Reilly's character who begins to torture him. The first thing he does is cut off his supreme beard, but Aladeen manages to escape after a freak accident. Aladeen arrives outside of the building but no one recognizes him as his imitator has already taken his place. He is surrounded by protesters and one of them, Zoey (Anna Faris), decides to help him and take him in. For the first time in his life, Aladeen can't have things his way and a series of comedic events ensue. There are several funny moments in this film and some great lines, but for the most part the film goes way too far with several gross out jokes. I really enjoyed the helicopter scene where Cohen's character is talking to his friend in his own language while two senior Americans are sitting in front of them worried about what they are saying since all they can make out are words like 911, Osama, Empire State Building, and Statue of Liberty. This scene was hilarious and had me laughing really hard, but it is about the only memorable moment I can rescue from the movie. There are some funny lines like when the dictator is helping a woman give birth and tells her the terrible news that the baby is a girl. The film makes fun of a lot of these stereotypes where women aren't considered very important in Arab culture. Sacha Baron Cohen is very irreverent and offensive; he has no problem in expressing what he thinks. He doesn't hold back anything and says things how they are. In my opinion this is what made him such a successful comedian, but at the same time he can also take things to an extreme and gross fans out due to the crude and explicitness of his jokes. I'd recommend this only to fans of Cohen who aren't scared off by his humor. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com
1.0~Neither offence nor challenging. Or funny! TheSquiss Sign in Permalink What a waste of an evening. What a disappointment! Did this really come from the mind that created the characters of Ali G, Borat and Brüno? Sacha Baron Cohen might well be something approaching a genius when it comes to creating satirical characters that ridicule the pompous and corrupt, but when it comes to writing a comedy film using actors rather than the unpredictable public, he's about as sharp as a rubber knife. The Dictator is a middle fingered homage to the absurd despots of recent years: Gadaffi, Hussein, Kim Jong-il et al. Based on the reaction of the seven other viewers last night (ignoring the eighth, a teenage girl who'd evidently found the route to hysteria through a bottle of vodka and a straw) there was one mildly funny moment in the film: a short sequence involving a new spin on an old Wii game. It wasn't a laugh out loud, or even smile quietly, moment but it did offer brief respite from the grimacing and head holding. The Dictator is a sub-Farrelly brothers effort from Cohen, the kind of film they might make if they opted for deeper barrel scraping than Shallow Hal. It's not offensive, though I'm sure some will find it so, but neither is it edgy or clever. It may think it's clever but then so do fifteen-year old drama students who attempt to ad-lib their comedic exam pieces but know neither the direction to take nor when to stop. We've all seen them, we've all cringed and we've all considered hara-kiri as a way to end it. Haven't we? If not, you will with this. In the case of Ali G, Borat and Brüno, Sacha Baron Cohen wrote his characters with panache and served them to his unsuspecting public on a razorblade platter dripping with a hemlock dressing. They were honed, three-dimensional characters who said things we wouldn't dare, who pushed the boundaries of taste and acceptability and eschewed diplomacy in favour of potshots at unpleasant people who really should know better and deserved all they got. His characters ma not have been welcome guests at our dinner tables but they were well written and they absolutely knew (and enlightened us) who the enemy was. The Dictator isn't sure who the enemy is (is it the eponymous character or the back-stabbing uncle or the hypocritical American government?) and screenwriters Cohen and Alec Berg are clearly not sure how to approach the film, develop the characters or write the gags. It feels as though they have attempted to write 83 minutes worth of jokes but not stepped back to see how, or if, they work together and have failed to see how certain scenes contradict each other. How can a man who is 'serviced' regularly not have any concept of how masturbation feels? It's not shocking, it's just inept. No, it's puerile. Every scene is over-egged, every message (is it really trying to educate us?) and every apparent joke is sledgehammered home. The film as a whole, and the characters and jokes within it, are as subtle as a fart at a wedding & far less amusing. Instead of the sharp satire one has come to expect, we've been served a cheap, amateurish, witless pantomime. It isn't offensive, it's not challenging and it's certainly not funny. Mr Cohen, if you're reading this, please bring back Borat ad Brüno and please, please don't balls up Freddie! Another film review from The Squiss.
5.0~Crude and terrible, yet funny jackasstrange Sign in Permalink This film is so crude and ridiculous than it's impossible to not laugh at it. I would add childish to the description as well. Sasha Baron didn't in 'The Dictator' a horrible mess like he did in the unfunny and forced 'Brüno'. That time he really delivers a few Laugh out Load moments and not only terrible crude jokes,as his aforementioned previous film. Some may find it offensive, and rightfully so. But those who aren't in the offended group will just enjoy this over the top comedy. The soundtrack based of north African versions of famous American hits is quite hilarious. I guess it's because is really weird. But what i found really funny about this film is the way it criticizes everything. Nothing really escapes from being mocked here. And yeah, far from being the funniest and even more far from being the smartest one. But is somewhat enjoyable during it's run time. Good 'pass time' flick. 5.5/10
10.0~this IS a satirical slapstick... until you hear the last speech when you realize this ain't bullshit. sacha is intelligent. hello-653-631586 Sign in Permalink This is a comedy for people who have been sick hearing the word "racist" and "greed" lately. I don't enjoy Borat, or Bruno - but this one is a total blast-off. All puns are spot-on, blunt, absurd, yes some are visually annoying when it involves hairy personal parts, but I just laughed and got over it. Because those are just small insignificant humor. It's not important. You know what's important? The last speech, in the end of the movie - where he ripped the constitution letter. Listen to that speech. He was pointing on how a dictatorship (in his stupid fictional country) should be like... but we all know what he's saying could also happens around us, even in our own country. Safe comedy. Smart comedy. Sacha is doing a soft political method for a political satire comedy; he exaggerates his jokes in the beginning so we all will think all of this are surreal. No one is offended because his character is downright crazy. But in the end... he's right. -- And for you who thinks Sacha is just a douche trying too hard to be funny, you're not the guy he's talking to. Well I guess humor is the last thing to be suitable for everybody. And from what I heard, Sacha is actually a smart, soft-spoken, intelligent man. Hats off. I guess if you can't fix a racist or a greedy union - you can always laugh at them.
10.0~Very Funny!!! Pumpkin_Man Sign in Permalink This movie was absolutely dirty, offensive, hilarious, racist, and crazy over-the-top moments. It's about the same style as Sacha Baron Cohen's previous movies, but it's done much better. Cohen plays a silly ruthless dictator named Admiral General Aladeen. He is very anti-semitic and plans on creating nuclear weapons. He hates the very idea of democracy. While on his way to the United Nations, he's betrayed and shaven so no one would recognize him. He's taken in by Zoey, a vegan hippie, and gives him a job at her store. Will Aladeen make it to the U.N. to stop democracy from coming to his country, or will Zoey change his heart? I would definitely recommend THE DICTATOR!!!
7.0~Unexpectedly Good eshin55 Sign in Permalink I usually avoid movies I know will be explicit and include crude humor because it's just not my cup of tea. So, right off the bat I was expecting this movie to be absolutely horrible... I do not know if it was my low expectations before the screening, but I actually enjoyed this movie very much. In order to enjoy this movie, however, you do have to somewhat detach yourself from thinking too much into the wealth of racist and crude humor contained in the movie. Nevertheless, The Dictator is satire, it is a movie making fun of the real world, and if you let it be, it makes you aware (while laughing) at the racist thoughts and stereotypes ordinary people have everyday. Yes, it has its strange and explicit scenes, but overall, I think it has substance and it was very funny. Put your "Victorian" influences aside for a night and have a good laugh. Watch it.
7.0~Got what I wanted dschlatter Sign in Permalink The movie delivered exactly what the trailer promised. Some people were offended? But wasn't that the whole point? You see I always read the 'loved' and the 'hated' reviews. There was one 'critic' who labeled the movie as 'a piece of crap'... just because he was offended by the dead black guy's head scene. Well yes, it is offensive. But come on, did you not see the trailer? Do you often choose movies randomly without knowing anything about them? well I don't. The protagonist is a ruthless, misogynist, racist, power-hungry dictator. What kind of jokes do you people expect? Even I thought some jokes were too weird/gross (I'm thinking about the birth-scene). But the political statements of the movie? Wow! Sasha B.C. fired jokes in every direction and they hit home! The speech on the benefits of a dictatorship? Priceless! I sure hope the American audience (the Romney voters) sat there thinking 'is he talking about our...? could he mean..? naah! or could he?' TLDR go watch it. It's dirty AND brilliant. Subtle and well, not so much. Enjoy!
1.0~Worst movie of the century? gerd86 Sign in Permalink We watched the entire movie without even grinning once. It is not even remotely funny. The jokes are distasteful and lack every and any humour. It even jokes about the Munich massacre of 1972. That is not funny, that is disrespectful and in poor taste. The acting is awful; it makes you wonder if these people had any training in acting at all. The movie has many distasteful scenes. Also, it portrays stereotypes in a way that is very worrying. Our advice: throw it in the trash. Do not watch this. It is no fun to watch and a complete waste of time and of all that money, which could have been spent so much better. This movie only makes you feel bad about the extremely low standards in movie world.
8.0~TRULY FUNNY....Comedy Gold...B++++ markussaturn Sign in Permalink Just been to see this film and could never stop laughing. Sacha Baron Cohen is a true comedic talent...an excellent writer as the jokes in it are genius. The film is short but packed full of laughter. Perhaps I'm an easy laugher, but what can I say, I liked it!!! A LOT!!! As well as the comedy being brilliant, the actual plot/storyline is superb also. From watching the trailer, and then watching the film, it was actually a completely different story to how I thought it was going to be. I wasn't very excited to see the film after the trailers, but decided to venture in... I enjoyed it much more than I expected and will likely see it again! It isn't for the easily-offended but if this is your sort of humor then you need to go and watch it now!
2.0~Desperately unfunny Rob-O-Cop Sign in Permalink Wow, I wasn't expecting this to be anywhere near as bad as it actually was. I've not seen so many unfunny jokes fall flat in a long long time, normally because you get reasonable warning signs that the film is a stinker, but this film, with this team, well we had good reason to expect much much more. It's hard to tell exactly what went wrong here and why so many good people got on board for something that is just plan off the mark dull. it's not even edgy and offensive, it's just desperately unfunny and for a comedy that's instant death. This really was as bad as any Eddie Murphy movie from the last 15 years, yes, that "uneasy silence after a clanger" bad, but over and over again. I don't think there was a decent performance in the whole movie as star after star committed career suicide in front of our eyes. Ironically Megan Fox was the only half decent cameo. One wonders if this project at any point ever looked good? I can't imagine this material being any better on paper than it was on film, so it bears the question why? or maybe how?
9.0~one of the greatest movie ever! sisayeskinder Sign in Permalink The Dictator The dictator is one of the best and mesmerizing movie i have ever seen. The main reason that i'm writing this review is that i wanted other people to watch it because its one of the greatest movies. Haffaz Alladeen is the bizarre dictator of the oil-rich African nation of Wadiya. Alladeen is as egotistical and ruthless as dictators come, executing anyone who disagrees with him by using his signature "head chop" signal. Alladeen is summoned by the UN to address their concerns about his nuclear program. This movie was mainly placed in Newyork and wadiya. The main reason i liked the movie is that because i loved the actor alladeen. Alladeen in the movie was really funny and entertaining, the things he did wa simply amazing and sometimes breath-taking, even though he is really funny there were times at the movie he took advantage of pepole and harassed them. "The Dictator" is funny, in addition to being obscene, disgusting, scatological, vulgar, crude and so on. Having seen Sacha Baron Cohen promoting it on countless talk shows, I feared the movie would feel like deja vu. But no. He establishes a claim to be the best comic filmmaker now working. And in a speech about dictatorships, he practices merciless political satire. Compared to the gleeful transgressions of "Borat" and "Bruno," this is Cohen's most conventional film. It has a plot, it has a romance, it sticks to the story. Not that it's mainstream, although judging by the laughter of a preview audience, who knows where the stream is anymore? He also wisely gets in, gets his laughs, and quits. The movie, like Bruno," falls short of 90 minutes, in an era where too many comedies run on relentlessly. This is why i really liked the movie. The major lessons that people will learn of this movie is that you always have to be a good person to be happy and successful in life and majorly being honest regardless of who you are, regardless of who's family you came through because all are in one eye of God. This movie is majorly for adults above 18 because it has some bad view of how to make a baby and it contains harsh language that young people must not hear and contains harsh crimes like killing people in a very harsh way. I highly recommend this movie for adults because i want them to see how people love their country and they must not show their love to their country by harassing people and forcing them to death. In my opinion the movies rating or MPAA is R which means the movie is rated and people less than 18 must not watch this movie. When it comes to rating don't call me harsh but i give this movie a 4 out of 5. I know it deserves the outstanding rating but in some of the scenes i have witnessed some shameful acts that must not be included in this movie. His name is Eskinder sisay, he was born in Ethiopia on June 9 1995 from an Ethiopian family. He finished his high school last year and is currently studying his major which is international business in guangwai or GDUFS in guangzhou, china. Eskinder is a very outstanding and very famous in his university, most of the students in guangwai call him 'baby face' and he's mainly known for he's height and mesmerizering football and volleyball qualities.
1.0~Had potential to be very funny chatandy Sign in Permalink This is one of the only 2 movies I have ever walked out of the cinema part way through. The last movie I saw staring Sacha Baron Cohen was "Hugo" which was one of the 5 best movies I have ever seen in my life. I wasn't expecting "The Doctator" to be as good as Hugo, but I was expecting it to at least be reasonable quality and funny. I'm afraid I was sorely disappointed on both counts. There were very few funny moments. The quality of acting, especially from Sacha Baron Cohen (who plays the lead character) is horrendously poor. The main character is pathetically shallow and poorly thought through, and behaves in ways which are inexplicable throughout the movie. The whole plot seems to have been thrown together very quickly and with little thought. It's a shame because I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do much better than this, and the idea of a vicious dictator finding himself having to interact with ordinary Americans has the potential to make a very very funny movie. Unfortunately this potential has gone completely unfulfilled. Having said all this, if you liked "Borat" you might well like "The Dictator".
5.0~The unexpected is missing, but there are still lots of laughs jefflouvre-435-77367 Sign in Permalink IN Borat, Sacha Cohen Baron took the mickey out of America. His character asks a real-life car salesman if he had a car that could kill Jews. The fun is in watching the salesman's expression. Borat also visits some rich people in their southern mansion and after his visit to a toilet, he proffers his feces to the female host in a bag. In Bruno, he quizzes a swinger about his wayward ways. He also interrogates a white man who claims to turn around homosexuals. While Borat and Bruno are fake characters, the interviewees are real and their answers and expressions are priceless. Also, and most importantly, these segments were unscripted and depended on Baron's extemporization. In The Dictator, which is Baron's most conventional movie to date, the laughs are still there in abundance, but the unexpected and mind-provoking humor are sorely missing. Baron, as playboy dictator Aladeen, pokes fun at Western nations' lust for conquering non-white dictatorships and then imposing their views on the vanquished. He contends that the West's push for democracy is to actually further their economic hegemony and quench their desire for oil. Also, Aladeen's soliloquy on democracy's imperfections is priceless. The movie does start off well, as it makes fun of the Aladeen's sexual appetite for movie stars, including Megan Fox, and his distaste for those who get on his bad side or even oppose him. Anna Faris' is a good foil for him as a rights activist and love interest, and Ben Kingsley, far away from his Gandhi days, is his bête noire in the fight for control of their kingdom.

8.0~Hysteria, absolute hysteria amahlanand Sign in Permalink If you haven't heard of the 'Dictator's' arrival to town, you've been living under a rock. After all, he did apparently pour Kim Jong-Il's ashes on Ryan Seacrest's minty fresh tuxedo at the 2012 Oscars. Sacha Baron Cohen's latest addition to his portfolio of memorable characters stunningly has (wait for it) political inspirations as the man himself admitted during an interview with the BBC (the rarity of his appearances as himself in interviews is pure irony I must add). It fascinated me as to the research he's conducted, whilst most of us focus on the atrocities a dictator commits, he finds the comedy out of it, and it's not necessarily black comedy but things that are genuinely amusing about power abuse. Although not explicitly stated, some of this is inspired by true happenings (or rather, real rumours). This man has a very twisted sense of humour but you cannot deny that he is a master of creating total hysteria. He continues to be crass, racist and lewd through his latest creation, General Aladeen. Yet, his ability to not only be an all-round comedian not confined to simple 'gross-out' or idiotic comedy but someone who can cleverly integrate and use his jokes in a timely manner is his greatest strength. Though, credit to the man's guts I have to say, even he could have foreseen the calls for his head that would have arisen following this or any other of his films. I can't say that it is difficult for anyone to be turned off by Baron Cohen's infuriating lack of decency and tact in most of these roles, but it is all about the mindset with which you approach this. He makes it very easy to laugh at but moreover, simple to treat in jest and in a mocking and harmless way, as long as you have the capability to do the same. I felt he explored new territory in the likes of 'Borat', 'Bruno' and 'Ali G' even if it was playing on long-standing stereotypes that have been used so many times before. This did, if anything, feel like a re-hash of stereotypes and jokes to do with America, Arabs, terrorists and the lot (as per 'Borat'). There isn't much that breaks new ground in that sense, although what was refreshing was the way his character took a swipe at both Americans and Arabs simultaneously. And you gotta admit, he has his own original way of making the same old thing still hilarious. Trust me when I say whether or not you wish to, you will remember his gags. I puzzle over why any actor would want to be involved alongside Baron Cohen in his films. As hilarious as they are, bad publicity coming their way is just about as inevitable as death. Supposedly, 'Borat' even caused a permanent fracture in Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock's relationship because of the former's involvement in the film ('Borat'). Supposedly. But being involved in this is something different and you will be recognised for having the gall to do it. And my respect and admiration goes out to both Ben Kingsley and Anna Faris for that. Expect to smack your forehead a number of times in fits of laughter. I saw the trailer and said to myself, 'this is on my bucket list'. I suggest everyone do the same and decide whether they feel similarly before showing up at the box office.
5.0~Funny But Not Particularly Memorable, and a Far Cry From Borat drqshadow-reviews Sign in Permalink Sacha Cohen is probably too recognizable to get away with the unscripted bits that fueled his characters on Da Ali G Show any longer, which is a pity because those provided the fodder for most of his best bits. He gets by okay in The Dictator, his first starring vehicle without any such scenes, but also feels more homogenized and common than ever before. It's an intentionally crass, stupid film that leaves no culture un-mocked and no softball un-smacked. That's not to say it isn't funny, because it is - I averaged a legitimate laugh every five minutes, which is far better than the modern average - but it's missing the sharp-edged points that helped his previous films transcend generic comedy. Borat was as much about cultural disconnect as it was naked men wrestling in a hotel lobby, and Bruno used its explicit shocks to challenge homophobia at large. Despite a hammy attempt to shoulder in a deeper message about modern democracy, The Dictator has nothing even remotely intelligent to say. Take that for what you will; there's still a place in film for plain, dumb laughs, but I was hoping for something more unique considering Cohen's track record.
1.0~Intimidated Much? elixirr Sign in Permalink What is with Sacha portraying stereotypical Muslims in all his major lead roles minus Bruno. I am not bias towards any religion but seems like this Jewish person is really intimidated by Muslims. Look at Ali G, Borat and now Aladeen. He definitely can make outrageous comedies but he needs to come up with fresh ideas and stop beating the dead horse. Also I am not sure if he is confident with his sexuality, dudes are always making out in his movies and rubbing on each other naked. This is getting really old and stale. Sure, there were some good jokes in the movie but again they were on stereotypical Muslims expense. I didn't find anything original in this movie.
10.0~People who are easily offended, watch out: Sacha Baron Cohen is back again GTeixeira Sign in Permalink Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Will Ferrell... See any similarities? They are some of today's most popular 'recent' comedians, and incredibly overrated as such. Their comedic antics, which try to be crude but seen afraid of going too far at the same time, are complete failures once you watch a single of their films: everything else they do will follow the same formula. They seem to fear the backlash a change for the stronger would create. Luckily, we still have good comedies like this. Sacha Baron Cohen, who did the sensational 'Borat', 'Bruno' and Ali G, is one of the few who can still be completely original and unexpected, and actually have the courage to go past the 'acceptable'. This time around, he created yet another great character: Admiral-General Aladeen, the titular dictator from middle-eastern Wadiya. The many misadventures he faces once in New York, after being replaced by a look-alike in a plot to overthrow him (and install a democracy in the country he loves to oppress), are exactly what today's comedians should try to do. Though not done in the same real way as 'Borat'/'Bruno' (ie.: 'The Dictator' is acted), the intense political incorrectness Cohen is known for is ever-present here. There is plenty of racial/stereotype jokes, which might upset quite a few people (but then, such people should know by now to stay away from Cohen's work). Also political comedy, as well: there are plenty of jokes about his dictatorship and dictators' usual crimes, as well as the USA's similarity to it (explicited in Aladeen's speech near the end). There is also attacks on the liberal activist side, done through Aladeen's relationship to a feminist tomboy (played very well by Anna Faris) and how similar she is to him in some ways. Besides Sacha Baron Cohen's natural brilliance, he is also well supported by Anna Faris (one of the best comediennes nowadays), Ben Kingsley (who adds little to the comedy aspect, but much to the acting one) and Sayed Badreya (whom I never heard of before, but was great). This type of crude humor is how comedies should be done nowadays. Not holding back in fear of the backlash a non-political correct film would create (and it does, Sacha Baron Cohen's multiple lawsuits and bannings are a proof of it), but actually giving his utmost best always. People who are easily offended should learn to avoid this, though it is their loss only. 'The Dictator' is the best comedy in a long while, and a sure recommendation.
7.0~Cohen is as offensive as always. Donatien3 Sign in Permalink If nothing else, you can't accuse Sacha Baron Cohen of mincing words. While 'The Dictator' may be his most "mainstream" movie yet, from the very first scene (which is dedicated to Kim Jong-Il) to the final post-credits sequence, it manages to be just as offensive as his previous characters Ali G, Borat and Bruno. The storyline is fairly simple: Cohen plays General Aladeen, the supreme dictator of fictional country Wadiya. He has such complete rule – and is so deluded – that he changes 300 words of the Wadiyan language to "Aladeen" (which becomes a running joke), holds his own Olympics (and wins 14 gold medals) and pays to sleep with numerous celebrities (including Megan Fox), orders an execution whenever he doesn't get his way and thinks oppression is the best thing for his "beloved" Wadiya. When called to address the UN, he is captured and made anonymous after he loses his beard and is replaced by his body double (Cohen), who is even dumber than the man himself, and is tricked by his aide Tamir (Ben Kingsley) into turning Wadiya into a democracy so its vast amounts of oil can be sold. After a chance encounter with feminist Zoe (Anna Faris), who runs an environmentally-friendly grocer, Aladeen sees his pathway back into power with the help of Zoe and former weapons-maker Nadal. The best thing about 'The Dictator' is its pure offensiveness. The highlight is towards the end, when the real Aladeen addresses the UN (and America) on the benefits of a dictatorship, which satirises the many mistakes the USA have made as a democracy. While there is a romantic sub-plot between Aladeen and Zoe, it doesn't detract from the satire, though its – this time around – isn't quite as shocking as 'Bruno', whose materialism and obsession with instant fame made him quite unlikeable. Aladeen is mocked for his stupidity and his deluded ego. Despite his threats of violence, he's actually quite harmless and – deep down – is a lonely man wanting to be loved. Cohen, as usual, inhabits his character wholly. While his various foreign accents tend to all blend into one after a while, he gives off an imposing – yet still deluded - vibe necessary for a dictator. There's also a reasonable supporting cast, including Farris, Kingsley, John C. Reilly and cameos from Fox and Edward Norton. If you're a fan of Cohen's offensive humour, and his ability to inhabit his characters, then 'The Diplomat' is well worth a look.
2.0~Not SBC's best work! TheMightyHodgeheg Sign in Permalink Firstly I love Sacha Baron Cohen. I think he is an incredibly brave and important comic actor and a much needed anecdote to the crazy world that we live in. He plays his characters to perfection and his dedication to staying in character, especially to promote this movie and his general chameleon like abilities are impressive to say the least. However this was not his finest work! The plot was lazy and ridiculous. Satire works best when it is vaguely realistic or identifiable as real life but this was like a bad parody of something already terrible. Yes his characters are always cringe worthy, he always pushes boundaries but this was entirely too much. It was unbearable. We switched it off after an hour or so as we just couldn't stand to waste any more of our lives on it. Some satire makes you think, points out the obvious and makes you actually question society or life in general. This just did nothing to stimulate me nor did it make me laugh, which is its main purpose! I think it was over done, excessive and although that might have been the point given the extravagant nature of The Dictator, that just made its credibility get lost in what came across as vacant padding. Perhaps the hype just led to overblown expectations? I have given this an extra star as I didn't make it through to the end and maybe there was a hidden gem that would have been 1 star worthy! But I am guessing that is unlikely. The other star is for SBC because he went to all that trouble in becoming that awful character and he sure likes to throw himself into his role! (perhaps a bit too far this time!)
2.0~Too disgusting. jesi_flora Sign in Permalink I saw this movie yesterday at the cinema. I usually do some research before I watch something but a friend called me and said that he was bored and we decided to go to the cinema and see this movie. I had seen the trailer a few months ago and it looked like it was gonna be fun. I had also heard that it's really good and it stayed and cinemas for a long time, since May I think. So I expected to have a lot of fun. At the beginning, it was fine. But then it got just to disgusting and sexist. I don't mind some dirty humor as long as it's not too disgusting to be funny but in this movie they just went too far. Trough most of the jokes I was like "WTF?! Gross!" rather than laughing. I was expecting it to get better in the end but it didn't. I expected to see some change in the main character too. I know that dictators are meant to be mean and all that but still. When you could actually think that he was trying to change and be a better person a moment later he was again going back to being an idiot and a jerk. I know, it's a parody of dictators and parodies can be sometimes sarcastic and dirty but this was just gross and disgusting. I can't believe how so many people like it. I don't think that anyone else than a middle aged bored man or some teenage boy who's trying to act "cool" would like it. To sum up, I went to this movie to have some fun but it was rather disgusting. At the jokes, I wasn't laughing. I was just thinking "Eww." most of the time. It's not a movie that I'd see again.
8.0~One of the Funniest and Most Intelligent Criticisms I Have Ever Seen in Many Years claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink When the UN threatens the nuclear program of the Republic of Wadiya, the dictator Hafez Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) decides to go to New York to make a speech in the assembly. However, his minister Tamir (Ben Kingsley) is plotting a scheme to topple Aladeen and sign multimillionaire contracts with foreign oil companies to make him a tycoon. Tamir hires the torturer Clayton (John C. Reilly) to kill Aladeen, but he fails and the dictator flees without his long beard. Aladeen unsuccessfully tries to reach the Lancaster Hotel and he meets the owner of the store of natural products Zoey (Anna Faris), who is protesting against the presence of Aladeen in UN. She believes that he is Allison Burgers, a refugee from Wadiya and brings Aladeen to her store to help him to cater the hotel. He stays with her while he tries to find a means to break in the hotel with his comrade Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas). The politically incorrect "The Dictator" is one of the funniest and most intelligent criticisms I have ever seen in many years. Sacha Baron Cohen is hilarious in the role of a dictator and only his speech in the United Nation explaining what a dictatorship is to people used to "democracy" makes the movie worth. But there are several other jokes that made me laugh most of the time. Further the cameos are also a great attraction, especially Megan Fox in the role of herself. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Ditador" ("The Dictator")
7.0~The Most Aladeen Movie of the Year brando647 Sign in Permalink If you've ever watched one of Sacha Baron Cohen's movies, you're probably already aware that his films don't generally sit well with general audiences. His movies have a twisted sense of humor and a tendency to push some buttons when touching on delicate subjects: racism and xenophobia in BORAT, homophobia in BRÜNO. There's a reason Cohen's movies never reach blockbuster status; they're not for everyone. The average Cohen movie has a loose plot establish to carry the film from start to finish, but consists of a series of skits or gags where Cohen brings his character into situations (mockumentary style) where he can bring out the worst in people while (sort of) making a point about prejudices or whatnot. Or sometimes just to mess with them. In this sense, THE DICTATOR is Cohen's most mainstream movie so far. He maintains his off-color sense of humor but the movie is more accessible to your average movie viewer. He's dropped the mockumentary style of his past two films and gone with a traditional narrative structure. No more shaky hand-held camera either. No more hidden camera or real-world participants caught in the middle. THE DICTATOR is a return to normal movie structure with actual plot and character development. It is the tale of Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen) of the African nation Wadiya. The latest in a long tradition of Wadiyan dictators, Aladeen is on the verge of developing nuclear weapons technology and the United Nation has taken notice. He travels to New York City to confront the U.N. when he is captured and replaced by a duplicate in a plot hatched by his closest adviser to control the fate of Wadiya. Alone in a strange place and surrounded by people who would see him hang, Aladeen must regain control and ensure his beloved nation remains a dictatorship. I'm a fan of Cohen's movies. I loved BORAT and, even though BRÜNO wasn't as strong, I still really enjoyed it. At first I was bothered by Cohen's shift to traditional filmmaking for THE DICTATOR, but then I remembered watching BRÜNO in theaters and wondering if his mockumentary shtick was getting old already. Fun as the movies are, there's only so much you can do with them. Cohen and his co-writers kept the satire elements that made his other movies so funny and shifted gears and, for the bulk of the movie, it works well. THE DICTATOR is a funny film with some really hilarious moments. Cohen's latest character, Admiral General Aladeen, is his best since Borateven if his character's legendary beard was distractingly fake. I love that Cohen will market his movies while remaining in character, and it's made even better when first-rate icons of the news scene go along with the joke. There's a great scene in the movie where Aladeen is doing an exclusive interview with Larry King; I love that King goes along with the gag. This movie continues to show that Cohen is one of the funniest comedians we've got in modern movies, even if his particular brand doesn't sit well with everyone. It blows my mind that he got Ben Kingsley to co-star in the movie as his trusted adviser Tamir. Kingsley strikes me as a higher class of actor, so it's that much funnier when he tries to coax his Aladeen double in getting freaky with some gorgeous virgin bodyguards. John C. Reilly adds some laughs with a short bit as Aladeen's protection once he arrives in New York. I only wish he'd been a bigger role in the movie. My only real complaint with the movie is the love interest, Anna Faris. Faris does her usual bit here (while somehow becoming less hot as a liberal green grocer) as Aladeen's love interest and the plot device used to give Aladeen access to the hotel where he can confront Tamir and his imposter. The whole subplot exists to give Aladeen a chance to wonder if, maybe, democracy isn't so bad, but it slows down the movie in the middle. Whenever Cohen and Faris were together, I would get bored and wonder when we'd get to see Aladeen and his former nuclear expert Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) go off on their next harebrained scheme. Even as the movie slows down in the center, it all comes together for a great finale in the U.N. when Aladeen tries to convince the world that, hey, dictatorships have their perks. The movie has it's share of misfires but the jokes hit more often than they miss, and Cohen gets a chance to tease the American government a bit. It's all in fun and turns out to be a pretty good time.
6.0~Starts very hilariously but quickly drifts into unclarity after Seraphion Sign in Permalink The jokes in this movie's opening parts are very much hilarious. Although their very subjects may be perceived as offensive as most people, still they crack out great laughs. I really like how the movie really uses great imagination in depicting the crazily stupid things the dictator may do. Couple that with the sensitive issues of race, terrorism suspicion, and phobia to Arabs, the movie makes it a fun way to approach such sensitive matters. But then all those good stuff strays away some time near the ending. The movie tries to follow the pattern of mainstream comedies by bringing in the romantic relationship. I think that having the character Zoe is nice to add balance to the story. But forcing in to be predictable by following to have a romantic relationship brings the predictability up. The acting is just a standard overall, but the jokes are really enjoyable that they cover up the lack of acting quality.
7.0~Sacha Baron Cohen's many personalities SnoopyStyle Sign in Permalink Haffaz Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) is the tyrannical ruler of the Republic of Wadiya. His uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) schemes to take over. Aladeen escapes and loses his identity. He has trouble fitting in as a nobody in New York and hippie store owner Zoey (Anna Faris) gives him a job. Sacha Baron Cohen is at it again with another character. There's definitely a lot of Colonel Ghaddafi in this personality. I LOVE Borat. It is one of the most brilliant comedy in recent memory. On the other hand, I HATE Brüno and Ali G is watchable only in short bursts. Why? It's hard to explain but funny is sometimes very personal. I like The Dictator.
1.0~the dictator..what a load of garbage kevibhoy67 Sign in Permalink watched a pretty good cam copy of it..when the so called funny bits happened normally with a cam copy you can hear the audience laughing out loud but i heard 1 single person(a woman giggling)..i didn't find it the 1 but funny..so much stuff I've heard before..the usual gag at the muslims is wearing a bit thin..i wouldn't advise anyone to see it..maybe if you've been in a closet for the past few years and haven't heard the gags about Muslims and dictators then this is the movie for you but if like me you've heard it all before don't waste you're money on it..i didn't.i watched a cam copy of it and if it was any good id have watched it in the theatre but nope..first few mins were OK but heard seen it all before with cohen..sorry thumbs down.
10.0~Hilarious, probably going to be addictive! connort01 Sign in Permalink Don't know where to start. Just been to see this film and could never stop laughing. When I thought it couldn't get any funnier, it did! Sacha Baron Cohen is clearly an excellent writer as the jokes in it are genius. I love the humour of it! Although it is a short film, the jokes that it includes seem to pay off. As well as the comedy being brilliant, the actual plot/storyline is superb also. From watching the trailer, and then watching the film, it was actually a completely different story to how I thought it was going to be. The plot made the film funnier. I would recommend that you all watch it as I would certainly watch it again, a lot more as this film is a work of art. It isn't for the easily-offended but if this is your sort of humour then you need to go and watch it now!
5.0~Unequal balance of tasteless to humorous jayyeveli Sign in Permalink As a fan of Borat and Ali G, I was excited by the launch of the film, and was evermore excited anticipating the next 1 and a half hours of another beautifully humorous Sacha Baron Cohen classic. For The Dictator is a film among many riddled with tasteless or sometimes in a excessively grotesque and childish demeanour, (not that the film is mature, but consists of comedy that has not yet outgrown the playground, distinguishing from previous Sacha films). Overall it surpasses the classic and highly amusive humour Sacha Baron Cohen has previously achieved originally, which has therefore ended the film in an utter disappointment.
8.0~Even an Oppressor Needs Someone to Cuddle Chris_Pandolfi Sign in Permalink When I saw the first ads for "The Dictator," I knew that there would be absolutely no middle ground, that it would be either a work of genius or one of the most offensive movies ever made. I now know what side of the divide I stand on. Where you stand, well, that will depend not only on your sense of humor but also on how you personally interpret the state of the world we live in. To say that this movie isn't for everyone would be a massive understatement. But even then, there's no denying its ability to grab your attention and keep it for every one of its eighty-three minutes. In their third collaboration together, co-writer/star Sacha Baron Cohen and director Larry Charles have crafted a searing political and social satire that's simultaneously hilarious and shockingly audacious. To give you an idea of what I mean, consider the fact that the film is dedicated to the memory of Kim Jong-il. There's an unbelievably fine line between parody and cruelty, and somehow, Cohen and Charles have consistently found the right balance. They get away with it, I believe, because there's a method to their madness; rather than just push people's buttons for the sake of eliciting a visceral reaction, they're actually trying to send a timely message. Beneath the jaw-droppingly crude verbal and physical gags, "The Dictator" is a rather intelligent examination of political corruption and the failings of fundamentalist human behavior. The single best scene in the entire film is when Cohen delivers a speech outlining the ways in which America would be better if it were a dictatorship rather than a democracy. The list he rattles off is funny not because it's ridiculous, but because it's sadly true. If you ever needed proof that comedy stems from tragedy, look no further than this film. It tells the story of Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen), the ruler of the fictional North African country of Wadiya. Tyrannical, self absorbed, racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and fiercely opposed to Westernized culture, his ultimate goal is to develop the world's greatest nuclear weapons and turn his country into a feared superpower. He travels to New York with the intention of addressing the United Nations, as their Security Council has threatened to intervene militarily. Travelling with him are his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) and an easily manipulated body double (also played by Cohen), who's essentially mentally challenged. Careful observers will have already noticed the use of satire, as this scenario is not too far removed from the true story of Uday Hussein and Latif Yahia, the man who was forced into becoming Hussein's body double. Jealous that he wasn't given the throne despite being next in line, the treacherous Tamir plots to have the slow-witted decoy speak on Aladeen's behalf at the United Nations. The plan is to have him sign a new constitution for Wadiya, one that will transform it into a democracy. Once this happens, Tamir will be free open his country's abundant oil reserves to greedy international corporations. He gets Aladeen out of the way by having him kidnapped by an undercover security guard (John C. Reilly), who tortures Aladeen simply by shaving off his beard. Aladeen is able to escape, although he's now lost in the urban jungle of New York City. When he's not recognized and ultimately accosted at a U.N. protest rally, he's rescued by a young woman who mistakes him for an ordinary man opposed to Aladeen's regime. This would be Zoey (Anna Faris), a radical left-wing feminist who owns and operates an organic market staffed by political refugees. Adopting the alias Alison Burgers, Aladeen and Zoey inexplicably begin the process of falling in love. As this is being established, Aladeen reunites with his former ally, Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas), who was his personal nuclear scientist back in Wadiya before being sentenced to death for insubordination. As it turns out, none of the people on Aladeen's execution list were actually executed; they were simply shipped off to New York, where settled into a section called Little Wadiya and opened an anti-Aladeen restaurant. The two conspire to get Aladeen back into the United Nations and stop the democratization process from happening. There are moments in this film that will have you shaking your head in stunned disbelief, including a Wii game in which infidels are beheaded, several scenes featuring the severed head of a revered civil rights leader, and a sudden birthing scene that, to put it mildly, pushes the envelope. In the midst of such outrageousness, isn't it strange that the only thing about "The Dictator" that wasn't especially successful was the love story between Aladeen and Zoey? There are aspects of Aladeen's personal life that are indeed funny, such as a wall covered with Polaroids of his sexual liaisons with various celebrities. But somehow, Aladeen's secret desire to cuddle someone and finding a kindred spirit in Zoey came off as surprisingly conventional. This movie is at its best when it stays firmly within the realm of political satire. And just wait until you hear all the English-language pop songs redubbed with Middle Eastern lyrics. -- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)
7.0~Funny but no as good as his previous movies jack-c-920-863668 Sign in Permalink Dictator is a funny movie and i found myself at some points laughing out loud. But i did not find this movie any where near as good as Ali G or Borat. The main reason for this was because there was no scenes where he did things with people who were not expecting to be filmed. The whole movie was completely scripted, but this did have a much more meaningful story line than any other movie he has done. Also this movie is funny because it is probably more rude and offensive than any other movie done by Cohen. I liked the celebrity appearances such as Megan Fox and Edward Norton playing themselves. Another reason i think this movie lacks is because at some parts it is really funny but then for 15 minutes the movie goes boring. Because of this it makes the movie feel dragged out. Overall i think this is a funny movie which could of been better.
6.0~Dictator? Check. Great? Don't Be Funny writers_reign Sign in Permalink I've now seen all three movies featuring Sacha Baron Cohen and in each case they have smacked of the early Woody Allen films which consisted of funny moments linked by static, wooden hiatus. Of course Allen eventually graduated to much better material in which one-liners were no longer everything and recognizable plotting began to emerge. From the first I have felt - and certainly hoped - that Borat-Bruno would do the same and give us some titles to stand beside the best of Woody Allen but this third title does nothing to suggest that maturity is on the horizon. This is not to say that the film lacks humor, far from it, there are several laugh-out-loud moments and even if there were not films like this should still be made and screened if only to say to the uptight PC Brigade that normal, sane people are on to them and will not take their dictatorship (sorry about that) lying down.
4.0~Sacha Baron Cohen's The Dictator is an uneven comedy that had some good laughs tavm Sign in Permalink This is one of those movie comedies that has an "anything goes" attitude about whatever happens concerning characterization or plot. In summary, don't expect anything to make sense. And also don't expect everything that is depicted to be funny. That certainly was the reaction I had when watching this latest Sacha Baron Cohen film in which he plays a dictator from a fictional country mistaken for a protester in New York City. I'll stop there and just say while there are lots of stuff that wasn't funny to me, there were quite a few times when I did find myself laughing in spite of the stupidity of it all. So on that note, The Dictator is at the least worth a look.
3.0~Sacha Baron Cohen goes the Adam Sandler route...comedy is scripted like a sketch TV show and edited like a trailer moonspinner55 Sign in Permalink Wadiya, a country in the Middle East equipped with its own midget missile, is ruled over by an egomaniacal fascist/misogynist who was born with the same straggly black beard he wears now; after arriving in New York City to speak to the 'snakes' at the United Nations, he is kidnapped by his top aide who wants to replace the democracy-hating dictator with a ringer. Even on its own terms as a raunchy, one-thrust political send-up, "The Dictator", a fully-scripted effort from co-writer and star Sacha Baron Cohen, fails because the plot (such as it is) and the characters make no sense. Of course it's politically-incorrect and comically 'offensive' (though with a wink to the audience)--that's a given; however, the gags lose steam because the story is so haphazardly constructed. The production values are solid, but any real spark of creativity behind the camera is noticeably absent. There are no sequences, only individual scenes: each one designed to slay viewers with gross-out sight-gags and (literal) potty humor. It may be time for Baron Cohen to cinematically graduate from junior high school. *1/2 from ****
9.0~Smart Humor pieron-926-495118 Sign in Permalink It would stand to reason that a lot of people dislike this humor or just don't get it. But i believe this to be one the best joke films for while with little comments at many dictators and there many (personality quirks). The film had a sense of real world impact you just don't get without a good director who knows good timing. But i also felt the story made the comedy hazy with a love story and a weird ending but the comedy is there and its well written with non of the jokes being forced or out of place. so all in all great film. the love scenes in the film were boring but they did not occur often and maybe could have been removed altogether and a better more funny plot devised but it served to lead the story and was only really present in the 3/4 of the film which as the only real downfall of the film it can be easily overlooked.
8.0~Not bad, but Cohen could've done better. deadinside91 Sign in Permalink Well, after seeing Sacha Baron Cohen's "The Dictator", I have only this to say, for a movie in itself, it's pretty good. For a Sacha Baron Cohen movie, it falls short. I feel as though Cohen's greatest strength is shock value as seen in his two previous films, Brüno and Borat. There isn't much shock humor in this movie. Instead, we get sort of a mix between dark humor, slapstick, and political satire. In this film, Cohen still wants to maintain his signature shock value sense of humor while trying not to offend anyone, which to me, doesn't work. My main complaint about this film is that it has the same stupid fish-out-of-water premise he's been doing for six years already where a foreigner goes to America and learns about their customs. Honestly, when will he drop that shtick already? Okay yes, there are minor differences. In Borat, he played a Kazakh journalist. In Brüno, he played a gay Austrian reporter. In this film, he played a Middle Eastern dictator, but with all the differences aside, they're all the technically the same film. Another problem I have with this movie is the camera work. It doesn't know if it wants to go back it its shaky mockumentary roots or if it wants to be a steady legitimate film. It kind of transitions between both and the result is a confusing mish-mash between amateur filmmaking and steady camera work filmmaking. All in all, "The Dictator" isn't a bad movie by any means nor is it Cohen's weakest film. It just has its share of flaws. Besides, you can't top Borat. Then again, he wasn't trying to. But, what do I know? I'm just a stupid kid.
8.0~Viva la Wadiya StevePulaski Sign in Permalink The Dictator is a different species for comedy-actor Sacha Baron Cohen, as it is an actual film, rather than a mockumentary like his previous works, Borat and Brüno. Instead of relying on pedestrian reactions, Cohen's dictator is created in a world where there is a screenplay, actors, and many, many planned out one-liners sure to stir the pot of controversy. The film has already been banned in two counties, both Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, but I doubt they will be very discouraged. Of course one can't not compare this work of farce with The Marx Brothers' Duck Soup, about the small and corrupt country of Freedonia being ran further into the ground by the incompetence of their newly elected leader, Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx). Both The Dictator and Duck Soup punctuate different eras of film, one were crudeness and foul language was feared, and one where it was embraced and the "fine line" of when something goes too far simply doesn't exist. Not to mention, both do a splendid job of including some sharp satire on our societies then and now. Sacha Baron Cohen, the brilliant satirist that he is and truly one of the most versatile and brave comedians working today, plays Admiral General Hafez Aladeen, the antisemitic, anti-woman, anti-democratic ruler of North African Republic of Wadiya who has served a term lasting over forty years. His mission is a simple one; never allow democracy to enter the land of Wadiya and have his people live under a fierce and unapologetic dictatorship. After being kidnapped by a hit-man (Reilly) and being betrayed by his uncle Tamir (Kingsley), Aladeen is quickly swapped with a decoy who looks exactly like him so the government can force him to declare Wadiya a democratic country so they can quickly open up their oil fields for business and make a boatload of profit. Aladeen manages to escape from the hit-man, but after his beard is wholly shaven off rendering him as unrecognizable. He eventually stumbles into the clutches of green activist Zoey (Farris) and is soon employed at her eco-friendly market as a cashier. Cohen is ecstatic and cheerfully cynical as Aladeen, although this is quite possibly his weakest picture. When The Dictator is funny, it truly is funny, but when it's not, it hits the ground hard with some scenes. Quite possibly the worst scene takes place in the green market, where Aladeen is forced to assist a woman helplessly lying on the floor with the delivery of her baby. The film tries to evoke an emotional bonding between Aladeen and Zoey, but it comes off as ignominiously unnecessary and awkward. Now ostensibly, this seems like an inept racist film, incapable of humor, comedy, or wittiness. What works is the harsh truth of the source material. It seems Cohen wanted to go down the road of being shockingly irreverent and undisciplined, but have his crude and shameless film wrap around and conclude with an eye-opening lecture. His final speech, without a doubt, rings truer now more than ever, and is up there with Joel Murray's frequent monologues in God Bless America for best speeches of the year. I will admit that many viewers will be instantly turned off or disgusted with the subject matter, much like why Brüno underperformed at the box office and Borat has now been viewed as mean-spirited schlock. Each one of Cohen's films has explored a topic that is touchy and instantly brews controversy, from stereotyping, xenophobia, homosexuality, and finally, varying political agendas. I have a feeling his work will go on to be even more cherished as years descend into new ones, and certain topics and disputes will have eventually simmered. Soon they will serve as time capsules for America's touching naivety towards difference. Not only is Cohen to be commended for his work as Aladeen, but director Larry Charles, who also worked on both of Cohen's previous works, Bill Maher's wonderful documentary Religulous, and even several episodes of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm, has made yet another winner and is continuing his streak for great films, one after another. Despite a few marginally dry sequences and some unnecessarily tasteless scenes, The Dictator is, so far, one of the most impressive comedic exercises of the year. Starring: Sacha Baron Cohen, Anna Faris, Ben Kingsley, and John C. Reilly. Directed by: Larry Charles.
10.0~Great! schuepbach-sven Sign in Permalink One of the funniest movies I know! There are so many good jokes based on what's happening in the world. If you read the news on a daily basis and know what's going on in the world you'll like this movie. Some people may not like Cohen but I think he's a genius. It really takes something to show the problems that we have in a funny way. However you should really go and watch that movie, it's worth the money. I personally watched it twice in theater. Now I really don't know what to write anymore without giving away any jokes because the jokes come one after another. I was already laughing out loud after one minute. It's really cool if you watch a movie in theater and everyone in the room is laughing. So my definitive final conclusion is that The Dictator is more than a movie, it's an experience ;)
10.0~Very Aladeen! lasewcanada Sign in Permalink Awesome, funny, and very good @ pointing out some of the realities in today's geopolitical landscape Very equal opportunity @ insulting everyone Also very good @ poking fun @ true dictators (past and current)-it seems they captured the top 5 of them of the past 30 years. Quite provocative yet well put together. Enjoyed it greatly.. and I will likely to watch it few more times. Unlike the Borat, this is a movie with everyone being actors, so effectively series of skits - aka SNL. Quite a few details captured in the movie, so watch and laugh! Few scenes (like in Borat) went over "my line" but all in good fun If you like Borat, you will love it... otherwise, you will hate it! And yes, I like watching documentaries with a ducks... like Nuclear Nadal has pointed out...before his "execution" 8)
6.0~The Dictator Dominates And Desecrates The Screen renee-844-417622 Sign in Permalink I loved the satire of Da Ali G Show - nominated for 6 primetime Emmys. Most exciting were the segs of reportage on UK life from (the then) little known TV reporter, Borat. And it was great to see a character like Bruno stick it up fashion. Now Sacha Baron Cohen gives us The Dictator. At his best, Cohen's approach to his craft reminds me of Peter Sellers - a single absurdist character who by being nutty holds up a mirror to our own nuttiness. This is the most valuable gift an actor can give an audience. It is not to marvel at how great the actor is - but to give us a way to understand our ridiculous selves a little better. At his worst, Cohen reminds me of Adam Sandler when Sandler is at his worst (cos sometimes he's good - eg Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates and Punch Drunk Love prove Sandler can do good work). I enjoyed The Dictator because I enjoy Cohen but I also have to let go of a few gripes. Instead of a terrifically woven satire from start to finish buliding to a mind-shattering realization about how the world works through the eyes of a dictator, Cohen has given us a rom-com with an isolated speech near the end about what his character has learned about democracy. The Dictator has been dumbed down so far, that not even a bikram yoga master could limbo under it. I saw this dumbing down happen when Cohen took Borat from the small screen to the big screen and I understand why an artist does this - to reach a wider, dumber audience. But I don't want art dumbed down. Give people an entertaining way to help them understand a difficult concept - don't give them a lazy way to understand a simple notion. If Cohen had have seized the opportunity for great and timely satire, The Dictator might have had a chance to be ranked alongside the great and timely satire of Charlie Chaplin's film The Great Dictator. ** Curious observation - notice how fashion repeats ad nauseum except for one item - Hitler's moustache. It has never enjoyed a renaissance. I wonder who had it first - Hitler or Chaplin? And was it awkward when they bumped into each other on a red carpet? Does Sacha Baron Cohen need to be more democratic or more of a dictator to keep his satire smart? I give the film 8/10 for what it could and should have been - and a 6/10 for what it turned out to be. I mean - after Borat made more than $100m at the box office, was Anna Faris the best he could do? I'm not one to promote real-life partners co-starring in movies but maybe this was that one time Cohen should have cast his wife Isla Fisher. Oh well. It's worth seeing for some of the severely awkward moments and lines of dialogue that no other comedian on the planet would dare to utter and a few 'oh-no-they-di'-n't' cameos.

10.0~Don't mess with the John tururro tkathao Sign in Permalink Hollywood is a sanitized labor ward and it takes Sacha to rev things up. However, this time I am wondering if he has ever been to the movies himself? Not only a complete rip off of the extremely talented Turturro from "don't mess with the Zohan", it was just boring, not funny and a feeling of when will it end or get funny. Sacha is clever, but maybe with less money, less ego and maybe he should go to the movies sometimes, I thought this was Turturro, funny how no reviews mention this? Being Jewish is not a license for poo jokes. This film could have good, maybe with a script? Better jokes, less poo jokes. 65 mill on what? The people who actually enjoy this movie are the same people the film is making fun of. Missing this mark is an understatement.
6.0~Sacha Baron Cohen is too good for this... enicholson Sign in Permalink This movie is pretty funny at times, but it's a bit just too conventional for Cohen and it's not very well directed. The jokes should be funnier, the comic timing is off (early in the film especially), and the grossness veers into Adam Sandler land. Actually, that's a bit of an insult to Adam Sandler since You Don't Mess With the Zohan is not only funnier than this film, but as a satire Zohan is maybe more mature and politically pointed. Sacha Baron Cohen is a brilliant guy, but this film is rather middling and comes off as kind of rushed. The jokes sometimes work, but sometimes they seem like they were probably funnier on paper. Other things are just kind of head-scratching (like the perverted ambassador from China; now a perverted IMF boss from France would have been funny). Worth seeing but maybe save your money and get it on Netflix. Speaking of Netflix, better movies along the same lines are Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator and Woody Allen's Bananas. Those are really funny and very unique films about "dictators". The Dictator has its moments, but I guess I expected more from SBC.
4.0~This Dictator Doesn't Rule cultfilmfreaksdotcom Sign in Permalink What happens when an undercover agent's identity is revealed? They have to move on, as did Sacha Baron Cohen No longer able to slip beneath the radar as a BORAT or BRUNO, where oblivious non-actors react to his crude statements, we're left with an actual movie. Like Christopher Guest's FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION the first non-mockumentary attempt after helping define the genre this treads very shallow waters. Cohen is the dictator of a country called Waadeya and has a lot of fun ruling his people, winning his own Olympics and not taking U.N. resolutions very seriously. The jokes and situations are only as clever as the one-liners allow, which are hit and miss (and mostly shown in the trailers). But alas we can't savor his rule very long till he ventures to America where, after an agent strips him of his signature beard, Aladeen is a nobody in the streets of New York. He finds work with a spunky feminist who owns a health food store. Anna Faris as Zoey provides the kind of rom-com love interest that corners this film into mainstream avenues Cohen and director Larry Charles seem completely lost in. Adding sporadic over-the-top sexual and/or "toilet humor" seems more befitting a Judd Apatow flick and now, instead of laughing at people i.e. victims with Cohen like the good old days, we're held hostage to a story that doesn't even seem spontaneous. Not that THE DICTATOR lacks humor – a few good jokes are present. But they just don't feel natural anymore. For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com
9.0~Get your grandma out the door and be prepared for non-stop laughter soldier9428 Sign in Permalink The Dictator has sweet crude humor and social satire galore. I literally couldn't stop laughing throughout this film it was so funny. All the self- juicing jokes were probably the best. I loved watching everyone's reactions to the protagonists crude jokes and blatant sexual references. The Dictator also points to a lot of flaws in both American society and Muslim society. The end speech is a good example of how both societies are criticized. I can't really say more without spoiling the movie but trust me if you like crude humor and political humor you will love this film. If you do not like this kind of humor though you really shouldn't watch this movie because there is a lot of it.
2.0~re-enforcing stereotypes shouldn't be considered funny quzmar-435-612181 Sign in Permalink There is no question that this a very well thought out film which makes the problematic messages and sentiments in the film even more worrying. Other reviewers (most gave high rankings) felt the need to say that you need to detach yourself from reality to be able to enjoy the film, I believe it is wrong to do that, even if it is the only way to enjoy this film. If you have a racist classmate who is funny do you just detach yourself from reality so that you can enjoy his bullying "inferior" (according to racist ideas) classmates? The film contained cheap racist jokes re-enforcing stereotypes about discriminated-against layers of the society in Europe and the US. I can't think of anything that would differentiate this film from literature which used stereotypes about ethnic groups in Europe without any questioning and served a great tool for normalising racism against these ethnic groups. The film also purposefully portrayed anti-racist/anti-war activists in the west as well intentioned but too naive (beyond reason) and not true to their principles. It also tried to tap into the stereotype anti-war activists. The film also included a subtle pro-war sentiments by promoting some of the pro-war propaganda as facts. Everything in the film tells you that is very well thought through (particularly the characters) which means that these messages and sentiments are intentional. I would have given this movie a 1 if it wasn't for its critique of western democracy!
5.0~Not my taste Treyroo Sign in Permalink In your home country, you are all-powerful, worshipped, albeit forcibly, and seen as God come to Earth. Then, you are abandoned in a country where you're despised by the public as a whole and must make a living. What do you do? Admiral General Hafez Aladeen (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) has been master of all he surveys in the North African Republic of Wadiya for decades. He's immature, anti-Semitic, has such poor judgment, and so little control over his libido that his bodyguards are all female and chosen primarily for their looks. In addition, he spends a fortune of his country's money for the pleasure of Megan Fox's company in the bedroom. Still, all is not perfect in the world of our conceited ruler. He must face the combined challenges of building his struggling nuclear program and keeping U.N. inspectors from discovering it. All while his right hand and uncle, Tamir (played by Ben Kingsley) grows frustrated with working for such a buffoon. Believing that he rightly belongs in the seat of power, Tamir (Kingsley) hires an American mercenary named Clayton (played by John C. Reilly) to kidnap Aladeen so that he can be replaced a look-alike they employ to foil assassination attempts. The look-alike, (also played by Cohen) is a simpleton and will be much easier to manipulate than the real Aladeen who managed to escape his captors, but not before they'd stripped him of his decorated military uniform and cut off his trademark beard. After meeting him outside the U.N., Zoey, an activist and operator of an alternative lifestyle food co-op (played by Anna Faris) offers Aladeen a job, believing he was a refugee from the oppressive regime rather than the covertly ousted oppressor himself. Now, having not seen Borat or Bruno, perhaps I was unprepared for Cohen's brand of comedy. The director, Larry Charles, was also behind the camera for Cohen's previous efforts but I'm only familiar with his work as an alumnus of the Seinfeld writing staff and as the director of the Bill Maher documentary Religulous. I am a fan of both but comparing The Dictator to Seinfeld is like comparing apples to well, Seinfeld. And the obvious references to eccentricities exhibited by Saddam Hussein and former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi were funny, but the protagonist himself neither funny nor sympathetic. To me, he was rarely, if ever, interesting. Others might enjoy this film, I didn't.
5.0~Well, at least it's an improvement wandereramor Sign in Permalink I'll be upfront here: I've never been a fan of Sacha Baron-Cohen's works, which largely feature brazen ethnic stereotypes and then castigate those who react to those stereotypes as racist. The Dictator largely follows along in this tradition, with Cohen's Aladeen embodying every stereotype of the crazy Arab dictator, a stereotype which has usually been perpetuated to justify the US's own imperialism and castigate anyone who stands up to them. But at least this time there isn't much of a pretense at social commentary: The Dictator is a farce, plain and simple. The other shift from Baron-Cohen's past films is that instead of faux-documentary provocateurism, this is a conventional narrative film, and is all the better for it. For one, it actually has jokes instead of just awkwardness. Sure, most of the jokes are crude and/or obvious, but they're jokes nonetheless. And there are some funny moments on there, such as a riff on Aladeen changing the words for "positive" and "negative" to "Aladeen", or a running gag about made-up names that seems to be a long mockery of The Usual Suspects. The film is also careful not to overstay its welcome, clocking in at a slim 75 minutes, and makes good use of the always enjoyable Anna Ferris. It's actually a relatively enjoyable experience, assuming you're not annoyed by the standard beats and tastes of mainstream American comedy. Still, that doesn't make it good. For one thing, even at its short length, a lot of scenes are obvious filler, such as a movie-standard one where Aladeen has to deliver a baby. The characters are also never really much more than stereotypes. From a competent filmmaker, this would be a disappointment. But from Baron-Cohen, this is a step in the right direction.
10.0~One of the Best Scastic Movies runondonutsideeli9 Sign in Permalink I love this movie. Let's begin with that. I love it so much that after I shockingly found out the "relatively low" score in here I have to come in and see the reason some people don't like it. Most of them accused jokes in this movie of being too cruel, racist, uncomfortable. Then I realized that not everyone of us has the privilege to live in a "perfectly harmonious" world. Well. I'm a woman who grew up in a country that has a similar political structure of dictatorship, and no I am not offended by the "bad jokes" in this movie because they are true and because they are actually way less cruel than true stories I have heard/seen. If you somehow can't get over your "conscience" and feel bad when you laugh at those jokes, I sincerely hope that the speech of Aladeen towards the end of the movie has put you mind at ease. Hypocrisy. One of the biggest theme in this movie and exaerrated with many "bad jokes" in hopes that the movie would help to make a difference. If you think you are living in democracy , then how come all those conditions Aladeen mentioned sounds so familiar? You know joking about "throwing new born girls into trash can" is sexism and inappropriate, but do you know there are plenty places got used to this idea and have seen plenty of real-life cases? While you take the scenes/lines depicting low woman status as "offensive, bad taste, and Hollywood-like", the real life stories are probably happening right now in your office and you didn't even think about it. Still feeling bad for laughing, or about how "low" the jokes are? well don't be. You just haven't seen it all yet, and I bet you that Larry Charles, the director of this brilliant film, hated hypocrisy more than any one of us.
9.0~Breath Edvis-1997 Sign in Permalink I can't. I saw this movie like 7 or 8 times already and every time I found it really funny. The main character did great job. Those jokes about women are hilarious. I just love this film.
2.0~The Dictator: Nothing More...Nothing Less TroyeEvans Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen appears as the dictator Aladeen of his own dictated country, and as usual, it is a film similar to Borat, a successful comedy full of sidesplitting moments. It is the usual style of this writer-actor, translating the "wrong" ideas into constant laughter. Unfortunately it is a film that offers no clear message and seemingly over the journey of the entire film there is not much learned; the Dictator is still the same old Dictator, though he claims he understands more. Anyway, it is still a pure comedy that shines with nicely written jokes, funny one-liners, and racism and sexism made laughable. To fully appreciate a film like this, all moral standards must exist, but it is a film that is asking you not temporarily care less about such rules. There is no much in depth to say this film. It is a great comedy because it is funny. It is by no means a good drama not because it lacks the elements in its making, but because it wasn't intended for this to be a drama. So accept the fact that this is all comedy, and enjoy the fun that probably can only last through a one-time, yet worthwhile watch.
6.0~The Dictator jboothmillard Sign in Permalink Ali G Indahouse was the only fictionalised film that Sacha Baron Cohen had made before his big hit mockumentary films Borat and Brüno, this film may have been scripted, but I knew it wasn't going to cut down on dark jokes and near the mark controversial material, from director Larry Charles (Borat, Brüno). Basically Admiral General Haffaz Aladeen (Cohen) has ruled the North African Republic of Wadiya for years with as a childish, lecherous, misogynous, anti-western and antisemitic attitude, refusing the country's oil to be sold internationally, developing nuclear weapons, and surrounding himself with beautiful female virgin bodyguards. Aladeen is to resolve the controversial matters at the UN Headquarters in New York City with the United Nations Security Council, but soon after arriving he is kidnapped by hit-man Clayton (John C. Reilly), hired by Aladeen's treacherous uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley), who is replacing him with mentally-challenged lookalike decoy Efawadh (also Baron Cohen) who has been manipulated to sign the document that will make Wadiya an open country and allow the oil to be distributed. Aladeen has his big beard shaved off making him almost unrecognisable, and he escapes after Clayton accidentally sets himself on fire, and he ends up with activist Zoey (Anna Faris) who runs an alternative lifestyle co-op who offers him a job, but he refuses and seeks help, and in an unlikely place he finds his former nuclear weapons program chief 'Nuclear' Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas), the place is full of people he thought were executed, but have actually been exiled. Nadal only agrees to help Aladeen stop the plot by Tamir and become the dictator again on the condition that he makes him the head of the WMD program again, this is agreed, and Aladeen accepts a job with Zoey because she happens to be catering at the building where the document signing will be taking place, and as time goes by, she teaches him how to masturbate amongst other things, and he slowly falls in love with her. He manages to help out Zoey's struggling business by imposing strict schedules on the co-workers and with his "persuasive ways", including forcing a critic into giving the store a positive review, but eventually when they get closer she is shocked to find out his true identity because she is very much against his regime. After getting the beard that he needs from a corpse, Aladeen decides to infiltrate the UN conference himself, so he manages to get into the building with the help of Nadal, and he convinces Efawadh to swap places with him, and when he gets to the document he tears it up and expresses his praise for dictatorship. He sees Zoey in the room though and he changes his mind about most of his beliefs, and he decides to allow Wadiya to be an open country, but the oil business will mostly benefit for the country, and he declares his love for Zoey, and Tamir is arrested after attempting to assassinate him, Efawadh is the one who takes the bullet. A year later Aladeen rigs the election, because he is also President Prime Minister, and he stays the leader of his country, and he marries Zoey, only to find out afterwards by her crushing a glass that she is Jewish, and later on television she reveals she is pregnant, and he asks "is she having a boy or an abortion". Also starring Edward Norton, Megan Fox, Susan Sykes aka Busty Heart as Etra Head Virgin Guard, Chris Elliott as Mr. Ogden, Kevin Corrigan as Slade and Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Gazprom Executive. Baron Cohen is terrific as the naive and foolish but equally determined dictator who enjoys his leadership and is not afraid to say what he likes, and he has some amusing moments as the thick body double, Faris is a good choice as the woman he falls for with strong views on the political issues, and the supporting cast members are fine as well. The film is filled with the usual slapstick and deadpan jokes you would expect, and with subjects like 9/11, Kim Jong-Il, Osama Bin Laden, sexism and anti-Semitism in the script it is a controversial but at the same time genius story, and if you have the extended cut edition of the film the funniest scene for me was the fight with Busty Heart attacking, crushing and suffocating Baron Cohen with her large breasts, a funny and very watchable comedy. Good!
8.0~I really enjoyed but it was like Borat, Zhoan, and a tad of Bruno mixed. slimbruv Sign in Permalink I have to say I really enjoyed this movie and look forward to any other new Sacha Baren Cohen films in the future. It had many controversial jokes but I just thought they were hilarious, it simply added to my enjoyment. Not many recent movies have made me actually laugh out loud. As I said, it reminded me of "You Don't Mess with the Zohan" but that's okay, another great film. "The Dictator", in my opinion, is Cohen's second best movie. 1.) Borat (It's a classic) 2.) The Dictator 3.) Bruno 4.) Ali G (I didn't find it that funny.) The reason why I wouldn't give it 10 is the fact that it had a few recycled jokes such as the AIDs joke. I highly suggest that you rent/buy it if you haven't seen it yet!
6.0~Crude...with a capital C! MartinHafer Sign in Permalink Abadeen is the dictator of a crappy little North African country and he is modeled after the likes of Kadafi and Kim Jong Il. But, to make such a character more palatable, he is played for laughs--albeit very uneven ones. That's because "The Dictator" is an incredibly uneven film--with lots of funny parts and lots of unfunny and offensive parts. My advice is to DEFINITELY not watch it with your kids, your mother-in-law or Father Jenkins! But, if none of them are around and you have a high tolerance for this crude humor, then by all means watch. But I am warning you--there are lots of rape jokes, some full-frontal nudity and lots and lots of sex jokes. Worth seeing? I dunno--but it did often make me laugh--especially when I watched the Olympics.
4.0~"It's not the good old Borat days" jasonandnick6 Sign in Permalink I have been a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen since his Ali G days, However for me The Dictator was by far his worst performance to date, i went to see the first showing of this movie as soon as it was on at the Cinema and remembering the days of Borat where i almost choked several times on wine gums as i was laughing out loud a lot, as was most of the cinema, So on expecting something similar i decided to avoid sweets, but no, i should of took my Wine Gums, as the Cinema was more than half full and laughter was not a common emotion. The Dictator for me and i would say most the Cinema that day simply failed to deliver little humour what so ever, it was mostly idiotic that just didn't hit home for me, there was a few brief moments where a laughed a little, but even knowing not to take Sacha serious i just couldn't get to grips with The Dicatator and was very disappointed with the movie, i'm just glad it was a Orange Wednesday and that i got into the Movies 2 for 1. 4/10 just wasn't that funny, but i did stay to the end and watched all the movie, but that was mostly hoping that it was going to dramatically improve. Wait for the DVD!
9.0~The (Last) Great Dictator RainDogJr Sign in Permalink THE DICTATOR (one of the films I was desperately waiting this year) opens with a picture of Kim Jong-il (North Korea's "eternal leader") and the legend "in loving memory of" (as you know, he passed away less than a year ago). This certainly lead you to think something like "Sacha, you've done it again, you crazy motherf*****!" It is not his most daring effort though – arguably, nothing dealing with the mock of a dictator can be seen as something shocking ever since Saddam Hussein appeared as a gay and vulgar cartoon in the SOUTH PARK movie (almost 15 years ago). Hell, Trey Parker and Matt Stone gave also the "royal treatment" to Kim Jong-il in their TEAM America and a little-known filmmaker named Charlie did too a brilliant take on a little-known dictator named Adolf back in the early forties. Anyway, Cohen is taking inspiration from Libya's former dictator Gaddafi (Cohen's character, the childish dictator Aladeen, is from a country called Wadiya) and of course from Trey Parker/Matt Stone and Chaplin – if we had in TEAM America a puppet Kim Jong-il singing a song about how lonely he was, here we have, for instance, Aladeen feeling a bit lonely after not being able to convince Megan Fox to spend the night with him. And Cohen is doing a THE GREAT DICTATOR thing: playing two psychical identical characters (you gotta love Aladeen's double). At the time same, THE DICTATOR is pure Cohen. It seemed that this was his sort-of different project, his big-budget picture with nothing "real" and the participation of famous actors like Ben Kingsley, John C. Reilly, the already mentioned Megan Fox and *spoiler alert* Edward Norton. However this is a film with a big trip to America – if you have seen BORAT and BRUNO, you know what I mean. This time Cohen goes for a romantic comedy feel – Aladeen falls for a woman and the thing becomes real, unlike Borat's thing with Pamela Anderson! Picture Cohen's take on romantic comedies yeah, there's pretty f***** up material, as absurd as hilarious. In fact, the film is hilarious in all of its facets, with jokes that are instant classics. Cohen's third collaboration with Larry Charles is the best comedy of the year; and nothing comes close, really. *Watched it on 29 August, 2012
7.0~Cohen brings comedy and offensiveness to the theater rgkarim Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen always makes quite a show when he produces a film. Borat and Bruno clearly showed us that he wasn't afraid to test the boundaries of appropriateness and comfort. So naturally you can guess that I was a little skeptical when he decided to venture into the Arabic world and the jokes to follow. What's my verdict on this movie you may ask? Was it good like Borat or crap like Bruno? Read on to find out. For those of you who have missed the countless trailer commercials, the plot of this movie is about a dictator named Aladeen (Cohen) who enjoy a life of luxury and misuse of power. He is eventually called to the U.S to address the United Nations, but is interrupted when he is abducted. Stripped of his beard, and as a result his power, Aladeen must now adapt to being a common, oppressed citizen, with only a hand full of people willing to help the tyrant. What adventures are to come? As I'm sure you all guessed, it wouldn't be a Cohen movie without stepping over the line at least once and The Dictator is no exception. Throughout the movie Cohen continues to make fun of the Arabic culture that is both insulting and funny at the same time. However, his jokes don't just limit themselves to Middle Eastern stereotypes, they expand into just about every ethnicity in the world. Unlike most comedies however, Cohen doesn't hold back on insulting traditions, values, and color and more than once says some pretty harsh things. Those easily offended by racial dialogs should definitely avoid this movie. You may seem surprised that I actually found most of the dialogue funny, but what I found humorous was the delivery ore than the content. Cohen's accent in this movie made his vocabulary very funny and entertaining, especially the use of his name for various words. Dialog wasn't the only funny thing this movie had to offer. No my friends Cohen also had some funny situational comedy occurring as well. There were various moments where he was lurking the streets, interacting with customers, or hanging out with his fellow countryman Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) that had me in stitches, and other parts that had me wonder what Cohen was thinking. Mantzoukas brought the best out of Cohen's character and set him up for so many jokes that kept the movie entertaining. Like Cohen, he too has mastered the English-Arabic accent and manages to say his lines, many of which I found funnier than Cohen's, with an emotion that makes it very funny. Both of them had a natural chemistry that made it feel real and not over acted, which just made it funnier. Anna Faris on the other hand kind of plays the same character she always plays, and while she plays the part well it really adds nothing special to the movie. The other thing I liked about this movie was the catchy and funny soundtrack that Cohen and company put together. Many of the songs you hear are Arabic versions of popular songs and I had some fun trying to figure out what tracks were being sung. But there are some negatives to this movie that I wanted to warn audience members about before they spend their money on a ticket. For one thing, although there were some funny surprises in the movie, the trailers did ruin a lot of the good jokes. Many of the scenes seen in the trailers are again present in this movie, and were already stale by the time I got to the film. If you didn't catch it before, there is severe racist and sexist humor in this movie. Sure it is supposed to be in good humor, but Cohen really oversteps his boundaries for some of the jokes, making them more offensive than anything else. Another thing I wish to warn you about is there are a few scenes that are very uncomfortable/awkward to watch. I can't really tell you too much, but let's just say that some of the sexual humor makes the American Pie series seem like child's play. The plot is also predictable, but that is to be expected in a comedy series and so I can't really dock it too much. The Dictator is definitely one of the funnier comedies I have seen in a long time, but it still isn't the best comedy of the year. Cohen does a great job making fun of many cultures, but for me he still needs to dial it down to continue to make it fun. Despite a predictable story, and some awkward scenarios though, I had fun watching this movie. However, I recommend you hold out on this movie until Netflix offers it, and only go if you have a group of friends wanting to laugh their heads off. The scores for this movie are as followed: Comedy: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0 Again it's fun, but you can save your money for something else. If you decide to see this film though, make sure to stay for about half of the credits to see a few more funny scenes. So check back tomorrow for not one, but two reviews. Until then, this is Robbie K signing off and telling you to enjoy the movies.
1.0~Awful shood321 Sign in Permalink The Dictator is one of the top-10 worst movies I have ever seen. We left in the middle of this dreadful creation. Bathroom humor is fine but the gratuitous, sophomoric filth was over the top. How Ben Kingsley could have lowered himself to this level is astonishing. One of the best actors of a generation has gone from an Academy Award winning portrayal of one of mankind's greatest characters, Ghandi, to a film that could have been produced by a college fraternity. Borat was great and Bruno was good, but Cohen jumped the shark with The Dictator.
1.0~I had to leave the cinema mailprorebeku Sign in Permalink I love comedies, I love political satire,but this movie was neither comedy nor political satire. It contented of a very primitive and predictable would-be jokes, which made me feel embarrassed. It is absolutely not a bad idea to based the comic on US-Middle East relationships, but the "masturbation" joke had nothing to do with it. However the movie tried to reflect the cultures stereotypes,it didn't work really well in the way of extreme vulgarization. The way of humor there was very rude and simple, unoriginal and jokes resemble each other,therefore the movie started to be boring after several minutes.It was totally time and money wasting experience.
10.0~non stop comedy ..MUST WATCH kumar-sourabh Sign in Permalink This movie is a complete refreshment for any body who understands the Arabic influenced English. It will make you laugh and laugh out loud. Every dialogue of the movie is worth listening and it gives you smile in return . Go for it people it is the best comedy movie and even much more interesting than scary movie series ..... :)Movie starts with humor and end on a very good and emotional note that will make you think . Movie ends up with a critical joke on democracy and its implementation versus the dictatorship .Acting is superb and timing of comedy "comic sense " is quite awesome. The males in the movie dominate the female actresses .... :) ooops there is only one woman in the movie rest are private guards of the dictator .
2.0~Disappointed. Utter Garbage seghers Sign in Permalink Success spoils talent. We see it everywhere. This movie is a prime example. The Ali G Show (HBO) is Cohen at his best. Crazy, edgy, hilarious, and above all, BRAVE. Borat was a tad childish but very good, with some amazing moments. Bruno was uneven, homophobic and a bit cruel - but also with its moments (the scenes with the Mexican "furniture" is not to be missed). Now we have The Dictator. While I commend Cohen for giving a shot at scripted comedy, and fully abandoning the impromptu "reality" comedy he excelled at, sadly it was a complete miss. I did not laugh a single time in this terrible, pointless sell-out of a movie. A couple nervous laughs at the beginning as I hoped it would get better... but it never did. A complete and utter embarrassment, on a part with Hangover II as one of the biggest comedy disappointments of the decade. Awful, awful, awful. And to make things even worse, not a shred of the intelligence or multi-layered humor Cohen is deservingly famous for.
9.0~Black comedy attacked deeper this time anujnagpal-76062 Sign in Permalink The Dictator could easily be mistaken for a gross-out comedy at first, but it's a much cleverer work than what it looks like. Being a black comedy movie, audience may find it uncomfortable and offensive at times but that doesn't mean you should judge it as a movie not worth watching. Every other dialogue is filled with racist and sexist comments and their delivery is done in such a way that instead of offending you, they make you giggle for a second or two. The movie is a political satire which is perfectly grinded with comedy to make it entertaining. Starring Sacha Baron Cohen as Admiral General Aladeen, the dictator of a nation named Wadiya, he may seem like a dedication to Kim Jong-II, the late Norh Korean supreme leader, at some points. Aladeen tries his best that democracy never enters his nation, but his uncle Tahir (Ben Kingsley) who is the heir to the throne, is conspiring for something else. While Aladeen is invited to the UN summit for signing a new era of democracy in Wadiya, a series of interesting incidents made him face a completely different life. Sacha Baron Cohen has tried a way to work out his frustration with everything from governmental policy to the cost of wireless internet in hotels into this movie and his final speech is a slingshot on the democrats expressing what it would be for America to become a dictatorship and that just only to reveal that nothing would be changed. Apart from serving the viewers a complete bowl of humor, it is also a straight jab at the heart of politics across the world and it's done so almost to a point where it becomes more of a sad state of affairs than comedy.
8.0~Not bad. mark12914 Sign in Permalink I was pleasantly surprised, perhaps because I had read some negative reviews. My advice would be, go with your instinct. If you were at least mildly amused by the trailer, and find the entire premise somewhat funny, probably you are not going to be disappointed. I would also disagree with some reviewers that it will appeal only to college students. I am over 50, and went with a person in the late 40's. We both loved it. In general, I am not a fan of pure-shock humor. I don't find Howard Stern to be funny. But although Cohen relies on shock and poor taste often, it is mixed with enough quirkiness and cleverness that it is really kind of refreshing. To me, it is the appropriate use of shock - enough to knock you off balance, but also combined with an actual joke or weird surprise. No Academy Award here, but if you yawn at CGI spectacles and formulaic sequels like MIB, then this might be up your alley.
5.0~Funny at times agmoldham Sign in Permalink Ever since the Phantom Menace I've always been very wary of films which have a great trailer. The trailer for "The Dictator" was very funny, but in common with other comedies you always have a nagging feeling that the best gags may have been included in the trailer. This was the case with "The Dictator", but there are some other funny moments to look forward to as well. As with most of Sacha Baron Cohen's films much of the comedy tests the lines of good taste. The plot is fairly straightforward and follows the attempted overthrow of a dictator. It's a very easy watch and you always know that the parts which drag will soon be followed with something that's funny. It isn't for the faint hearted though, so if you are easily offended you should steer clear of this.
7.0~Political Farce Aspires to Cohen's Borat! HollywoodJunket Sign in Permalink Review by: Daniel Berkowitz There is a recurring joke in "The Dictator" where every time the Admiral General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) gets even the slightest bit annoyed with someone he motions to one of his guards with an off with their heads signal to kill them. It's a funny sight gag when used appropriately, and after finding out all of his victims are alive and well, it serves to ram home the idea that Aladeen is a brutal and incompetent leader of the fictitious North African nation The Republic of Wadiya. Another long-running joke in the film is that General Aladeen not only took over his nation's language, changing words like "positive" and "negative" to "Aladeen" buts is also a star in many Wadiyan films such as "You've Got Mail Bomb", and "Planet of the Rapes". The film opens in a mockumentary style with news footage explaining the "nuclear threat in Wadiya" with the General Aladeen's restriction to allow other countries to view his nuclear arms. We later learn that the 39-year-old "Supreme Leader" is working feverishly to build a massive missile, preferably with a "pointy tip". His plan is soon placed on-hold when he is kidnapped during a visit to New York City. Forced to blend-in with American commoners, Aladeen turns his attention to re-establishing his identity and over-ruling the biggest threat of all to his dictatorship in Wadiya - a democratic government that will allow other countries to profit off of the Wadiyan oil. In "The Dictator" rarely are the jokes executed appropriately. And in a film where the plot is so basic, the comedy is really all we have to hold onto. This marking his fourth character parody film, Cohen has a solid supporting cast in Ben Kingsley who plays his back-stabbing right-hand man Tamir, John C. Reilly whose kidnap attempt goes array, Anna Faris as Aladeen's grocery store boss, and even a comical cameo from comedian Gary Shandling as a Health Inspector. Other hysterical roles came from J.B. Smoove in an unforgettable funeral scene, and "MADtv" comedian Bobby Lee, as a Chinese United Nations Diplomat displaying questionable morals. Given its subject matter, "The Dictator" has the opportunity to provide scathing satire. Sadly, however, something the film never truly takes advantage of. The film never makes good use of Kingsley, even though Faris gives a solid performance. For argument's sake, any competent actor could have taken on Kingsley's role and done as fine a job. Aside from his role as the main facilitator of transforming Wadiya from a dictatorship to a democracy, his on screen time is so limited, and his character so flat that his presence is almost unnoticeable. Enduring to the character of Aladeen is his obsession with pop-cultural and longing to be loved by everyone all the time. When they don't, he beds enough celebrities to fill a wall covered with Polaroids of them. Like any dictator, he has an inflated sense of self. More important, though, the times when Cohen seems ready to inject his script with expert satire fizzle out into nothing more than frivolous "Family Guy"- style conversations and gags bordering on absurdity. Yes, "The Dictator" is a comedy and yes, from the outset it is made clear that the film does not take itself too seriously. But, this should not preclude it from giving us capable satire or even smart comedy. In one scene, Aladeen, down on his luck with no hope in sight, stands on the edge of a bridge, moments away from taking his own life. When his new ally and ex-head of his nuclear weapon department, Nadal comes over to convince him not to jump, the conversation heads into a them discussing the fact that Aladeen is wearing Crocs. It's unfair to say this is inappropriate, but it is fair to say it is pointless. It's an irrelevant, and from a plot standpoint, utterly unnecessary conversation in which the only conceivable purpose is to provide cheap laughs. And that's really what "The Dictator" is: a series of gags and goofs designed, not so subtly, to illicit laughs every ten seconds. Often the film succeeds- when it's funny, it's funny- but more often it does not. As well, it could have been so much more. Where jokes are overused, there could have been restraint. Where dialogue seems forced and contrived, it could have been organic and free flowing. Where opportunities for satire are missed, they could have been better executed or even included. At the end of the film, Aladeen delivers a minute-long speech pointing out the differences between democracies and dictatorships. It's an intelligent argument, but falls flat. It's not in keeping with the tone of the film, and it comes out of a corner so alien that it's almost unwelcome. Cohen's first American film release "Borat" (before that, "Ali G" in the U.K.) was nothing more short of brilliant and given that his second, "Bruno" was disappointing, it's unfortunate that he fails to right the ship this time around even after numerous test screenings in Los Angeles and Paramount Pictures delaying the film's release date originally from May 11 to May 16. "The Dictator", succeeds in providing some solid laughs and gags. HollywoodJunket.com

8.0~Hilarious fun; Would Recommend, EthanBJones_03 Sign in Permalink Plot Overview: After his uncle/adviser arranges for his death and replaces him with a double, Admiral General Aladeen(Sacha Baron Cohen) team up with ex nuclear scientist, Nadal(Jason Mantzoukas) and vegan, feminist Zoey(Anna Faris) to foil the signing that will make his country a democracy! Directed by Larry Charles Starring Sacha Baron Cohen, Anna Farris and Zoey Mantzoukas # NO SPOILERS! Overall: I know many people won't like this movie and if you hate dark/offensive comedy, then I recommend you DO NOT watch this film. If you're fine with jokes about terrorism, and racism or actively find that funny - I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. This movie is Sacha Baron Cohen's most conventional movie, featuring a plot and what not, which is why I imagine his previous fans of movies like 'Borat' won't enjoy this as much. It's still a smart satire which follows in tradition with his previous work but I think it's more focused on humour than a message. The type of people who will like this movie will be fans of the dark humour genre and possibly some of Sacha Baron Cohen's fans who enjoy his previous work. Would Recommend. # POSSIBLE SPOILERS! Sacha Baron Cohen is amazing as Admiral General Aladeen and has a good comedic timing. Jason Mantzoukas was great as Nadal as was Anna Farris as Zoey. Both have good timing and both their characters were interesting enough to share spotlight with Sacha Baron Cohen. Ben Kingsley was pretty weak as Tamir and Tamir was a very weak villain. I also feel like Zoey as a character wasn't needed and not including a love interest may have benefited the movie more. I do understand her purpose in THIS particular story but I think the film could have been better with a story that DIDN'T include her. This film's story is stupid, dumb, idiotic, ridiculous and makes no sense - it's perfect. The ending was also perfect and fit so well it was kinda disturbing. The cinematography was OK. This movie was hysterically funny and I was actually crying from laughter, which is VERY rare for me. Personally, I love this movie and I think it is amazing. 8/10
7.0~Consistently Funny, despite an Unlikeable Protagonist, lesleyharris30 Sign in Permalink The Dictator is a good movie with a fairly well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast. Sacha Baron Cohen hits it out of the park once again, further showing his versatile range for comedic performances, he plays two characters in this movie that both bring in the most laughs, the scene on the helicopter tour had me in stitches, the controversial jokes and political satire is evident throughout this film, which never fails to make me laugh. My main problem with this movie is that Aladeen is a very unlikeable character, though he may be very funny, I never found myself supporting him or wanting him to succeed in any way, in every film the character should turn around and become a better person than they were at the beginning, but Aladeen remains the exact same, and he is supported by many likable characters, such as Omar and Zoey, that really have no reason to be helping him as much as they do. The story telling in the movie is a bit off, a comedy film obviously dosen't have to have a terrific arc, but it gets very messy at times, it jumps around a lot from Aladden trying to return to his throne, to a love story that begins out of nowhere, to a villain who's motives are always made clear but never really come in to full swing, there was a lot of stuff that I felt could have happened, such as a proper love scene between Cohen and Anna Faris, or an actual confrontation between Aladeen and Tamir, it ends with a lot of loose ends that aren't tied up. It has many flaws, but the Dictator mostly makes up for this with pure hilarity, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy if you ever see it on television or Netflix. While in New York to ensure democracy never enters his country, a powerful dictator is taken away from his position and forced to a live as a normal American. Best Performance: Sacha Baron Cohen Worst Performance: Rizwan Manji
4.0~A comedy that is the epitome of stereotypes KineticSeoul Sign in Permalink So this is another mockumentary by Sacha Baron Cohen who is known for playing and getting really into these types of different roles with a lot of stereotypes. He used stereotypes in his past movies but this one is like the epitome of stereotypes in movies and that is where most of the humor comes from. Now "Borat" didn't seem to try as hard and is consistent at least to some degree. But there is nothing consistent with this one, it's like watching one skit after another. It's better than "Bruno" that is for sure. But this just isn't' a great comedy. The thing is humour shouldn't look like it's trying to hard. Most comedians that are good don't seem to be trying that hard but it's funny and others seem to try really hard but just isn't all that funny. This one is the latter, it just tries to be funny by being offensive and gross as possible. It works sometimes but for the most part it just comes off flat cause it doesn't seem natural. This movie just isn't for viewers that don't like really offensive jokes, but for those that do may like it. I for one is open to almost all kinds of jokes but this just didn't seem all that funny. The plot like any other Sacha Baron Cohen movies, is basically the colliding of culture. Except this time it's between a dictator and democracy. For those that really enjoy crude jokes, this MIGHT be for you. 4.5/10
8.0~Political Correctness takes a beating, as did my sides stephen_r_mills Sign in Permalink Right from the start, you knew this film would make the line between decency and crudeness look like a dot with its 'in memory of' tribute, and it doesn't come up for air throughout. But that's in the DNA of a SBC production, right? We have known for years that political correctness is off the table whenever you hear SBC is involved. And that was exactly why I went to see this film. I wanted, and expected, to see something which refused to adhere to any boundaries. Anybody with this attitude will fall about in the aisles watching this. Anybody naïve enough to think this might be the SBC production to break the mould of those gone before will give this film a 1-5 rating, and shouldn't have bothered paying. It's like going to see an installment of the Saw franchise and criticising the non-stop violence. You know it's coming, so don't be critical when it does. Enjoy it for what it is, an achingly funny movie
10.0~The best comedian movie since ... larousse-c Sign in Permalink So good, I still laugh till I cry two days later. Ingenious. You may disagree with its jokes and its bluntness, but feel free to have a good laugh. It is OK. If you are a man of any other culture than that of the United States, you might be able to relate and enjoy the movie more than the average American. If you are an American who has been exposed to other cultures, that would make you above average by the way, you can at least learn to appreciate the movie, if you do not already. If you are an activist of almost any sort or a feminist, you might find it offensive. One thing for certain is that the dictator shine a little light upon our deepest desires, the things we discuss among those who share our core values. The Dictator is a must see regardless of your orientation religiously, sexually, politically,...
8.0~Ignore haterz, i love this movie themizzz Sign in Permalink Guyz ignore those critics who has give under 5 stars, Believe me if ur gonna watch this movie Ur gonna laugh out of control
8.0~Rather fun. joshmuziks23 Sign in Permalink I wasn't really won over by the trailer so much, primarily because it was constructed in a "big-comedy-but-probably-not-funny" kind of way for me. I thought I'd give it a try because I really liked Sacha's characters all the way to Ali G. Personally I thought it was a riot. I really roared a couple of times at some of the uncomfortable stuff. The race jokes were spot on and worked well, although some of them really fell flat with the audience I was with (mostly white crowd, I'm brown myself). The jokes are really, really offensive, including the one that somewhat playfully open up the still-healing wound of America's 9/11. But as a brown person, and one of minority in the city I live in, I felt that the crowd was simply too uncomfortable with the jokes. Most of the atrocious ideas that look overblown (killing the mom in the beginning, executing your servants, baby in the trashcan joke), are still in practice, sadly, in certain parts of the world However, they don't seem to far-fetched to me. Some of the crowd acted like it was the first time they'd heard of these things happening. Overall a great experience, and I would probably buy or rent the DVD to look at the gag reel and commentary, if any.
7.0~Eh, could have been a 10, wound up a 7. igotmunsoned627 Sign in Permalink When I watch a movie I go in with a blank mind (not hard to do for me) and they all start off at a 10, of course they can only go down from there. This movie that starts out pretty good and kind of funny, but then goes wrongish (everything is ish) around the scene in the helicopter when they make fun of 911. OK, I get it. 911 was years ago and we should get over it, and I can still look past this with an open mind even though it hits me hard. Then the movie crashes further south with a beheading of a corpse at a funeral. They beheaded the body! Then they use the head as a puppet. I get pushing the comedic boundaries, but this goes way to far. Now it's not all bad. all of the above took this movie down to a 2. I believe laughs do allow for a lot of recovery of a movie in a comedy. If you've saw this movie all I have to say is pointy poop, penis to window, peaking in vagina, and rape room. These laughs alone recover it to a 4. I also take into consideration if a movie keeps me laughing. And the fact that I laughed nearly the entire movie, which I know is contrary to what I wrote in my previous paragraph, awards this movie another two points for a solid 7 (And I realize my math is wrong).
6.0~Don't be expecting Borat robearbarrett Sign in Permalink Upon going to see Cohen's new film, I like many others may have been expecting a similar experience to Borat. However this is an easy mistake to make and many made the same mistake with the release of Bruno. So my first advice is try to withdraw yourself from thinking that The Dictator will be anything like Borat. But don't be to put off, The Dictator is a good comedy film overall, but 'good' is the best adjective for it. Again as predicted Cohen produces below the belt humour that will have an audience trying not to laugh at controversial topics but the main narrative of the film is a real let down. Both Borat and even Bruno to an extent have a purpose for the main character, but in The Dictator 'Aladeens' story is a little too far-fetched and leave's you disconnected with the character. Despite this there are still some real funny moments and the idea on the whole is good but it's not executed as well as previous Sacha Baron Cohen productions. So if you do watch the Dictator, don't expect Borat, don't expect a purpose, think of it as one long sketch with a few laughs here and there.
3.0~It was better then I expected, but still not my kind of thing osj2507 Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen is a strange guy, a bit too much in many ways, but he also got a sense of humor that is different from many other "comedians", it is very crude and to the point, so much so that it just becomes corny for me. I liked this film more then I had expected I would, I thought it was more in the lines of Borat then an actual film. It definitely have its moments and there is a lot to laugh about, both in big silly somebody got hurt kind of way, but also in the more subtle references and behaviors of the characters, the latter works best for me in this film. I am not a fan, it had its moments, but not really my kind of comedy. It does work well as a plot and setup and the film is nicely put together, but all in all I was expecting more and hoping that this would be more to my liking, but it was not.
1.0~Everybody Hurts... Big Time!! xaggurat Sign in Permalink Someone asked "Did anyone over 30 like it?" Maybe I would have liked it when I was under 13, not sure. I was over 30 when I saw 'Borat', thought it was wild and I laughed a lot watching it. 'The Dictator' is just cheesy and bad. Waste of time. The fact that title of this film is close to Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' almost gives me a headache. Acting is clumsy, jokes are childish, timing is terrible, looks cheap, plot is a big cliché... almost everything in this movie sucks. MC Rai's version of REM's Everybody Hurts is the only exception, but obviously one track in the soundtrack just can't save the film. 1/10 stars. That bad.
6.0~What You'd Expect From Sacha Baron Cohen sddavis63 Sign in Permalink Sometimes crude, sometimes funny, sometimes rather dull. It's Sacha Baron Cohen! And it's a movie with some similarities in style and story to "Borat" - although I would say "Borat" was probably the better movie of the two. In "The Dictator," Cohen plays Admiral-General Aladeen, ruthless dictator of the North African republic of Wadiya, whose goal is to crush any moves toward democracy promoted either by his own people or by the international community. The movie starts out with a laugh as it's dedicated to the memory of Kim Jong-Il. Throughout, as I suggested above, it's an uneven kind of movie. It never seemed to find a consistent pace. When it's funny, it's very funny. When it's not, it's really not. One of the problems with this is that it's set mostly in the United States, in New York, as Aladeen has travelled there to speak to the UN. As part of a plot by his trusted associate (played by Ben Kingsley) he ends up replaced by a double and out on the streets, struggling to get back into power. That's where it develops most of its similarities to "Borat" - the cultural issues, with Aladeen speaking and acting and thinking like the Wadiyan dictator in the midst of New York City, where no one knows he's the Wadiyan dictator. OK. Some of that was humorous. The relationship that develops between Aladeen and Zoey (played by Ana Faris, who I honestly wouldn't have recognized as Ana Faris) is the hub around which the cultural issues revolve - Aladeen being the Middle Eastern dictator, Zoey being the left-wing, vegan, etc., etc. Of course, the two fall in love. That's always necessary for whatever reason. Their relationship fit in with the general theme of the movie. I was left wondering, though, whether more of this shouldn't have taken place in Wadiya? Why not show more of Aladeen battling pro-democracy forces there rather than in New York City? The best part of the movie for me (and in a strange way the funniest - or at least the best bit of satire) might have been near the end when Aladeen, back in power, faces American reporters and tries to explain to Americans (who know nothing of dictatorship, of course) what dictatorship looks like - and it looks surprisingly like America! That was an effective skewering of the system. On and off over the course of the movie American democracy is also skewered as it becomes obvious that the type of democracy the international community wants to force on Wadiya is really just an excuse for outside interests to gain control of Wadiya's oil resources. Sound familiar? Also an effective skewering of the system. This isn't a great movie, but it does have its moments. (6/10)
4.0~The Dictator lasttimeisaw Sign in Permalink It's Euro-Cup time now, so there is a famine in the cinemas, maybe one should not go to cinema twice a week these days (I have already watched PROMETHEUS 2012), the only possibilities are this one or SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN (2012), so hectoring by the latter's horrid reviews, a satire comedy sounds like a more safe choice between these two. Deceiving by its trailer, and Instead of being a political satire, the film is no more than a crass sketch comedy, with a plentiful supply of self-conscious jokes about masturbation, human excrement, racism, sexism, gay culture, terrorism, a mixed-bag of all the possible sought-after topics. But how is the effect? Though in my memories, I didn't perceive BORAT! (2006, a 5/10) as a deserving accomplishment, but by comparison, THE DICTATOR even has less virtue and has no difference with other annually cranked-out Hollywood trashy comedies, which more or less are able to generate some laughters but one would never give a second-thought after leaving the cinema, lest feel repellent even thinking about the source material or simply erase it from the memory. THE DICTATOR marked the third time Sacha Baron Cohen and director Larry Charles work in unison (after BORAT! and BRUNO 2009, which I skipped), but the pith of it is all in its trailer, I wonder, when will Hollywood ever deliver another comedy without meddling too much with filthiness, sometimes audience needs to be innovated instead of being pondered to. About the cast, I don't want to complain what on earth Kinsley or Reilly is doing here, but my sympathy is completely all over Anna Faris, takes a tomboy coiffure, while is doing what has stereotyped her through her whole career and she is fairly adequate even though the script hardly takes any effort to be logical or tolerable, perhaps I would enjoy more with any episode of Saturday NIGHT LIVE. trashy comedies, which more or less are able to generate some laughters but one would never give a second-thought after leaving the cinema, lest feel repellent even thinking about the source material or simply erase it from the memory.

6.0~Funny in places, but NOT for everyone bob-rutzel-1 Sign in Permalink Dictator Admiral General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) of the (fictional) Republic of Wadiya goes to America to address the United Nations, to explain his "peaceful nuclear program." Once there, he is kidnapped and a body double takes his place. The job of the body double is to sign a new constitution giving the country democracy and opening the door for oil contracts that his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) is behind. Aladeen must find a way to stop this nonsense and hold onto his dictatorship. The problem is that his beard has been cut off and no one recognizes him as the true leader of Wadiya. What to do? What to do? This is not for everyone. Why you ask? Offensive, crude and rude insults abound for everything imaginable: ethnic groups, religions, ways of life, political ideologies, medical conditions; and, body parts have not been left out. Yes, this is a satire and there are (alleged) funny lines throughout. And, even though you may find some things disgusting and over the line, you may find yourself laughing anyway, because, in here, timing is everything. And, the timing was great. Maybe you had better watch this alone so no one knows what you laughed at. I'm just saying. I expected more f-bomb language and it is there but not as much as anticipated. Ben Kingsley is wasted in here, but maybe he thought he could do his Sexy Beast routine. He couldn't. He is just plays Tamir, a greedy uncle who keeps trying to assassinate Aladeen, because he is actually the rightful ruler. Before Aladeen goes to the UN in New York, Aladeen used body doubles whose main job was to take one in the head. But, in New York the body double has another mission working for Tamir. Some aspects of normalcy are brought in via the love interest: Zoey (Anna Faris) and she does a credible job not knowing who Aladeen actually is. This is a scripted movie whereas BORAT (Cohen's first) was not, more or less. For Cohen fans the debate rages on as to which movie is better. Politics and social customs are never far from the off-the-wall-comedic mind of Sacha Baron Cohen. You'll see, but again, this is not for everyone. I'm just saying. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Sexual content: Abounds. Nudity: Yes, and also male frontal nudity is shown when Cohen or a stunt man swings thru a window. A severed head: Used as a comedic prop. Yeah, I couldn't watch it either. Language: Yes, F-bombs also, but not too many.
6.0~Over-sized and Fits Somewhat Uncomfortably. DJRMewzique Sign in Permalink Yes, "The Dictator" is truly as stupid as you expect it to be. Maybe even a little more so. Sacha Baron Choen's latest release, following the controversial "Borat" and the hilarious "Bruno," is yet another ridiculous look into the life of another sort of "outsider"...The Dictator. But this one lacks something the first two had. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it lacks...something. As the named leader of a fictional African country, Cohn plays Supreme Leader Aladeen, an amalgamation of every horrible leader one can imagine. He demands that people be killed left, right and centre while producing nuclear weapons and living in a lavish property while bedding as many people as he can pay for...but, aw, never finding love. And then a bunch of ridiculous circumstances that are never quite developed and just assumed to be accepted by the audience land Aladeen not just in New York, but stripped of his identity, leaving him to find a way back into his proper role before his second in command (played by...Ben Kingsley?!?!?), brings democracy to his land for personal profit, all the while finding love when he meets Zoey (Anna Faris). While Borat was just naively politically incorrect and Bruno was a hyper-cliché for the sake of humour, none of which is subtle, much of which is grotesque, Aladeen is just offensive. Humorously offensive, but offensive just the same. The entire film has an air of aggression that, despite making one laugh, will leave you feeling somewhat guilty in having done so. Attacking race, gender and sexuality, sometimes all at once, the audience is left with a feeling that they should not have laughed at certain moments, despite themselves. And I laughed, but at the same time, was taken aback by what Cohen seems to feel he can get away with...and generally does. Yet, ultimately, he seems to have a point to get across and it is wrapped up in another not-so-subtle speech at the end, which oddly manages to get it across with some clarity that you can't help but agree with. Definitely not a shining moment in cinematic history, as with all Cohen comedies, it's not supposed to be. With a plethora of surprising cameos and some truly hilarious moments, "The Dictator" is by no means a terrible film, but the laughs will occasionally leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.
9.0~Offensively Hilarious! g-bodyl Sign in Permalink The Dictator, as it would seem from the get-go, is a very offensive and racist film. Perhaps the most racist film I have seen to date. But that being said, this film was just way too funny perhaps for it's own good. Many if these scenes were very crafty and most of them has added wit. There will be people who hate this film because of the racial jokes and slurs, but if you know it's going to be racist, then you shouldn't watch this film. Larry Charle's film is about a dictator named General Aladeen from the country of Wadija and he has to speak with the U.N or else his country will be attacked. But while in New York, he gets switched for a body double and now Aladeen must reclaim his throne. Sacha Baren Cohen is just too good in the film. I love his idea of comedy no matter how racist it may seem. He had many hilarious scenes including my favorite which is the one involving the American tourists in the helicopter. Anna Faris does a good job as the left-wing radical owner of a health store. I really loved John C. Reilly's small part here because he was also very, very hilarious. Overall, this is a really funny film that is a laugh-out-loud riot fest. If you can't take racist jokes, then this movie is not for you! If you like Borat, then you would definitely like this film. I rate this film 9/10.
7.0~The reason why i avoid watching trailers for comedies. Preskoto Sign in Permalink Just to note i haven't watched "Borat" or "Bruno",so i only kinda knew what to expect from the movie. In short it's a really great film,filed with great humour and great actors,that doesn't take itself too seriously and it shouldn't be taken seriously from the audience around the globe.It's lighthearted comedy for those who have a hour or two to spare. The main problem for me (as noted in the title) is that the trailer gave away maybe 70% of the really really funny parts.I remember seeing the trailer for the first time i laughed for a good 5 minutes after it ended.The second time i saw it,it actually convinced me to go and see the movie later on,expecting much more from it. In the end i can't say i was disappointed i still think it's a great movie,just with a trailer that gives away less of the really funny moments it would have been a much,much more memorable experience.But i guess that's my mistake since i know that trailers usually give away 50% of the comedies these days.
1.0~Wasted my money and time jimminysnickety Sign in Permalink My father and I just came back from seeing this turd of a movie. Didn't laugh or smirk once. Sasha Baron Cohen how could you do this to a movie. Bruno was less ridiculous than this movie. Don't go to this thinking it will be as good or better than Borat or Bruno because it just fails. Go to the Avengers instead of seeing this garbage. The cameos made by Anna Faris and Sir Ben Kingsley just don't even matter. This movie is so sub par on so many levels. I don't care if i'm sounding bias. It was just stupid to have to sit through. The comedy i was just not feeling and that's very sad. I think the humour was overly crude even for Sasha Cohen standards.
7.0~Laugh? I almost executed the usher... philblakeman Sign in Permalink As with any Sascha Baron Cohen feature you can leave any misguided beliefs about the importance of taste and decency in the cinema cloakroom because there are more cheap shots in "The Dictator" than a Student Union Bar in Freshers' Week. Unlike Bruno and Borat, The Dictator is entirely acted with SBC leading as Admiral General Aladeen, tyrannical ruler of "Wadiya", who must try and stop democracy coming to the country he so lovingly oppressed for many years. In some ways the film functions like the mockumentaries, with others serving to provide the ammunition SBC needs to give you that "I can't believe he just said that" moment. The experience is very different though with laughs coming from your own reaction and those around you rather than the out-of-touch politician/pompous celebrity/naïve man-on-the-street (delete as appropriate). Aladeen is vile and lovable at the same time with a larger than life performance from SBC whilst Anna Faris is quirky as the liberal feminist food-store owner Zoe who won't shave her armpits for any man but might just love him. The dictator has a few laugh out loud moments, plenty of gross-out comedy and some very quotable lines. The social and political satire is mostly overpowered by cheap and easy lower-brow jokes but these are sometimes shocking enough to have you spitting your popcorn out. A perceptive and clever take on geo-politics? No! Willy jokes and offensive to everyone regardless of their race, religion or sexuality? Yes! Sasha Baron Cohen doesn't do subtlety; he does "The Dictator".
6.0~Obscene, offensive and excellent comedy saurav_shekhar Sign in Permalink "The Dictator" will give you a good time laughing for its near 90 minute run. It is obscene, however outrageously funny. The movie has a lot of offensive political, racist and sexist humor. Overall, it is an excellent comedy. Sacha Cohen plays Aladeen, the narcissist dictator of the Arabian nation Wadiya, where he executes people with the flip of a finger, plays terrorist attack games and keeps a photo wall of celebrities he has slept with. Ben Kingsley is Tamir, his general and rightful owner to the throne. In an attempt to escape an assassination, Aladeen ends up on the streets of Brooklyn downtown with a dumb double in his place as the ruler. The story then revolves around his plans to regain his place. Plans progress and so does romance as Aladeen finds himself falling for a liberal girl Zoya who gives him a job at her food store. Cohen does a good job keeping you smiling with his funny accent and satirical jokes. Story flows casually along, with well blended comedy. Humor can get disgusting sometimes, and Ben Kingsley deserves better roles. The plot is always kept in a cozy mode and the movie has a good repeat value. Watch it if you have some time to kill. In this troubled world, a moment of laughter is always appreciated.
6.0~I Don't Know Why I Am Writing This Review! TejasNair Sign in Permalink Well, there is no concerning plot. A simple kick to the governments: fascism, democracy & dictatorship! Sacha Baron Cohen is hilarious with his sense of humor but you may barf at some highfalutin claptrap that this one exhibits. This is no movie for people who hate racism or likes. This is sheer slapstick! The music is provocative as the scenes double, direction is so-so and the cast appears good. Although I still haven't been able to figure our why Ben Kingsley took the role, but Anna Faris is charming in her "Chemo wig"! The Dictator is impressive but offensive, too! Watch at your own risk and if you are aware of what is happening around the world! This one has lots of vulgarity, porn relation and what-not! WATCH OUT FOR: Sacha's fabulous sarcastic comments on different affairs & Edward Norton's cameo! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Language: Yes | Sex: Yes | Mouth-Kiss: Yes | Violence: Yes | Nudity: Yes
7.0~Crudely successful p-stepien Sign in Permalink International fame effectively mean that Sacha Baron Cohen can admittedly no longer get away with spoof characters such as Borat, Ali G or Brüno, thus forced to bring it with narrative features. In an attempt to replicate the crude brilliance of his breakthrough characters, Cohen conceives an equally offensive and explicit idea of playing a despicable dictator with truly unlimited political incorrectness. This time around Cohen seamlessly takes over the role of Wadiyan ruler supreme Aladeen, famed torturer, mass murderer, weapons-of-mass-destruction fanatic, serial rapist, Jew hater and - naturally - billionaire. Due to international pressure Aladeen ventures in New York to attend a United Nations session, which aims to discuss his dictatorship. Unfortunately for the well-meaning despot his right hand Tamir (Ben Kingsley) supplants him with a goat-loving villager. Aladeen manages to escape, but without his pronounced beard and any documents he is unable to prove his identity. Chance brings him into a Wadiyan expats, such as the 'assassinated' nuclear scientist Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas), and finally under the protection of unsuspecting human rights activist slash ape-armpit lesbian slash health food retailer Zooey (Anna Faris). Thus comes a welcome sequel to "Coming to America"... Sascha Baron Cohen is crass, obscene, absurd and has no qualms at pushing the bar. Unlike "Brüno" and "Ali G in Da House" the script manages to balance the purely disgusting and counterpointing it with witty political / social commentary, hidden behind the drastically overboard characters. Audiences are fully aware about the absurd extremity of Aladeen, but his character still manages to engage to an extent that Cohen manages to pull off the seemingly impossible: creating a sense of affinity towards a mass-murderer, where you can't help but cheer him on in his endeavours. "The Dictator" is an obscene, but simultaneously extremely successful satire, equally open to ridiculing the oil nations as well as the 'superior morality' of the West and America specifically. Unbelievable how something so crude can possess such pronounced substance...
3.0~Some genuine comedy hidden behind a thick unoriginal premise monstar92 Sign in Permalink The Dictator, from the outside, looks like an original tale of the bad guy doing what he does best, being bad. But the actual product is nothing more than the antiquated story of guy falls for girl. The writing does have it's high and there are more than a few good chuckles in this movie thanks to some great script writing, but the story is so terribly overdone, so greatly played out that it takes what could have been a fantastic comedic tale of the guy everyone loves to hate and turned it into another crappy, run of the mill flick that's unoriginal and uninspiring in every which way possible. The Dictator could have been great, it could have been good, but with Ali G, Bruno and Borat already under his belt SBC could have done so much better.
7.0~An entertaining, but not completely satisfactory, comedy Argemaluco Sign in Permalink In the '80s, the name "culture jamming" was given to an artistic movement created in the '50s, which consisted of using the media as a "canvas" to create artistic expressions which satirized the media itself as well as the society which blindly believed in them. Nowadays, the "culture jamming" is part of the popular entertainment thanks to the Internet and the cable TV, which are both always hungry of new and provocative material in order to attract an increasingly segmented audience. And something which can't be denied is that the most successful exponent from this discipline is comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who made the media (voluntary or not) accomplice of his social satire, first in the TV series Da Ali G Show and later in the films Borat and Brüno. For better or for worse, the most recent film in which he has been involved, The Dictator, adopts a more conventional narrative shape in which his accustomed observations about North American culture are combined with the clichés from many contemporary comedies. The result isn't completely satisfactory, but it offers enough laughs and good satirical comments in order to make it worthy of a moderate recommendation. First, the screenplay from The Dictator is focused on the issue about the main character's double. Then, the focus changes when the main character gets lost in New York, when the movie becomes a modern (and more vulgar) version of Coming to America. At the same time, the screenplay looses impulse and degenerates into a parade of vignettes which fully exploit the "fish outside the water" cliché, in which we see the dictator using his habitual insensibility and arrogance while he tries to look for a job and find someone who believes his crazy story. Some of those vignettes work quite well, both in the humorous and the satirical level, pointing out some ridiculous aspects of North American culture and laughing at the extremes reached by the "political correction". But other vignettes feel antipathetic and too repetitive. As for the performances, I liked the work from Baron Cohen, Ben Kingsley, Jason Mantzoukas and Anna Faris. So, in conclusion, I can give a moderate recommendation to The Dictator as I previously said, because it made me laugh enough times, and also because of its social satire, despite not being as solid as the one from Borat.
3.0~Screenplay is horrible,they tried so hard to make it funny...but it wasn't. lyannefebo Sign in Permalink I was actually obligated to go and watch this movie. So I decided to give it a shot,I was aware of Sacha's other work,although I haven't really seen any of them. This movie wasn't THAT funny. There were some parts of course,that made me smile but I didn't "lol". It's a good movie for those who find everything funny,but for me...totally mediocre.It has a lot of offensive comments,but I get that he's trying to criticize social matters in our world. He could use other ways to show it,I've seen a lot o movies that you don't actually feel that they're trying to make you laugh,you just laugh naturally because the screenplay is that good. Anyway,this movie was a waste of money. You can watch it at your own risk in my opinion but you'll probably be disappointed.
1.0~Terrible jackdub75 Sign in Permalink If I could've voted negative, I would have. This is by far the worst of his movies I've seen. I wanted to laugh, and even tried a few times, but it was really only out of pity. I truly wish I could take back the hour and a half that I spent watching it. I can't believe this actually made it to film. Don't waste your time or money, even if it's only a dollar rental. I actually paid $5.99 to rent this on demand, and I really feel cheated, annoyed and betrayed. SBC should really consider a new line of work, because his acting is questionable, and really makes him look like a giant, goofy ridiculous man. I sort of liked Borat, and tolerated Bruno, even though I feel guilty for finishing it. SBC needs to try a different genre if he wants to continue acting, because these roles do not suit him, or vice versa.
8.0~Surprisingly funny robert-wood-1 Sign in Permalink I'm not at all offended by Sasha Baron Cohen's films, but have found them just not *that* funny in the past. However, this was a gem. From the very first moment in the film that brought a genuine laugh, to the end of the film there are many moments that make you laugh out loud. If you've seen SBC's other films, you'll know the style of comedy to expect. Irreverent, crude, lewd and, potentially, offensive. However, whether or not some of this is too close to the bone, it does what a comedy should do and that is make you laugh. SBC's characterisations are totally over the top and people might take umbrage at some of them, some will find it very funny. In the same way Yorkshire folk didn't get offended by Monty Python's Meaning of Life sketch, there's no good reason for people to get upset at this. SBC pokes fun at one and all in his comedies. There is an amazingly well observed speech towards the end of the film; he wonderfully draws parallels between a dictatorship and America (an observation that could equally apply to the UK) which forces the point home that SBC is a clever bloke with a sharp mind in amongst all the filth and stupidity that makes audiences laugh. Thoroughly recommended.
8.0~Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, Sacha Baron Cohen Br007 Sign in Permalink The non-stop jokes, off-color humor, slapstick and under 90 minute running time of "The Dictator" hearkens back to early Woody Allen gems like "What's Up Tiger Lily," "Take The Money and Run," "Bananas," and "Love and Death. And, in the world of comedy, that's quite a compliment. Like Cohen, Allen's first films were often misunderstood. Some folks just did not get the joke. Many still don't get it today. The object of comedy has always been to take down the high and mighty by whatever means necessary. And, if you happen to be a Middle Eastern despot, you will find much to be offended by here. But, as Allen often did as well, Cohen uses racial and gender stereotypes to shine a light on people's attitudes, and that's likely to put off others as well. That's fine. Some comedy just isn't for everyone. While his writing style owes much to Allen, his acting chops are also influenced heavily by one of Britain's greatest comics, Peter Sellers. You can see it in his outrageous accents and in his ridiculous pratfalls. Like Sellers, Cohen is fearless in his characterizations and, again, like Sellers, there will be those who will take offense in this. Again, not for everyone. But, if you laughed your butt off at Sellers' simpleton Indian character destroying a Hollywood party, you will be laughing here too. And that's what we're talking about; laughs. Not every joke works. Many fall flat. But the film starts off fast and furious with a rapid succession of gags, most of which work hilariously, settles down for a bit and then takes off again, literally. His verbal sparring with co-star Jason Mantzoukas is one of the highlights as are many of the fun cameo appearances and a running joke about his name that I will not reveal here. There are many great sight gags that are easily missed and the appearance of his Efawadh character at the U.N. channels a scene right out of Allen's "Sleeper." There's a few scatological and sex jokes also (one about excrement, one about urination, one about masturbation, several about body parts), and these, if you ask me, are the low point of the film (except a child birth scene that's as funny as it is outrageous). But, the bodily fluid gags, so rampant in comedy films today, are actually few and far between. And there's a bit of a message, too. We're not dealing with "Citizen Kane" here. But, then, this film made me laugh much more.
8.0~One of the funniest movies I know! chetaninbox-668-54666 Sign in Permalink Very difficult to describe this movie. I can't stop laughing i wish there should be more movie like this. The plot of this movie is very funny, this movie is not for all audience only a genius can make this kind of movie. When the fist time i saw trailer i decided to give it a chance. Tis movie is about the story of a dictator who risks his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country. Just watch this film and could never stop laughing. Sacha Baron Cohen is a true comedic talent. I enjoyed it much more than I expected. I would recommend this movie to all those who are not looking for logical fun. This is definitely that sort of humor you will not regret then go and watch it now!
6.0~It will make you laugh...but no where near Borat lagudafuad Sign in Permalink Same old thing all over again, crude comedy, racial jokes, stereotyping and all that; seen Borat seen 90% of the movie already. There are some parts that made me laugh though but I am too ashamed to say where. Baron Cohen based his performance primarily on the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The movie is a mockmentary of a North African Dictator and the lines are fun to hear if you don't mind racial comments, also the speech of the Dictator Admiral General Hafez Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) at the end of the movie was, if I have to say so myself memorable. The movie was shot in Seville and on the island of Fuerteventura, Spain, and Baron Cohen said the United Nations refused to let him shoot scenes inside the UN Headquarters. The plot is as simple as all other Cohen movies are, a man from a different culture and different background Aladeen travels to America and finds in himself in an environment that is not favorable to his existence. There is a love story intertwined in this plot and a nice ending to it too. Now as for acting and directing and everything you want to look for in a good movie, just forget it nothing to write about at all, all I can say is, if you don't mind crude humor, racial jokes and abuse of power then you will like me lol through the movie. But if you are not a fan of the above mentioned and you like a movie with a strong plot, then I advice you don't bother seeing this movie.
5.0~Disappointing yet watchable saadgkhan Sign in Permalink The Dictator – CATCH IT (B-) There are some movies people will always watch it even if you tell them don't watch it. The Dictator falls under that category, it's not that movie is dreadful it's just its not as great as we had expected from Sacha Baron Cohen since Borat. The Dictator is mostly funny, in addition to being obscene, disgusting, scatological, vulgar, crude and so on but somehow it doesn't work all together. Especially his scenes with Anna Faris are tedious. Sacha Baron Cohen is good but certainly not great. Anna Faris is OK but she isn't that funny with Beiber hair cut. Megan Fox one liner cameo was alright. On the whole, The Dictator is disappointing but still watchable because crude antics of The Dictator.
8.0~Way better than what i would have imagined harry_goodwin Sign in Permalink Absolutely. Positively. Amazing!. When my mates asked me if i wanted to see it i was unsure because i thought it didn't look that good - I have never laughed so hard in my life, the jokes, the craziness and the sheer stupidity of the plot made is so hysterical. Sacha Baron Cohen is a comical genius! Even if you have no sense of humour this film will bring it out of you! Most enjoyable to anyone (15+). if i had the choice to this again i would jump for the chance, the film is so much better once you see it in cinematic form! i WILL buy this on DVD and show it to everyone i know! I strongly recommend you to see this movie!
3.0~Forget Borat and Bruno - this is Ali G Indahouse 2 willjohnhall Sign in Permalink The latest outing from Sacha Baron Cohen follows the experiences of an eccentric dictator named Aladeen (Baron Cohen) who strives to prevent democracy being introduced in his home country of Wadiya. After travelling to the US to make a speech he's kidnapped, de-bearded and replaced by a brain-dead double. Breaking free, he's taken in by a vegan, liberal activist (Faris), and begins to hatch a plan to prevent Wadiya becoming a democracy. Comparisons of The Dictator to recent outings such as Borat and Bruno are slightly misleading. The genius of his previous work was melding bizarre fictional characters with unknowing bystanders. Using these exuberant creations, such as Borat, he was able draw reactions out of members of the public that were often shocking, and sometimes hilarious. This is not evident once in The Dictator, which moves away from away from the documentary style and feels like 83 minutes of filler, with no end reward. Instead the audience is subjected to what is in essence a very poor, gross-out comedy, which relies almost entirely on its ability to shock. It harks back to the Ali G IndaHouse era, which few will think of as Baron Cohen's golden age. There are some comical moments, such as Aladeen and a friend taking a helicopter ride with two American tourists and, while gesturing innocently, appear that they are about to commit a terrorist attack. However these brief flashes are not enough to save a disappointing third outing, which will survive primarily due to the kudos established by previous titles, and the hype Baron Cohen once again masterfully orchestrated. If another Baron Cohen character is created it will surely need more substance than The Dictator has to offer.
8.0~Democracy is like ................ xamtaro Sign in Permalink Political satire takes an equal amount of balls and tact. Too often does a satire movie end up too preachy, too safe or too overdone that it crosses that thin line. It takes a master to craft a film that delivers a good punch without being too painful. Enter "The Dictator", a witty, funny, biting political and social satire that can easily be the most hilarious film this year. Larry Charles and Sacha Baron Cohen team up once again to bring us black comedy at its finest. If the snide opening dedication to the late Kim Jong Il does not get you at least grinning or chuckling then you know you're in the wrong theatre. You are not here to watch some tame little romantic comedy. You are here to behold the rise and fall and rise again and fall again of Admiral General Aladeen; the perverted, anti- westerner, immature and slightly off his rocker ruler of the North African republic of Wadiya. His lecherous decadent life is shattered on a fateful trip to address the UN over talks of stopping Wadiya's development of nuclear weapons. Betrayed by his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley effectively reprising his role of treacherous right hand man from Pince of Persia), replaced by a mentally challenged decoy, and shaved of his trademark beard by a hit-man, Aladeen embarks on a clandestine scheme to get back into power by joining forces with a Wadiyan refugee (whom he supposedly executed) and a tomboyish political activist named Zoey. Strip the story down to its bones and it is "Prince and the Pauper" or "Emperor's New Groove". Heck, it's "Lion King" complete with treacherous uncle and African monarch. A sheltered leader falls from power and soon learns the simple joys of a simple life. Not very original there. Yet it is in the pitch perfect execution of this tried and tested plot that The Dictator stands out. Sacha Baron Cohen IS Admiral General Aladeen. He plays the role with such earnest vigour that, like his previous film portrayal of fictional Kazakstanian Borat, you would be hard pressed not to believe Aladeen exists in the real world as a real person. Ironic in that his overblown antics are anything but real. He is a caricature, much like The supporting cast consisting of caricatures of typically oppressed demographics of a population; the minorities, the disabled, those who are different etc. All put on performances beyond excellence but one cannot help but pity how Ben Kingsley has been so under utilized as an actor of late. The Star attraction is of course, the satire aspect. Other satires may bare their political teeth, but The Dictator sinks its whole jaw into themes of racial oppression, the contradictory nature of democracy, the recent world economic situation, the rise of China and it's own brand of "democracy" etc. It is intentionally crafted to tick off the right people and entertain everyone else. Crude without being overly offensive, . Even the more "icky" stuff are played strictly for laughs. You'd get it if you had a sense of humor. The hard hitting jabs at politics and social issues are interspersed with looney toons style slapstick and a tender emotional subplot that actually feels right in place. One downside is that this film does require the viewer to have a bit of knowledge of current world socio-political issues. Failing which, a good number of the jokes and jabs would just fly over the heads of the ignorant such as a rousing climatic speech by Aladeen extolling the virtues of dictatorship. (It is not as straight forward as you think. Those that get it will get it good). Without the aforementioned prerequisite, The Dictator would come across as just another "Prince and the Pauper" comedy clone.But for those in the know, for those willing to think through all the little mocking points raised by the narrative, it is the softer spiritual cousin to "Team America", the vulgar dysfunctional third nephew to "Fahrenheit 911" and the crude great grandson of Charlie Chaplin's 1940's classic "The Great Dictator". IF anything, The Dictator serves to establish Sacha Baron Cohen as possibly the finest comedy actor of our decade. May his reign be long, hard and full of.................well, you get the point.
7.0~Half and half. But worth watching. theworldxatlarge Sign in Permalink Truthfully, some of this movie wasn't really that funny. Some of it really did fall on its face. I think Anna Faris had a lot to do with making the movie not funny, because the stupid love affair and really her acting overall was enough to bring it down. But that's not to discredit the other parts that were phenomenal. Aladeen's little monologue about America in the last few minutes was probably the best part of the movie, and it was nice to see somebody rip our country a new one. Reading these other reviews, I think it's not fair to totally dismiss the good parts of the movie just because not all of it is great. Movies in this day in age are usually at least half decrepit feces and half funny in any case, so it's not like some of this being bad was breaking any norms. Also, I feel like some of the sarcasm and satirical elements in this movie totally flew over a lot of peoples' heads. Overall though, the better parts of this movie made it worth watching.
2.0~Embarrassingly Bad... Not Funny In The Least Marvelouis Sign in Permalink This movie is completely awful in every way. It plays out like all bad parody films. There is no real story, just a bunch of unrelated jokes. I know you don't go to these type of films for the story but you need something to hang these "jokes" upon. As is, it's not funny at all. Honestly, I may have chuckled once during the entire showing. Anna Faris and Ben Kingsley must have lost a bet to be in this thing. The cast looked embarrassed to be in it and frankly, I was embarrassed to be sitting through it. I thought this would be a funny movie about how an over privileged dictator who is now living among the people would act, like a fish out of water deal. Muslim leader in the non Muslim world. (Like Eddie Murphy's Coming To America type thing) They actually failed on that front bigtime. The movie is four years too late. Yes, it's a Pro Obama commercial in an election year but, without directly mentioning Bush, it pretty much attacks his administration and then goes on to bash America. Spoilers... His lame speech calls America a dictatorship and rips its form of democracy. Honestly, they spend more time bashing the United States than pointing out the mess that is the middle east or the extreme Muslim way of thinking. More time was spent with Sacha as The Dictator doing very lame interviews than working a script that was probably written on a napkin four years ago. What a waste of film and of time.
6.0~The movie was so Aladeen ironhorse_iv Sign in Permalink The Dictator doesn't have the same charm as Borat, and it's way below Charles Chaplin's Great Dictator in scope of being funny and important in society, but still it's interesting to watch. I personally thought this movie was a giant heap of Aladeen. The movie starts out a back story of Admiral General Aladeen (Sasha Baron Cohen) and how he became the leader of the small North African nation of Wadiya. For years Admiral General Haffaz Aladeen been treating his people as a lewd, childish, misogynous, anti-democracy and antisemitic who refuses to allow Wadiyan oil to be sold internationally and is secretly working on developing nuclear weapons. He has been getting help from his Uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) on running the day on day operations of the country while Tamir is secretly trying to overthrow him so Wadiya can be open for the world oil companies. When the U.N calls for him to speak to the UN Headquarters in New York City, Admiral General Aladeen goes to the mock them, for only to have himself kidnapped by Clayton (John C. Reilly), a hit-man hired by his uncle to kill him. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally burns himself to death, but his huge beard has been shaved off by Clayton, making him practically unrecognizable, while Tamir sports a double as Aladeen to the public. Yeah, I know, just go with it. He meets, boyish-looking, hairy arm-pitted, activist Zoey (Anna Faris), at a Anti-Aladeen rally and they befriend each other while he hides under the name of Allison Burgers. Zoey offers Aladeen a job at her grocery store who is catering the event in which his double is staying. At first, he get the job only to get pass the security, but in later scenes it doesn't really play a factor into his plans. He encounters Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas), a exile Nuclear scientist whom working at Apple type store. I really like Jason Mantzoukas, his straight man approach works great against the out-there Aladeen character. Nadal helps Aladeen only if he can regain his old job as a nuclear scientist. There are two versions of this scene, the part where he meets Nadal. In an alternative scene, Aladeen approaches Nadal at work and one in a bar type restaurant. Slowly Aladeen becomes to warm up to both Nadal and Zoey, which turns the character around and question if he should still allow Wadiya to be under a dictatorship. There is a unrated cut of The Dictator runs an additional 15 minutes from its original 83-minute theatrical version. Much of the added material is additional sexual content and dialogue. There is a scene following Aladeen falling asleep in the back of the store where one of his bodyguards, Etra, tries to kill him by beating him with her enlarged breast. The film has a lot of gross out humor that doesn't work, and much of it wasn't really need for the plot. The movie can also be too offensive to some people. this movie is making fun of all racist stereotypes. If anyone actually thinks that all Muslims are like that, they are really stupid. The rapes jokes were really not that funny. I found the film a bit too juvenile at times. Sasha Baron Cohen sort of had his finger on the cultural pulse in terms of knowing which buttons to push, in order to criticize the attitudes and beliefs of people. I think the problem was, that Aladeen had too many funny things to do and say throughout the movie, so that after half an hour you're so familiar with the comedy, he says than you might grin and chuckle and want to laugh, but you can't because deep down you expected it. Iwill give him that he's a phenomenal actor, a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to developing a character; however, the jokes was already stale because he play that part in Borat. The jokes feel like unused Borat jokes. What made Borat so funny was that the people in that movie don't know it's fake. They actually think it's real. He's that kind of comedian. In this, you know it's not real. You know, it's a similar character to Borat and audience can be disappointed because it's not Borat type of material in humor. So it's too bad that The Dictator features far more gross out gags, than his usual dark, satirical comedy, that could have made it a smart film. Still there is lots of obscenities, and his speech in the end, parody Charles Chaplin in the Great Dictator, but Sacha Baron Cohen was overshadowing everyone and not giving any room for anyone else to be funny. It's still watchable. "The Dictator" has offensive, dirty, and everything you've come to expect from a Sacha Baron Cohen movie and that somewhat works.
7.0~Baron Cohen is back with The Dictator madscientist2787 Sign in Permalink This political farce, which is the third film that Larry Charles and Sacha Baron Cohen have made together, is also their first which is a straight narrative comedy rather than a prank-laden mockumentary. Although Baron Cohen exhibits the same total commitment to his wacky main character as always, this isn't quite on the same level as Borat, but that's only because you can't write anything as outrageous as tricking a rich Southern family into being okay with bringing a bag of your feces back into the dining room. This film is something of an homage and a reversal of Chaplin's The Great Dictator. Whereas Chaplin's film focused on a poor barber impersonating the Hitler-like ruler, Cohen's Admiral General Aladeen is shaved and abandoned in New York City, where no one recognizes him, while his uncle schemes to present his mentally challenged double to the United Nations. There is even an ironic inspirational speech at the end, which recalls the Chaplin classic. The film is very funny and happy to offend. It's dedicated to the memory of Kim-Jong Il, Aladeen plays a Wii shooter game of the '76 Munich Olympics, and tells feminist, organic co-op owning love interest Anna Faris "There's a woman going to school is like a monkey on rollerskates. It means nothing to them, but it's so adorable to us!" Jason Mantzoukas, Ben Kingsley, John C. Reilly, Fred Armisen, Aasif Mandvi and Chris Parnell all have funny supporting roles, and the soundtrack contains covers of pop songs, like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's "The Next Episode" and R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts" sung in Arabic-sounding gibberish.
7.0~Worth a one time watch for the entire movie but a ten time laugh riot for the first 30 minutes eshwarmail Sign in Permalink First 30 minutes is a laugh riot with excellent slapstick gags which fades quickly into forceful physical humor that tries too hard. Often offensive on most aspects like racism, gender bias, religion etc. Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen) is an ignorant, dimwit, stubborn and volatile dictator of Wadiya, an African oil rich nation. When he addresses his nation about his vision to go nuclear, UN imposes sanctions and threatens military strike if he does not address the UN in person. His uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) has a different agenda to kill and replace Aladeen with a double and sell off oil rights. When Aladeen finally decides to go to U.S. to address the UN - Tamir hatches his plan but Aladeen escapes sans his beard and gets rescued by a human rights activist Zoey (Anna Faris) who doesn't recognize him. Rest is about conflicts of his growing feelings for Zoey and his instinct to get back to power. Cohen has an air of confidence around him that let him almost pull this off perfectly. But the film lacks the number of quality gags required which are eventually replaced by sub standard humor that tries too hard. It might not sit well with all audience as it takes pot shots at almost every topic under the sky leaving no races, genders, religions behind. Worth a one time watch for the entire movie but a ten time laugh riot for the first 30 minutes.
4.0~Forced, predictable and inconsistent. anaayesh-8 Sign in Permalink To elaborate, the film really is the group of mistakes that ruins any comedy. It started well, but after about 10 minutes you could predict what's going to happen in any given scene as soon it comes on the frame. I love Cohen's work and I think he's a great comedian but this just isn't funny. This film's makers seem to think that being offensive and disgusting is in itself funny but, unfortunately for them, it isn't . Being offensive and disgusting in itself is just that, offensive and disgusting. I have no problem with offensive language when used in order to be funny, Eddie Murphy excelled at it before he went down the drain, and even Cohen himself did with Borat but this one fails miserably at that and just comes across as a good idea turned bad and then worse. Not recommended at all. Waste of time and talent. 4/10
1.0~Sacha Cohen sinks to a new all time low of comedy. Jimi-22 Sign in Permalink I would normally hesitate to award a 1/10 to any movie, as there is usually some redeeming factor to each production that would warrant it be award SOME merit. Unfortunately, that cannot be said about this movie. Being a big fan of Sacha's early work, in the guise of Ali G (having a slot on the show The Day Today), I was bitterly disappoint at the extremely adolescent and unintelligent 'humor' he has adopted for this movie. I can honestly say that there wasn't ONE amusing moment through the film, from start to end. Your 83 mins would be a well worth spent on something else a lot more productive.... like sleeping. Sorry for the negativity, its just that this movie was utter s***.
3.0~Okay, probably good if you like Cohen bjjnedan Sign in Permalink I must say, this wasn't my favorite. There were some funny parts, but overall, I just don't like Sacha Baron Cohen. Just about all of this movie's supposed funny parts was more like, "What the f*** is he doing?" Hell, the best part of this entire movie was the 5 minutes with John C. Reilly. His very first dialogue was funny as f***! There were some parts, the child birth for example, that were just..., completely unappealing to me. It wasn't the believability, I expected very stupid s*** with this movie, but come on..., I don't know what it was, it just wasn't funny. Of the 83 minutes, there was about 10 of it that even made me crack a smile. John C. Reilly's appearance and part of Cohen's final speech at the U.N. The rest of it was just boring and..., not really disgusting or gross, but more like..., in bad taste.
6.0~Retrospective Reviews- The Dictator (2012) tyreeewebster Sign in Permalink From Sacha Baron Cohen and Larry Charles, the creator and director of the 'Ali G Trilogy' comes the duo's latest comedy effort, 'The Dictator'. In this, a foreign man makes his way to the United States of America for hilarious hijinks... what else is new? I'm serious, the formula that worked for 'Borat' and 'Bruno' doesn't work entirely well in this film, which is completely scripted, unlike the other 2 films. Why does Baron Cohen keep doing the same story? Speaking of the story, it doesn't work 100%. It's one of those comedy plots that need jokes and gags ALL the way through in order to carry it. With films like 'Airplane!' and 'Animal House', it works perfectly, but with this... it fails quite miserably. I'm not saying that the film wasn't funny, because it absolutely was, it's just that some of the jokes fell very flat, mainly because they were based around feces (crapping on people), urine (drinking pee), mocking women (sexism) and an extremely over- the- top "birth" scene, which was truly disgusting and was dragged on for way too long and got less funny as it went on. Some jokes were very funny, but like I said, the story isn't strong enough to make every joke work. But the script is silly and rude at times, so it should get a few belly laughs out of you. Sacha Baron Cohen's performance as Admiral General Aladeen is good, he was funny in this film as the bumbling dictator, he wasn't as charming of a character as Borat, or eccentric and flamboyant like Bruno, but has strong character traits that make him work anyway. He also plays his dimwitted double, and he was okay. Anna Faris was, as always very charming and funny as her character of feminist Zoey was a highlight, and the chemistry between the two characters work to full effect, even if slightly rushed. Ben Kingsley, John C. Reilly and Jason Mantzoukas are all thrown in their as the villain, cameo role and supporting character, and all do a very good job in their scenes. The music by Erran Baron Cohen is cool, but also very annoying, but helps with the mood and tone of the film. So, overall, the film was decent, it wasn't as funny and charming as 'Borat!' or as raunchy and wrong as 'Bruno', but the film is funny in it's own way, the script is very rusty, but it'll take Baron Cohen some time to get used to the scripted side of film- making. Give it a watch and have a good time! 'THE DICTATOR' Directed by: Larry Charles Written by: Sacha Baron Cohen, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer Starring: Sacha Baron Cohen, Anna Faris, Jason Mantzoukas and Sir Ben Kingsley
10.0~The Dictator cultfilmfan Sign in Permalink The Dictator is the new comedy starring and co-written by Sacha Baron Cohen of Borat and Bruno fame. This film unlike Borat, or Bruno is not filmed, or written as a documentary. To say that it is scripted whereas Borat, or Bruno were not, would be a lie seeing as although there was a lot of spur of the moment and unplanned events, as a lot of it was planned and written in the form of a script even though it didn't always feel that way with the first two films. Cohen's comedies really seem to be hit and miss for people mostly for fairly obvious reasons. Borat, was extremely well received and is probably still the best of the three films and it earned Sacha a Golden Globe Award as well as being nominated for an Adapted Screenplay Academy Award. Bruno, I thought was very enjoyable, but it got nowhere near the acclaim, or affection that Borat did. Now we come to The Dictator, which has gotten mixed, but mostly favorable reviews. In this new film like his previous outings, Cohen plays a larger than life character where he completely inhabit's the role and a lot of the humour relies on what most people would consider very offensive remarks and humour. The film's humour to some, would seem racist, homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic and the list goes on and on. I think however, like his previous two films collaborating again with director Larry Charles, that their intention and basically the point of the film, if you can call it that, is to show these types of racism, or intolerance to make people more aware of it in general and perhaps have a laugh about it while watching the film, but at the same time, feeling a little guilty and ashamed at ourselves for doing so. I think the message is clear that Cohen, is trying to shed light on these issues and show just how foolish, or offensive someone could look like, or sound behaving, or acting in this type of way and again to make it more of a highlighted issue, so after the film audiences could talk about it and in some ways be informed about it a little more. There is certainly a message and method to Cohen's madness. Putting that aside, a lot of you are probably wondering if the film is any good, or most importantly, is it funny? My answer to that would be, yes. There were times during the film that some jokes did fall flat and just did not work due to poor comic timing, delivery and writing, but more often than not, a lot of the material here does work very well and provides a very entertaining time at the theatre. Cohen, like in his previous roles seems to have a blast playing this larger than life character and like the other films, he does a very good job of it. Using humour that to some would be ambiguous, or complicated to those not familiar with daily politics and world issues, there is still a lot that would make them laugh, particularly the more crude and scatological type of jokes. However, I particularly found the satirization of foreign policies to even policies of my neighbors in America, to be sharp edged, focused and well played out and written. The more offensive humour is still really funny as well, but in a different kind of way, but to the majority of people, that would be what they are going to see in this film and perhaps miss a lot of the more intelligent humour. I like Cohen's storytelling and his performance and what he is trying to say to the audience with this and his other films. There is a dark side to some of the humour, but especially with this film, I also found there to be a very likable, playful, and dare I say even sweet side to it. There is a relationship that grows out of the film and I think it plays out very well and is in the end both funny and adorable. The Dictator works as an extremely entertaining and hilarious comedy and also works as a satire and voice to shout out to the world the attitudes and intolerances of people that really do need to change if we ever want to go anywhere in life, whether it be a democratic nation, or not and for his message and the brilliant and hilarious way he goes about doing it, The Dictator is another winner for Cohen and company.
1.0~A New Low jackass1057 Sign in Permalink I was expecting this movie to have some sort of the ingeniousness from the previous Sacha Baron Cohen flicks such as "Borat" and "Bruno". Sadly the long-ward down-sloping hill that inevitably would come to the "excessive-stereotype-off-color-humor-genre" that Sacha was producing happened to be a free-fall with a face-first plunge right in the Hollywood industry. Sasha's comedy lives on the exploitation of various kinds of stereotypical and ridiculous events, situations and people. This was originally delivered in "Borat" with some more subtle remarks while still having that over-the-top feeling baked into it. One might even say people could learn a thing or two from that movie due to the way comedy can expose ignorance. In this case you'll end up feeling more ignorant after wards. The crude off-color racist, sexist and childish jokes would appeal only to the simplest movie-viewer in a favorable way to attract American high-school kids. There is some kind of Hollywood-plague-feeling over the whole movie that results in a lot of noise and visual stimulation but absolutely no substance. The story itself is patched together from more or less random political events that anyone with an even remote contact with the world would already know plenty about. Where is the point? Where is the substance? Where is the actual humor? Why would anyone in their right mind think excessive racism and bantering with a plot apparently written by a five-year-old would keep the already dying exploitation-comedy-genre alive? I admit "Bruno" wasn't exactly great, but at least "Bruno" would occasionally make you laugh instead of leaving you with a feeling that feels like you lost several IQ points by watching it. I was honestly so fed up and bored halfway through the movie that i shut it off. I tried my best to finish it but it just couldn't be done. I'm glad i didn't waste my money going to the theater to watch this rubbish. Too bad more people didn't do the same so Sasha can learn something from this train wreck and start producing something new rather than barking up the same old tree to maximize profits. -------- SPOILER BELOW --------- I was gladly waiting for the scene where Aladeen compares America to a dictatorship because that's the only remark which actually has some truth in it. Sadly i couldn't just put up with it long enough to make it that far into the movie. 1/10 Stay away folks, stay away.
6.0~Enjoyable christophe92300 Sign in Permalink You know what to expect when you see Baron Cohen as the lead actor: well developed, quirky characters, and an absurd sense of humour. This is the case here for The Dictator, which is that time not a mockumentary but a "classic" scripted movie. The plot unfolds pretty smoothly; the movie is dense and very dynamic overall without overlong passages thanks to an appropriate duration (~1h30). The humour is noticeable and spot on, like Aladeen's speech on democracy. All in all, Baron Cohen did a great job as always in creating unique, innovative universe and characters.
4.0~Many prejudices and foreign policy propaganda guisreis Sign in Permalink I could just say that this is a comedy full with jokes that, in general, are not funny at all. It would be true, but the truth is even worse. "The dictator" is a predictable film full of prejudices and intended to work as a propaganda of the foreign policy of the United States (even tough at some time it criticizes American politics when the spectator does not expects it anymore). It is simply not nice to make a film just to reinforce prejudice against Middle East in the United States. Poking fun at actresses and actors suggesting that they prostitute themselves is not nice either. Why are torture devices from many Eatern countries and none used in Guantanamo, for example? Why so much criticism about nuclear weapons in Middle East and no concern about them in the United States, the only nation that has already used a nuclear weapon against another country ever. Even the character shown to criticize prejudice, Zoey, is indeed caricature-like. The only great moment of the movie is the speech of Aladeen; it could have been a kind of remake of Chaplin's classic scene for present time. Tough, unfortunately, it happens after the film have taken a completely different path. The coincidence of supporting democracy against dictatorship is only an apparent similarity, as the meaning is completely different in both films.
1.0~Sick and Grossly Inappropriate for sober folks haruwn Sign in Permalink If you get bothered by dirty and sick humor, you'll stay away from this movie or moan on your wasted time and money! There are many cons I'd mention: 1. Racism 2. Religious Prejudice 3. Religion Abuse 4. Poor Cast 5. Dirty and I mean dirty storyline 6. Rubbish dialogues Complete crap. When you watch parody movies like: Vampires Suck, Scary Movie etc. that's a thoughtful item but this is pure junk. Stay Away! Moreover, It's completely inappropriate for family and children. Sick nudism and flashing was made part of every scene that is about to come. There are few place where you'd like to keep pushing to see full movie but when time keeps passing, you get more and more disappointed.
8.0~Hilarious and outrageously far from P.C. Morten_5 Sign in Permalink + Sacha Baron Cohen's outrageous but liberating total lack of political correctness. + The amazingly ridiculous beard of Aladeen. + Anna Faris' and S.B.C.'s unexpected chemistry. + The music and the songs, which are really good and greatly adds to the atmosphere and the humour. - "The Dictator" is not as wonderfully great and funny as "Borat...". Nothing is. Still, you can't help comparing.
8.0~"The Dictator" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in many years. ianrivlin Sign in Permalink I almost split my sides laughing. Yes, it's crude, politically incorrect and trivial but - at the end of the day - it is funny, uplifting and entertaining. I read the fatuous politically correct review by James Berardinelli, who picked holes in this film - but he's got his nose so far up his own "alladeen" that he misses the point... This is a film to make you laugh. People who watch this film expecting to find some wonderful sense of enlightenment will be disappointed - in which case go and see some French film that shows a surly man smoking a cigarette commenting on Life, The Universe and Everything. Watch this movie if you want a belly laugh and don't want to analyse the film with connoisseurs and pretentious twits over multiple glasses of chardonnay and late coffees.... I loved the film. It made me feel good and giggle. It's a shame there aren't more movies like it. The world's miserable enough. We need more inane laughter - it's good for the soul.
6.0~No Borat. But better than Bruno xnoblesoldierx Sign in Permalink I don't particularly like Sacha Baron Cohen. Although I liked Borat and the Ali G interviews. This film is decent. It could've been a lot better. And I mean a lot better. They're making fun of dictators which could've been much better. But as he only is a dictator for a short while in the movie, there really isn't much time to do too much. It's OK. Granted, it does have a few scenes that are hilarious. But it's not consistent with the laughs. Overall, it could've been a lot better but wasn't. While it still provides some very funny moments.
1.0~As bad as Manos or Robot Monster zt650 Sign in Permalink This movie was so idiotic,parts of it were unwatchable.....unfunny,gross with horrible acting...how ben kingsley agreed to do this crap is beyond me!..What a waste of time...Im glad I didn't have to go out to see this garbage....Please someone try to find anything funny in this poor excuse for a movie
10.0~I don;t usually like films of this type. This one was great Raech40213 Sign in Permalink I am not a fan of movies like Borat, or even a Dumb and Dumber type film, or even the scream parodies are dumb to me. My boss paid for us to see this film. Everyone voted and I lost. Or should I say I won. I got to leave work early and laugh the entire film. I am so happy I was forced to see it. I was dreading it all week, and I ended up thinking it was extremely funny. It is not a PC film.... I guess I loved that too, which also surprised me. But it is not gimmicky, not the same old same old, not a shock fest to be one... It is funny! My face and stomach hurt from laughing so much. See it... Adults only. But see it. So happily surprised. I have never seen a film quite like this one. If anyone would have bet me in advance I'd even like it a little I would have lost. I really thought I would HATE it. Yet I love it. See this film and be happily surprised like I was. Absolutely no kids though. It is too adult in humor.
6.0~Sacha Baron Cohen is a Master! namashi_1 Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen is a Master Actor! No two options on that! His range as a performer, is undeniable & indeed terrific. With his latest box-office hit 'The Dictator', Sacha delivers a yet another masterful performance, that exhibits his potential to the optimum. 'The Dictator' Synopsis: The heroic story of a dictator who risks his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed. 'The Dictator' is funny & entertaining, but its obviously not logical. It has moments that are so absurd, that you might feel repulsed, but 'The Dictator' at least stays true to its genre. The Screenplay Written by Alec Berg, David Mandel, Jeff Schaffer & Sacha himself, is funny, but crass & overtly crude, but it never loses pace. Larry Charles's Direction is adequate. Sacha embodies Admiral General Aladeen & is simply masterful in here. A Versatile, Marvelous Actor, who once again delivers beyond expectations. Here's an actor who needs to be taken more seriously. Being so good in a silly film such as this, proves how good he can get in a film that offers a stronger background. On the whole, 'The Dictator' isn't the finest comedy you'd see, but its entertaining nonetheless.
6.0~Same level as Borat... martin_oster Sign in Permalink A lot of the single lines, has already been used at different events during promoting the movie. But I'll still recommend it. It's worth watching a single time. I just came from the cinema, and 300 people in the auditorium were all laughing at the same time. Sacha was all of the worlds dictators gathered in one person, where he use his power as a power extension for a small aladeen. I think it's cool that he dares to use his freedom of speech to make fun of a lot of different countries, both in the middle east and also the US, but at the same time take a moral stand against all the problems in the world. Well, that's my opinion. And he does so in a very funny way. You'll have a fun evening, I promise you :)
8.0~Baron Cohen Channeling Chaplin as a (Close to) Great Dictator... ElMaruecan82 Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen's "The Dictator" (actually directed by Larry Charles) is a movie I avoided ever since its release. I wasn't reluctant because the film supposedly mocked Arab regimes (why should I?) but because it did so at the worst possible context: an Arab Spring that had already made way for many winters. In 2012, many North African and Middle-Eastern countries rode the revolutionary wave but was it for the best... or for the West? Indeed, you might call it cynicism (I'd call it realism), I grew up in an Arab country and often thought an iron fist could be in certain cases be the lesser of two evils, not that it should. But Western countries often made a matter of honor to spread democracy, which is good... but oddly enough, for some dictatorships not reluctant to share their resources, diplomacy always found a way. As for the overall perception of Arabs and Muslims, terrorism and widespread immigration "helping", they always got a rough deal under a relative indifference from mainstream media, I thought "The Dictator" was one of these anti-Arab mockeries and I wasn't exactly in an urge to watch it. But the 2010s are coming to an end, and I'm getting tired of politics and ethnic-centered biases, tired of being angry to put it simply. Retrospectively, it didn't even make sense to avoid the film: I loved "Borat", that's one thing, I'm a huge fan of raunchy, crude, satirical and most of all politically incorrect humor, that's another. Indeed, I didn't criticize "American Sniper" much because of its stance against Arabs but because it took its hostility too seriously, if Sacha Baron Cohen was offensive by being funny, I knew it wouldn't be personal, just "laughing" business. And boy, did I laugh. I laughed. And I laughed again. The film was exactly what I expected, it did make fun of Arabs, not much of Islam which was the smart move, it did exploit the worst possible stereotypes but while swimming in such dangerous waters, it always carried a satirical edge and reminded me of some of the best South Park episode. It was politically incorrect but not untrue. Plus, there was just something irresistible in Baron Cohen's full embodiment of Wadiya's leader General Shabazz Aladeen. You could tell he took that role with the same dedication than Chaplin for "The Great Dictator", except that his target had the 'privilege' to watch his film. Gaddafi was dead at the film's release and was obviously the main inspiration, but the caricature is not too far from other tyrants of the Arab-Muslim world, there are some shades of truth underneath the over-the-top façade, from the arbitrary executions (that reminded me of the King in French animated masterpiece "The King and the Mockingbird") to his sexual exploits with celebrities, from his prima donna tantrums to his personal obsessions (country-wise). Truth or no truth, they're still played for laughs and Ben Kingsley is perfect as the treacherous opportunistic second-in-hand Tamir, he plays it straight and serious, so we know Aladeen is closer to Borat than any of his real-life models. Speaking of "Borat", at the end of my review, I said humor should have no frontiers. I'm not sure a reverse "Dictator" wouldn't have stirred less controversy, but speaking of that one, don't expect me to bash it; I happen to have a sense of humor and it was the funniest film I've seen in a while. Roger Ebert said it's the spiritual successor of "Duck Soup", I thought it was closer in spirit to "The Great Dictator": same plot involving lookalikes and matching the international context, same performance made of gibberish posing for Arabic, same romantic subplot (a more unlikely one with vegan, feminist, eco, LGBT and immigrant-friendly Zoey played straight by Anna Faris) and most of all: same intelligent and inspirational speech. Say what you want about the sexual and scatological humor (perhaps the one digression from Chaplin's spirit) but the climactic speech makes you realize the West (that's a synecdoche) shouldn't be too prompt to give Arab countries lessons of democracy. I won't go as far as saying that Cohen took sides but at least he did something even Eastwood didn't: 'relativizing' and that's what humor is about: seeing things from a different angle. Aladeen might be a ruthless, egomaniac, dictator prone to execute anyone who contradicts his craziest opinions, but his methods prove to be efficient when it comes to manages Zoey's store. What did I tell you about the merits of an iron fist? Still, I appreciate the way Baron Cohen kept the film in the safe side, and didn't make an anti-Arab movie. In fact, once you have a protagonist like Aladeen, the film can't be offensive because he's the central protagonist of a rather traditional narrative: he falls in love, evolves, becomes more tolerant. Like Chaplin's Hynkel, Aladeen is ridiculous, childish and ultimately sympathetic. I think his secret is to be surrounded by characters who act normally, from Tamir to Zoey, not to mention Nadal, his ex-chief scientist played by Jason Mantzoukas. Together they form a hilarious Laurel-and-Hardy pairing and have a great helicopter scene where their Arabic dialogue contain key words as audible as misleading for the American tourists and say a lot about the paranoia induced by September 11. And the fact that he used his Hebrew to pass as Arabic says something about how close the cultures are and I hope the world accept an Arab comedian making fun of Westerners, though I'm not sure Cohen's humor would be welcomed in many Arab countries, some people are too respectful for their own good and maybe should just accept a few bits of irreverence every once in a while. I still believe there are a few double standards here and there but I'm ready to gracefully accept "The Dictator" because it's a product of its time, it is smart at times and hilarious every time.
7.0~Very Funny but the Jokes Goes Way Beyond the Border antoniomagallon90 Sign in Permalink Admiral General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a Wadiyan leader for more than forty years. He wants to develop nuclear weapons for "peace" purposes. Obviously the President of the United States, NATO, and the UN isn't buying it and want to take military action unless Aladeen goes and address the UN council. He goes to New York and not surprising he gets a unwelcome visit due to his dictatorship. He then gets kidnap in the middle of the night by a hit-man (John C. Reilly), who was hire by Aladeen uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley). He shaves his signature beard and somehow he accidentally burns himself to death. Aladeen is now unrecognizable. His "body double" announces that Wadiya is going to be a democratic nation. This is not good news for Aladeen. It's obvious that The Dictator was marked as a straight-up comedy as oppose having a serious plot. Strangely enough the plot is straight forward and makes logical sense most of the time. If anyone wants to take this film very seriously, then you need to reconsider. I'll be honest with you; I have never seen Borat and Bruno, but that doesn't stop me from going to see this movie. The Dictator is funny from the beginning to the end. All of the humor is easy to understand, however not everyone is going to enjoy it due to Aladeen's vicious acts and even sexual humor that goes way beyond the border. For example, Aladeen and Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) "infiltrates" a funeral of a famous civil rights leader. In order to get the beard, Nadal literally chops the head off. This scene is going to offend people, but for my prospective point of view, I think of it as a harmless entertainment. Believe it or not, The Dictators contains political satire. Although it doesn't quite offer it as much as I was hoping for, it works. Aladeen is based off of many well known dictators from the 20th century to the present. It also satires Americans who easily get paranoid with terrorism. For example, in one scene Aladeen and Nadal are in a helicopter with an American couple. The two exchanges with one and another with their language (their language is made up because Wadiya is a fictional nation) and the American couple think that the conversation has to deal with another terrorist plot. This is a good example of how Americans easily get paranoid. The only issue that I had was that it's too short. It's only an hour and twenty five minutes. That is way too short for me. What pay ten dollars just to see a movie that only last a short amount of time? Overall The Dictator is funny and entertaining, but due to the short length of the film, I can't recommend it to see it in theaters. Just wait and rent the movie. Let's hope Aladeen doesn't execute me for not recommending you guys to see his movie. P.S. The opening of the film is dedicated this film to Kim Jong-Il, the leader of North Korea who died in December of 2011.
6.0~I knew it was going to knock Ghadaffi down! petarmatic Sign in Permalink This film was not as good as Borat, but from the moment I left the movie theater I knew Ghadaffi was going to fall from power. I thought he would be smart enough to leave Libiya but he was stupid and stayed to fight. May be it was better for him to die, then to face loss of a country he so lovingly worked hard for democracy not to come to it. As soon as the Americans found out that he really had no weapons of mass distraction he was done for good. Sasha Baron Cohen was excellent in his role of dictator, but not as good as in Borat. Great film to watch, where Libiyan reality convalesces with fiction of a film.
3.0~Are you ready for 9/11 jokes? Quietb-1 Sign in Permalink Starts off with some laughs but gets lost as it seems to try too hard. There are the expected jokes to offend every ethnic group. There are some good moments and more painfully bad moments with bickering characters that just doesn't work. It's hard to imagine 83 minutes as too long but in this case it is way too long. It drags and there are long stretches void of laughs. Too bad they didn't let Cohen jump off the bridge it would have been over sooner. The great poster with the frame around it combined with excellent PR may get comedy fans into the theater but most will walk out disappointed.
5.0~Oh Dear sensorshot Sign in Permalink Whatever you do , do not waste good money going to see, "The Dictator". It is puerile rubbish. I have seen funnier, more original, Carry-On films. It will only appeal to you if you are a racist, sexist, American or under 12 and think poo and willy jokes are funny. Which is Ironic as under 16s are not allowed to see it.. I cannot believe the jokes in this movie actually cleared some kind of production process. If you stuck 5 monkeys in a room and said they had two hours to come up with a comic movie about a Dictator, their jokes would have been far more original and less obvious. I am stunned that this is getting 7 + stars on IMDb. My vote, 5, is generous and even then it's in acknowledgement that some people, like Carry On Fans, have a soft spot for this rubbish. But I think even Sid James would have passed on this tosh.
7.0~A welcome change oxley1867 Sign in Permalink I'm a little perplexed having read a couple of user reviews - one of them said this was movie was unbelievable and unconvincing due to the fact that it had a love theme going on? huh? I suppose the film 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is unbelievable too? In fact, how many movies are believable? 'The Dictator' is a comedy, nothing less and nothing more than that, and that was the intention. Whether it's believable or not is irrelevant. The movie had plenty of laugh out loud moments. I'm glad this movie headed in a different direction from his previous efforts. Had the film continued in the same fashion as the reality TV way, then I don't think it would have stood any chance of working, not with this new character anyway. So to those who are expecting and hoping for something similar to Bruno and Borat you may be left a little disappointed, but for those who wouldn't mind seeing something slightly different, and can take a movie for what it is, then you should enjoy this, as I did.
10.0~Dictator: Manages to make all the rules; The Dictator: Manages to make laugh... a lot! franciscoraposo72 Sign in Permalink The Dictator is a fantastic movie. I've seen several movies this year, like This Means War and some others, one of them was The Hunger Games and I mentioned that The Hunger Games was the best movie of the year, well, now, I take it back. Why? Because I watched The Dictator, an offensive, politically incorrect but it's overall a comedy masterpiece and my 2nd favorite movie. It's hilarious and I laughed my ass off, but don't forget that I have a little regret about that, there's a lot of guilty laughs while you watch it, but, well, it's impossible not to laugh. Sacha Baron Cohen was terrific, he should get an Oscar for his performance, his voice, his beard and his ego were just fantastic, I completely loved his performance, he's a master of comedy. Overall, The Dictator is a spoof to politics, The Dictator is brilliant, it has brilliant jokes and fantastic performances by everyone, The Dictator is the movie of the year, whether you believe me or not, it's highly entertaining and it never fails to make you laugh every minute. This movie has no mature scene, only stupidity but we're still able to love it, The Dictator is a comedy classic and I'll never forget it, besides, it's without a doubt the best comedy/movie I've ever seen since Horrible Bosses. Here's a stupid, but also clever movie. The Dictator is hilarious and I say it again, The Dictator is my 2nd favorite movie and it's also (So far), the best movie of the year. I loved it. 2nd Favorite Movie of All Time. Larry Charles did a terrific job with everything, the director of Borat and Bruno brought (Again) a fantastic R-rated movie with an amazing directing. Sacha Baron Cohen takes the lead as the now iconic character Admiral General Aladeen, his performance was remarkable, he was hilarious and showed us that he was definitely the best person to play this role, I'll never forget his amazing performance and I hope he gets a good award (nomination), Sacha is known from Borat, Bruno and Ali G. Anna Faris was great, her performance was solid and funny, she finally starred in the movie that is neither a Scary Movie nor a bad movie, she was great and a valuable person in this movie's cast, Anna is known from Observe & Report, Cloudy with the Chance of Meatballs and some other movies. John C. Reilly also brings a very pleasant cameo that is enough to still you some laughs, some big laughs, like the racist joke, John is known from Step Brothers, Cyrus and some other movies. The main cast is great but Sacha is really the one who stands out, he was pure genius, but the rest of the cast also delivers good performances and laughs, we have Jason Mantzoukas, Kathryhn Hahn, Megan Fox and Ben Kingsley. Bottom line, The Dictator has a fantastic cast where Cohen has the chance to leave another sample of his giant talent, he was legendary. Terrific cast. Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) is the dictator of the African country Wadiya. But, he's a bizarre dictator, he's slept with thousands of famous people, including Megan Fox, Lindsay Lohan and Oprah, he changed more than 300 hundred words to Aladeen, he always wins the Olimpyc Wadiyan Games and he executes everyone who slightly disagrees or annoys him. Aladeen has to go to America, or UN was going to use military force to destroy Wadiya because of his nuclear program. Now, in America when he's able to escape from a murder attempt to him, he's now trapped in Manhattan with no beard and no one recognizes him. But still, he will not give up from not leaving the democracy coming to his country. (What I thought about the plot) The script is genius, I loved the script, it's just brilliant and don't forget that the characters were amazing, especially Aladeen. Sow, The Dictator's script is not stupid at all... well, it is, but shows the differences between democracy and dictatorship in a great way. The script also has some terrific scenes, like the wire scene, which is just idiotic and hilarious, the sights' helicopter scene, the Olimpyc Games scene and all the others are just amazing. The Dictator was amazingly scripted, it has a fantastic premise, amazing characters and superb details, I also loved the scene where they sort of answer to the question "Who is General Aladeen?" showing everything about his life, which was amazingly written. Terrific plot. Besides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, although it's racist, sexist and it has pee, sex and poop jokes you just can't not like it, this movie is brilliant and hilarious, it's impossible for you to stay a minute in this movie without laughing, it just kept so many jokes for you, hilarious jokes and you can't even believe how much smart jokes there were here. I highly recommend this movie, it's hard to digest but it it leaves you fully satisfied... like it did to me. Sow, The Dictator is definitely my 2nd favorite movie of all time it made me laugh countless times and it gave me the time of my life in a theater, I was fully entertained and I laughed a lot with this R-rated comedy that used the R for good. 10/10
8.0~Vulgar, offensive and scathing- 'The Dictator' sees Sacha Baron Cohen back at his acerbic best, which is also why this is one of the must-see comedies of the year moviexclusive Sign in Permalink Be warned, those of you who thought that the world's sharpest but most politically incorrect comedian was finally shifting his aim away from the United States of A- Sacha Baron Cohen spends less than one-quarter of the time of 'The Dictator' in the fictional North African country of Wadiya. For most of it, Cohen's alter-ego General Admiral Haffaz Aladeen is once again roaming the land of the stars and stripes- specifically the streets of the Big Apple- his skewer specifically aimed this time round at American stereotypes and misconceptions of the Middle East. Indeed, General Aladeen- and for that matter, Wadiya- is constructed with a fair degree of exaggeration out of these preconceived notions. So Aladeen's luxurious beard characteristic of Arabs and the object of racial profiling - think Osama bin Laden- is explained away as his mark since birth; while like two other late despots, Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein, Aladeen is obsessed with self-aggrandisement, going to the extent of inventing his own Wadiyan Games in order to be the champion 14 years in a row. And perhaps most significantly, like the late Kim Jong-il (which the movie opens by dedicating itself to), Aladeen has been building up his own nuclear weapons programme while keeping United Nations inspectors at bay. Despite being an obvious riff on the aforementioned dictatorial figures, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the level of wit that Cohen (who co- scripted the movie with Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer) brings to the film's introduction alone. In particular, a standout moment involves a spot of linguistic confusion between a doctor and a patient who has just been tested for HIV, precipitated by Aladeen's self-conceit in which he changes the national language for 'positive' and 'negative' to his very name. Laugh loud but laugh fast is our advice- for the rapid-fire pace at which the gags are delivered means that you may easily miss the next about Aladeen's sexual conquests or his pettiness about the shape of his nuclear warhead. Under threat of attack, Aladeen makes an unprecedented journey to New York City to address the United Nations- though the visit is really a ploy by his not-so-loyal adviser Tamir (Ben Kingsley) to usurp his power by assassinating him and replacing him with a body double of even lower intelligence. On his first night, Aladeen is kidnapped by his head of security (an uncredited John C. Reilly) whom he outsmarts by revealing a lot more about methods of torture- not in time however to stop Tamir from placing Efawadh on the podium and declaring a new democratic constitution to be signed, opening the door to commerce and more importantly riches for the former. Relying heavily on the fish-out-of-water conceit, the real Aladeen is instead left beardless, penniless and faceless on the streets of New York until a run-in with a left-wing protester Zoey (played by a tomboyish-looking Anna Faris) gives him a chance at a new life. Hilarity ensues as (in his own words) old habits get hard, and get in the way of his assimilation into the nondescript life as a service staff at Zoey's organic food store. An unexpected romance between Aladeen and Zoey also beckons- despite the latter with hairy armpits and barely breasts being a complete opposite from the women Aladeen's used to back in Wadiya. Even more hilarious than their hetero-seen coupling of hands inside the vagina of a pregnant woman about to deliver is Aladeen's reunion with his former nuclear programme head Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas), whom he thought he executed for being disrespectful- with Nadal becoming an surprisingly useful ally in his bid to stop Tamir's attempt of turning his autocratic nation into a democratic farce. One of the funniest sequences of the movie (that thankfully has much more to offer than what the trailer already reveals) shows the pair travelling with an older American couple in a tourist helicopter over Manhattan, their otherwise undecipherable conversation punctuated by suspicious phrases like 9/11, Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty and mock explosions. But aside from taking easy jibes at preconceptions and paranoia (as both of Cohen's earlier creations 'Borat' and 'Bruno' have done), Cohen also makes razor-sharp observations of the proud capitalistic nation of America. "Imagine if America was a dictatorship," Aladeen says, "You could let 1 percent of the people have all the nation's wealth. You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes and bailing them out when they gamble and lose. Your media would appear free, but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family " How different is that from America as it is now? We let you be the judge. Like his earlier sitcom-to-screen creations 'Borat' and 'Bruno', Cohen adopts an outside-in perspective and points out the hard truths about America, aimed mostly at its pride at being a bastion of democracy. Of course, as much as it is incisive political satire, Cohen once again addresses the stereotypes held about people of different minorities, religious affiliations and nationalities- so if you've been offended before by his brashness and insolence, you're not likely to find much comfort here. Yes, he may not be improvising here, but Cohen has lost none of the edge working in yet uncharted waters of scripted comedy. Rightfully, this is Cohen's show through and through, with his outlandish creation consistently engaging and entertaining. Next to Cohen, even A-list actors like Ben Kingsley know better than to get in the way, leaving him to do his usual shtick. At the helm is his frequent collaborator Larry Charles, who reins in the movie at a tight 83 minutes and keeps the pace brisk and punchy. 'The Dictator' won't appeal to everyone, but for those who appreciate his unapologetically offensive brand of scathing humour, this is one of the funniest comedies you'll see this year.
7.0~A Rag-Bag of Jokes, Satirical Barbs and Attacks on Stereotypes l_rawjalaurence Sign in Permalink THE DICTATOR, it has to be said, is an extremely funny film. Sacha Baron Cohen has undertaken the task of attacking those demigods who consider themselves both impregnable and supreme, running their tinpot dictatorships. He is largely successful in his task; his Aladeen comes across as incredibly narcissistic, whose philosophy is simple - execute people first, and ask questions later. The film has him coming to the United States to address the United Nations; this gives director Larry Charles the chance to make some trenchant points about so-called 'democratic' societies which, in their way, are almost as repressive as Aladeen's. Some of the jokes are extremely vulgar, but delivered with an élan that renders all criticism impossible. Ben Kingsley copes well with the thankless task of acting as Baron Cohen's foil, while Anna Faris is a feisty love-interest. Not the most memorable comedy, perhaps, but certainly an entertaining one.
5.0~The trailers are way much better than the movie EchoMaRinE Sign in Permalink Here is the short story of this movie. The trailers are way much better than the movie. From the beginning to the end, the movie is full of jokes but most of them are really not funny. Compared to the previous movies of Cohen, this one is at least worth watching. There was less insult, less adult content, more jokes that everybody can enjoy. The story line was not so brilliant but at least it was coherent. Acting was kind of OK. Considering the trailer was better than the movie, I must say the directing was not so great. Overall, an average movie. It was worth the time I spent but I am not so sure whether it was worth the money I paid.
8.0~Outrageous fun! joonas134 Sign in Permalink Okay first of all, I liked Borat really funny movie. Bruno that was okay, but not so funny. But then "The Dictator" Saw it today, it's outrageously funny to watch with your friends or alone. Cohen is something really "Laugh out of loud" man. Jokes were funny and hilarious to watch some real-life situations. It's not a masterpiece or comedy gold. But really MUST see one, something different by other comedy movies. Overall it's damn good and i like too see it again. Acting was good, outrageously, disgusting jokes, very offensive ones, but laughable. Go see it.
1.0~Very poor in comparison to Borat and Brüno hilary-54 Sign in Permalink I had to force myself to watch this movie to the end (download). I found some of the humour, if you could call it that, absolutely sickening (and I am not referring to the scatological and sexual references). Torture is not funny, overt racism and stereotyping is not funny. There were one or two amusing instances. Not enough though. The dialogue was poor. 90% of this movie filled me with disgust. It was racist, meaningless, with had very little to recommend it. Something has happened to Sascha. He used to take risks in all the other movies he made. This movie is studio material and not really made as a documentary. Does he think he is being dangerous by insulting everything and everyone? I don't think so. SBC. get your act together. I wish I had read some of the more thoughtful reviews before watching. So glad I did not actually buy this movie (I bought Borat), and still find it a killer. The Dictator theme had great potential, but it died in about the first five minutes of dialogue.
7.0~Funny propaganda sofiamiliopoulou Sign in Permalink The movie was hilarious and I had a lot of fun watching it. I didn't find it racist or offensive because the main hero who was racist and offensive towards women, black people, jews, Americans, etc, was not exactly a role model. Since Aladeen is described as evil, violent, racist and sexist his attitude can only be treated from its funny aspect. And my opinion is that it was hilarious. However, I believe that there was also a more indirect message from the movie. A clear propaganda that wants the Arabic countries to attack Israel and terrorise America. Historically I believe that the opposite has happened more often, and those clichés create on overall prejudice and fear of the Arabs. Although Aladeen, the Arab leader, is the one who is obviously offensive, the indirect message of the movie is against him and Arabic countries. Finally I believe the movie was worth to watch, for I had a lot of fun doing so, but we should always reflect on the messages implied.
6.0~GREAT FIRST HALF r-angle Sign in Permalink The first half of this movie is hilarious! Funny and clever and well written. This is the best Sacha Baron Cohen movie I've seen. However, it falls apart in the middle, when the great dictator goes to an organic grocery store and meets a feminist woman. The story logic goes out the window. But the first half is first-rate. Worth a look.
5.0~Making fun of USA again stensson Sign in Permalink Sascha Baron Cohen is once again over there, now as a fictive (or not so fictive) Middle East dictator. This time the whole thing is based on a script. No real life scenes, which he's done previously, satirizing USA. The jokes are often below the belt and what else was to be expected? But there's a little too much of it, like an annoying teenage kid trying to be funny a couple of times too many. Attacking crazy dictators is also a way of kicking open doors in. Cohen's next movie should be more Günter Wallraff-style, mocking with Germany, Israel or why not China? And it should be more real life.
5.0~3 hilarious moments, the rest garbage... deatman9 Sign in Permalink The only reason im giving this a five is because it had 3 moments that really were laugh out loud funny. The rest however was boring and painful unfunny. They make jokes that try to be hilarious and miss the mark completely. This movie is about a dictator of madiya(a fictional country in the middle east). He is a brutal dictator so all his right hand men scheme up a plan to overthrow him and usher in a new age of democracy. Besides for those 3 moments I mentioned above this movie is not funny at all. I loved borat and like bruno and this does not even compare. Cohen should have just made another one like borat and bruno.
7.0~Actually funny bobbyxie1984 Sign in Permalink For those who are offended by this movie, you have no business watching a Sasha Baren Cohen movie. You're probably the same type who thinks Tarantino's movies are just about violence. Sasha Baren Cohen is a Jew playing an Islamic dictator; what were you expecting? I didn't really like Borat and I hated Bruno but this movie was genuinely funny. Sasha once again shows how he can be so offensively funny. Yes, he pushes the boundaries with his comedy and he does go over board a lot of the time but this one was actually done well. This is the type of movie where you'll need to listen to every line spoken because so many jokes are thrown at you at times, it's hard to recognize all of them. Definitely 10 times better than I thought it'd be. LOL even the music is done hilariously. 1 thumb up
8.0~Had me in stitches Troy_Campbell Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen has been hailed by many as a master of comedy. I'm not one of those. Although I thought Borat was hysterical, I found his Ali G and Bruno creations dull and worthy of a chuckle at best. This satire on dictatorship (the hint is in the title) gratefully lands closer to the Borat end of the scale. There are numerous gags that fizzle away, however these are counterbalanced by a plethora of laugh-out-loud moments that had me crying with laughter. Cohen is ballsy, there's no doubting that, and his latest character – the fascist, racist, sexist, homicidal and egotistical war criminal General Aladeen – dishes out jokes that centre on sexual abuse and genocide, among other things, all the while ensuring women and minority groups are belittled at every possible opportunity. Cohen's style of comedy isn't everybody's cup of tea – Bruno certainly wasn't mine – however I shamefully have to admit that The Dictator had me in stitches.
5.0~Some good lines, but not enough kevinmorice Sign in Permalink SBC started as a sketch writer, and that is evident here. There are a lot of good sketches hidden in this film. But trying to tie them together into one movie was too 'untidy'. There isn't enough of Aladeen being dictatorial. The characters aren't deep enough. Nuclear Nadal almost steals the movie and he is a bit part character. There are some good gags. There is some good political comment. The sign/name gag works a couple of times but rapidly reaches family guy levels of pushing a joke too far. Changing words to Aladeen sometimes works (the Katy Perry gag was fantastic) and sometimes doesn't (the HIV scene). The disembodied head is funny but in a cheap and disgusting way that belittles a lot of the smarter work elsewhere. The climactic speech about American democracy is hilarious, but unfortunately I think a lot of the audience I was in with didn't really understand the irony. All in, it is worth seeing once, but I wouldn't go again.
1.0~An Absolutely Horrible and Disrespectful attempt to remake Chaplin's The Great Dictator maudelynn13 Sign in Permalink I found this movie just offensive on so many levels. The thing that just disgusted me the most is what I will deal with here. He blatantly, and very obviously, ripped off The Great Dictator and replaced all the grace and beauty in Chaplin's original with crass, crude, and very lowest common denominator gags. And that enlightened, oh so amazing speech he gives at the end of the movie? Watch Chaplin's original to see what the real thing sounds like, and how beautiful and moving it is. This is just a really awful, disrespectful abuse of a true genius's work by someone arrogant enough to think no one would realize it was a complete rip off, and a bad one at that.
5.0~All Hail Borat thesar-2 Sign in Permalink The Dictator definitely had its moments. Want to see them? Watch the trailer. I'm kidding, of course. There are more in the movie, itself and the more I think about it, since I've seen this movie, I laugh a little extra. I also admire the man who completely and utterly mocked the horrible dictators, dead or alive, of the world. Sacha Baron Cohen has already won my heart with his spoof Mockumentary characters Borat and Bruno, but here he literally spits in the faces of such evil men. Who wouldn't give him a high-five for that feat? That said, The Dictator isn't a great movie, but it's an enjoyable enough film of said Dictator who goes from riches to rags in New York City and "learns" about compassion along the way. And along the way, for us viewers, that is, we just get multiples of sketches strung together to make up the running time. There really is a thin straight-line plot, but for the most part you will, as stated, just see scene after scene of things the writers find funny. You might, as well and Cohen does keep it lively in his never-faltering portrayal of a bad, bad man. Normally, I don't include movie quotes in my reviews, but this one line is worthy of anyone seeing this and I will leave you on this as there's not much more to say about this movie: "Why are you guys so anti-dictators? Imagine if America was a dictatorship. You could let 1% of the people have all the nation's wealth. You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes. And bailing them out when they gamble and lose. You could ignore the needs of the poor for health care and education. Your media would appear free, but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family. You could wiretap phones. You could torture foreign prisoners. You could have rigged elections. You could lie about why you go to war. You could fill your prisons with one particular racial group, and no one would complain. You could use the media to scare the people into supporting policies that are against their interests." - Aladeen
8.0~Better than Borat but not as funny. cel-petrini Sign in Permalink The best part about The Dictator is also what holds it back. Most Cohen movie lovers(that are sane) will rate Borat as his crowning achievement, which means all other movies will be judged with bias. The Dictator stands alone in that the entire movie is scripted, thus the funny moments, though plenty, are carefully positioned in between moments of actual plot. The movie uses cameos, stills and references to many celebrities and politicians in a very humorous (Canadian spelling) way. Another thing Cohen did well was his trailers, there was very little similarity from what was shown on TV to what was shown on the big screen. Overall, it was a great improvement over his last movie Bruno and on par with Borat. PS: Stay for the credits there are lots more laughs.
1.0~Don't waste your time. farhannyc Sign in Permalink Sasha Cohen is old news. The movie had a cheap comedy. If you will laugh at anything then its not bad. I rather go to sleep. The movie has no sense of direction. The actors are C- storyline is weak There are some funny line here and there. Borat was excellent, however this was disappointment. The Ali G show was great when it came out. This was a continuation of The Ali G show.There was a lot of racism and typical stereotypes but most were overplayed. This movie was probably done in Sasha mind in a 5 minute dream. I am glad i did not pay to watch this movie. I guess when he spilled the ashes on Ryan Seacrest this was a sign how bad his movie was. He is a great actor, I commend him on his work in other movies, but this movie was for amateurs.
6.0~Offensive but funny philipjcowan-119-646602 Sign in Permalink This film is crass, stupid, offensive, childish, crude, and very very funny. It is if Team America and There is Something About Mary both got drunk, ended up in bed together and this is their brat of a kid out in the streets of New York running wild. There is something here to offend everyone, but it is especially offensive to anyone from the Middle East or Muslim. You could argue that Sacha Baron Cohen is making some point about the West's regard for Middle Eastern dictators, but I suspect he just wants to make the audience laugh and so produce a box office success. A guilty pleasure.
10.0~Surprisingly very funny aboka-481-578437 Sign in Permalink After Bruno I was not expecting too much from this film, but it delivered laughs in spades. My family had fun watching it. The movie had searing political satire and hilarious slapstick comedy. Some of it was pretty twisted, but was so outlandish it avoided being offensive. I don't see why anyone would watch the unrated version of this movie, surely many of the best parts would be missed. You have to abandon all seriousness when you walk into this movie. Cohen has really gone after some of humanities idiotic inconsistencies and after what happened a few days ago in Benghazi over an equally silly film, people need to realize this is what it is, humor.
3.0~So much worse than Borat! katya-91 Sign in Permalink I was really surprised when I first saw the trailer, as Borat is one of my favourite crazy comedies. I didn't have amazingly high expectations, but I was looking forward to a movie that will make me laugh. It did make me laugh..probably in 15% of the film. The acting was ridiculously bad, the accent sounded really fake to me. Anna Faris and Sacha Baron Cohen really disappointed me as their characters were not even close to convincing. The jokes were at times very stupid and illogical to the scenes, so most of them did not make me laugh. Looking back at Borat, I remember laughing out loud through the whole movie and here, the Dictator did not deliver the same performance. Anyway, I would not recommend anybody spend their money on the Dictator as it will simply not make them laugh. Watch Borat if you have never seen it.
10.0~Excellent mihkelm1 Sign in Permalink I wish there were more comedies like that - crossing over the political correctness line, but not over the line of good taste, so as to make a movie hard to watch. The film is quite pointy, it is for a moderate audience and will make all kinds of extremists quite unhappy. The plot is well thought out and funny. It'll nail you to the screen. I like the unorthodox character of this film, Sacha Baron Cohen's movies are definitely one of the kind. I wouldn't consider the humor crude, but it is certainly honest. Some of the unthinkable things you see are likely to have happened in reality.
4.0~Fails to leave any impression sledgehammer86 Sign in Permalink Hm, disappointing. Sure, I did not expect a high culture movie from Sacha Baron Cohen, but Borat was a pleasant surprise. While Bruno was somewhat disappointing too, I got my hopes up for two reasons. The first was reading this was to have more of a story as well. The second was the surprisingly memorable performance by Baron Cohen in Scorsese's Hugo. But The Dictator is merely a chain of sketches stitched together to form a story. This would not be a problem if most of it was funny (see Borat), but there is too little material which is of good enough comedic value. Bruno was disappointing, but at least successful in its uncompromising bad humour. This leaves no impression at all.
8.0~It's not Cohen's best but it's still enjoyable. Christian_Dimartino Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedic genius, lets face it. I know a lot of people who can't stand him, and I respect their opinion. But he does what most funny people wouldn't. He goes to the extremes. Apparently, while filming Borat, the police were called on him about 30 times. That is something that nobody else would do.His latest comedy, The Dictator, isn't like his previous two. It is not him going around and tampering with America, which is sort of what takes the fun out of it. But I still laughed a lot, even if some laughs are better than others. This time, his character isn't from his show The Ali G Show, it's a brand new character named General Aladeen. He's a dictator from some country called Wadiya, which I'm pretty sure is fictional. When he visits America, he is almost killed and has his beard shaved, making him unrecognizable. So he must now live among the citizens of New York, while he tries to get his job back. The Dictator has some very funny moments, and it's great to have Cohen back. What I like about Cohen's comedies is the length. Cohen tells as many jokes as he can, and gets out of there in a mere 80 minutes. Some comedies ramble on and on, but he just backs out as soon as possible. That's a technique that other funny dudes should take. Can I put The Dictator on par with Seth McFarlene's Ted or David Wain's Wanderlust? Absolutely not. But it is one of the funniest movies of the year. But a part of me felt like it's missing something. I guess I'm just used to Borat and Bruno. This isn't as good as those either, but I still say see it. B+
5.0~So desperate to offend and be controversial that it forgets to be funny MovieGeekBlog Sign in Permalink Heralded by a strong marketing campaign that makes it sound as the most controversial movie since the last temptation of Christ, The Dictator is a strange hybrid. It is certainly not what the trailers makes it look like, nor is as innovative as Sacha Baron Cohen's best work (well... so to speak... I guess I'm referring to Borat, which is no masterpiece but at least it felt new at the time). I call this a strange hybrid because in trying to be both controversial and a crowd- pleaser, rude and cute, clever and silly, in the end might just dissatisfy pretty much everyone. This time the documentary style from both Borat and Bruno has been abandoned in favour of a more straight forward and linear structure. But while there are undoubtedly some inspire puns and good ideas here and there (right from the start the mother dying in child-birth), the story (or rather lack of one) is so idiotic and pedestrian that leaves those few good jokes too exposed and definitely not enough to keep you engaged even if the overall length movie is pretty short. Believe me, I'm all in favour of good satire and I'm certainly not one of those who claim we should not joke on delicate issued like racism, xenophobia, terrorism and Arab (or Western) stereotypes and preconceptions. If it's done with a purpose and if it's clever, it can be as sharp as a knife and quite effective. Sadly here, you can just see sporadic glimpses of what this film could have been, had it not fallen into the trappings of a thin love story. Four Lions tried it last year: it was not completely successful, but it was a noble attempt. Here, the satirical edge of the Dictator is too diluted among cheap slapstick and unnecessary interludes, extraneous to the central message (the masturbation sequence for example, rude for its own sake, was just cheap and unfunny in my book, just to mention one... Just being rude for the sake of being rude should really not be the purpose of such film. Leave that to Apatow). The Dictator was so desperate to offend and be controversial that it forgot its main purpose: to be funny. In the end it just fell flat. This is certainly not Dr Strangelove, but it's not South Park or Team America either. It's just a collection of gags, some more successful than others; a sort of modern-day (and more polished and slick) Kentuky Fried Chicken (and let's not forget that even that one is NOT a good movie!).In theory there is nothing wrong comedies made up with a series of gags all stringed together by a silly story. Look at Airplane! But at least on that one the gag rate was so fast that all you did is laugh... here the laughs are too few. At the end of the day, the proof is in the pudding: I was in a half-packed theatre surrounded by what I suppose must have been the core audience for this type of product (a 20-something crowd) and the silence that welcomed some of the supposedly funny jokes was deafening: a clear sign that I was not alone in feeling sorry for a film that is just not as clever as it thinks it is... wp.me/s19wJ2-2005
6.0~It's SO over-the-top... and I really enjoyed it!!! jaxbubba Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen's newest persona, "The Dictator", has to be, by far his most politically incorrect individual/character to date. This film's leading character is so blatantly disrespectful and uncouth, that it's so incredibly comical to hear the words that are actually being spewed from his mouth. To take this film serious for even one second would be depriving yourself the genius that is this movie; however, if that was not the intention of this film, then every copy should be gathered up and burned, because it's just that offensive to OH SO MANY!!!!! If you have an opinion on any one or perhaps several political agendas, then I can almost guarantee than you will become very offended sometime throughout this film. I just chuckled, and kept watching. It was actually mesmerizing and almost hypnotic with every slanderous/bigoted statement, I was saying to myself, "OMG, he didn't just go there" and the comments just kept coming, and coming, and coming. To the point that the lunacy/obnoxiousness, became quite hilarious, and you were sitting there just waiting for the idiot ("The Dictator") to say sometime even more over-the-top, more insane, more ridiculous, more ludicrous than his last statement. I have to admit that I found the film very entertaining. Aladeen (Cohen) is the dictator of the oil-rich country of Wadiya. He is self-centered, egomaniacal, ruthless, hypersensitive and overbearing. He rules his country with an iron fist; however, when he comes to America to address the United Nations council, he is kidnapped and replaced with a simpler, dim-witted impostor. His trusted and loyal head of security, Tamir (Ben Kingsley), has plans to turn Wadiya into a Democracy, and simultaneously strip-mine the country of all its natural resources for a price of course. Aladeen is befriended by Zoey (Anna Faris), a local tree-hugging, vegan, hippie protester; who just so happens to also have the contract to cater the Wadiyan meals while they're in NYC. Plot of the story is too predictable; you already know what's going to happen in this film before you press play on your DVR/DVD player. But it's the Sacha Baron Cohen character, it's the goofy soundtrack of all the songs that you know by heart; however, sung in Wadiyan, it's sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for the next preposterous statement to be uttered, that is why you are watching this film. DEFINITELY NOT FOR EVERYONE!!!! However, if you are NOT easily offended, then by all means take a chance on this film. It's not as good as Borat, but way better than Bruno. If you are a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's humor, then you will enjoy this film. However, if you are not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, then this film will definitely not convert into being one.

1.0~The Dictator 2012 review drblagger Sign in Permalink In the words of Comic Book Guy "worse film ever" , its badly written you can tell its been scripted by a teenager with a crayon and not a lot of free time with predictable stereotyping of 3rd world dictators blatantly replicated the countries ending with -stan .If you read this review before you watch the film then take it from me Don't cause its 1hour forty six you will waste of your precious life and you will never get back. The acting quality is very poor especially from Sacha Baron Cohen and even from Sir Ben Kingsley i know even I'm shocked that distinguished actor Ben Kingsley would get involved in poor film.
5.0~No satire and not enough humour davidgee Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen's take on the late and unlamented Colonel Qaddafi makes for a hit-and-miss movie that misses more than it hits. As General Alaldeen's Machiavellian adviser Tamir, Sir Ben Kingsley looks mighty uncomfortable at being in this schlock, as well he might. There are some un-PC observations (racist, homophobic, anti-feminist, anti-vegetarian - you name it, Sacha trashes it) but the threadbare plot and scenes that fall flat leave THE DICTATOR floundering for much of its 90 minutes. Funny moments and one-liners are not enough: a comedy needs sustained scenes of hilarity and THE DICTATOR has hardly any of these. The humour targets pre-teens and the frat-house mentality. In BORAT and BRUNO Baron Cohen entertainingly satirized bigotry and intolerance in the US; now that he's playing a bigot, satire and entertainment go out the window. American Reunion, two weeks ago, was rude, crude, well-scripted and generally funny. THE DICTATOR is rude, crude, poorly scripted and nowhere near funny enough.
5.0~This Movie Having Good Reviews IS* the Joke! ravensteals Sign in Permalink The only funny thing about this movie - are the raving reviews of people who thought it was funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ... Sacha Baron Coen wrote this movie as: a joke! He is now reading all these *Good reviews of his *Terribly unfunny film and he is laughing his socks off! No Brit is going to be impressed by this film... and he knows it... He is laughing reading IMDb reviews! The Joke is on the public for sure... I think it was his evil plot all along - to make a terrible movie and then laugh at all the people who laughed... I still love him though! Even if he is totally taking the Mickey! He can't help himself... He is famous enough now to get away with it.... LOL
8.0~Good Comedy sarabjit_cse Sign in Permalink Well, writing anything about the story of the movie in the review is considered a spoiler. I would avoid that in any of my reviews. If you are looking for a surprise so stop reading reviews and just watch the damn movie. Its a lightweight comedy, a refresher about the term "Dictatorship". "Living in a meshed up Democratic country I sometimes wish if there could be a dictator who could just come and rescue us." Oops sorry back to movie, it starts with the insight about the life of a Dictator in a simple \ funny way, and as you travel further, the rest of the movie makes him realize his other better self. The jokes will keep on coming in between and keep you smiling every now and then. Some of them might seem uncalled for but I still found myself laughing either openly or deep within. Also the Jokes were unique, and not lame. But I can bet not all people will like this movie, and I'm talking about people of different age and not of different background! So a word of caution if you are going to watch this movie, go with open mind and keep all you know about racism, dictatorship etc aside. You will find a reason to smile and enjoy this movie. The ending is even more charming and with a little sweet twist. I have my reasons to like it besides all the Dirt\Wittiness\Racism.. blah blah.. if you can, go watch it its a good comedy after-all..
1.0~This doesn't deserve any stars motown425 Sign in Permalink The most crass, crude movie I've ever seen! No redeeming features....not one. I can't believe any of the "actors" would lower themselves to do such a movie as this, and that money was spent on the making of it. There is no talent or creative ideas....just the lowest "humor" I've ever seen. It touched on every subject that would be offensive/hurtful to someone....war, 9/11, murderous dictators, abuse of women, masturbation, eradication of Israel, homosexuality, etc. There was nothing to laugh at in the entire movie.....it is junk. Don't waste your time or money watching it. It's truly the worst movie I've ever seen.....honest.
6.0~Entertaining josh_lambert1991 Sign in Permalink This film doesn't hit the heights of other Sachs baron Cohen movies but still has some funny moments to make it worth a watch
5.0~Calling the kettle? indiarock Sign in Permalink *Perhaps the film can teach people about the reality of life about many women in the world who suffer from men's control and ignorance that prevents many women from constructively contributing to society but are unable to 'enjoy' it as a result of a male dominated materialist capitalist world. *BTW. Not to minimize previous posted reviews but it would help if spelling and grammar are correct. It would give more credibility.

1.0~lies and funny ahmedgaber-79321 Sign in Permalink A lot of misinformation and foolishness in this film first by claiming that America seeks to spread democracy but the fact that it supports dictatorship The film shows Israel that it is oppressed but the fact that it occupied and killed the people of Palestine In addition to the distortion of Islam, which is the religion of justice and distortion of Muslims and arabs who are trying to get rid of the dictatorship supported by America
6.0~The supreme leader abcvision Sign in Permalink Sasha Baron Cohen comes back with his parody of real life melodrama in The Dictator. In this tale, the absolute supreme leader of Wadiya, General Aladeen is desperately seeking to have his own nuclear warhead. He is simply trying to keep up with his fellow dictators. He is so ruthless, that anyone that disagrees or literally crosses him will at a simple sign get their "head chop". On a journey West to speak before the UN, General Aladeen gets caught in an unfortunate mishap that pops him out of his own security bubble. Then the odyssey begins as he deals with discovering his identity and managing to win the girl, regain his post, and fight for his beloved people. The movie does have some funny scenes but at times is too predictable and the talented Cohen opts to take the plunge to low brow crude comedy to get a cheap laugh. This movie is dedicated to the loving memory of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong 'Il.
6.0~Forgive and Forget, LOL paulina-wardani Sign in Permalink The point of this movie is, it has no point. Put your brain aside, and your logic too. If you're a moslem from a moslem country, please don't take it seriously. And if you are not, also don't think that's how things run in moslems countries. This is pure entertainment and this movie is perfect to watch with your buddies, over some beers and snacks. There are some scene which are way overdone, too long that made the scene less funny, but it's OK. You will forgive it and forget it. Just like the movie itself. There is surprise cameo of ... and that's kinda cool moment. Good dude gone 'euw' kind of cameo. Don't worry there are some gross things in store enough to make you say yuck. Or gigantic breasts and some hot chicks doing pointless scenes. Come on, it's typical. It's not as original as Borat. Not the best comedy of the year. Not even the best performance of comedic cast ensemble. But then again, forgive you have logic and forget you have brain, and you'll have a good giggles here and there.
3.0~Over the top, ultimately un-funny flick. Trepanist Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed Borat, but this movie is awful. The jokes go on too long and end with little payoff. It's the a sign of sloppy writing when most of your jokes just go for the extreme/insane. I know that's his schtick, but it doesn't work scripted like this. The only part I really liked was the U.N. speech at the end. I wish the rest of the movie was as insightful as this scene. I hope he returns to the edgy reality based comedy that worked the first time, but I guess he's too famous for that to work now. Maybe he's a one trick pony, or maybe he just needs to refine his art. M. Night Shamalan was good for a while at least.
4.0~The Tasteless Dictator cultjones Sign in Permalink There is no denying that Sacha Baron Cohen is an immense talent and the fact that he attended Cambridge is a testament to his intelligence which, when combined with his comedic prowess, makes him a dangerous talent. With that, and the previews of The Dictator, I prepared for an amusing couple of hours while simultaneously trying to block out the stain that was Bruno. Sadly, The Dictator was such a disappointment that I struggled to finish it. The plot was passé, the jokes cheesy and it was mostly about shocking the audience. You can't help but wonder how an icon such as Sir Ben Kingsley would've signed up to be in such a farce! Then again, I guess you would have to ask the numerous cameos the same. Yes, there were moments where I did laugh and some of the jokes were witty but they were few and far between. In fact at one moment when the racist bodyguard, played by John C. Riley, is about to murder Cohen's character at the start, I actually wished he did so we could be done with the movie! Perhaps one needed to be stoned to appreciate the humour or maybe I just didn't get it. If you're a fan of the Scary Movie franchise and Bruno, perhaps The Dictator is right up your alley.
8.0~Sasha Boron Cohen's dictatorship in shock humor continues to reign diac228 Sign in Permalink The Dictator suffers from a crazy case of multiple personality disorder. On one hand, it can be quite smart—as its fast-paced subtle political humor flies over the heads of most the audience not as involved in the world of American elections—and has a funny yet feasible evil plot that loosely imitates real world activities. Basically involves a secretly overthrown dictator trying to win back the crown before an imposter totally changes the government of the oppressed country involves. And just wait until you see the sharp double-sided slap in the face to American politics. On the other hand, it can be quite stupid with some crazy and sometimes utterly random humor—and some of it will definitely make you cringe. On one hand, the movie has a bit of tenderness and heart that you just won't find in Cohen's previous works that victimize celebrities and practically anyone in his wrath. The story has some structure and even has a mild dosage of catharsis. On the other hand, we still have the same unstructured crude humor that put Cohen and Larry Charles (The director) on the map with some sequences that range from bizarre to downright hilarious. If you couldn't survive the nature of Borat and Bruno, then you'll probably have trouble with this film as well. So on one hand, The Dictator fails to truly shine as a comedic gem in the way Borat delivered years ago because it was usually too smart for its crude humor, while sometimes being too crude and lowbrow to be spitting some political commentary in subtle and unsubtle manners. But on the other hand, it's Sasha Baron Cohen and he will carry this picture and deliver laughs by any means necessary, and I mean ANY means necessary. Cohen is like Jim Carrey in the 90s—flippin' crazy, risking plenty to entertain, and yet in the midst of the insanity carries enough heart and soul to make you truly care and root for the protagonist every time. The Dictator is Cohen's movie, and he pulls off an excellent performance that allows you to merge past the film's flaws ranging from the inconsistency to the rushed muddled ending. So if you are searching for a good time, then The Dictator will provide, granted you can tolerate its incessant range of humor and timing of said humor. The Dictator aimed very high and very low; which will result in you laughing, nervously chucking, cringing, and during some of the better segments, nearly in tears.
1.0~Worst film of all time darren-153-890810 Sign in Permalink I never thought I'd see the day when one of England's finest and most daring comics completely sells out to the masses. But that's what Sacha has done. The film is made for the Eastenders generation, I'm not really into politics but even I felt insulted by the plot and the absolutely woeful obvious gags. People falling over, poo jokes, I mean, come on, surely. THIS FILM IS NOT FUNNY. There should be a warning in the opening credits. The girl (little boy) is one of the most pointless stupid dim characters I've ever seen on the big screen. I've never walked out of a film but was very close. My friend and I were actually laughing at how rubbish it was. In fact, hardly anyone was laughing in the audience. I can't see how this film has had some excellent reviews, I can only guess that they like Eastenders too! Simply horrific and a complete waste of money and time.
5.0~The Dictator (2012) SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen drops the documentary format, which is for the best after the awful Bruno. This time he brings as the character if General Aladeen, a dictator of a made-up country. On a trip to the US he is kidnapped, robbed of his beard and replaced by a lookalike. The film has some funny moments, but most of the time it just falls flat. The plot itself is quite refreshing, as the protagonist is an evil dictator that is trying to stop democracy in his country. Luckily Cohen enthuses his performance with enough charm and tongue in cheek moments that he is likable, even though he references rape and abusing little boys. Obviously Cohen isn't trying to give us a realistic performance. Some of the lines are funny, especially a speech that tells America how great a dictatorship is. A couple of A list cameos in self-deprecating roles are also much appreciated. The film just doesn't manage to shock as much as it should, nor does it have enough clever laughs. You can predict a lot of the jokes and Aladeen offends so many people it loses all effect after the first 30 minutes. Enjoyable enough in some parts, I wish I had seen the shorter theatrical version.
3.0~"The Dictator" is more of the same from Cohen americanentertainmentrep Sign in Permalink "The Dictator" opened early to avoid the Friday rush. I guess Sacha Baron Cohen and his crew thought people would see this movie first. There were 10 people in the theatre I was in, so that theory didn't work. This film stars Cohen as the dictator of a fictional African country. He is summoned to the United Nations to explain his human rights violations and walks right into a plot to overthrow him and bring democracy to his land. The problem with this movie is that--whether he is the Dictator, Borat, or Bruno--Cohen recycles many of his jokes. In this case, the new ones aren't that funny. This is one of those films where if you have seen the previews, you have seen the best jokes. Once again we are subjected to gross sex and potty humor and a quick shot of Cohen's genitalia put in for no reason other than to shock the audience. I was curious if it was really his or a stunt penis. This movie does have some funny stuff. Some of the palace scenes are clever, as is his arrival in New York. It all leads up to a speech in front of the UN that is funny and a great social commentary. But that scene, the great actor Ben Kingsley (sinking to a new low) and cameos by Horatio Sanz, Megan Fox, Fred Armisen, Garry Shandling, and Chris Parnell can't push this film anywhere above a mediocre 2 out of Fordyce. Credit Check: Nothing occurs at the end of this film, so escape as soon as it is over. Post a Comment | Share Article
3.0~Great trailer, mediocre movie good-decision Sign in Permalink They should have hired the guy who wrote the trailer to write the movie. I didn't find it funny.. only a few and sporadic moments here and there, and most of them are in the trailer anyway. I am not sure why the writers had to spoil a perfect canvas for comedy to take the story from political satire about a dictator to some mushy love story that insults the intelligence of anyone watching. What a disappointment. They had all the potential to make something that can knock your socks off but they resorted to stuff that reminded me of House Bunny. No surprise she was in both movies. So, if you find House Bunny, Waterboy, and other crap/fart/accent jokes funny, knock yourself out. If you were hoping for something a bit above the waist line, seriously.. don't bother.
7.0~It's a comedy... thierry-jamie Sign in Permalink I had quite low expectations going in but in my opinion it was much funnier than Borat or Bruno (and yes, a comedy like this should pretty much only be judged on how funny it is) and had the entire audience laughing out loud quite often. Overall, I think it got better as the film went on, but there were moments throughout. If you're mildly sensitive, there were only two parts I found offensive - one joke about the Munich Games Israeli athletes and one reference to Saddam's war crimes. Also, if you go and watch it stay until the black screen and credits come up as some of the 'outtakes' are also quite funny. Aladeen Motherfvkkers!
6.0~I'm at a loss as to how to describe this movie. mtuspersonal Sign in Permalink I went to see this movie with my friend. I would consider that we both have a good sense of humor and are open to all sorts of jokes. I have seen other movies by Sacha Baron Cohen, like Bruno and Borat. I found Borat to be hilarious, but Bruno was a bit over the top for me. This movie strikes a balance between the two, but leans more towards (my personally favored) Borat side. The comedy in this movie is both hilarious and uncomfortable at times. It has the same LOL- quality as it did in Borat, but there are scenes where the comedy is so crude that it is almost uncomfortable watching/listening to it. The movie is definitely funny, but you will not enjoy it if you do not find jokes about racism and stereotypes funny. The plot is your typical Sacha Baron Cohen plot; a person from an entirely different culture travels to America and you watch how incompatible the two cultures are. Also, just like most of Sacha Baron Cohen movies, there is a love story intertwined. It's not the dramatic and sensitive kind of love story though. The plot itself is not very immersive, and I believe that its only purpose is to lead you to the funny parts. I will say this though, the ending speech of this movie given by 'The Dictator' really impressed me. It made me realize how well Sacha Baron Cohen understands politics and stereotypes. You have to hear it for yourself. If you're looking for a movie with consistent but crude laugh-out-loud comedy, but do not look for a serious and powerful plot, then you will enjoy this film. On the other hand, if you cringe at racist and stereotype jokes, you will be covering your ears virtually the entire movie. Approach with an open mind.
2.0~Mr Cohen your time is up. action-man101 Sign in Permalink Weak script, poor acting and unfunny gags sink this turkey from Britain's bad boy of comedy. Cohen made his name as a brave edgy comedian who took risks and poked fun at the establishment. Ali G was a great TV creation and Borat was one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Even Bruno had several very funny moments. But this movie seems a movie too far for him and he appears to be running on empty now. I'm all for toilet humour and tasteless jokes but The Dictator just isn't funny. Comedy is all about timing and Cohen's was well off. There appeared to be a pause after every unfunny joke as if Cohen was waiting for people to laugh. Even his accent was poor. The film has a couple (literally) funny one-liners, Anna Faris tries her best, but that's about it. The birthing and zip wires scenes were particularly excruciating as was the needless joke about raping boys(?). The scene where Cohen is kidnapped by a rogue CIA agent who attempts to torture him is spectacularly unfunny and embarrassing, it's as if a 7 year old thought up the gags. No one in the cinema laughed at all during the film. Perhaps some teenage boys who failed all their school exams might find it funny but I doubt anyone else will.
10.0~Timepass or Pass? Its a Super Timepass for me! pushpinderbagga Sign in Permalink Before I went in the cinemas, I was sure of one thing - either this movie was a full time pass or a pass for me - nothing in between. It came out to be a good surprise super time pass and I enjoyed it a lot. Of course, as goes with earlier movie most of the good scenes are already shown in the trailer but this one sure has more than just what was shown in the promos. Timely punches were able to bind the movie together and keep me interested. Ben Kingsley is so damn perfect for these cunning roles - similar to one done in Prince of Persia. I would suggest, go see this in a Sunday morning and have a good week ahead!
7.0~A lot of bad taste jokes...yet funny. 72.5+% dfle3 Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen plays Admiral General Aladeen, the eponymous dictator of this comedy. from the fictional nation of Wadiya, in North Africa. Like his peers, he is suspected of having nuclear weapon ambitions. After an attempt on his life, he has to live incognito in the U.S. whilst scheming to retake control of his country after the successful machinations against him. This is a return to Sacha's movie debut form, "Ali G indahouse", insofaras as it is a narrative movie, without the mostly unscripted interactions with non-actors. Whilst that first movie was disappointing precisely for that reason (the "Da Ali G show" television series was often hilarious for his interviews with people unaware of his comedic intent), here it works better. I found myself laughing aloud throughout the movie. The few flat spots in this movie arise when the movie takes on a more conventional Hollywood narrative form. It's when Sacha is vulgar and offensive that the film is a lot of fun. That being said, this movie won't win any new fans for Sacha. If you didn't like Sacha's more unscripted outings - "Borat" and "Brüno" - then try this one on for size. One actor who competes with Sacha for laughs is - I hope I have the right name here - Fred Melamed, who plays the Head Nuclear Scientist (the movie has two of these...I have in mind the one who rides in a helicopter with Aladeen when he is in the U.S.). His no-nonsense dialogues with Aladeen are often funny (in a way the non-actor Americans in the US version of "Da Ali G show" were not). Anna Faris as Zoey is the butt of some of Aladeen's jibes, which can be funny. Presumably Sacha's Aladeen beard prop doubled as her armpit hair...two props...one for each armpit. If you have a nervous disposition, it might do to avoid this movie...there are some 'gross out' moments here! This movie is nice and nasty in turns. I particularly like Aladeen's final speech to the U.N. as to why the U.S. should consider being a dictatorship. The irony was not lost on me! Random points: * There is an end credit for something - along the lines of - "astounding use of technology", with Isla Fisher named. Wikid her...yes, she is Sacha's wife. Got me wondering what that credit means...there is a scene of childbirth in this movie...gosh, was that internal shot of Isla? Very accommodating of her if that's the case! * The end credits also mention a "physical comedy consultant". Are there "verbal comedy consultants" too? * Incidental music is fun too...Arabesque versions of "9 to 5" and "Everybody hurts". Someone related to Sacha has a musical credit in this movie too. * "too soon" to be using 9.11 as comedy fodder?
4.0~Could have been and should have been funnier tgooderson Sign in Permalink Admiral General Aladeen (Sasha Baron Cohen) is the dictator of the fictitious North African Republic of Wadiya. After his attempts to build nuclear weapons are announced he is summoned to the UN to explain his and his country's plans. While in New York he is betrayed and an attempt is made on his life. After escaping he discovers that he has been replaced with a double and finds himself working in a vegan, shared earth coop where he becomes friends with Zoey (Anna Farris). Aladeen uses the coop to try to regain his identity and his grip on power in Wadiya. For his 4th feature, Baron Cohen has moved away from the mocumentary style for which he has become synonymous and The Dictator is mostly played as a straight forward comedy feature. The character of Aladeen is based on a hodgepodge of various real life dictators and draws from the West's perceptions of them and their countries. The result is that Aladeen is a racist, sexist, cartoon who while being occasionally funny, generally fails to impress. The humour of the film on the whole failed to resonate with me and the majority of the audience I saw it with, indeed a man on the row in front of me walked out about an hour in having not laughed once. The film delivers the kind of jokes you'd expect from a Sasha Baron Cohen film with a mixture of un-PC statements and comments and gross out stunts. If you've seen the trailer then you've seen most of the less offensive jokes and the more offensive stuff didn't impress me. I loved how un-PC and wild Borat was and I'm a fan of stepping over the line in that respect but in The Dictator the offensive jokes felt a bit lazy. There is a fair amount of cultural stereotyping in the film, which you come to expect, but what Baron Cohen did with it felt old and lazy. He's done it all before. Some of the more offensive jokes failed to make anyone laugh in the screening I saw and these included a video game where you could shoot Israelis at the Munich Olympics. I am a bog fan of comedy which pushes the boundaries of what you can and can't do but only when it serves a purpose. In The Dictator it was used mainly for cheap laughs. I had expected a bit more satire from the film. When dealing with a subject such of this I was hoping for more subtle and satirical humour but it was generally played very broad. There was one very good part in which Aladeen compared the USA to a dictatorship which had me laughing but no one else. Perhaps this is why the film was played so broad. Other than this scene the satire was thin on the ground and I think that was a missed opportunity. Baron Cohen is good as Aladeen but the character is not that far removed from Borat. I thought that his accent was a bit wobbly, ranging from random Arab to Swedish and back again via Russia. Ben Kingsley was excellent as Tamir, Aladeen's uncle. Kingsley plays the role completely straight but with a knowing raised eyebrow. Anna Farris was fine as the love interest/political activist but her character was really annoying. Even speaking as a left wing, vegetarian feminist I disliked her. She was just a caricature and like a lot of the film was lazily written. There were numerous cameo appearances but most failed to provide anything. One area of the film that I liked a lot was the soundtrack which was scored by Baron Cohen's brother, Erran. The film takes well known songs by the likes of Snoop Dogg and REM but replaces the words with Baron Cohen's made up faux-Arab. The result is quite funny but sometimes barely noticeable. I think I went into the film hoping for a cross between Borat and Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator. I left feeling very underwhelmed by what turned out to be a run of the mill Romantic Comedy with a bit of crude humour thrown in. The film has funny moments and I'm sure there will be some people who will love it but for me it could have and should have been so much more. Sasha Baron Cohen has it in him to make something much funnier and edgier and I hope he delivers that next time. www.attheback.blogspot.com
8.0~Very funny! Mathye Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen's previous work with Borat. I came in to The Dictator with relatively high hopes for some good laughs. I'll say that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Cohen gets some great laughs on politically incorrect humour in to this film, and it's well done. In the first 10 minutes of the film, I was laughing my head off with the consistency of the humour, but I can see why in the later half this can not be abundant. However, sometimes this film falls flat, with a lot of humour being delayed in the last half of the movie. Sometimes it (but very rarely) feels like it is not Cohen. However these jokes are still a bundle of laughs for the right people. Overall it's a great film if you're familiar with Cohen's other work.
10.0~Very funny dupamiaza Sign in Permalink I saw this movie in 2012. I loved it. Today I was curious about its rating. It truly deserves a better rating. I don't understand why some people say that the movie isn't funny. I remember that the entire cinema hall was laughing all time throughout the movie. The majority had a great time. So what's with the hate? The movie is hilarious.
7.0~The Funny bits outweigh the offensive bits! martinrobertson300482 Sign in Permalink Much like Sacha Baron Cohens last effort - "Bruno." "The Dictator" stands seriously close to the edge. Though unlike his earlier movies, this one plays like a proper comedy film, with everyone acting, telling rehearsed gags, and with no unwitting bystanders not in on the character actors joke. It's been a while in the making this I guess, as "Bruno" was 3 years ago. Though in more off a traditional movie style, "The Dictator" is jaw achingly hilarious, and jaw dropingly distasteful in equal measure. Much like Baron Cohens last movie. So there's no surprises then? Well off course there is. This is intended too shock you into hysterics. Unfortunately there are a lot off moments that are way too shocking, and just come off as either seriously offensive, overly crude, or are just in out right bad taste (One moment in particular had the whole cinema feeling noticeably uneasy). Fortunately though a majority off the flicks gags will have you laughing your socks off. If you can stomach the bad parts, the helicopter scene, line wire scene, and ridiculous ending, will hopefully more than make up for them. Pretty much to the same standard as "Bruno" then this. If you liked that one. You'll like this one. For me though, the original "Borat" (and the rest off it's ridiculously long title) was heaps better.
6.0~A Duck Soup with a missing ingredient NutzieFagin Sign in Permalink The Dictator is really a clever idea. A Dictator from some unheard of Middle East country (we assume it is because there is a lot of sand and desert) He is ruthless, and a non likable person who seems to be hell bent on his own hedonistic pleasures and making a "must be pointed" missile to conquer the world. He also sends everyone for execution at a drop of the hat. Amid this chaos, there are numerous plotters and assassins who want to take him out. Only when he visits the U.N in America, he will have a chance of redemption and true love with a cute elvish "going green" woman whom he unexpectedly meets at a protest. Good plot but I think I have already seen this in a Marx Brothers movie called "Duck Soup". Sasha Cohen's previous hit movies "Borat" and "Bruno" were hit movies because they had impromptu situations and scenes. The fun of seeing regular people react to the wacky scenes in a Candid Camera set up was the real magic of these films. Here in the film, The Dictator we had none of that humor. Everything was scripted and acted out by trained actors where I felt the real attraction or fun of the film was sorely missed. also some of the jokes were weird in a Sasha Ben Cohen way but not really funny. However, there were some jokes that hit their mark--but most were not that great and possibly offensive by some. Also like Duck Soup, the conclusion was a little fuzzy. Although he finally found true love and happiness and claimed his country was a democracy---it seemed noting changed politically as well. Does that mean that the character also has not changed? No matter! The whole story is considered a fairy tale but I think the messages are somewhat confusing. I would probably recommend the movie. But not at the price of a theater ticket---wait until it comes out on DVD with a slight discount price. The Dictator is not a entirely bad movie--just one that seemed to miss its mark or audience.
1.0~raunchy amethystwings32 Sign in Permalink This movie is a man's movie from the start. I don't know how any one can think this is funny is beyond me. I can not understand how this even made into the theater in the first place. I would not pay to go to a movie like this. Little lone watch it on TV. I would rather stay home and read a good book. This is my mom's opinion of this raunchy satire spoof! And I have to agree, I don't have to go see it to know I won't like it! It is that bad , I find it to be raunchy and controversial ! Considering the content , there is seriously nothing funny about this movie at all. Anyone who thinks so is an idiot! Because going to see this is a total waste of money! We give The Dictator an F , for flop.
1.0~one of the worst movies ever ilkeniz Sign in Permalink No iq is necessary. i think you should watch this film in a coma and it would be a good match for your drooling. unbelievably bad. i do not understand why people give such high marks to crap like this. Also Anna Faris is like tyler perry. if she is in something then that movie is almost certainly gonna suck. the only movie she did not suck was lost in translation. and in that movie she was who she always played and people mocked her. i was shocked by Sasha Baron as well. such a bad movie and in such a political time. Charlie chaplin did the dictator for ww2. and it is full of intelligence. Sasha did the dictator for world war 3. and it is absolute crap.
1.0~worst comedy ever? Could be... jritty Sign in Permalink Absolute garbage. Not since The Pest have seen a comedy THIS bad...oh sure, Pink Panther 2 was horrible but this takes it to a whole new level. Cohen should not be allowed to make another movie and Farris and Kinglsey need to have their heads examined. It simply not funny, racist, offensive and filled with flat jokes. You can see the jokes coming a mile away and everyone is as lame as you imagined. It's funny how most critics would say Mel Brooks fell off with his last 4 films (Spaceballs, life stinks, Robin hood and Dracula) and the box office receipts might agree with them (although I never have. All of those films have merit in some ways) but THIS - THIS IS HOW YOU FALL OFF. It's absolute SHITE.
2.0~Hugely disappointed pincushion-581-874440 Sign in Permalink I wanted this film so bad. I had readied myself for the best laugh to be had at the cinema in 2012. It just wasn't. I mean I did laugh, here and there, but just not as much as his previous work. At all. I can see how this particular character could've got Sacha killed if played straight to an unassuming public. However the alternative shouldn't be a by the numbers one note script! It's like the proverbial punk rock band selling out. His other personalities mined comedy from the unsuspecting participants. Borat made you feel as if you were 'in' on the joke, the element of fun and danger was just lost. The dictator simply offers bad taste jokes, bucket loads. Some hit some miss. A real shame. As for Sacha Baron Cohen, I'm still a huge fan. From his comedic work on the 11 o'clock show, Ali G, Borat, Bruno and Talladega nights to more serious parts like Sweeny Todd and Hugo. I believe he is a talent. Aladeen is a thoroughly repellent character in all the best ways. Cohen does that like only he can. The comparison with Sellers is a just one. Just maybe not with this film. Comedy is very subjective so please don't take this review as a bashing of others tastes. Its simply the opinion of a very disappointed viewer.
3.0~Was I watching the same movie as everyone else??? les-180 Sign in Permalink I really cannot believe the reviews I am reading about this film, how funny it is, an instant classics etc... Let me first begin by saying I am a huge Sacha b Cohen fan, I love his stuff, Ali G, Borat & Bruno. All hysterically funny, some what very unnerving to watch at times, but that a massive part of the appeal... They were below the belt humor, especially Bruno, that you really hadn't seen before and didn't know how to react to it, which made it hysterical. The dictator was non of that. It had brief funny bits in, that were really obvious as well, throughout the film. I was so disappointed as the trailer looked funny and being an avid fan could not wait for the release. But like i say, it wasn't, it was just obvious lets make quick money Hollywood nonsense that so many films seem to be these days. I actually started to think, "is it me, am I getting too old for this sort of stuff?". I'm 48 and went to see the film with my 20 year old sons who also thought the film was rubbish!! What is it with so many films these days that they seem to of lost all sense of character? I love a film, I love a good comedy, but I haven't seen anything decent in a long time because there always seems to be something missing or lacking from the the films these days. Has all the writers run out of ideas, or has everything just been done to death now? Get your act together Sacha, you know your better than this Hollywood bulls**t, don't let those idiots ruin what and who you are!! That's the truth right there pal, despite all the hype I bet you agree with my comments!!
4.0~Wait for the DVD ssbra Sign in Permalink After watching the trailer and waiting weeks for the movie to come out, I finally had my chance when i got tickets to the advance screening and having watched all the other Sacha Baron Cohen movies I didn't expect this to be such a disappointment. I weren't give away any spoilers or any vital bits but certain lines and scenes in the trailer don't appear in the film , whilst some scenes where funny overall most of the jokes lack fizz and fall flat and the accent isn't portrayed well. The story line was set up well and this could have been a great movie but it just seems like it was rushed and just a film to get another pay check. So my advice is to save your money and wait for the Uncut version to come out as it seems it might just make this film worth it.
3.0~Pretty much a failure ChristianUnchained Sign in Permalink A couple hearty laughs, some pretty smart political jokes, and a surprisingly sophisticated finale still doesn't allow The Dictator to achieve its nuclear level of promise. I was truly hoping for something that would be smart, but I guess I was asking way too much. No one in Hollywood would dare to make a smart political comedy. Sigh... Unlike Borat, The Dictator is staged and written. It's not that funny, and lots of the laughs are ridiculously nasty or played for shock value. Borat was genuinely funny and incredibly original (in its documentary style direction) but this was destined for the bargain bin. It's funny, but nothing close to the level of genuine comedy or genius of Borat.
3.0~What's Cohen got up his sleeve next? curtis_o Sign in Permalink This movie is a complete change of format for Cohen's film style since mockumentary's Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan and Brüno. Was it a logical step for his films to take or is it just one step that never needed to be taken? Ali G Indahouse: The Movie is similar where genre is concerned, but that came after two seasons of Da Ali G Show so we had time to familiarize ourselves with the character Cohen was mocking in the first place. Aladeen in The Dictator didn't seem to have the same sort of character progression so I watched this latest addition in line-crossing impersonations with a different frame of mind. Because Cohen had such success with Borat and Brüno, it seems bizarre to move back to the commonplace comedy genre. It may have had more believability if Cohen wasn't the actor. If he had stepped aside, let someone else act and set up a back-story where he actually found this dictator and wanted to make a documentary about him, it may have drawn me in more than it did then. But I guess only Cohen can play his characters like he does. But, he may have just wanted to make a funny movie, not believable, just relatable to what western people understand about real dictators of the world. As a comedy though, I can't say I was in stitches. Some of the characters are hilariously stupid, the usual crude displays and attempts at offensive humour are all there, and the grand scale of Aladeen's arrogance is funny but tapers off at an alarming pace. It seemed to lose track after he went to America where they clearing wanted Aladeen to change his ways and fall in love with literally the polar opposite of him. The romantic plot point takes up most of the movie and becomes his motivation in his final (well put) speech. I'd like to believe a few of the jokes are unscripted. To wrap up, fans of Cohen's work may be disappointed that he's too recognizable to continue fooling Americans into thinking he's really some wacky foreign guy. But it's something Cohen can't really avoid, and I can appreciate that he wants to make new characters but perhaps this type of film is what Cohen will now be limited to. For now, we can look curiously look forward to his portrayal of Freddie Mercury.
6.0~Cohen's worst film but still quite funny areatw Sign in Permalink I'm a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen and 'Borat' remains today one of my favourite comedy movies of all time. No matter how many movies he makes, I doubt any of them will come close to 'Borat'. I was a fan of 'Bruno' too, so I couldn't wait to see what 'The Dictator' had to offer. I did enjoy it, but I do think that Cohen's other movies are better. 'The Dictator' is refreshingly politically incorrect at a time when film-makers go out of their way to avoid causing offense. I thought the character 'Zoey', an obnoxious left-wing feminist, was a particularly funny and accurate representation of many people in society today. I loved that side of the movie. However, I did feel that there were chunks of the movie that didn't provide any laughs whatsoever, which was disappointing for a Cohen film. 'The Dictator' is an entertaining and funny film, but I must admit that it didn't meet my high expectations. Probably Cohen's worst film, but still worth a watch.
9.0~Damn funny and enjoyable tennis_larry Sign in Permalink Indeed, this was a romantic comedy and goats were not directly involved. It had a head and a heart that raised it above the level of the humour which was substantial on its own. And in fact the humour and the romance played off each other in a way that enhanced both. No, this is not an all time great movie, but it was a year's great for this genre, which is admittedly thin. It was not a film that required great acting, and none was evident but this did not detract from the film either. The story line and rapid-fire jokes kept the movie going and it went by all to quickly. If the dictators of the world watched it, I am sure that they would laugh at themselves - before sending out an execution squad to eliminate Sasha Baron Cohen.
9.0~A solid 9 szha-80064 Sign in Permalink Why people are always so mean when score comedy? Do they know how hard it is to think out of an idea and express it to make its audience laugh? This movie is by all means hilarious and Sacha is definitely a genius. I have already watched more than four times and don't mind to watch again and again.
6.0~Cohen Dictates. anaconda-40658 Sign in Permalink The Dictator (2012): Dir: Larry Charles / Cast: Sacha Baron Cohen, Anna Faris, Jason Mantzoukas, Ben Kingsley, John C. Reilly: Here is a film that pokes fun of government and leadership with Sacha Baron Cohen starring as Admiral General Hafez Aladeen whose reputation is at the extremes in controversy. He is set to visit the United States but upon arrival he is kidnapped by the chief of security and replaced with a double by his scheming uncle. Aladeen escapes but without his beard, which was sheered during torture. He ends up being befriended by a political activist, played by Anna Faris who runs a health foods store with those whom she views as social outcasts. This is all quite funny as an idea but it soon becomes predictable and somewhat wayward in its concluding views. It does have a lot of funny moments thanks to Cohen being likable in the lead. He struggles to adapt to city life in New York while making his own rules as he goes. Another hilarious appearance comes from Jason Mantzoukas as Aladeen's nuclear weapons manufacturer who was believed to have been executed. He and Aladeen have a funny argument regarding whether the top of the weapon should be pointed. Other roles are typical. Faris has comic potential as seen in Observe and Report but here she is just the bunt of male jokes due to her short hair. Ben Kingsley as the uncle is also one dimensional despite his efforts. John C. Reilly makes an appearance as a contact with another agenda. Cohen and director Larry Charles together again with an assault on government but this is no Borat. Score: 6 / 10
8.0~Thought It Would Suck - It Did Not!!! **SEMI SPOILER** patrick-olson86 Sign in Permalink Borat, Bruno, and now the Dictator. I thought this was going to be just a third movie with the same style and genital jokes.. far from it. This was well written, the jokes are hilarious, and the jokes poke fun at everyone from Hollywood, the global elite, the US and the Middle East. Some of the jokes are so subtle that I'm betting a good majority of the people don't even realize they're there. Not all jokes in this movie are slapstick crude jokes, many of them are observational and you need to have a little knowledge on class/power differences from the elite to the layman. ***SPOILER ALERT**** The ending speech where he tells the USA how they would love a dictatorship and proceeds to describe what it could bring to them (and perfectly describes the US as it currently is, then realizes he described a democracy, and then instills a "democracy" in his country) is genius.
9.0~The Dictator... Genius ! ckinnair205 Sign in Permalink The Dictator is hilarious; although it does not give the same affect as Borat and Bruno it is still genuinely hilarious. It is shocking, disturbing, vile. I had to look away sometimes at how terrible it really was, the humiliation in the film is unexpected and you can tell when the moments aren't unscripted. It is like Ali G on acid. It is sensational. All the way through I was hysterical. I nearly peed myself at one moment :/ It is a very enjoyable film, the thing with Sacha Barron Cohen you either love his films or hate them, and nothing will change about that. The same rules apply for Dictator. You will love it or hate it. simple as.
9.0~Sasha did it again Kpone9-377-99735 Sign in Permalink If you are a fan of hilarious , delicate, taboo, politically incorrect movies then this is yours. great great great fun. Seriously Nobody stopped laughing all time, i almost cried, some funny middle east accent, some racial abuses, a wrong very wrong Dictator, that never masturbate. Aladeen is the best dictator, it's a mix , with a plot that you already know about in the trailer, and so it goes on, but one of the finest political movie , and actually if you know the world you will see the truth in the movie, because the movie actually is telling the truth. Big up Sasha, you are the man must watch
6.0~Cohen's usual antics, but sillier rather than sharp Movie_Muse_Reviews Sign in Permalink Good day, democratic imbeciles. You first knew him as a Kazakh news reporter, then as an Austrian fashionista. Now, dedicated character comedian Sacha Baron Cohen plays a North African fascist in "The Dictator". The journey of Admiral General Aladeen is unlike his predecessors in that it's not done in a mockumentary style. So, how does this change the actor's shtick? The use of a traditional story (and those words aren't being used lightly — it's cookie-cutter) attempts to mainstream Cohen's brand of humor, whether that was a conscious choice or not. The pop-culture references are a bit more frequent, the potty humor dialed up and the shock gags not as inspired as say, two grown men wrestling naked and chasing each other through a hotel. All the same, Cohen's trademarks are still there, from ignorance-based jokes to thoughtful satire. The writing team that assisted Cohen with the screenplay consists of three "Curb Your Enthusiasm" writers, one of which is Jeff Schaffer, who wrote "Bruno." These folks are all familiar with a looser narrative style, in which the story builds around the jokes. Even director Larry Charles (producer on "Curb"), who did "Bruno" and "Borat," has essentially no typical storytelling experience. As with any film with a plot simply meant to string together a necklace of gags, the individual jokes are forced to carry the film and the results are hit and miss. Aladeen is a great deal more unpredictable than Cohen's previous characters. You never know if you're going to get the poor idiot routine a la "Borat" or the strong-willed dictator used to getting his way. It keeps you on your toes, but feels less complete and ultimately less lovable. It also doesn't help that the plot has him trying to thwart his brother's (Ben Kingsley) plan to turn Wadiya into a democracy. That said, Cohen most definitely wants make you feel uncomfortable rooting for a character who yearns to oppress his people once again. Capped off by a simple yet brilliant speech about all the things America could do if it were a dictatorship, Cohen's commentary hits some strong notes during the film, even if it doesn't compare to the eye-opening methods of his first two, especially "Borat." For the most part, however, the script focuses on making sure no minority loses out on some form of a jab. Yet for all the genuinely creative jokes, like a misinterpreted helicopter ride over New York City, "The Dictator" relies a bit too much on sight gags, like a man yanked out of a bathroom mid-urination or the milking of a woman's breasts. It's just stupider than "Borat" and "Bruno", and with that track record in mind, you're just kind of stunned when an obvious attempt to get laughs draws silence. Fortunately the hits outweigh the misses, but when your story isn't all that interesting, the misses start to stand out. Given the array of recognizable cast members, "The Dictator" is also much more of an ensemble effort, but it is definitely Cohen's show. The casting of Kingsley proves wasteful unless it was to make the point that Kingsley can play any race or religion, but his collaboration with Cohen on "Hugo" is the likely explanation. Anna Faris tries to add some heart as a semi-butch super-organic shop owner, but she's drastically underutilized for someone as funny as she has proved to be. The biggest supporting highlights come courtesy Jason Mantzoukas (Rafi on FX's The League), who plays the perfect foil to Cohen because he's given every opportunity to call Aladeen out on his stupidity. Unsurprisingly, the bar Cohen set with "Borat" will sour people on "The Dictator". You want to walk out of one of his comedies feeling challenged and pushed further than you ever expected (in terms of entertainment), whereas the tone of "The Dictator" is clever, but resonates as mostly silly. As far as the "traditional comedy" experiment goes, next time (assuming there is one) Cohen and Charles should try working with a story structure at least resembling more of a mockumentary, even—dare I say—found footage. It does not have to go back down the road of roping in real people, but Cohen benefits from that touch of realism. The results of attempting to translate Cohen's style to the rise-and-fall format suggest that his brand of comedy needs more space to breathe. The sketches and bits need time to develop organically, without an obligation to a through plot line. Fortunately, there's enough successful humor here to see Cohen through until the next ridiculous character. ~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
7.0~Extreme Humor Is Not For Everyone Thrashman88 Sign in Permalink After watching BORAT a couple of years ago I must confess I've become a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's extreme brand of humor. Where BORAT was basically a series of pranks stringed together to make up a movie,THE DICTATOR is indeed a movie with plot. The kind of humor seen in this movie will certainly enrage quite a few (arabs, Jews, Muslims, 9-11 victims, New Yorkers, etc), but the extreme nature of the movie's humor has a very definite message towards the U.S. Sure, not all jokes work all the time and sometimes they seem forced, but I must confess I actually enjoyed most of THE DICTATOR. Imagine Sacha Baron Cohen as an extreme Adam Sandler (some of his jokes do resemble Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider). THE DICTATOR is political satire at its most extreme and some people might even find it disgusting but I just had huge laughs for it and I can't wait to see it again.
8.0~Exceptional performance by Sacha Baron Cohen! jaimoen Sign in Permalink That was just awesome. There's only one is a 100 years like Sacha Baron Cohen. I was worried when I prepared to watch this movie. So I've decided to select a Jim Carrey movie. Just for a moment, my eyes stuck at Cohen and he got selected. The past 80 minutes of my life has one of the best 80 minutes I've ever been. In short, now I turned to be a big fan of him and searched all his works and bought all of them from Amazone and just finish watching. This is all a one man show and as it should be. If you want to laugh and to get some relief from tension, read the Bible first and then watch any movie of Sacha Baron Cohen, especially this one.
5.0~If you like Sacha Baron Cohen, you'll like the movie JohnRayPeterson Sign in Permalink In typical irreverent humor, Cohen has a unique way of presenting reality in the most provocative way; he excels at it. In this movie, the character is perhaps chosen because the subject could not be more contemporary. There are some very funny moments and an abundance of not so funny ones. As with all the previous Sacha Baron Cohen characters, he plays the role of a character you would really love to beat the sh** out of; so he provides that outlet like few others do. There are supporting cast members and cameos that also add greatly to an otherwise mediocre production. I did have fun watching it, but I picked an appropriate time to do so; it's perfect when you have a lull in your viewing schedule.
2.0~A waste of time. hassnawi2111 Sign in Permalink This movie is not intended for cultured and educated people. I've seen this one with a friend of mine on the plane heading for home. First I didn't intend to finish watching it, but I thought, " I have much time, why not spend some on this trash." I think this movie was produced completely by Israeli ones. It has a political message to deliver to the audience. The theme of the film is utterly absurd. The comedy is artificially unnatural. The is no plausible sequence of events. The main point is how to deform the picture of the other in any possible way. We know Mr Cohen is an English actor, but at the same time he holds the Israeli citizenship.
1.0~Cohen is terrible in scripted comedy sacredcat Sign in Permalink After watching Borat and Bruno I was hooked and couldn't wait to watch the 'dictator.' However, the movie was a huge disappointment. It was so boring that I didn't want to sit through the whole movie. Please don't waste your money on this one. Cohen is brilliant as Ali G, Borat and Bruno, but he's terrible in scripted comedy. There were plenty of scenes that tried to shock the audience and make them feel disgusted. But the jokes were just not funny. The actors were irritating to watch. I still can't believe that Cohen made this one. Cohen's talent is for improvised comedy. He should stick to that.
2.0~Disappointment jhowarth69 Sign in Permalink This film was a disappointment to say the least, not just by the terrible acting but also by the structure of the film. Sasha has really let himself down with this one, from the days of Ali G indahouse and Borat you can clearly see that he has sold himself out. This film consists of a poor attempt at comedy that cannot be described as more than 2 stars (just like the cast). If anybody goes to see this film with any expectation please don't as you will see the harsh reality of what once was a comedy genius selling himself out to Hollywood in order to make big money instead of sticking to what he knows best. The surprise element in the Dictator was  Nothing! I watched the trailer before and that's all that was in this film apart from a terrible script and woeful acting throughout. All I can say is please just stick to the trailer and do not waste ninety minute of your life you will never get back.
3.0~A new low for Cohen and Charles itamarscomix Sign in Permalink I like Sacha Baron Cohen; I like him as a person and a comedian, I loved his TV show, and I love his work in small but memorable parts in films like Hugo and Sweeney Todd. But I really, really wish he's stop with the vanity projects and come to terms with the fact that writing feature films just isn't his strong point. The Borat movie was a success not because of the shock effect and gross-out humor, but because it made a real sharp jab at modern western values. Bruno disposed of the satire, and kept the gross-out; but at least it was somewhat funny. The Dictator doesn't even have that. The Dictator makes genuine attempts at satire only twice throughout the film - once, in the first fifteen minutes, which are truly funny and intelligent; and once again at the very end, with a monologue so obvious that the word 'satire' could have been flashing across the screen and it wouldn't have made the difference. It reads like an attempt by Cohen to maintain some integrity as a witty satirist without losing the lowest-common-denominator appeal, by making a point that everybody will get, no matter how dumb. The rest of the film comes across simply as racist, sexist and low-brow; Cohen had lost track of the difference between parodying racism and ignorance and actually being racist and ignorant. The sad attempt at a coherent plot makes no sense, no point, and worst of all, it's not funny - not even in an awkward way like the worst parts of Borat. Please, Sacha - move on and keep exploring your talents as an actor and a comedian. Focus on the Freddie Mercury biopic, where you can actually get some cred as a serious artist, because fame had gone to your head. You've been walking a fine line between wit and tastelessness from day one; with Bruno you've crossed it - with The Dictator you forgot that line exists.
2.0~Too Hard to Swallow! blogurious Sign in Permalink Baron Cohen has a weakness for targeting social behaviors, be it in politics or simply day to day life. But his humor is quite personal and I wouldn't be so sure it suits everyone. "The Dictator" is another one of his parodies that measures no words or actions when depicting the character, without fearing it could even offend some less tolerant audiences. I always keep an open mind when watching Cohen's films, believing his main purpose is to entertain. And that works most of the times, but "The Dictator" fails in every sense. It is actually boring and tasteless because comedy, besides being fearless, also needs to respect some limits which, in this case, are simply ignored. The jokes are childish, bringing down the level of the story and making it look silly and trashy. There were hardly any laughs in the theater and that too confirms that I wasn't being too picky. In fact, I believe that audiences should not be so underestimated as we're not paying good money to enrich studios, but firstly to have fun. Very disappointing.
6.0~The Vidiot Reviews... capone666 Sign in Permalink The Dictator Remove their medals, fatigues and facial hair, and dictators are nothing but unbalanced people with access to nuclear arms. Unfortunately, the tetchy tyrant in this comedy has lost all of the above. Before he can address the UN, Admiral General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen), a merciless, misogynistic martinet from Wadiya, North African, is kidnapped. Beardless and powerless, he must now earn an honest living in NYC. Meanwhile, a look-a-like hired by Aladeen's uncle (Ben Kingsley) presents the Security Council with plans to covert Wadiya into a democracy. Incensed, the insolvent Aladeen must seek the aid of an impudent female (Anna Faris) if he hopes to regain his regime. While it takes awhile to hit its stride, once it does, there are heaps of offensive religious, political and sexual jokes for infidels to worship. Incidentally, the best way to usurp any authoritarian administration is to include third-party candidates on the ballot. (Yellow Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca
8.0~Baron as a coach for "western" democracy spavlakovic-934-975905 Sign in Permalink Very good movie! At Borat and Bruno there were a parts of the movie I liked but with this one I can't even put a number on a things I liked. Although it looks cruel at some moments, when you think about it, everything is perfectly at place and right up to the point. There will be people who wont get this movie because it moves them from their point of perspective so they wont feel comfortable. If you free your mind from all you know about dictatorships before you watch this movie, you will find it profoundly courageous and deep, as one comedy can be. The only thing I do not appreciate the most is the thing that he got carried away from the point at some moments and trying to satisfy different viewers with different attitudes so he can "trigger" them also. Highly recommendable movie for everyone.
6.0~It's all right awesomemarcoe Sign in Permalink This movie was great in the beginning it was really funny and I loved it. It set itself up to be a great comedy that I would gladly give about a 7 or 8 to but then in the second half it took a major turn for the worse. The movie got really inappropriate and I'm one who normally likes inappropriate comedy but this just went way too far to the point where it wasn't funny and it ruined the movie for me. The story is fine I mean it's a comedy so it's not going to be ground breaking so that was fine. It's not a movie that I'm going to want to watch more than the time that I already saw it but you will be entertained if you watch it. Overall I would say it's not worth your time but if you do watch it it's not the worst.
5.0~Could have been better hdavies5608 Sign in Permalink I watched The Dictator on a whim expecting it to be a very typical comedy with funny moments and a clichéd plot. I guess I got exactly what I was expecting, I was neither impressed nor disappointed. Overall the plot of the movie is alright, it's predictable and clichéd but it's not awful by any means, it has a typical romantic subplot going on and is utterly predictable. The actual comedic content of the film wasn't that good. I'll admit it had some funny parts, and when it was funny it was really funny, but those parts were few and far between, surrounded by jokes that just didn't hit their mark. Some of the jokes seem like they were trying to fill space, they were repeated multiple times to fill a bit and only served to kill whatever humour was in the original joke. Other times the writers clearly thought a joke was good but it just wasn't funny. The movie certainly had promise, the characters were enjoyable and the premise was alright but when they're put together it falls short. On the whole The Dictator movie is alright to watch for a bit of fun while it's certainly no comedic masterpiece if there's nothing else on it's a bit of dumb fun.
6.0~Could be better hakan_volkan_57 Sign in Permalink This movie was really funny. My friends suggested to watch this movie to me.But I think this movie was not very successful. Because there was not many action in the movie. But I liked market scenes. I laughed very much at starting of movie. I thought "it will be more funny in next scenes", but movie failed me. In my opinion remaining of movie is bad. Actor doesn't like democracy and he is a dictator really.If there had been more intrigue in the movie, It would have been more interesting. Thats why I give 6 out of 10.
5.0~Funny in the first twenty minutes. Too bad the next hour wasn't as good. wolverinesforever Sign in Permalink Look, "Borat" was a funny film. I've rarely laughed harder in a theater. Writer/actor Sacha Baron Cohen seamless mixed outrageous gags with sharp satire of American culture. However, it seems that the success of that picture may have gotten to his head a little. "Bruno," while sometimes funny, seemed to focus more on shocking the audience than making them laugh. I was hoping his latest picture, "The Dictator," would be a return to form. Unfortunately, I left feeling underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, the first twenty minutes, I thought it was a good show. We are introduced to Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen), the incredibly conceited ruler of Wadiya (a nation who's borders oddly resemble Eritrea's). He hires celebrities to sleep with him, he stages his own Olympics (where he wins every event), he freely has people executed when they get in his way, and he lives in a palace that celebrates all things Aladeen. There are plenty of good jokes to be found early on, including a brief "dedication" to the late Kim Jong- Il, Aladeen inspecting a nuclear missile, and a cameo by Megan Fox (playing herself). Then the plot kicks in; Wadiya will be attacked by NATO if Aladeen doesn't speak to the United Nations. His right hand man Tamir (Ben Kinsgley) encourages him to make the trip. Reluctantly, Aladeen packs his bags and heads over to New York. Shortly after his arrival, he is ambushed by a man working for Tamir (John C. Reilly in another cameo). Aladeen escapes, but not after his beard is removed and he is rendered "unrecognizeable" to everyone else (more on this later). Now he has to make it on his own in New York City while trying to reclaim his identity as the Admiral General. I won't too much further in the plot, but suffice to say, it's when the film turns into a fish out of water comedy that the picture starts to suffer. Cohen takes lots of risks in trying to come up with humor; you can't deny he's got guts. Unfortunately, he once again resorts too much to just shocking the audience instead of making us laugh. For an example, at one point, Aladeen is desperate to find a beard. So he cuts off the head of a dead man. Apparently, this film thinks they have come up with a "money gag," as the head is shown repeatedly as a puppet operated by Aladeen's hand. The problem is, it's not very funny. Frankly, it's a little unsettling. And I can't think of anything it's satirizing. Further, the screenplay is all over the map. Is the film trying to be a satire on dictatorships? A story about one man's challenge to find love? There are plot contrivances too. Why is a man who was supposed to be executed by Aladeen now helping him to return to power? Why is a far-left woman falling head-over-heels with Aladeen when he continues to be very insulting toward's everyone? And why can't she recognize it IS Aladeen without the beard? (That woman, by the way, is Zoey, and she's played by Anna Farris. Needless to say, it's not a well-written role.) "The Dictator," in short, needs several re-writes. Especially with it's plot. Yes, even outrageous comedies like these sometimes need a concise plot (look at "A Fish Called Wanda," for example). And then, try to carry what worked early on into the rest of the picture. Honestly, if it wasn't for the first twenty minutes, I might have the theater in a very sour mood. As it was, I still left deeply underwhelmed. I can only hope that Sacha Baron Cohen will review his screenplay and his jokes more carefully next time.
5.0~Political Satire jfgibson73 Sign in Permalink I thought this story sounded like a bad idea for a movie, but I wanted to see it for Sasah BC. There were some funny moments. Mostly, it was forgettable. The delivery scene was outrageous, and I liked Jason Manzoukas. It would have been nice if s.b.c. had made a movie that would get enough attention that the speech at the end would have made more of a difference. The subplot involving Anna Faris' character was mostly tedious. It feels a bit outdated to still be making fun of the p.c. counterculture stereotypes. I'd like to see Cohen do something as funny as his HBO series again one day. Obviously, he works best in situations that are not scripted.
1.0~review of the movie nermeen_roshdy Sign in Permalink one the worst movies i have ever seen >> full of unethical scenes and i could even love once , full of hatred and racism , and of course now i know why after knowing that the hero is Jewish .

8.0~If you like your comedy strong neil-476 Sign in Permalink The Dictator follows the fortunes of General Aladdeen (from the Gadaffi/Saddam school of murderous Arab dictators) as he travels to New York to address the UN, is stripped of his beard and replaced by a stand in, and his to find a way of surviving in a city which does not believe he is a powerful wealthy dictator (and wouldn't have a lot of sympathy for him if it did). Sacha Baron Cohen's follow up to Bruno is his most coherent, structured movie so far. There is a proper story, other characters beyond the the titular mainstay, and humour which arrives by way of proper jokes, crafted situations and so on, rather than simply exploiting the attitudes and ignorance of the unwary general public. Which is not to say that this is tasteful (it isn't) or gentle (it most certainly is not). There are some savage, but effective jokes (for me the best of these was when Aladeen and an associate are on a helicopter tour of New York and start talking, in Arabic, about the sights they want to see - Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty - and their enthusiasm for the Porsche 911, to the increasing alarm of the other passengers). A speech near the end rather overstates its satirical purpose, but much of the satire is pleasingly subversive notwithstanding the fact that middle eastern dictators are a pretty soft target. Cohen is a clever and brave writer and performer who pitches his comedy right at the edge of the precipice over which humour tumbles into unacceptability, and this movie has to be judged successful for there are many very funny moments. Anna Faris, as always, is prepared to make herself look silly in pursuit of that laugh out loud moment, and does so in this case with a portrayal which also has charm.
6.0~Better than expected... The_Movie_Cat Sign in Permalink A lot better than I was expecting from the trailer, but surely Cohen's weakest film vehicle to date. Ali G - still arguably the greatest of his characters - wasn't well served in a so-so film that took him away from genuine responses and into a scripted narrative. This omission was capitalised on with Borat, still his greatest film endeavour. Yet whereas Borat saw his "innocent abroad" character reveal prejudice for comic effect, the follow up Bruno achieved the same ends by poking people with a metaphorical stick. Bruno was a very funny film in its own right, but had less to say and forced its own narrative in a way that Borat did not. Now reputedly too famous to do any form of real life interaction, it's a return to scripted works with the first Cohen film to feature a character not from his TV series. The Dictator doesn't - one laboured bit of satire at the end aside - seek to puncture any kind of prejudice. Rather, it reinforces a stereotype for purely comic effect. It's lazy, debatably biased, and, at just 83 minutes, does feel a little like cheating the audience. It may be a couple of extra minutes on his previous effort, but there's a difference between a film made up of real life encounters and a pre-planned, structured movie with a prepared script. The humour varies throughout... sometimes genuinely amusing, sometimes a little too broad, sometimes shocking, sometimes just obnoxious. Frequently it's a lot wittier than expected, though just as frequently it sinks to the lowest common denominator, something I hadn't expected from a performer of Cohen's previous class. Mostly it hits its target, but that target is such an easy one.
8.0~40% trash, yet 60% spectacular black & uncensored humor vadimv-dev Sign in Permalink If you like shocking and controversial scenes, black humor in the style of South Park this movie is for you. Previous works of this team: "Borat" & "Bruno" was too much for me. Still, even this movie is not for a weak minds. At some points I've asked myself: "Really? You have a nerve to make jokes from these tragic things?". It seems that the movie doesn't have any censorship which is adorable. Thumbs up for great job of director and actors. Perfect reflection of Arabic behaves & pronunciation. I'd like to emphasize Sacha's impersonation talent. I could never tell that he is Englishman by the movie. He played well, too well. I worry of his well being now :)
7.0~Amusing, but at a price. PWNYCNY Sign in Permalink Despite the raunchy humor and the shallowness of the story, this is a funny movie. It produces a lot of laughs and some scenes are even hilarious. The problem is that the story stereotypes an entire ethnic group, which some could find offensive. Ethnic humor can be cruel and divisive, and when the laughter is at the expense of a certain group, can cease to be entertaining. It is apparent that the movie producer has certain biases which quickly become obvious through the principal character whose ethnic and cultural affiliation is unmistakable. When comedy is used to mock an entire group, the results can be hollow. Once again, this movie is funny and it does make the audience laugh. But be warned: the movie could offend some, and for those who are offended, the movie may not be funny.
7.0~Worth Watching If You've Got Nothing Else Surreptor Sign in Permalink Although some scenes are quite long drawn-out and are kinda hard to watch, my overall impression of this movie is a good one. The beginning is funny and delivers a nice preview of the rest of the movie. Then it gets a little boring with stale jokes until they arrive in America, where my favorite scenes, the demonstration of the torture equipment and its criticism on the part of Aladeen and the helicopter flight take place. Again, the movie becomes a little bit stale with occasional laughs but overall more story-advancing than funny scenes. The ending however is made really well and had me break out in laughter quite a few times. At the same time it's still original and not the way you'd expect it to be (I'm not going to spoil it here, though). What I especially like about this movie is its hidden criticism not only of African and Asian dictatorship but also of America and western cultures (see opening of Aladeen's long speech at the congress, "why dictatorship is great").
9.0~Really funny movie ..LOL AbsoluteRaushan Sign in Permalink This movie is really funny movie. I laughed so much that my it gave aches in my stomach. Should you watch this movie.? Yes ! definitely. Just watch it and have a good time. But the movie contains some curse language and little bit of nudity but that's OK just watch it with your friends.
2.0~Tedious horizon2008 Sign in Permalink I felt my attention wavering within 15 minutes of The Dictator, it just doesn't have many laughs and it descends into a mild romcom of no real substance whatsoever. Im not sure how its gotten so many high vote reviews here, it really doesn't deserve it. I suppose if you find boring jokes about the various quirks of Arabs/Muslims amusing then maybe thats where those reviews come from. Personally I think it should have been even more near the knuckle. It came across to me as quite safe for some reason and it kinda reeked of Mr Cohen just thinking he could churn out any old rubbish with his name on it and it would sell. Well sorry, not to me mate. Dull as dishwater.
5.0~Sach starting to fray. st-shot Sign in Permalink This is audacious parody film maker Sacha Ben Cohen's third go round featuring himself as an outrageous character turned on the Western world. While in his two previous outings he employed documentary technique the Dictator is a straight fiction and the film, brief to begin with (83 minutes) becomes an elongated short trying too hard to shock and be funny. Cohen plays Haffaz Aladeen, a comically ruthless dictator of the oil rich nation of Waadyia clumsily developing a weapon of mass destruction with arguments about whether the tip should be rounded or pointed. Aladeen travels with entourage to New York to address the UN but is removed and replaced by a double by his most trusted aide Amar (Ben Kingsley) working in consort with the Chinese. Aladeen escapes assassination but now finds himself beardless and out on the street where an activist/caterer (Ana Faris ) takes him in. With his country on the verge of becoming a democracy Aladeen devises a plot to derail it. The Dictator has a decent amount of funny moments skewering assorted despots from Quadaffi to Cheney along with some patented Cohen gross outs but the fresh zaniness of Borat has become fatigued and predictable and the film is little more than a series of hit or miss skits ala Scary Movie franchise reinforced by the presence of Faris. Cohen and Faris match up well enough but Cohen's major firepower, his ability to mine comic gold by playing non-actors for rubes is nowhere to be found and the film flounders evolving into another run of the mill heavy handed comedy whose telegraphed shock value no longer carries much of a punch. Sacha Ben Cohen's over the top musings are becoming bottom of the barrel. His fifteen minutes may well be up.
9.0~Amazing film... a must watch !!! codee240 Sign in Permalink Hilarious and boldly funny, amazingly amazing, cultural references were perfect this time, the jokes can make you pee your pants, I went to see the World premiere held at Glasgow Cineworld and I am glad that I did, as you may have seen the trailers the film is a must watch. Spoiler Alert - Baron Cohen plays General Aladeen, the tyrannical ruler of the oil-rich north African rogue state Wadiya, who is intensely irritated by the western powers' infatuation with the Arab spring. This political annoyance is compounded by the stress of having to keep Osama Bin Laden in one of the spare rooms in his obscenely opulent palace after the Americans took out one of the al-Qaida leader's doubles. He exerts a grotesque, Orwellian power and abolishes hundreds of words in the Adiyan dictionary, insidiously eroding his people's moral sense by replacing "positive" and "negative" with "Aladeen", leading to tense moments in the Wadiyan HIV clinics. His confrontation with Washington has reached a crisis after a speech in which he announced Wadiya was just months away from enriching uranium, and then corpsed and giggled uncontrollably when trying to claim that this was for "clean energy purposes". In fact, Aladeen is obsessed with nuclear capability and succumbs to Freudian rage at the thought of not having a big missile. "Everyone has one," he screams, "even Ahmadinejad and he looks like a snitch from Miami Vice!" There is a horribly funny scene in which Aladeen confronts his nuclear scientist about slow progress and reveals his assumptions about rockets and warhead delivery systems are based entirely upon cartoons. but as I said , you have got to watch it to see if you pee your pants from laughter..!!!!
8.0~The dictator is a comedy movie not just about dictatorship, but about our democracy too. gulherme Sign in Permalink The dictator is a comedy movie not just about dictatorship, but about our democracy too. First of all, the movie goes thought some stereotypes, begins with how we see the middle east, and the dictatorships, stupids and full of self pride. Although it shows a society with multiples interests, for good and for bad. Furthermore the dictator, called Aladeen, goes to America and suffer from a cultural shock in the way of life. After he has access to western way the way he thinks change and start to have more conscience. Besides the dictator epiphany, the main question is ourself reflection after listen his speech in the United Nation. About how unequal and unfair our society is, and beside the average sense we are more similar with dictatorship we use to think. All in all, the movies make a critical vision of our society, and how big is the possibilities ways we humans can organize ourself, it is amazing, for good and for bad. I strong recommend this movie, specially the final UN speech.
4.0~no mojo dromasca Sign in Permalink Almost everything I loved in 'Borat' is missing in 'The Dictator' - the most recent installment from Sacha Baron Cohen. To add to the insult, the title of one of the best films ever made is being hijacked for something that may be as ambitious, but this 'Dictator' has nothing of the human fabric, symbolism and melodramatic power of Chaplin's classical. There is also an almost direct quote with the speech of the 'dictator' at the moment of climax of the movie, but the difference between the magic of the moment Chaplin approaches the microphone and the so-expected turn of mood in Cohen's speech is abyssal. As in his previous movies Sacha Baron Cohen plays with stereotypes. After cautiously projecting some North Korean and Sadam Hussein frames at the start it focuses on the image of Arab dictator of an imaginary country in the North of Africa. Later the script takes its hero to Manhattan, somehow similar situations with the ones in 'Borat' but almost everything is prefabricated. Some arrows are being thrown towards the leftist and ecological movements, and there is even some romance in the plot. Which does not make it less simplistic (bad) and anarchistic (good when coming from Cohen). Gone are the feeling of improvisation, the audacity of the social criticism, the 'cine-verite' style. In are some of the Leslie Nielsen parodies gags. Yes, we get some laughs from time to time, but they are more caused by the classical physical comedy jokes, this is not really what I expected from Sacha Baron Cohen. Ben Kinsley is having some fun in an other of those anti-casting roles he is picking lately. This film placed a challenge to its authors, as it's not easy to deal with the Arab or Muslim cultures in comedies. The result is too polite, but this will probably not buy the film too many export licenses in Arab countries. However, if I am to compare 'The Dictator' with previous films from Cohen and director Larry Charles, I would say that what is missing is actually the 'chutzpah'.
4.0~The only good jokes to come out of "The Dictator" have already been shown in the trailers and commercials cmcrazy81392 Sign in Permalink The only saving grace of Sacha Baron Cohen's latest comedy "The Dictator" is that there are a few select jokes that I liked. Unfortunately, at least 75% of those jokes either came from the film's trailers and commercials or have already taken place in the first few minutes of the film. Now don't get me wrong, I think Sacha Baron Cohen has proved himself to be a gifted comedic talent. I thought "Borat" (2006) was one of the funniest movies of the past decade. Furthermore, I do respect that Cohen is changing his comedic targets in this film from random normal people (like what he did in "Borat") to celebrities to prove his versatility as a comedian. However, this new approach he tries backfires resulting in this picture becoming a big comedic misfire for Cohen. Sacha Baron Cohen plays Haffaz Aladeen, the ruler of the North African Republic of Wadiya who treats himself to whatever he pleases much to the resentment of his people. Aladeen is forced to travel to the United Nations Security Council in New York City in regards to his plans to attack Israel with nuclear weapons his country is currently working on. When he arrives, he is kidnapped by a hit-man hired by Aladeen's uncle (Ben Kingsley), who wants to overthrow Aladeen and become the country's new ruler. Aladeen is able to escape after the hit-man accidentally burns himself to death trying to burn him. But because his beard had been shaved off (much to his horror), he can't go back into the hotel room where he's staying due to other circumstances relating to his identity. It is then that he comes across a protester (Anna Faris) who offers him a job at a grocery store. He reluctantly accepts knowing he has nowhere else to go and through his relationship with this protester, he eventually realizes that he might have a change in heart in terms of his values. So I've said earlier that there are a few scenes that I did laugh at. One of them was when Aladeen and his partner Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) are on a helicopter ride with a regular American couple and this couple thinks that Aladeen and Nadal are hatching up an attack on New York City in the vein of 9/11. That scene had good comedic timing and was executed well. Another funny scene was when Aladeen is competing in his nation's Olympic games and running a sprint of some kind. As soon as this "race" starts, he shoots all the other competitors with the gun he used to start the race and the finish line is intentionally sent closer to him so he can win the race no problem. This scene is hard to describe, but it's in the film's trailer in case you need to see it to believe it, which I would recommend. But for all the few good jokes that did work in "The Dictator", there are an even greater number of lame jokes that miss their targets completely. An example of which is when Aladeen accidentally walks into the Death to Aladeen Restaurant which is filled with people from his country that he thought he executed. A waiter ("SNL" cast member Fred Armisen) asks him what his real name is because apparently it's crucial that a waiter knows your name in a public restaurant. What results from this situation is a lousy comedic skit that obviously feels like a lame, overlong "SNL" skit with Aladeen reading the signs in the restaurant as if they were his name. Nothing about this joke works, the waiter was too dumb and unfunny for my liking, and any real-life restaurant devoted to wishing for a dictator's death is lucky to have any business at all. A similarly awful joke occurs later in the movie when a pregnant woman is in labor at the grocery store where Aladeen and the protester work. As you sadly would have guessed, these two actually help her deliver the baby in the store. What happens from there is not only disturbing and disgusting, but is also without the slightest bit of humor. Aladeen's cell phone gets stuck inside the women who is pregnant. The way they yank the baby out looks like it would hurt like hell. And the payoff involving the baby's gender is not funny, it's just offensive to people of that gender. Another equally awful and repulsive joke occurs during the climax when Aladeen is trying to get into his hotel room and stop the signing of a specific contract. I won't give anything else away other than this joke feels as tacky, disgusting, and unfunny as the other bad jokes before it. The only thing about this film that upsets me more than the inconsistent humor is the equally pathetic and uninspired story. "The Dictator" is frustrating because it had some potential with its first couple minutes. But as soon as Aladeen goes to America, it all goes way downhill from there. The love story between Faris and Cohen is clichéd, forced, and boring. The story completely meanders all over the place and loses focus. On top of that, the story has nothing new to bring to the table. It basically has all the elements of your typical "Prince and the Pauper" storyline crossed with every other raunchy romantic comedy ever made. It's all the more disappointing since the reason Cohen's humor was so great in "Borat" was because it was unpredictable and it was in real-life which isn't the case with this picture. "The Dictator" is definitely one of the biggest letdowns I've seen in a while. Save for a few jokes and the different approach Cohen attempted, I thought this film was a complete waste of time.
7.0~Sacha Baron Cohen's apology for Bruno jimbo-53-186511 Sign in Permalink I'll be honest and admit that I was unsure about seeing this film after the absolute atrocity that was Bruno, but following a recommendation from a friend I decided to give it a try and boy am I glad that I did. The Dictator feels more like Borat or Ali G in terms of approach than Bruno. For me, that is the film's major strength. The problem with Bruno is that it felt that it was trying too hard to shock and too hard to be funny. The Dictator feels more like Borat or Ali G In Da House in which it uses its main character to create the humour rather than forcing the humour down everyone's throats. The first 5-10 minutes of this film are pure Baron Cohen gold, the Olympic games parody and the Aladeen dictionary giving the words positive and negative the same set up were incredibly funny and really gave the film a sense of stupidity that was setting up the jokes rather than focusing on staged humour (a la Bruno). The biggest strength of the film comes when General Aladeen is forced to become a working class citizen and his big struggle in adapting to working class life (after being the person who could order a kill just from running his finger along his neck). I think what makes this film work is that for the most part the jokes come and they come thick and fast - there are so many that it is hard for me to remember them all, but trust me if you watch this film you will see what I mean. For those that are worried that this is going to be another Bruno then have no fear, I can honestly say that this is miles funnier. Cohen has clearly learnt his lesson from the last disaster and got himself a new writing crew who definitely deliver the goods. The cast are roundly good with Baron Cohen and Kingsley clearly giving standout performances. With this being a Sacha Baron Cohen vehicle, there are several jokes which may not be to everyone's tastes - the joke about the Chinese and the Phillipinos and the 9/11 gag may upset some people, but as a liberal myself I have a broad mind and a broad sense of humour and find that I can laugh at those sort of jokes. In summary, this is a slight step down from Borat and Ali G In Da House, but it is a huge step up from Bruno. If you are the sort of person who loved Borat and Ali G In Da House then you'll love this film. However, if you're bothered by bad language or close to the knuckle jokes then this may bother you. However, if you're one of those people who loved Borat and Ali G In Da House, but hated Bruno then this plea is to you - watch this film as Baron Cohen has clearly forgotten about Bruno and has reverted back to the old formula that he's tried and tested before - The Dictator is a treasure.
7.0~Very very funny but offensive in some parts. More like "Borat" then "Bruno" but Cohens best movie so far. I say B+ cosmo_tiger Sign in Permalink "You lied to me and your wanted for war crimes!" General Admiral Alladeen (Cohen) has the perfect life. He is the dictator of an oil rich country and all he has to do is make a signal and people die. He is a multiple gold medal winning athlete and can pretty much but whatever or whoever he wants. When he refuses to let UN inspectors into his country to look for weapons the US threatens attacks. While in New York to talk to the UN his second in command tries to have him killed and institute democracy in his country. Alladeen tries everything to make sure that doesn't happen. I have to say that I think Cohen is the Andy Kaufman of this generation. His comedy is the type where it makes you a little uncomfortable and you laugh but also wish he would stop and that you never saw it. If you have seen "Borat" you know what I mean. For me he is usually a little too much and crosses the line from funny to obscene. I didn't think that "Bruno" was that funny and in that one he seemed to just try and make people mad more then laugh. All that said this is far and away his best movie. There are the scenes in this where you laugh as you look away and thing you laugh at that you know you shouldn't but for the most part this is pretty mainstream (for him). I will say this is not for the easily offended though but there are some really really funny lines in this. This is another movie where if you like Cohen you will watch and if you don't you won't but this is his best movie so far and more like "Borat" then "Bruno". Overall, very very funny, somewhat offensive but I think very much worth watching. I laughed really hard many times. I give it a B+.
5.0~Funnier than Bruno, but very uneven comedy a-ozornin Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen is in this again. After brilliant comedy Borat and absolutely terrible Bruno, he brings another comedy, where he plays Aladeen – the head of small Arab country, who opposes any kind of democracy and will never let anything looking like freedom to sneak into his kingdom. Cohen got an absolutely unique niche in the entertainment industry. His characters become something more than just fiction. Borat was outstanding in some sense; the jokes from the movie were quickly learned and quoted by almost everyone who bothered to watch the movie (despite the notorious quality of the jokes, which exploited practically only a couple of topics). Bruno, on the other hand, failed badly. Partly because of the high expectations, partly because of the poor plot, but the movie failed to amuse in the same shocking and provocative way. This is why I was a bit worried about the Dictator – the movie could have gone in both directions. In reality, though, it took a middle ground. It is not a failure, as Bruno was, but it is not incredibly funny either. There are many really funny jokes (jokes about the gender of babies being my personal favorites), that make you laugh out loud. But this movie is too fictional; it does not follow the suit laid down by Borat of mockumentary-style provocations and explicit trolling. The characters are not there to take the mickey out of clumsy and slow men on the street. They are there to say the jokes which were carefully scripted. And this is what actually distinguishes the movie from other Cohen's works. Rigid, pre-written boundaries do not allow him to enjoy himself. He finds it hard to fully assimilate with the character, simply because there is no need to do so – and the biggest, the funniest part goes straightaway. Cohen forces himself to crack jokes, meaning that in the intervals between the jokes the movie does not exist. It sails from joke to joke, from one background for a joke to another. It does not flow naturally, and this is the reason why it will never be as popular as Borat. This is very uneven comedy, with brilliant jokes and wooden, unnecessary characters. Of course, it goes without a hint of a doubt, the quality of the jokes remains the signature dish of any Cohen movie. He still exploits the same vulgar, immoral and politically incorrect topics, but if he does not do this to perfection, nobody will ever be able to. And, moreover, this is probably the only thing that Cohen knows how to do: when the only smart joke is performed, where Cohen compares dictatorship with democracy in America, it sounds so unnatural, like from the other planet, absolutely alien to the general theme. Let us wish Cohen to stay on track, to return to Borat-like provocations and improvisations - this is his comparative advantage, I hope he realises it and exploits it. m-picturegoer.blogspot.com
8.0~once again a great satire sauveer-ketan Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen does it again, movies from this guy are not normal slap- stick or vulgar comedy but are kind of black comedies and anyone watching them should keep this in mind and should not take any offence. Black comedies are movies made in serious tone but having characters with characteristics and thoughts not commonly acceptable in society, these movies add elements of humour through satire. Though Baron takes this genre and creates a new genre by adding some vulgarity and openly unacceptable dialogues but essentially he satirizes these social evils and mocks them in these movies. If someone is laughing at the characters of his movies then also he succeeds because all these characters are shown as stupid and funny, if someone wants to take offence then also its fine you are already a good guy. In Borat he mocks jew-phobia, George Bush and his wars, gynophobia and sense of cultural superiority in Americans and in Bruno he mocks the hostility of the society towards homo-sexuals. In The Dictator again he is not celebrating racism or dictatorship but he is mocking them. The Dictator will come second only to Borat in these kind of satirical movies.
8.0~A pleasant surprise pault-webster Sign in Permalink When I sat down to watch this movie I have to admit that I did so with a few preconceptions about what to expect. I was not impressed by Sacha Baron Cohens, Ryan Seacrest/ashes stunt as for me, it was just publicity for it's own sake, and, yes, I know, 'no such thing as bad publicity!' but still! poor! That aside, this movie, simple, and following a 'clash of cultures' format that has worked well for Cohen in the past (as well as for many others before him) it was entertaining and funny, while at the same time being racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic...all of those things we hate in the intolerant shadows of society, but all at a level that is made acceptable by the satirical nature of the movie. It's intended to be mildly offencive, and it is, but funny with it! Not rolling in the isle's funny, but funny!
8.0~Laugh fest mistarkus Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen makes the funniest movies of all time and this was the case here. It really got me to laugh nearly constantly throughout the whole movie. No other movies has come close to doing that. It is not necessarily extremely witty rather it is in your face stupid, over the top, politically incorrect and raunchy slapstick but I absolutely love that. The key word is "I". It was MY brand of humor and really made ME laugh and that is why I loved it. This humor is definitely not for most people. Not because it is too raunchy or over the top (not too much is these days) but because some people don't find it as amusing as I do. And if you aren't going to laugh at this movie there isn't a whole lot of redeemable features. You are not going for the interesting plot, the character creation, cinematography or mood. You are going to laugh your brains out at stupid/raunchy over-the-top humor. Its hard to rate this movie because it was not technically a great movie but it was a laugh fest for me personally. If you find his stuff funny its worth going to. Its a little less satirical than some of his other movies since this movie was scripted as opposed to the improv created when one of his zany character goes over to random, unsuspecting people and filming these people's reactions to the zany character. Usually these random people's souls are being satirized which is actually quite an intelligent, statement making brand of humor. Despite being scripted The Dictator was funny and made a few statements.
3.0~I give it "Aladeens" down Ofisil8-850-238679 Sign in Permalink Plot: General Admiral Whatever Aladeen, a dictator in some African nation visits America for the first time. I only remember the face of Ali G, Borat's trailer caught my interest but I haven't seen it yet and Bruno just passed by me. Soooooo this is actually my first Sacha Baron Cohen movie and my expectations were like: smart satire & a funny overuse of racial humor. Boy was I disappointed! First of all let me point out that I'm not easily offended by this type of humor. "Offensive" humor here didn't actually try to offend but to satire and besides that, if a joke is a good joke, then I can tolerate almost anything So why didn't I like it? Well, let me steal, (and slightly change), a Bill Maher's phrase Because I'm not a 6-year old who giggles when I see pee pee parts!!! 50% of the jokes were way too immature to be regarded as satire. Some examples: #1 Woman battles with Aladeen by using her ginormous breasts #2 Aladeen crashes into a window and his tiny penis sticks out scaring a woman #3 Aladeen loses his mobile inside a vagina and has to talk through it. OK, so these are the more "slapstic"-style ones, what about the more "sophisticated" and satiric ones? Well, it makes fun of racial stereotypes and all kinds of fundamentalists but everything is somewhat boring, predictable and just not funny or smart at ALL! If you like the movie's humor though, you are in for a treat because what it lacks in quality it gains in quantity since you will literary hear a joke every 15 seconds. But now my main complain. Most people know that when it comes to humor everything revolves around the HOW. It's how you tell a joke and not which joke and S. B. Cohen is –for me- a terrible comedian. The rest of the crew and especially Mantzoukas, Reilly and Lee have done a great job and probably play in the best scenes of the movie, however even this guys couldn't save us from this disaster. Bad movie? Nuh more like a "meh" one. It has its moments and the pacing won't make you want to slit your wrists. But that's not enough for me. FINAL VERDICT: Simplistic humor & a worthless attempt at satire (3.5/10) Also Check: Borat (2006) - The Campaign (2012) - Zoolander (2001)
10.0~Larry Charles and Sacha Baron Cohen have made a politically incorrect film !!!! FilmCriticLalitRao Sign in Permalink As a comedy film which ridicules everything which is discussed in the film, 'The Dictator' can be seen either with people of one's age, juniors or friends. It would be not right to call its opponents 'Victorian prudes' but under no circumstances should one watch it with family. American director Larry Charles and actor Sasha Baron Cohen have contrived nicely to make their film replete with sexual innuendos. They also make a lot of fun of nature loving geeks. Some hints of authenticity are witnessed in the portrayal of UN delegates especially a Chinese diplomat who makes a lot of comical remarks about his wife in order to seek false popularity ? American director Larry Charles' film "The Dictator" is a bad work of art for dictators and their megalomania cal images. It is a film which no intelligent dictator would like to endorse. Most dictators feel that their actions are always justified. For this reason, they would never like to be remembered for this type of hostile portrayal.
1.0~Disgusting, lame, raw, pointless... udoricht Sign in Permalink And this movie supposed to be a comedy? Who was the target group? People with lower IQ level I guess. Nothing worked here. Script was pointless, stupid with some odd jokes that make you only puke. Acting was terrible. Of course what we expected after previous work "Bruno" which was the most stupid and disgusting movie ever made. This one is in some kind of way in same direction. I have no idea what was Ben Kingsley doing in this rubbish. The role of the dictator by S.B.Cohen is just unsatisfying and amateurish even for a comedy. Every next role of him is getting worse. Maybe I won't watch his movies anymore. This was too much for me. I don't want to waste more words to describe this folly. Just avoid it.
7.0~Typical Sacha Baron Cohen bowmanblue Sign in Permalink Ali G, Borat, Bruno. If you've seen any of them, then you probably know what to expect from Sacha Baron Cohen. Vulgar, crude, politically INcorrect are just some of the terms you could use - depending on your opinion. Basically, if you're easily offended, you probably won't want to watch the tale of an evil Middle Eastern Dictator who finds himself lost in America amidst a plot to oust him from power. However, there are still plenty of people who find this sort of humour funny (and I'm one of them). Personally, I didn't think it was as good as Borat or Bruno as the second half seemed a bit forced. The film lasted just under the typical hour and a half mark, but probably could have got away with being an hour long. It would probably have been a pretty funny hour - if you like that sort of thing. The major criticisms being thrown at The Dictator is claims of racism (just like Borat and Ali G, not to mention claims of homophobia at Bruno) and whether the film mocks Middle Eastern stereotypes, or whether it actually attacks those who impose the stereotypes. The film has also come under fire for being too 'pro-Jew' too anti-American and generally too liberal. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not. It's one of those arguments where if you're looking to use this film to support or challenge your own political viewpoint or religious beliefs there are arguments for and against. The bottom line is that it's quite funny. Quite. Not as good as Borat or Bruno, but still there are plenty of silly and vulgar (and I should emphasis the words 'silly' and 'vulgar' because they're the backbone of this film) moments to make you laugh out loud. Probably not a classic, but entertaining nonetheless.
1.0~Sacha cohen and another cheap comedy..! umar-555 Sign in Permalink *** This review may contain spoilers *** The title is about a dictator who's trying to stop democracy from reaching his country but whats the movie really about is mocking other culture and very disgusting racism and insulting religion and some shallow knowledge about Arabs , i don't really know who sacha think he is. even when he showed in red carpet he came and made a mess ,he gotta stop this silly comedy but i don't think so because this is all he got , clowning and insulting, this think can never be comedy. sacha really have a serious issues and i'm not going to watch any of his movies because it is a waste time and clowning is not really my taste and what i think this movie deserve is 1 of 10 and no more. this actor can ride his camel back home .this movie is really what prove that comedy now is not very good and its turned into clowning .
5.0~Pretty funny but spoiled by plot holes, poor story and politics jbar19 Sign in Permalink Let me start by saying I wanted to like this movie. I love SBC and his smart, sly, snarky sense of humor. But it was released 2 rewrites too soon. There are several classic moments, the helicopter scene and the soon-to-be-classic 100 yard dash scene come to mind, but the plot of the story is threadbare. He just took a few good gags and tried to tie them together in an amateurish, hackneyed manner. My real problem with the story is his final speech where he basically calls the USA a dictatorship. He was trying to set up a funny comparison but it just came off as a ham-fisted attempt to inject extreme Hollywood Liberalism into the film. This wasn't funny, accurate or even germane to the story. It was like the movie finally ran out of steam and SBC just improvised something he read in Pravda. Regardless of your politics you have to admit it was weak and unfunny. This movie could be distilled down to 30 very funny minutes 40 minutes of unbelievable plot and love story building 10 minutes of unfunny, trite, propaganda For SBC, this is an incomplete, amateurish outing. Disappointing.
9.0~Very Funny tigerstar154 Sign in Permalink The Dictator I saw this movie a couple of hours a go, and i loved it! A dictator faces the taste of real life when he is forced out of power. The Pluses: Sacha Baren Cohen, The chopper scene, the restaurant scene, the montage of him working at the store, the political humor/theme, and Anna faris. The Minuses: Too short, some scenes were crude (less than Borat or Bruno, but avoid in front of family) some scenes in trailer were missing from film. Overall, The DICTATOR will make you laugh, and will make you feel disgusted. This is an R Rated movie so be aware. 9/10
6.0~Really funny, but not Cohen's best rebecca-ry Sign in Permalink 'The Dictator' has been released at an awkward moment where people cannot decide on whether it is appropriate or not. It has been released after the death of Gaddafi and ridicules him throughout (appropriate) but, it has been released when there are still quite a few countries where these dictatorships still rule with civil unrest and many people suffering (inappropriate). It is a very funny film, looking at it head on. It can be quite shocking sometimes, with certain jokes and scenes being very topical or just vulgar. However, if people know Sacha Baron Cohen they will know this is what he does best. He portrays this ridiculous leader who has far too much money for his own good and has developed a God-complex. He makes fun of the whole idea of a dictatorship in this film very cleverly but also points out the hypocrisy of Western countries, particularly the USA (see the end monologue in the film). The script is very well written. It's not the best film made by Sacha Baron Cohen, some of his other films have been funnier than this one but it is still really funny in quite a lot of scenes. The actors are all very good in their own way, Anna Faris sort of plays the same character she usually does in films (funny but dim) but she does make you laugh a lot throughout the film and does in her own way really perform well. Again, not everyone will appreciate the comedy here and it can easily seem like 'movie-trash'. Overall, I would recommend this film if you have seen a Sacha Baron Cohen film before and really enjoyed it. If you have never seen one of his performances before but think you won't be offended by it then give it a watch, it does a good job of making fun of these dictators who clearly think that everyone respects them. This film points out that a massive amount of people think of them as ridiculous.
1.0~Awful awful movie imanloves Sign in Permalink This movie is incredibly OFFENSIVE. To Muslims, to Indians, and to Arabs. I feel very disgusted by this movie, and how they presented other nations. It is presenting Arabs as cruel, disgusting, "ride camels on daily basis", unsympathetic, etc.. Yes, the movie does talk about a made up country but still, there are a lot of offensive things to Arabs that go along with it. Very shameful, I think the case would be totally different if the writers, producers, and directors as well as Sasha had a better understanding of those nations they were talking about instead of just judging it based on the lies they hear and watch.
8.0~A Self-Obsessed Dictator Gets Kidnapped and Loses His Identity in New York ivern-326-711636 Sign in Permalink Sasha Baron Cohen's The Dictator is a movie about a self-obsessed dictator that goes to New York to hold a speech. However, he is captured and loses his identity. He is then replaced by a dumb look-alike that is going to announce democracy for his country. The dictator now has to get back his identity, but at the same time blend in with the American society. Now I came into The Dictator with skepticism. I thought the trailers were funny, but I also felt that they showed all the best jokes. But after watching the film, I can honestly say that it doesn't. There are still plenty of jokes in The Dictator that are not shown in the trailers. Honestly, this is one of the funniest movies of all time, almost as good as Borat. I was afraid that making it a real scripted movie and not a mockumentary improv film would ruin it, but it turned out well. The characters are good and the humor is hilarious. I mean, I laughed all the time, and I wasn't the only one either. Everyone seemed to enjoy this film. There might be a few flaws with the film. There is one scene where a woman is giving birth, and it just didn't work for me. I thought it was dumb and a bit nasty. Also, the last 20 minutes of it aren't as good of as the rest of the film. Still good, but not as great. Overall, The Dictator is an awesome movie that will most likely make you laugh! Sasha Baron Cohen did a great job with this one! Will it blow you away like Borat? No. Will it entertain you like Borat? Yup! Applaus!
1.0~How does everyone else not see how crap this movie is Frank-mccaughey Sign in Permalink This is up there with one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I loved Borat and Bruno. To me it's lazy and completely predictable. With none of the shock elements of his previous movies. I can't tell you how bad this movie was. But what I am amazed is it got 6.7 so far in IMDb which now makes me doubt this site. Overall the core problem is that the subject matter ie dictators just does not offer the same scope nor the opportunity to give you that real scenarios where the main character is causing caos. This to me was Sasha with a bigger budget not knowing or caring of the outcome. Brutal. Every joke was obvious. The accents were terrible. It just like any originality. I sat there with a sense of disbelief about some of the scenes. Really really disappointing. But then the trailer didn't suggest much. Butni thought given it was Sasha that it would be great. Brutal
7.0~Its funny but you might feel guilty laughing and you will need a shower afterwards theycallmemrglass Sign in Permalink I saw a preview screening of this in London. As expected from Sacha's previous outings and trailers, this film is in extremely bad taste with plenty of filth, blatant offence (disguised as naivety) of every race, gender, age, animal, disability, sexual orientations, terrorism and politics. Sacha gets away with it because no one is left out. No one, including white folks and straight men. Actually, I lie. I don't know how the hell he gets away with it. The important question is, though, is it funny? Yeah...mostly. There are enough roll in the isle moments to make this worth the ticket but there are also plenty of misfired jokes too, some of which really makes you groan but that's to be expected for a relentless joke firing machine which incidentally has (perhaps mercifully) a short run time of 84mins. Another burning question I ask myself, while watching this is do I feel guilty laughing at some of the offencive jokes? Yes I do, my guilty conscience raises its ugly head but then I realise (or perhaps I'm just making excuses) that I am laughing at the Dictator's naivety and hilarious sense of misplaced morality while others around him frown at his demeanours. This is a departure from the Borat, Ali G, and Bruno stable. With those previous films, real people are sought after and ridiculed by scrutinising their reactions and moral bases. This film, however is purely fictitious, Naked Gun style comedy very much similar to Eddie Murphy's Coming to America with obviously a lot lot less subtlety. However, Sacha's Dictator has pretty much the same political correctness that Borat has but with more hilarious Dictatorship cravings such as executing anyone that annoys him. A good supporting cast thankfully gives this zany film a little bit more variety, particularly Anna Francis, comically playing off the Dictator's character who frankly dominates almost every frame (as I guess a dictator would). John C Reilly also gives a short but hilarious turn. And then there are a few special cameo celebrity guest appearances (or victims, rather) sprinkled around. There are a couple of moments political satire that stands out in hilarity and I wish there was more of it. Alas, it seems vulgarity is more favoured. So if you have no guilty conscience, welcome vulgarity and all things "un-pc" with open arms, do not despise Sacha Cohen Baron and are willing to kiss his armpits (last one is optional), then I reckon you will enjoy this film. For me, filthy films are not my normal cup of tea, nevertheless I did enjoy this but I need a long shower after watching it.
5.0~not good keenanchris Sign in Permalink sometimes a mediocre artist produces one moment of genius that makes their career worthwhile whereas, as is often is the case, another who has produced moments of comic genius in the recent past reaches a point where they unleash on the public a moment of dumb, formulaic crap. Those hoping for the same quality of humour that Sach Baren Cohen reached with Ali G, Borat and Bruno will be disappointed with this effort and pray that he finds a way to revitalise his career and reach the same levels of comedy as he did before. Worst thing he's done since Ali G Indahouse. That's forgivable, but here's hoping he doesn't end up like Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin and returns to form one day soon.
5.0~Original? I THINK NOT!! gregphipps Sign in Permalink So, Sacha Baron Cohen's new film The Dictator features him in the titular role as General Aladeen, a dictator of a made up country. Weird, it seems like 72 years ago, the same movie was made. *cough* The Great Dictator *cough* Let's go on. The titular character is thrust into an unfamiliar world due to a string of events we learn of in the first 20 minutes. Like how the Jewish Barber from The GREAT Dictator wakes up from the war and lives in Hynkel's Tomania (Hitler's Germany). The titular characters both work at a day job, and find love along the way. Through a strange turn of events, whether they'd like it to happen or not, they end up separated from their lovers, and have to give a speech pouring out their heart for the thing they love most. (Aladeen about anti-democracy and Jewish Barber about anti-fascism) And in the end, all is good and happy. Okay, really? Could this have more similarities to The Great Dictator, the Oscar Nominated film from 1940? The answer? Probably, if they really tried. I guess they just thought that no one had even seen the Great Dictator, and just decided to use elements from it, assuming that no one would notice. Well, we did. The film is funny at some points, but overall is really just kind of hyped up and repeatedly offensive to the point of exhaustion. The movie is only 83 minutes long, but feels longer. And with all the scenes in the trailers that were cut from the main film, it seems like the film was a lot less funny than I hoped it would be. It's decent, but not really worth all the hype and building up over. Overall, I give it a 7/10. It's funny, but not GOOD comedy like I was hoping.
2.0~The Dictator...1 out of 4 Skittles FilmStallion Sign in Permalink General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen)the harsh dictator of the fake country of Wadiya, claims the world's worst political figures as best friends, admits that the real Bin Laden is currently living in his guest house, and has no problem calling for the execution of anyone who mildly inconveniences him. General Aladeen makes his way to America to defend himself to the United Nations about his pursuit to construct weapons of mass destruction, but ends up running for his life on the streets of New York after an attempted assassination against his life goes awry. The premise sounds like a winner in the current political world, yet the actual product doesn't live up to the hype of Cohen's reputation. Cohen became a comedic force with his gut busting Borat in 2006 and added to his legacy with 2009's Bruno. His comedic style works best when it's natural, and those around him aren't in on the joke. The Dictator sadly comes across as the exact opposite. It felt staged, scripted, forced and worst of all it wasn't very funny. The talented cast of Ben Kingsley and John C. Reilly are severely underused, and a pathetic attempt at a love story between the general and the kind of woman he has despised his entire life, a politically correct hippy owner of an organic world market (played by Anna Faris) only plays as weak writing. There are a few laughs to be had, probably the biggest being the montage of the general learning how to self gratify himself intercut with footage of majestic bald eagles soaring through the air. Cohen's hilarious rendition of Dr. Dre's 'The Next Episode' with the general singing "Aladeen motherfuc%er!" will find itself on more than a few Ipod playlist. I'm also sure a few of the movie's lines will be quoted by adolescent middle school aged boys and douchebag frat dudes alike, but for the most part The Dictator is a major dud, and a huge step back from Cohen's previous films. It left me longing for the days of Borat offending the world one rodeo at a time.
4.0~It was a bit of a nothing movie. Shopaholic35 Sign in Permalink Wow, I really don't know what to say about this movie. There were places where I felt mild enjoyment but for the most part it was pretty average. The dictator character felt unoriginal and just like everything Sacha Baron Cohen has ever done. It's always trying to be outrageous but in his pursuit of this he has become very repetitive. The vibe was also somewhat boring and it just didn't interest me. I also found Anna Farris' hippie little boy character to be weird and unnatural to the flow of the movie. Now if she was a hooker with a heart of gold, I would have believed it. In their own way they are both too good and not good enough for each other. The prospect gives you this weird icky feeling. I've watched it once but never need to again.
9.0~Hilarious! jackstephensfishing Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen has outdone himself on this one. This hilarious movie is about a dictator of whom the entire world hates. So the United Nations make him come to the US to sign a declaration for whether Wadiya will become a democracy(which of course he doesn't want). With plenty of laughs this movie will keep you laughing all the way through, of course if your comfortable with Sacha's comedy style. If you are familiar with one of his movies you can skip the next part because all his movies pretty much have the same style of comedy to them. WARNING! This movie does have a few racial remarks, mentions of Osama Bin Laden, mentions of children committing suicide(meant in a comedic way), they behead a man in order to get his beard(he is already dead and they don't show them cutting of his head), there are a few racial remarks towards a few people at a shop he works at, and a few more jokes that may offend the light-hearted. I give it an 9/10 but this is only because I found it really funny, definitely not for children below 14 (maybe 13 if they are mature enough) Definitely Sacha Baron Cohen's best movie and hope to see some more from him in the future.
10.0~Such a funny movie - love it dantedamiano81 Sign in Permalink Such a funny movie - love it - you guys rock. Keep on the great work!!! The actor is a genius. I love you Sacha. I cant wait for the next movie by you guys. Thank you guys. Perhaps, The Dictator 2? or Dictator returns? From Borat to Dictator, what is next? Doing a fantastic comedy. No other comedian can reach to you. Look at Bruno or bad-grandpa, they cant be as funny and realistic as you guys. Thanks Why did it get removed from Netflix? I watched it there and wish it was available again so I could watch it. Sacha you are brilliant in every movie I see you. I recall from tailgate with Will feral, you were amazingly great.
7.0~Another Cohen Hit s-neaverson Sign in Permalink This film is outrageous, offensive and to be honest, very silly. Yet it also happens to be one of the funniest, most original comedies to have arrived since well, Borat. The film follows Admiral General Aladeen in his quest to stop his "evil" brother from bringing democracy to his homeland when he is kidnapped and replaced with a body double(don't worry, this isn't a spoiler, it's revealed in the trailer). The film is a laugh a minute thrill ride, with nearly every joke hitting the mark, carefully strafing the line between hilarious and offensive, with only one or two jokes slightly crossing the boundary(the one on 14 year old boys in particular). I can't recommend this film enough in what has so far been a very drab year for comedies. Welcome to the Republic of Wadiya, just please leave your morals at the border.
2.0~Waste of time therealcristi Sign in Permalink This movie is over-rated. PERIOD. It's not the kind of classic comedy movie and it's meant for a certain kind of audience. The characters are of a staggering stupidity and they would amuse me if I were maybe 4 years old. I had the patience to watch it to the end, and made me smile for 3 times. The plot is weak and most of the jokes are obscene or an insult aimed at somebody. It's impossible to figure out how this movie got it's HUGE grade on this site...
2.0~Didn't laugh once merrydizzle Sign in Permalink As my title says, I watched this movie and did not laugh once. Not even a chuckle. I was going to give it one star instead of two, but I used to really like Sacha Baron Cohen, so I had a change of heart, I guess. The humor in this movie just seemed really immature and stupid. I'm not some prude that gets offended by crude humor, but there was just no wit or originality in this film. Like I said, I loved Sacha Baron Cohen. I thought da ali G show was hilarious and I loved borat. I think he does great with his characters and in short skits. If I had to guess I think the reason why this film flopped is because they tried to tie in some lame story line with the character. If wasn't candid like da ali g show or borat. I feel that if Sacha Baron Cohen was just goofing around, being his funny self and not trying to stick to some format or story line it would've been much more funny and entertaining. Sacha Baron Cohen, as a person and as the characters he makes up are hilarious. When he tries to get more involved beyond that and start writing movie scripts, well, I guess it just kind of goes stale. It's a shame, really.
7.0~Funniest Dictator Ever!!! Gabrielka214 Sign in Permalink After I saw Borat, I didn't find Sacha Baron Cohen as an actor whose movies are worth watching, but this film has completely changed my opinion. Believe me, The Dictator is one of the most hilarious comedies of ALL TIME! It's based on prejudices against Arabic terrorism, but so well done, that the main character, Admiral General Aladeen, who comes from Wadiya (a fictive country somewhere in the Arabic region), will make you love him despite all. Yes, Aladeen is cruel, terroristic, anti-American, but besides also a funny fellow and a one huge oaf, who, in the end, changes his personality (or so we may hope). It might not seem so, but it's full of situation funny moments and SOPHISTICATED jokes made so that they can be understood ambiguously. Some scenes from this hilarious movie has become cult scenes, such as The Helicopter Scene, which I highly recommend to watch. The Soundtrack is also worth a one BIG PLUS - catchy Arabic songs throughout the whole movie will get you! I personally recommend songs as Ila Nzour Nebra and Goulou L'Mama. What more is left to say? I love this movie and think it deserves a better rating.
1.0~Piece of crap gerlyneyk Sign in Permalink In 'The Dictator' Sacha decides to write in his movie that a black dead man gets his head cut off. The black head then talks, etc. I guess the idea of his racist movie was that as long as you pick on women, etc. that you can make fun of black people. I think he should return the money to everyone who wasted their time watching that piece of crap. As a matter of fact, the only reason why I did not ask for a refund was that I was at a theater that I've never been before, half of the movie was done at this point and I was surrounded by too many young white people to bother getting up (but off course when the black man's head was cut off, that was the funniest part to them). He is as retarded as the character that he plays. I give this movie two thumbs down and think that a homeless woman should make a nice bowel movement on the DVD and leave it on his doorstep, actually not just a woman but a mob. That's my fantasy anyway, but do not do that. L.O.L. There is no need to do that since I'm sure Sacha Baron Cohen will not be taken seriously from now on. I was dying to see this movie, yet here I was hurt at 4:30pm wondering what I ever did to this guy. All hell would break loose if a white man's head was cut off in a black film. This isn't comedy, it's racist. And you know what? I'd rather see a movie like 'The Sound Of Music' because black people do not have to be put in movies for us to appreciate them and it's better that we don't make the cut then to be used.
8.0~The Dictator (2012) - Hey! Wasn't He the One Who Poured Kim Jong Il's Ashes All Over Ryan Seacrest at the Oscars? What a Moron! nickmesafilms Sign in Permalink Considered as one of the funniest human beings on the planet, Sacha Baron Cohen has always been recognized for insulting audiences, and offending all sorts of stereotypes. Back in the past decade, Sacha Baron Cohen has been bringing us "mockumentary" style movies with some of the most offensive characters ever put to film, such as Ali G, Bruno, and especially Borat! Now, he has now returned to insult even more people with "The Dictator". Although not set up as a mockumentary, "The Dictator" is more of a straight-forward, and fictional satire comedy. Sacha Baron Cohen plays the title role of General Aladeen (part horny, part idiotic, part stupid, and part deadly), a ruthless dictator of the fictional North African city of the Republic of Wadiya. After visiting the United States for a speech to end democracy, Aladeen is suddenly then kidnapped, and now his identity has been removed, making him totally unrecognizable. He later encounters Anna Faris as the owner of a hip, "all-green" alternative lifestyle grocery and café. He ends up causing some unquestionable shenanigans along the way. As a huge fan of "Borat", stereotypical humor is just hilarious for me. Yes, those type of jokes are offensive, but that's the entire point! I really love how great an actor that Sacha Baron Cohen is. He just says these ridiculous remarks, and he's not even sorry for saying them. As always, Sacha Baron Cohen winks at the audience, delivering one offensive remark after another, which will definitely shock the audience in every way possible. Some moments are shockingly offensive, while others are undeniably hilarious. From a disgusting birth scene, a racial misunderstanding involving 9/11, and a over-the-top conclusion that will leave others speechless. Besides, you knew that this was going to be an offensive movie. This is a Sacha Baron Cohen movie, not a dramatic Oscar front-runner, so you have to understand what movie you'll be walking into. I was walking into this movie with a few expectations and a few doubts, but I was definitely not surprised that this movie was going to be offensive, but I was surprised on how I liked it that much. Sacha Baron Cohen is still the master at thinking of some of the most offensive characters in a movie, and yet, we find that hilarious. So, don't walk into this movie with that much expectations, because you must already know what movie you'll walk into. "The Dictator", in my review, "unsurprisingly offensive, and completely hilarious".
5.0~Funny enough to warrant a recommendation TheSeaLion Sign in Permalink "The Dictator" is one of those movies that is stupid and tries too hard to make you laugh, but it has enough genuinely funny moments to warrant a recommendation. I had my worries about the film when I saw the casting, but the film raised my expectations within the first ten minutes and kept it at the same level throughout the entire movie for the most part. There are bumps here and there, but it always bounces back. Dictator Aladeen (Sascha Baron Cohen) is betrayed by his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) and replaced by a double Efawadh (Cohen) so that Wadiya can be made a democracy and Tamir, who reminds me of Scar from "The Lion King", can sell its oil to other countries. Aladeen joins up with a girl named Zoey (Anna Faris) and starts up a romantic relationship. He is then conflicted, either being with Zoey who wants Wadiya to become a democracy or retaking his role as its dictator. Unlike most people who have seen this, I have yet to watch "Borat" and "Bruno", so I am unfamiliar with Sascha Baron Cohen's work and based from what I saw here, I liked it. Unfortunately, I can not say the same for the majority of the other actors working on this film. I did not like Anna Faris in this and I thought that Ben Kingsley was a miscast. Cohen had to carry the film mostly on his own with some occasional help here and there from Jason Mantzoukas as Aladeen's helper Nadal. At times "The Dictator" can be annoying and disgusting, but other times it is very funny. There are enough humorous plot points to make it worth your time and the plot and humor can spin so out of control it becomes a windy roller coaster of a good time. Cohen does have to carry a large load as both the eccentric Dictator Aladeen and his Brick from "Anchorman"-esque double and he is sometimes not enough, but the movie manages to bounce back time and time again.
1.0~Scraping the bottom of the barrel allotati Sign in Permalink They are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this movie. Please don't waste your time or money watching this. It shouldn't even be called a film. What do we call it then? They really stoop low, so low. Stooping low is necessary when there is really ZERO content. The Dictator is VERY POORLY DONE. There is nothing to laugh about. It's NOT FUNNY. The film is a disgrace. It is truly unbelievable what goes out to market these days. Who approved this and how could it ever have been approved? I felt embarrassed for the actors. When movies are this bad customers should have the option of getting their money back. The movie goes from scene to scene to scene. There is no consistency and it is complete nonsense. In the previews they'll show you what you will think is funny. I thought other reviewers were exaggerating as to how low the film stooped, but they were not. The actors who were paid for this film along with the producers and directors should refund the viewers who were totally disappointed with it.
5.0~Shockingly weak. Boba_Fett1138 Sign in Permalink Seriously, I love Sacha Baron Cohen as both a comedian and actor and I am actually still convinced of it that he will win an Oscar some day but this movie unfortunately was a big misstep. Lets be honest. Is this movie in essence any better than a Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler or even Rob Schneider flick? In my opinion absolutely not! It suffers from the exact same problems and comedy-wise they have just about as many hits and misses in them. It is simple; this movie its foremost problem is really its script. It's actually shockingly weak and simplistically written. First of all, it isn't being original enough in any way and second, the way it progresses is all extremely predictable. Nothing in this movie happens as a surprise but what is maybe even more disappoint and troubling is that the movie is lacking edge and punch. It's actually a pretty tame movie, by normal Sacha Baron Cohen standards, even though its concept and main character all sounds like something potentially offensive and politically incorrect. However I feel that nothing about this movie works out as anything offensive or edgy and Sacha Baron Cohen is simply just playing a comical character, that is way over-the-top and relies on written material, rather than Cohen's improvisation skills. It really is a movie with more misses than hits in it, comedy-wise. And when it hits, it doesn't ever hit very hard. There are some mild laughs but that's about all I could get out of this movie. I don't even feel that Sacha Baron Cohen plays a very good character in this case. It's a character that is way too over-the-top but yet he still never goes far enough with it. Aladeen is never really being cruel or threatening enough. His actions are just simply stupid and ignorant, in a childish kind of way. The movie is never anything annoying or truly horrible to watch but still there is no good reason why you should ever go watch it, in the first place. 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
3.0~It would've been more amusing to watch Cohen literally beat a dead horse. bwcMBM Sign in Permalink I kept my expectations low for Sacha Baron Cohen's latest project. Knowing it wouldn't be filmed in the mock documentary format used in Borat and Bruno, both of which I very much enjoyed, I was skeptical as to how well Cohen would adjust to the purely scripted, thoroughly Hollywood-ized, big budget comedy. The Dictator fell far, far short of these already low expectations. As I alluded to with my mentioning of Borat and Bruno, I am not the least bit offended by Cohen's brand of humor. I think it's great whenever someone, particularly a comedian, is willing to push the envelope as far as it will go. Sure, Cohen's had his moments that I felt were just a bit too gratuitous (the flailing penis in Bruno comes to mind). The level of humor seemed to be bordering that of a 13-year-old boy's. No real joke, just an awkward attempt at some shock value. Still, none of it was particularly offensive to me. I make this point because I want to stress just how disappointing The Dictator's attempt at comedy was. There's a few "flailing penis" moments (by that I mean a few awkward attempts at shocking the audience, although there is also a quick glimpse at Cohen's little dick-tator), the occasional political joke (though none were nearly as profound as the filmmakers seemed to think they were), an onslaught of ethnic stereotype jabs, which might be amusing to someone who's never heard a racially charged joke. To make matters worse, every one of these gags are dragged on long after it becomes clear that they weren't funny to begin with. In most cases it would've been more amusing to watch Cohen literally beat a dead horse. Film starts out on a "good enough" note. Several newsreels explain Admiral-General Aladeen's rise to power and strange means of making his nation worship him (the changing of the worse "positive" and "negative" to "Aladeen" was good for a respectable chuckle). You get a lot of the jokes you'd expect regarding a megalomaniac dictator from a third world country, none of which are exceptionally hilarious but, again, "good enough." But then they keep coming. The same jokes. Over and over. For a good 20-30 minutes (and then again periodically throughout the film). Long after that premise runs dry the film decides to shift gears and sends our anti-hero to America, where he will address the UN over concerns about his regimes access to nuclear weaponry. Here's where the film tries to get smart. Aladeen's right hand man, played by Ben Kingsley for some reason, stages a coup d'etat, which leaves Aladeen wandering the streets of New York. Great, democracy for Wadiya! Not so fast, Kingsley is using his new power simply to gain control of his nation's oil reserves so he can sell them to tycoons from around the world. This is a clever enough social comment with some relevance to the recent uprisings in northern Africa. Thankfully the film doesn't allow us to think too much about that, since the scene where Kingsley's plan is revealed is interrupted by the thoroughly American, Chinese Ambassador (or whoever the hell he is) explaining his sexual encounters with many male Hollywood stars. If you don't find this bit funny the first time (and you won't), don't fret; the film gives you two more opportunities to laugh at it again. The film tries to fit an out-of-place love story in the middle that completely fails to add any empathy to any character, although in fairness it seems the main purpose of the romantic element was to provide fodder for a few more rehashed female oppression jokes. Things seem to be dragging in the middle when they decide to spend five minutes on a scene where Aaldeen is taught how to masturbate. The basic joke of this scene is.. Aladeen's never masturbated before.. and he's just learned how. and he thinks it's great. It's comedy gold, I tell you. I'm guessing the screenwriters felt the masturbation scene fit too well into the whole coup d'etat plot, so they felt the need to digress with a shot where Aladeen helps a woman give birth. All these seemingly pointless bits all make sense (hint: not really) in the end where Aladeen regains power at the UN building and makes a speech about the value of a dictatorship. Sarcasm aside, this was actually one of the few well-written scenes in the film. Aladeen explains the value of a dictatorship; how it helps empower the wealthiest one percent, how it fails to provide services for it's most needy, and how it will start wars on false pretenses. All obvious jabs at American government, which would've sounded a lot more thoughtful if I'd not heard Jon Stewart and several other comics make the same observations countless times over the last decade or so. I've never walked out of a movie before, and though I got my tickets for cheap, I nearly left in the middle of The Dictator. It's clear Cohen's niche is speaking off-the-cut and reacting to how other people perceive him, or his characters. When he actually has to sit down and write a premeditated scene, even with the help of three other writers, it simply doesn't work. In all, the film felt like a mainstream Hollywood produced version of Borat. The jokes are predictable, unoriginal, painfully contrived, and only offensive to the exceptionally sensitive.
10.0~best comedy movie jjjegadish Sign in Permalink Funniest movie i ever watched and believe me i have watched a lot of movies.You can really use some stopwatch and check and i assure you that this movie will definitely make you laugh every 10 seconds(There may be some exceptions like if you are not mature enough to understand the jokes then do not blame me ).Every person who watches this movie will surely become a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen.I personally think he is the most intelligent guy in Hollywood.Even the technical parts of movie is awesome. You can see how much money,Thought were given to each details in the dictators palace and stuff like that.Background score and songs also are very impressive.I don't know how some people get offended by this as its just for fun and people should take it that way as Sacha himself is a jew and he offends them the most.
8.0~As Expected tulhamano Sign in Permalink The movie was not as good as Borat, and it couldn't be because this is a normal movie, and normal movies are never as funny as "real life" movies. So this is more similar to Ali G. The movie seems a little made in a hurry and is not great, but overall its a movie worth of your time and money, as long as your expectations ain't huge. All i have to say to critics is: yes Sacha is not a great actor (surprised? he is not an actor he is above all a comedian!), yes his humor is for some shocking and offensive, my question is, if you don't like it, if you find it offensive insulting (whatever) why do you watch him? what were you expecting to see? Are you trying to like him? I see many people saying they were expecting something else, they got offended, etc, well if you were not expecting this, that means you don't know him at all, for me the movie was as expected. I guess for some people its only funny when they make fun of others. I don't think nothing in humor is offensive, it is a satire of reality and he is ridiculing reality, without any taboos or caring about hurting some immature egos, thats humor. He always attacks Jews in every movie and he is Jew, get it?? Thats SAcha Baron. Some people don't get his humor at all, think he is anti-Jew and get shocked to know he is Jew, why? because they simply don't understand the concept of humor.
6.0~Only if you are Baron Choen fan Mun7eanu Sign in Permalink And I am not. Contains some real critics about american politics, but is not convincing. Artistically is zero.
10.0~wonderful amiramiri9595 Sign in Permalink What do people expect from a movie to be excellent!? Im an Iranian and he was joking about our president! it made me laugh so what? this film is only a comedy a simple but in my opinion magnificent comedy, this is not one of those expensive Hollywood movies that the turned 200 cars on fire to make. but as a comedy and nothing more it made me laugh several times and having a good time is only thing you expect from a good comedy. I think this ratings are really just not supportive , yeah it seems many people expected some thing real and fancy the same way but the whole point of comedy is to laugh so I don't see why not 10 stars ! Sorry if there were some grammatical mistakes!
10.0~Absolutely hilarious reneenielsen1 Sign in Permalink So wrong and yet so funny. From the opening scenes to the shorts within the credits including the last line of the film, I was roaring. It's crude and completely politically incorrect so if you're easily offended, don't bother. The jokes come one after another so pay close attention to the dialog. Aladeen is so closed off from the world that his completely obtuse and offensive observations come across as completely innocent and totally hilarious. Loved all the actors.
3.0~Really boring fare krish-swamy00 Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen has been over the top in this movie. As expected, the jokes were cliché-ridden and predictable and so the overall effort was quite stale. Cohen is certainly capable of better - watch Borat and Talledega Nights for proof. But in this movie, the stereotypes were overdone and probably have been repeated in a hundred other spoof movies or episodes of Family Guy. Borat was the first of its kind and its documentary theme made it interesting and really funny. This was nothing of the kind. The one scene that stays in memory (for being quite funny) was the helicopter ride over New York. That one is worth re-watching.
10.0~A Masterpiece acppage-419-612658 Sign in Permalink In my opinion; a comedy masterpiece. Excellently observed satire with just the right amount of transgression that I'm fairly certain will never see the light of day in a fair few countries. Baron Cohen's best performance to date. He seems to be following his compatriot, Nuclear Nadal's advice in keeping his performance small and believable....well perhaps not in the grand scheme of things, but certainly in relation to his over-the-top antics and moderate over-acting of Borat and Bruno. One of the few films of the last decade or so to have me laughing my arse off the whole way through, and often just at the soundtrack which involves some excellent 'wadiyan' (sounds vaguely iranian to me but then I don't know the language so my apologies if that's offensive) covers of famous songs; everybody hurts brought a tear to me eye. I'm sure this film will have its detractors, but frankly, if you don't wet yourself laughing while watching this, there's something wrong with you (or you're one of the people being satirised). In closing: would you like the aladeen news, or the aladeen news?
8.0~This is the best title for comedy ti-jaheed Sign in Permalink I don't know what movies you call comedy. Like 'The Gods Must Be Crazy' - I don't find that much of comedy. But this movie!!!!!!!! Oh, don't talk about it!!!! Just watch and laugh your hearts out. 'She tried to milk me'.... Ha Ha Ha...
7.0~Cohen Humor Without the Hidden Camera gavin6942 Sign in Permalink The heroic story of a dictator (Sacha Baron Cohen) who risks his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed. This was a nice change for Cohen. While I think his strength was always in setting up hidden cameras, or in tricking people into thinking they were talking to someone they were not, this was a nice transition. How can you complain about a film where Megan Fox (as herself) gets told she has herpes? Some people have said the film contains racist jokes. That is not strictly correct -- it has racial jokes (as opposed to racist jokes) -- jokes that point out some cultural truths about America and Americans (how some people see Arabs, the history of slavery and more). The joke is not at the expense of minorities but at ignorant people. And that is brilliant cultural and social criticism. Anna Faris has such a different look... I am torn. While I do not think it works well for her, I must say she was able to be the stereotypical vegan perfectly. And I love the "Arabic" versions of popular music... this might be a soundtrack worth tracking down.
6.0~more shocking humor MLDinTN Sign in Permalink This movie does have some shocking humor that was funny and some that was gross. Also, this movie is less than 90 minutes, it was very short. Some of the better jokes are Aladeen order executions and learning they were never carried out, the wall of girls' pictures, stealing the head, the head under the covers, the exposed bathrobe, birthing the baby, the helicopter ride with the other couple. There's definitely some laughs there even though there wasn't much to this story. Anna Farris wasn't that great in this. I didn't like the wig she had to wear. FINAL VERDICT: If you like crude humor, I'm sure you'll want to check this out.
6.0~Bow down before me!! natashabowiepinky Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen takes a time out from his candid camera style films to give us a scripted one (though he's probably so well known now, something like Borat or Bruno wouldn't work anyway). It's a generally funny affair that will keep a smile on your face throughout, but there are no real belly laughs. As for the plot, the most charitable thing I can say is at least it sets things up for the MANY hit-and-miss gags. It's strange: a lot of the humour would have been shocking even 15 years ago, but now jokes about sexual assaults on young boys and fellatio with a decapitated head seem to be the norm, rather than the exception. Is this a key example of our steep moral decline? I'll leave it up to talk radio to decide... 6/10
7.0~Good but could be a lot better tamouh Sign in Permalink It is hard to watch any of Cohen's movies and not laugh. He has the right ideas, the right stuff to make a comedy. Even at moments when I feel the type of comedy is very distasteful. The issue here is the execution and producing of his comedy. The Dictator is a wonderful movie with good lines and wonderful message. However, the direction and the way scenes were cut is very bad. In fact, I've much favored the trailer over the actual movie just because the trailer had made better way of cutting the scenes. For example, the helicopter scene is almost a bore in the movie, but it is very hilarious when you watch it on trailers. I did enjoy the various norther African arabian music, though some of them did not fit well with the scenes. I think Cohen could use a better producer/director. He should even consider writing the script but let someone else does the acting. Though he is hilarious, I bet someone else can do it even better. No doubt, the Dictator is an enjoyable movie. If you are like myself whom absolutely hates distasteful comedy (the one that goes underneath the belt), then you'll find some scenes gross. There is also a lot of racial slurps, but as an Arab I've taken the whole movie as light hearted, and don't think anyone else should feel offended by what has been said there. Summary: good movie, good lines, some dark comedy, needs better director and producer, possibly a leading actor change.
1.0~A victim of his own success frankdrebin1 Sign in Permalink Ali G, Borat and Bruno – I loved. The Dictator – I hated. I never thought I'd see the day where I actually turned OFF a Sacha Baron Cohen film but I couldn't bear to waste anymore of my life watching this terrible excuse of a 'comedy.' His previous characters were all funny because of the raw humour and the way they took the p*ss out of all the right people in a very clever way. The Dictator however doesn't. The film is full of dud jokes and desperate attempts to be funny. It fails. I work in the film industry and know people that have worked with Sacha Baron Cohen. They say he has become a 'diva' and treats crew and behind the scenes staff with total disrespect. Unfortunately it seems as if the man has become a victim of his own success. If the fame and money has gone to his head maybe he should use that money to retire early and spend time with his family. If he makes another shocking (for all the wrong reasons) film like The Dictator again he will destroy all the good work he has done with previous films / shows / characters.
7.0~Entertaining Political Satire motherbenn Sign in Permalink Sacha Baron Cohen's film "The Dictator" is too hilarious! Cohen takes the despotic leaders of Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt etc.--rolls them all up into one tyrannical, misogynist, terrorist package--and becomes the Don Rickles of in-your-face, race-based, satirical comedy. His portrayal of a Middle Eastern dictator is racist, offensive and a joy to watch. There is a "goat" milking scene that will make you bust a gut. Cohen also spoofs liberal, lefty, tree hugging activists--lampooning their assault on the establishment and global no-goodniks everywhere. In a series of mistaken identity plots, his character falls in love with an over-achieving vegan from Amherst College who he meets at a protest rally outside the UN. I laughed hard when I heard the Arabic language versions of "Funkytown," Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" and other R&B classics. This movie is a smart, entertaining political satire. It's good to laugh about the Middle East for a change. I laughed until I cried.
7.0~Cohen is a Funny Man billcr12 Sign in Permalink Sascha Baron Cohen is a comic genius. Borat is the funniest movie that I have ever seen. It offends everyone; much like Cohen's mentor, Howard Stern. They share the no sacred cows and take no prisoners approach to comedy which is the way it should be. The Dictator continues in the same vein; and though not as consistent as Borat, I still laughed out loud several times over the course of the film. Cohen plays a Northern African leader with a ridiculous beard and silly uniform with medals on the front. He is about to be attacked by the U.S. for developing nuclear weapons, and so he travels to the U.N. in New York to make a speech. He is abducted and a simple minded double is sent to sign a constitution making the country a democracy. The real leader loses his beard and blends into Brooklyn easily. A perfect choice of location for reality's sake. He meets a feminist health food store owner, well played by Anna Faris, and she and Cohen have a natural chemistry on screen. The absurdity of the story is charming, with enough sarcasm and wit to make it well worth watching.
1.0~poor movie gizsajoby Sign in Permalink In 'The Dictator' Sacha decides to write in his movie that a black dead man gets his head cut off. The black head then talks, etc. I guess the idea of his racist movie was that as long as you pick on women, etc. that you can make fun of black people. I think he should return the money to everyone who wasted their time watching that piece of crap. As a matter of fact, the only reason why I did not ask for a refund was that I was at a theater that I've never been before, half of the movie was done at this point and I was surrounded by too many young white people to bother getting up (but off course when the black man's head was cut off, that was the funniest part to them). He is as retarded as the character that he plays. I give this movie two thumbs down and think that a homeless woman should make a nice bowel movement on the DVD and leave it on his doorstep, actually not just a woman but a mob. That's my fantasy anyway, but do not do that. L.O.L. There is no need to do that since I'm sure Sacha Baron Cohen will not be taken seriously from now on. I was dying to see this movie, yet here I was hurt at 4:30pm wondering what I ever did to this guy. All hell would break loose if a white man's head was cut off in a black film. This isn't comedy, it's racist. And you know what? I'd rather see a movie like 'The Sound Of Music' because black people do not have to be put in movies for us to appreciate them and it's better that we don't make the cut then to be used.
1.0~Astonishingly Bad wwarby Sign in Permalink I left the cinema after 45 minutes of this spectacularly unfunny film. I enjoyed Borat and Bruno so I was surprised by just how much I hated The Dictator. It reminded me of spoof movies like Scary Movie with it's steady stream low quality, witless jokes that might appeal to people who laugh at their own farts. Sacha Baron Cohen's reality-style comedies work because the audience is either cringing in sympathy for his unwitting victims or wincing in revulsion at the lengths he will go to for a laugh. His willingness to push boundaries in these films is what makes them entertaining, but in a scripted comedy, Cohen's utterly unsubtle sense of humour comes off as crass, lazy and cheap. Anna Faris's character epitomises everything that is wrong with The Dictator. She's a political activist that works in a non-profit feminist vegan health food democratically run co-operative shop who doesn't shave her armpits. She's a caricature of a kind you would expect to find in a formula spoof movie. It just isn't funny.
3.0~a political comedy who support Israel and new US foreign policy instead of people's voice? masseur28 Sign in Permalink most comedian would be under the fire and got fired if they made their comedy like this guy, but this guy always get away somehow, he got away from UK with his a racist and womaniser prejudice attitudes. Some how he never made jokes about the US or Israel government conflicts but he supports them, maybe that is why he get away from his racist jokes.. if you look at his jokes, unlike other decent comedians which always support the citizens but against the governments, but this comedian is other way around. He supports extreme level of the Israel and new US foreign policies that even Israel officially accept these ideas but behind the curtains. yes it is fun but stereotyping, prejudice ideas rules the movie and just imagine, say, if most movies made that way, there would be more small brain washed racists who might think these arabs are undeveloped people who want to destroy the world so lets attack before they attack us.. well, isn't that new foreign policies saying, so Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan etc invaded, millions killed and mr lovely sacha wants Iran to be destroyed by his movie say so.. of course he will get away with his jokes because I am sure he was supported some groups in the governments.. that is scary, a zionist at work as a comedian..
10.0~Funny, not PC cestriatlast Sign in Permalink It doesn't adhere to the tenents of Social Justice and thus can actually make jokes rather than fussing about what is and isn't a centi-aggression.
7.0~Afraid to laugh cultural stereotypes and borderline racist humor? Twins65 Sign in Permalink Don't worry about it, it's just sand under the bridge! That last line and several others got the laugh-out-loud treatment from me as I spent some time with Sacha Baron Cohen and his latest movie, "The Dictator". I remember this getting very little buzz when it came out, after the hype and the big letdown that was "Bruno". But in my estimation, this is SBC's best work. "Borat" was decent, but wasn't really a scripted movie, just (an unknown) Cohen setting up unsuspecting people (mostly clueless Americans) in strange scenes to say and do stupid things. And Bruno essentially was more of the same, with a less-likable lead character, and the movie sank quickly, both critically and commercially. But here Cohen co-wrote a great script in a more traditional movie with an actual plot, with the zingers come fast and furiously. I really busted a gut when Nadal described what his job really entailed as a computer tech in the U.S., and even the subtle stuff like the parody of R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts" video (sung with a middle-eastern spin) while the undercover Gen. Aladeen strolls aimlessly through the streets of NYC worked well. Special props to actor Jason Mantzoukas, who I was unfamiliar with. He was really good, and I hope to see more of his brand of comedy.
