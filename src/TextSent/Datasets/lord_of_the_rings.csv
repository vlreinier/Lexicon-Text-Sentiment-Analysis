10.0~quite simply the best movie made to date frodolives Sign in Permalink From the casting to the acting, from the cinematography to the special effects, from the locations to the sets and props an costumes and makeup, from the wonderful film score to the truly excellent screenplay, there is hardly a fault to find with this breathtaking, amazing piece of cinematographic art. Director Peter Jackson and his superb, highly motivated cast and crew have done the seemingly impossible in turning Tolkien's beloved books into a movie, and they have done it so amazingly well - finding their own idiosyncratic interpretations while staying absolutely true to the spirit of the book - that all I can say is: Go and see it!! - if you haven't done so yet.
10.0~In one word: Wow! Movies8586 Sign in Permalink LOTR is unlike anything I have ever seen before! It captures just about every emotion that you could want in a film: wonder, love, humor, terror, adventure, drama, etc.! This is truly one of the most awe-inspiring movies ever made! The cinematography is sweeping, the storyline is beautifully constructed, and the acting is flawless! There is no weak link in this cast! Ian McKellen fills the role of Gandalf like no other actor has ever filled a role. He IS Gandalf! The rest of the cast deserve special recognition as well. Much credit to Peter Jackson, JRR Tolkien, and the rest of the production company for making this miracle of a movie possible!
10.0~Finally done right! (spoilers) markmcf Sign in Permalink I could go on for a long time, but the film was better than I thought possible. (How did they get all of those big people to look like Hobbits and Dwarves?!) If you haven't seen it yet, GO! Naturally, they couldn't put the whole book on film. That's just not possible without doing a fifteen or twenty part mini-series. Given those restrictions, they did a fabulous job. We've seen terrible adaptations before, so this version really stands out as a terrific realization of the book. I went to see it with someone who hadn't read the book and she liked it too. <<Here follow spoilers!!>> I'm glad that they made Arwen's character more visible and important in the first film. There are too few female characters in the book. I did think that they made the Hobbits a little bit too timid. Frodo gets wounded at Amon Sul fighting the Ringwraiths, not cowering in fear. (Merry and Pippin are cowering in fear, but Sam and Frodo fight like studs.) There were a couple of small things. They didn't spend enough time in Moria or Lorien. I thought they spent too much time at the beginning telling the audience about the Ring, but that may well have been necessary. I wish I could give the film an eleven. It's really much better than I thought it could be. The Elves are outstanding. Gandalf and Saruman are perfect. The scenary is ideal. The music was right on the money. I even liked the Enya songs in there. Mark
10.0~A truly great movie, whether you're a fantasy fan or not Skeletors_Hood Sign in Permalink I knew from the first time I saw the preview that this was a movie that I wanted to see. Now, I have never picked up a Tolkien book, and the only story I ever knew was the Hobbit, and that was from the animated movie. Now, let me make my observations of some of the reviews listed here, and I must say that everyone is entitled to an opinion, and here is mine. If you don't like this movie, pronouncing it as boring and too long, then you obviously don't have the patience to watch a great movie, more like you love the hacked off 88 min movie that has no real script to speak of, and only took 2 months to film. Which is fine, because I like those movies as well,but also I personally love a movie that took a lot of work, and is also very spectacular as a result. Titanic comes to mind, for one. I want substance in a movie, and LotR delivers. It is a true work of art, unlike (someone mentioned "Fight Club" ???? A classic?! I think not). If you only thought of it as boring, then you were only looking for action and no story, in which case the latest Van Damme movie would have fulfilled your expectations. What I truly loved about this movie wasn't just the scenery, but the acting as well. Each part was brought to life perfectly, and the actors had great chemistry together. I especially loved Ian as Gandalf, and I must also give a great nod to Christopher Lee, who has always made a great villain. The action was well placed and suspenseful, and everything looked as I would expect a fantasy world to look like. Overall a very well made movie. If you hate it, then maybe it's over your head.
10.0~The best movie ever made james_earp Sign in Permalink When I first read the lord of the rings I never thought that a movie could make the books justice but after have seen the movie I have to admit that i had wrong. Peter Jackson has done a great work and made the best movie I ever seen. I think the only movie that could be better is a movie after the books of Belgarion.
10.0~The Best Ever flamethrower07 Sign in Permalink This is the best movie ever!!!!!!!!!! I love all 3 of them. I have seen this movie so many times, the truth is I have seen it 42 times and I know most of the lines to it. I've seen the 2nd one 33 times and the last one I have seen 15 times. I know, I'm obsessed. I wish that I could speak Elvish, that language is so pretty. Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood are completely sexy!!!! A lot of my friends really like this movie too. We have roles that we play and I'm Frodo. I think its really fun. Liv Tyler is cute, and she did a GREAT job on playing Arwen. I love elves and hobbits. I want to go get my ears pointed, just like the elves. Of course I also want to get my K-9 teeth pointed. Lol, don't ask. I would also love to be able to do magic. I think that it is really neat and would be a fun thing to do. I could help people out more. But anyways Lord Of The Rings are the best movies and Peter Jackson is the best director!!! He did a wonderful job on the movies!!!
10.0~Wonderful, astonishing movie with excellent acting performances 10/10!! *SPOILERS!* snowprincess2002 Sign in Permalink I had frantically tried to read the Fellowship before the movie had come out. I had read the Hobbit oh so long ago, and I had bought the Fellowship book before it came out, thinking, this might be interesting to read, and then go see the movie to see if it does justice to the book. I absolutely can't stand movies that don't stick close to books. If they don't, wouldn't that be copyright infringement or something? This movie goes waaaay beyond justice of the book. Because the great thing is, this movie is not exactly the book, which actually goes against my ideals of films and books! I had not been able to finish the Fellowship book before the movie had come out. But the movie, while sticking close to the book, was more of a glance of the book, then took its own stance. Peter Jackson brings more of Tolkien's ideals out more in the movie that i could find in the book after I had finished it. I finished the book finally, although my mind was still stuck on the movie. I'd have to say that the movie, finally, is more entertaining than the book. It is true; the book leaves more to the imagination. But it was as if all of my dreams and imaginations came true onto the screen. Jackson brings a celebration of the human spirit to Middle Earth. Hobbiton is the cheery all-night party town. It's all pure fun, and innocent. They have basically no knowledge of the outside world, of Mordor, Isengard, elves, men, whatever. Gandalf, the powerful, kind wizard, is even seen as a strange man to the citizens of Hobbiton. kind of like going to a family reunion (at least in my family). Isengard and Mordor, of course just by the sound of their names, is evil. It's all dark, and the bad guys dwell there. Rivendell and Lothlorien are the beautiful, graceful kind of places that I would love to live in. Elves dwell in these places, and the places absolutely glow in the movie. Of course, some digital glowing too. The different races that make up the fellowship kind of represent each person's...well, personality. Hobbits (halflings) are the fun, cheery, innocent little guys you just wanna give a big squishy hug to, and Dominic Monaghan (Merry) and Billy Boyd (Pippin) bring absolute great comic moments to the movie. They are so great together, it looks as if their jokes are all impromptu. The elves almost would make you feel inferior. They are perfect, they're in tune with nature and whatnot. And Orlando Bloom (Legolas) brings about that perfect boy-scout personality, the kind of personality that makes you want to be like him. He's honorable, beautiful, and wise. The race of men are kind of at the bottom of the chain here. They're deceitful, greedy, and mean. But there is also honor, hope, and love to be found in them as well. They're us, and that's great. My problem with elves is that they're kind of too perfect. Men have weaknesses, just like we do today. Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) does an absolute perfect Aragorn. And hats off to Sean Bean as Boromir. I never felt that man was given enough credit. When I read the first book, Boromir was just a bad man. He was stupid and stubborn. Well, Boromir is kind of stubborn in the movie as well. My main qualm with the book was that it seemed as if he was naturally corrupted like that. Like Elrond would have let him in the Fellowship then. But the movie centered more around the fact that it was the ring that eventually did him in. Even kings can be taken by the ring. And Bean just brings an enormous amount of character to Boromir, such as honor, humor and kindness (the scene with Boromir teaching Merry and Pippin how to fight), corruption (my favorite scene of all is when Boromir picks up the ring at Cahradas (?) and has that great little monologue), but redemption as well. He's corrupted, but not taken by the ring. He saves himself in the end by helping the hobbits. A more tortured man than Aragorn I have to say. Yay for Sean! I believe all has been said about Ian McKellen as Gandalf. Still cannot believe he didn't take home the Oscar! ("They have to throw that old queen a bone sometime!"-McKellen's commentary on SNL) Two other surprises are Liv Tyler (Arwen) and Elijah Wood (Frodo). I always associtated Tyler with teenie bopper movies, this is a wonderful change for her, and she does such a wonderful job. I'm enormously glad Jackson gave Arwen more screen time. And Wood I congratulate for bringing an excellent performance as Frodo Baggins to the screen. Sorry 'Lij, but I get the feeling this will be the one part you're going to be remembered for the rest of your life, no matter how many movies you do. The special effects are breathtaking, and the music is so beautiful! My mother's a big fan of Enya, so I kinda grew up on her music. But that song Aniron has to be the best song she has done yet. I'm such a big fan of Celtic and Old English music. There are so many other things I want to say. But they all know they're good, and all did a spectacular job. I believe this movie will do for kids and younger people like me what Star Wars did for the children and younger people of that generation. This movie is like Star Wars. You always hear stories of people growing up in the cinema, seeing movies like The Godfather, Star Wars, Indiana Jones. Now it's our turn with Lord of The Rings. The greatest thing? This movie was 3 hours, and felt like an hour and a half. That's my main qualm with the second movie. It was good, but why did the movie seem so LONG?
10.0~One of my all time favorites BobHoey Sign in Permalink When the Lord of the Rings did not win the Academy Award for best picture, I think that it was one of the greatest glitches in Academy history. A Beautiful Mind was a good film and well acted and maybe deserved a nomination but in comparison, it was a lightweight. I read the trilogy almost 30 years ago and was delighted to see that it was brought to the screen with so much integrity. I eagerly await seeing the Two Towers, of which I have heard to be a continuation of the same high standard. Indeed, this film may be my single all time favorite.
10.0~Amazing Doyleand71 Sign in Permalink Timeless classic. I watch this movie as often as possible!
10.0~Exciting and nearly unpredictable adrigirl2001 Sign in Permalink This movie covered every category that movies come in. There was action/adventure, romance, comedy, and terror. I absolutely loved it. It was very close to the book and the special effects were great. It was absolutely unpredictable for me (I had not yet read the book) and I haven't yet gotten sick of it. There is a great variety of themes and messages sent throughout the movie, but I will not say what they are. I'd hate to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it yet. If you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend it. There isn't a moment that isn't suspenseful in the entire movie.
1.0~Atrocious from beginning to end (SPOILERS) devurah Sign in Permalink This review contains SPOILERS All qualities of the book were sacrificed for the sake of an action film full of cheap plot devices, gratuitous and often illogical story changes, and poor characterization. The scenery was actually great, if the camera would ever stop whirling around long enough to allow it to be enjoyed. I appreciate a sweeping camera move judiciously used to set off a dramatic vista, but that device was done to death. The action scenes are such a blitz of brief incoherent cuts that they were hard to watch. The lighting is frequently peculiar, for example everyone in Rivendell looked waxy and sallow. Then there is the music. I am afraid the composer has watched Conan the Barbarian a few two many times. Operatic choir music = bad guys, every time you see them. Yuk! Those are just the minor flaws in this piece of trash. The endless action cliches and cheap devices left me groaning at such a ham-handed treatment of Tolkien. From the sacrifice of Sam, Merry, and Pippin's characters for the sake of comedy, to the crumbling staircase in Moria, to the silly wizard battle between Gandalf and Saruman (complete with the dive off the tower, only to be caught by the eagle ploy). All of this was invented by Peter Jackson, as if the book does not provide enough exciting events to draw upon. It is a long book, and clearly cuts had to be made for a manageable movie. But to expend precious minutes on protracted combats and repetitious detail of Isengard, while leaving out important story and character development is truly sad. In fact, Jackson goes so far as to drag material belonging to The Two Towers (the shortest of the three books) into this movie (which is the longest of the three books). Many of these changes do nothing for the story, sometimes even weaken it. In the books Saruman is in it for himself, believing himself to be the one person who could stand up to Sauron, if only he had the ring. His view of things has been warped by Sauron's subtle control of what he sees through the Palantir. This is much more interesting than Saruman as the avowed lackey of Sauron. The former case makes sense of the treatment Saruman gets at the end of The Two Towers, while the later does not! The combat and action should have been brief, intense, and significant. In the book none of the combat with Boromir defending Merry and Pippin is seen, just the tragic result. The battle in Balin's tomb takes up 1 page out of 400. It is short, fierce, and to the point. The incident of Frodo turning out to be okay after being speared is actually rather funny in the book. In the movie this is blown so far out of proportion I thought I would gag. It is turned into the worst of manipulative `character is killed, oh no they are okay' scenes. And for those long minutes (and many others like them) they sacrificed the Barrow Downs? Frodo's `Cow Jumped Over the Moon' table dance? The hobbits actually getting to know and trust Strider on the way to Rivendell? The worst part is the butchery of the characters. Legolas loses his light-hearted singing nature. Gimli is a caricature from a bad D&D game, replete with Irish brogue. Absent was their caustic interaction and the development of their friendship, one of the hallmarks of the books. Hobbits go from the stealthy nimble people of the books to bumbling comic relief. In the book Sam is clever, loves all things elven, knows old ballads. In the movie he is just dumb and loyal. In the movie Merry and Pippin are turned into witless juvenile troublemakers sucked into the quest willy nilly, instead of dedicated friends conspiring with Sam to go on the quest to support Frodo. And Frodo's own strongest moment, when he defies the Nazgul at the river, is taken away, leaving him just a helpless victim dragged along. And finally, back to that ending battle: where is Aragorn's poignant agony watching the Fellowship fall apart under his leadership? And his tortured choice over which way to go? He doesn't have to make it, because the movie adds a scene between Frodo and him settling the matter. Then there are `the bad guys'. We can start with Sauron in the beginning. He looks like some sort of battle droid transformer monster. What is that?! He is a wizard, and in the history of Middle Earth is most famous for his guile and lies, not being a walking tank. The orcs: of course they are supposed to be scary and nasty. But they are in fact a people. It is clear throughout the books that they are more than beasts. Much of the beginning of The Two Towers hinges on their own politics and personalities, as do the events in Cirith Ungol in The Return of the King. But what we see in the movie are almost-zombies who hiss and growl and grunt a word or two. The biggest problem with all of the evil portrayed in the film is the complete lack of subtlety or mystery. It's all shown in full special effects glory, rather than hinted at as in the books. Have I been frightened at movies? Plenty of times. Was I ever frightened during this one? Never. In fact, that is the big flaw in all of this. Peter Jackson has no sense of subtlety. Everything is explicit and obvious and the viewer is clubbed over the head with it. The movie is informed less by the books than by the stereotype-ridden gaming genre that came out of it. If the movie I saw was in turn novelized, the result would be just one more derivative hack and slash novel that would be forgotten a couple of years after publication.
10.0~The best film ever! Marshal_Kane Sign in Permalink Nobody expected Tolkien's bestseller to ever become a good movie as well. Peter Jackson proved everybody wrong. Thank you Peter Jackson for the magic that you have created, and thank you to all the actors who makes Tolkien's characters come to life.
10.0~If you were disappointed with the lack of character development(SPOILERS) Nick_J_S_86 Sign in Permalink buy the Extended version DVD. There are so many additional scenes that were cut for the theatre version. These scenes provide valuable background information. Also, one thing that bugged me about the first version was that nothing was said about the re-forging of Aragorn's sword. As those who have read the book know, this is semi-vital information in the latter books. This omission in the original version, like many others is taken care of in the Extended DVD.
10.0~Should have easily won best film 2002 loco12 Sign in Permalink Well what can you say that hasn't been said before 2,900 times. One of the biggest films of all time, and a tragedy that the boffoons at the Academy voted snoozathon A Beautiful Mind as best film. Yes it was OK but really how many times have we seen movies similar to that? Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring, had everything one could wish for. Top notch acting, a dramatic storyline, superb cinematography, Stunning landscapes and a classic soundtrack! Some reviewers have stated it is too long. I say it's not long enough and I could have quite happily have sat in the theatre for another hour no problem. I also noticed that many people have voted this film a 1. IMDb should have another top film table, minus the silly "1" votes. This film could never, ever be a one in anyones imagination. I, like many here, have read and loved the books. Watching the movie we see the images that were conjured up in our minds when reading the books. So many have said its exactly what they imagined it's almost uncanny but fantastic to behold. I totally agree. As for a lot of the doubters saying its not a patch on The Godfather, Shawshank, etc, well they wouldn't know whan a real classic came along to join these great movies. Yes, Godfather is a good movie, Shawshank is a good movie (though in my opinion slightly overated) But LOTR is the fantasy classic of our time. 20 years from now LOTR will have earned itself the status of classic fantasy adventure, with virtually no doubter whatsoever, a landmark that other films will strive, and mostly fail to achieve. Thank you Peter Jackson for bringing Middle-earth to life for so many of us grateful fans. Personally I can't wait for the extended DVD, with the extra 30 minutes of unseen footage, which arrives in November. cheers
7.0~Good but could have been better. kiotene_torris Sign in Permalink Alright, I liked the movie, but I have mixed feelings. First of all, you gotta give Jackson credit for his work, but it seems to me, that though he did a good job over all he did not really caught the magic of the books - and I don't mean in the movies, but he himself. The special-effects, the cast and and the production is great - but for acceptable alteration of the original story you find at least the same amount of really bad choices Jackson made. Let me just give th example of who is responsible for going through Moria in the book and on the other hand in the movie. Why change it to Frodo and give him the burden of Gandalf's death? Why do not let Aragorn take the broken sword out of Rivendell? These are just needless and bad alterations of the original story, and there are more examples for that kind of things. But nevertheless the movies made a break for the fantasy-genre and will spawn a lot of movies from the same kind (or so I hope). Jackson deserves credit for that. The Lord of the Rings is something you have to see - but not something you have to like.
10.0~This is the film of the century! lorant_05 Sign in Permalink I gave it ten of course why?Because it's pure magic!I think the director of the movie had an extraordinary vision of the film:where to film it and who to use as the characters.When i saw the first part i knew it was going to be a big hit,and know that there are two more episodes i just simply can't stop watching it even if i saw it twice i can still learn something from it!So please if you want to watch it then do it,and do it with your family because it's worth it! Now that i think of it,this film became my favorite because of the storyline,the places and sites of New Zeeland and especially the magic that suck you in the film and simply makes you feel like your there and taking part of the action.So don't miss to see this film at least once!
10.0~Breathtaking! SteveB Ohio Sign in Permalink Reading the other reviews here, it seems that people either loved this movie or they hated it. It also seems that those who say they hated it don't give any concrete reasons other than they don't seem to "get the point." The same is true of the books that this series is based on: some people think them to be the best works of fiction of all time, while others think they are nonsense. Well, you can count me firmly in the "loved it" camp! Ever since I first read these books in the '70s I have hoped that someone would make them into movies. (My other hope is that someone would take on the project of making quality film versions of Isaac Asimov's "Foundation Trilogy," but that's a different story!) The animated version was mediocre at best, but this one is breathtaking! Never mind the minor differences between the film and the books, this has got to be the best adaptation of book to cinema that I have ever seen. I would dare say that it is even the best film of any type that I have seen. Why? If you are one of those who "don't get it," I can't offer anything to convince you. Let's just say that this movie brings to life the incredible world that J.R.R. Tolkein created in a way that transcends simple fantasy. The characters and places are believable as real rather than mere creations of a fairy tale world. The story has more substance than the comic book style of the Star Wars series. The action is gripping. The visual effects are stunning. There is genuine emotion, from joy to despair. The acting is flawless. And through the entire experience, there is the constant theme of pure good versus pure evil; and staying true to one's friends and commitments regardless of how bad things get. And it does it without being preachy about it: it is totally free of the absurd political correctness that infects so many other films. This movie hits on all cylinders. The first time I saw it, I was in a theater that was completely packed. Nobody got up during its three hour length. There was no whispering or other signs of inattention. When it was over and the lights came on, there was a continued hush that was almost reverent. When people started to get up, I heard comments like "It's going to be a long year." (Meaning, of course, it will be a long wait until the second installment is released this December.) The only flaw I can find is that it was too fast-paced in some places, resulting in some parts of the story being a blur for those who aren't already familiar with the books. Even so, the three hours go by very quickly and leave you wanting to see more of the story. That will have to wait until the end of this year! For those who haven't yet seen it, I would strongly recommend reading the books (or at least read The Fellowship of the Ring) and then rent or buy the dvd when it is released this August.
10.0~What's left to say.... geddy1611 Sign in Permalink For the book readers a must, for the newbies a must. 4 Oscars are not enough to express the excellence of this movie. My mouth fell open when beholding the Balrog, exactly (and more) the way I presumed it would look. Thanks to New Line Cinema in believing and investing in the vision of Peter Jackson! 3 hours of footage could be doubled in my opinion to tell the story, but hey, who's complaining. After watching it 3 times, more details come to my attention, costume design (the runes on Legolas' quiver and the armor of Gimli), the make up...the, the...sigh...SUPERB!!! Peter...chapeaux!
4.0~Much Better Books. SolarFlux Sign in Permalink I'm not claiming that this movie isn't great because it doesnt live up or accurately depict the series of the books. I'm claiming its not great because it simply isn't great. To me, it's a pretty average film. Something for the kids, maybe, if you can find a kid that can sit still for 3 hours. The combination of over-used plot devices, under-developed and painfully similar looking characters (the two other hobbits besides frodo and the chubby one looked like twins, as did the two humans, ryder and the other one, with the same hair-cut and facial hair), and tedius nature of the film makes this one for video rental. Theres simply nothing amazing going on here, and the movie came off as rather tripe. No clever dialogue. No charm. No depth at all. This film simply takes itself too seriously. Although it's a much better fantasy film that the horrible, recently released Dungeons & Dragons, It in no way deserves to be the number one movie on imdb. In my opinion it doesn't even belong in the top 250. Theres something unsatisfying about fantasy films in the 21st century and I think I know what it is. Instead of focusing on character development and clever writing, too many film makers are using computer models and animation to deliver a story, thinking that the visuals will be enough to carry the movie. We can see the same mentality in star wars, episode one. The original trilogy contained 3 fantastic films, but the phantom menace, quite bluntly, sucked donkey. Jar jar was a completely useless computer generated character that they made just because they could. He had no relevance to the movie! Star Wars episode 5 a new hope, however, didnt have the kind of budget to make a useless movie with useless characters like its successor did. It had to rely on a good story, appealing actors, and enjoyable, but not over-blown action sequences. It seems like LOTR and many sci-fi/fantasy movies coming out these days just have pointless cgi characters and sequences, with awful stories and awful actor-characters thrown in at the last minute so theres an excuse for all the computer generated stuff to appear in the first place, and that my friends, is truly sad. This movie would be much better if it were made 20 or 30 years ago.
10.0~I LOVE this movie! marru87 Sign in Permalink First I read the book, which was 1000 pages long... = ) It was a fantastic book, so the movie had to be even more fantastic. And it was! Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo! Those big eyes....And Viggo Mortensen... So sexy!!! Orlando Bloom looks like an elf, so his perfeckt too (I ment that in a good way!).
1.0~unvisionary, mainly boring and uncareful made eobos Sign in Permalink the problem of the movie is mainly that it is made to be liked by as many people as possible, and that´s never a good start for anything. i don´t like jacksons personal visions of the book. he degraded the horrifying black riders to nothing more than weak actionfigures. saruman is too early and often shown, so he can´t be as fear-creating as he is in the book. his (jacksons) direction is more or less unsatisfying, and the acting is -with the exception of hugo weaving (elrond)- bad. jackson would have done good respecting that "the lord of the rings" is no romance but some sort of great "fantasy road movie". missing bombadil and good-fitting music (from rosenman) i will by any time prefer the bakshi animated-feature from 1978 (although it´s incomplete, and bombadil is missing too.. someone finish this movie, pleeeeease).. i´m personally disappointed that a great man like howard shore (crash, silence of the lambs, dead ringers, existenz, the fly, ed wood) could do such a boring score.
10.0~Perfect film-making, flawless fantasy rollercoaster ride! Doddi Sign in Permalink I am one of few who openly admits his favourite movies are Edward Scissorhands and Titanic, but before seeing Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring (abbr. FOTR) I knew I was going to see something unique. But nothing prepared me for this: jawdropping sets and special effects, details that are almost on the verge of sanity (!) and brilliant costumes and make-up. To have such a blend with amazing cast and director... is a delight. Peter Jackson has performed a miracle. He's taken the most popular novel of 20th century, defied the pessimists, stood tall in his shorts and turned it into the greatest movie I've ever seen. I tell you, everything in the film was "perfect". Nothing less. The script must have been difficult to write but it has been done so well here. Peter Jackson has also managed to get a cast that is known but not really "super-star", and they are perfectly cast in their roles. Fate brought Viggo Mortensen into the role of Aragorn (I can't see how Stuart Townsend was chosen) and I've never seen an actor live into the character so much. Ian McKellen IS Gandalf, so no contest and hand him the Oscar, thank you. The hobbits are wonderful and especially well portrayed, led by Elijah Wood, the story's small hero. Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are heavenly and Tyler even surprised me with good accent and acting. So did Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee and that newcomer Orlando Bloom. Added to this is the mythic and wonderful music from Howard Shore. I love it and it brings me everytime to the emotional highs and lows of the film and I see the sorrow, the faces and my heart cries out. It's a powerful film, with marvellous acting and music and sets..., directed flawlessly by soon-to-become-my-favourite-director Peter Jackson. At the end I can only say that I thank each and everyone involved with this movie because I felt better as a person after seeing it, and I'm always thankful for a perfect time. FOTR is indeed perfect!
10.0~Amazing, breathtaking, brilliantly wonderful!! rachi1409 Sign in Permalink This film is the most amazing journey I have ever been on. Not only was the movie enjoyable at the time, but I am holding my breath until the next one comes out! Although there are many characters in this film, it is made simple to follow and absolutley entertaining to watch. There is no lack in performance, particularly by Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), and Hugo Weaving (Elrond), oh yeah and Elijah Wood (Frodo Baggins) oh and also Cate Blanchett (Galadrial)..did I also mention Liv Tyler??? (Arwen). Look, the whole cast is just amazing, I really can't complain about lack of talent, and believe me, I'm picky. Don't go and see this movie if you are looking for just something short and funny. This is a deep movie which has great morals such as "Even the smallest person can change the course of the future", and will leave you pondering it for days afterwards and you may perhaps start reading the books! It is simply a dream...all the actors you could ever hope for under one roof! This movie is both magical, and suspensful. I recommend it to those who love fantasy and movies with lots of substance. This really is a journey you won't want to miss!
2.0~In A Word - Disappointing. boatguy Sign in Permalink When I asses a movie made from a classic story, I usually go back to a cartoon version of Oliver Twist where the producer, writer and director decided it would make a much better story if they added a talking frog. This wasn't that bad. I gave it a 2 because it wasn't that much better. I didn't hate it as much as my 13 year old son, but I didn't like it. Part of the problem was probably that we finished reading the book this past week and the better story and adventure was still fresh in our minds. There are problems that I can overlook: Hobbits and Dwarves grow and shrink from scene to scene, There was a gratuitous love scene added, and Saruman promoted into the primary villain (The simple "Bad Guy" is much LESS interesting than the scholar overwhelmed by his subject, etc). But the thing that bothered me the most and is really unforgivable was the terrible miscasting of Elijah Wood as Frodo. Since Wood seems to feel that acting means opening your eyes wide and whining, It isn't really that surprising that he, the director and writers have turned one of the more appealing heroes in literature into a total wimp. The more he whined, the more disappointed I got. I fear that Frodo is in danger of being remembered NOT as an average guy, with problems and desires and a thirst for adventure, put into an extraordinary situation and prevailing through his own grit, brains and determination, but as an ineffectual Dweeb, paralyzed by situations beyond his control and cringing and whining his way towards his destiny.
10.0~The Film biggestelijahfan Sign in Permalink I think that this film is great. The cast that has been picked fits in really well with the books description of the characters. I can't wait for The Two Towers and The return of the King, i've only seen this film once but i'm going again, hopefully i will see the new Two Towers preview.
10.0~GREAT MOVIE!!! zcat19892000 Sign in Permalink I didn't know anything about Lord of the Rings when I first went to see it but the weekend after I went to the store and got the books. I've seen it 5 times and I can't wait to see it again. It is a very exciting movie and I recommend it to anyone reading this.
10.0~Man this sucks MatrixROCKS Sign in Permalink It totally sucks that not everyone agrees that this was the best movie ever made (tied with the matrix) the adaption was almost perfect. one of the few times when the movie was actually better than the book. Other people have commented by saying that the acting was bad but all the characters were wonderfully acted except maybe for elrond and gimli (who seemed to be a bafoon in the movie) Otherwise it was perfect. And anyone who complains about the ending please realise that, that is how the book ends!
1.0~Boring itsjustanotherdaynow Sign in Permalink 95% of this film is just a bunch of people walking or talking. If I wanted to watch that I could of just gone outside. All they do is walk and talk, walk and talk and walk and talk. Thus it got boring very very quickly and surprise surprise it stayed boring because all their ever did was walk and talk. Walk and talk, walk and talk, walk and talk, walk and talk. As a bonus it was usually just them constantly talking about and repeating the same thing. Boring, boring and boring. The latter 2 are much better, because they aren't a documentary on walking/talking like this one. This one is just about walking and talking, walking and talking. Yay waling and talking. Are you bored yet? As this comment is pretty much the written version of the film. Walking and walking. I'm bored and they're walking and talking. Yay look they are doing some more walking and talking. Walking and talking. Walking and talking. Food. Walking and talking. Yay lets talk about the same things we just talked about again. Walking and talking, walking and talking.
10.0~=^0 CrystalBlueSilver Sign in Permalink A great movie. I hadn't even read the book. Even though it was a little lengthy for me, I really enjoyed the movie. I don't think if I had read the book it would have made sense, because in the book I have a hard time visualizing scenes. But now that I have seen the movie, the books make more sense. I can't wait for a sequel to come out.
10.0~The greatest adventure of all time comes to life jericho31 Sign in Permalink I first read the Lord of the Rings trilogy when i was 8 years old. My dad was a fan and he passed it on to me. Since that time I have read the trilogy numerous times, and it is easily my favorite, and in my opinion the greatest adventure story - the greatest story - ever written on paper. Naturally I was nervous when plans for this movie started. I did not want to see the Lord of the Rings brought to the screen if it was not gonna be done to perfection. Thankfully, my fears were unfounded The Fellowship of the Ring is the greatest movie adaption of all time and easily one of the best movies ever made. The direction is far better than I could have imagined possible. Peter Jackson's attention to detail is mind boggling - it feels like he has reached inside my imagination and transferred it to the big screen. Everything from the relaxing tranqulity of Hobbiton to the threatening atmosphere of Mordor is done with perfection. Jackson captures the book perfectly and deserves the oscar for achievement in direction Perhaps the thing I was most nervous about was the cast. I absolutely love these characters and didnt want to see them played by the wrong people. Again, the movie delivers. Elijah Wood is remarkably good in the lead role, and Sean Astin, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan bring his three Hobbit companions to life better than i would have thought possible. Viggo Mortensen is perfectly suited to play Aragorn/Stryder, and Sean Bean turns in perhaps the best performance in the movie as the tormented human Boromir. Orlando Bloom as the elf legolas and John Rhys-Davies as the dwarf Gimli are exactly as I imagined them. Hell, even Liv Tyler is good in a brief (even though its been beefed up) role as the elf Arwen. But the true MVP in the cast is Ian mcKellen who sparkles as the wizard Gandalf. He brings the best character in the book to life so well it brings tears to my eyes. The lord of the Rings is a completely wonderful start to the trilogy. I was so nervous going into it - and now I am supremely confident jackson will continue the trend next Christmas with the Two Towers. This movie is a wonderful achievement in filmaking and deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest made films of all time, and it seems the IMDB voters agree with me so far. I give it a 10 out of 10 and recommend to movie lovers of all ages.
10.0~W.O.W. Karma_K2 Sign in Permalink WOW!! First off, those who complain about the film...ARE YOU NUTS?!?! Films are merely forms of entertainment remember? And this film was very entertaining. The special effects were EXCELLENT!! I have to admit; I fell in love with a couple of actors after watching this movie. Hugo Weaving - always a favourite - made a delicious elf, as did Orlando Bloom. YUMMY!! Ian McKellen was lovely as Gandalf the Grey - GOOD MOVE! And Christopher Lee was really creepy as Saruman the White, but then again, isn't he always? Now to those who say that this movie has no plot, are you people blind? The plot is right there!! I'll spell it out for you. *Old hobbit (Bilbo) has evil ring, bequeaths it to young hobbit nephew (Frodo) *Frodo and 3 hobbit friends (Merry, Pippin and Samwise) directed by wizard Gandalf to embark on a journey to Rivendale (home of yummy elves) to give ring to elves for safekeeping. Unfortunately, no go. *4 hobbits continue journey with other members of fellowship of ring (Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Sauron) *Encounter danger *One dies *Journey to be continued in next movie Very basic, and I've probably left out a lot, but there you go. I really enjoyed this movie like you wouldn't believe - how DID "A Beautiful Mind" beat it? (Mind you, Russell Crowe is a pretty solid actor.) As a fantasy movie it rivals "Harry Potter", I loved it that much. (And I LOVED "Harry Potter" - especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape) All I have left to say is: 2 thumbs up; 10/10; ***** out of *****.
10.0~Breathtaking DemonKnight5150 Sign in Permalink I just wanted to point out that I have never read the books so I came into this movie with a very open mind. When I first saw the previews I honestly wasn't sure of what to expect out of this. Some friends of mine read the books and were going on about how Peter Jackson was going to ruin the franchise by making a movie. They were proved wrong. My friends and I went and saw it 2 days after it came out, and needless to say, we were all completely blown away by the beauty of this film. I may be young and I probably don't look at film-making the same way, but the way that Peter Jackson conveyed those words in the book to the big screen is just complete brilliance. I have never seen anything like it. Middle Earth was beautiful. Choosing New Zealand as the location to film this movie was the best decision ever. From The Shire to Rivendell to Mt. Doom, it was all captured flawlessly by Jackson. Now on to the actors. What better person than Sir Ian Mckellan to play Gandalf the Grey. My god, the guy breathed eternal life into that character and he did it with such grace. I have to admit that going into this film, I was very skeptical on the choice of Elijah Wood for Frodo, but again, I was proved wrong, as Elijah provided an innocence to the character that I don't think anybody else could have done. All the other actors from Viggo Mortensen to Sean Bean to Liv Tyler did one hell of a job. In summary, this movie is, arguably, my favorite movie thus far. All the things that I've wanted in a film have been weaved into this fine piece of artistic mastery and I'm definitely anticipating the sequels.
10.0~A true classic that will stand the test of time taima133 Sign in Permalink Reading through some of other peoples opinions its pretty clear that it has had a huge influence on people. Most people love it, a lot of people hate it, and some just don't know what to make of it. I don't think I have ever seen a film with such a huge range of differing opinions. People say it won't stand the test of time? but considering the book was writing 50 years ago LOTR has already stood the test of time. As far as the film is concerned IMHO its one of the best films I have ever seen and in 3 years time when we can sit down and watch all three movies back to back I am sure a lot of people who didn't like the first film for various reasons complaining about the lack of character development and a ending will more than likely change there opinions and will start to look on the LOTR trilogy as a true classic.
10.0~It is the best film ever made, apart from the two towers and the return of the king! Jia Jia Billins Sign in Permalink Hi, and here is my review of the Lord of the Rings 'the fellowship of the ring'. I saw this film when it first came out, which was on the 19th december. I had already read the books, and thought that the film would never be as good as the books. But, I changed my mind soon enough. I thought the film was brilliant! I liked everything about the film. It was exciting and dramatic. I was totally amazed at the special effects and the music was so good that I went bought the soundtrack the next day. I thought the most amazing part was where they were in the mines of moria with the balrog. It was totally amazing!
10.0~Lord of My Top 10 Movie List JohnLennon1985 Sign in Permalink The Fellowship of the Ring was one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written. Many thought it was even too great to be portrayed on the big screen. However, like always in this kind of situation, some crazy guy did it... and he did it well. I cannot imagine how one could NOT like this movie. Maybe those who don't like the Fantasy genre, or those who just can't be entertained. There is no explanation why anyone else would not like this movie. It was just too well done. It had everything in it, and as long as it was (and believe me, it was LONG), it entertains the audience with each scene. I also respect the fact that this movie was very true to the book. True, it did cut some scenes out, but to add every single thing in the book would make a movie TOO long. This movie left in the important stuff. The acting speaks for itself. Sir Ian MacKellen was extremely awesome in this movie! You will bow to Gandalf in all his greatness! This movie should have won more oscars. I have yet to see a Beautiful Mind, but I believe the Fellowship should have won Best Picture of the Year. Well, at least the Two Towers has a chance next year. I have seen very entertaining movies, but none of them could reach the level of greatness that this movie has achieved. If you see just one movie this year, this should be it.
10.0~An Instant Legend Squirelly Joe Sign in Permalink How to make a Legend: Take a great and/or timeless story Add a twist to it (in this case a ring that controls the fate of the world) Put some music theme(s) that plays throughout the movie/series every now and then Introduce great and memorable characters to the mix Kill off some loveable characters Make the situation seem hopeless Top it off with a great ending or an ending open for a sequel This is Lord of the Rings, book and movie. Acting: 10/10 The acting totaly blew me away for this movie. Even Liv Tyler (who has an inscrutable reputation for her acting) did a tremendous job as Arwen. Ian McKellan's performance stands out the most. Orlando Bloom honestly didn't have as many lines as the others, but did a great job as Legolas. PJ made a smart movie replacing Stuart Townsend with Viggo Mortensen. Viggo is the exact right age and has the exact right look that Aragorn should have. John Rhys-Davies played out Gimli much like he was in the book. Dominic Monaghan did a good job as Merry and acted out the lines like he really meant it. Pippin's character was portrayed closest to his character in the book thanks to Billy Boyd. Sean Astin playing Sam was right on and almost portrayed closest to his character in the book if only it showed more of his character changing and becoming more brave (later depicted more in The Two Towers and then even more in Return of the King).Elijah Wood is pretty much the only person who could get Frodo's character right and transform him both from a cheery, upbeat hobbit to a depressed and frightened hero while at the same time showing the ring's corruption on him (mostly shown in The Two Towers, but there is the odd hint here and there).Cate Blanchette and Christopher Lee were pretty much born for the rolls of Galadriel and Saruman. Elrond has a great character tone that could only be brought on by Hugo Weaving. Sadly though, Sean Bean's acting is short lived throughout the trilogy. ( For those who have seen the movie/read the books you know what i'm talking about and for those who haven't, see the movie/read the book to find out) Story: 9/10 The only reason this didn't get 10/10 is because, to put it blandly, the idea of a ring controlling the fate of mankind does sound farfetched. However Tolkien (pronounced Tol-KEEN) put such a vivid story behind it that to this day its amazingly fresh. The story itself fits in with the problems of our time such as the recent war and even everyday life. Friends, Courage, Sacrafice, Rising up against the odds. Mind you, Tolkien was in both World Wars so its bound to have that sort of theme in it. Music: 11/10 What many composer's fail to incorporate into their movies, Howard Shore does in this. Every place pretty much has its own theme and Howard Shore sticks to this idea throughout the entire Trilogy. The Uruk-Hai, Mordor, The Shire. All has its own theme. The choir really adds to the experience. Especially in the 2 very emotional death scenes through the movie. The score on its own is beautiful and touching. If the score makes you cry, then the movie will make you bawl your eyes out. Enough said. Visual Effects: 10/10 From Special Effects to camera tricks, PJ applied the newest tricks to make the Trilogy seem as real as possible. Hobbits are short, wizards are tall. All thanks to camera tricks and camera angles. Amazingly, the movie keeps its realism even from the lack of gore and blood. It's even more amazing when they do it in The Two Towers (still managing to only get a 14A rating). MASSIVE helped acomplish all the large battle scenes (The Prologue, Moria, so on) Overall: 40/40 One Word Review: Soincrediblyamazingitsalreadyalegend Good Enough?
6.0~An impossible task Fergoose Sign in Permalink A wonderful book, it was always going to be difficult to recreate it on the big screen. Whilst there is no denying the quality of the recreation of Middle Earth, this film is not without its bad points. Firstly, incidental music. Why so much? Can two characters not have an interaction without an orchestra dithering along in the background. Can actors not generate emotion without having to rely on music? I have never heard such an abundance of unnecessary music, at times it was reminiscent of a cheap Australian soap opera. Secondly, the acting. Whilst it is commendable to not select well known actors for every role, some of the actors, were simply not up to scratch and were unable to muster any sense of empathy in this disgruntled reviewers stoney heart. Thirdly, the love-interest *sighs*. Why must a mainstream film always shoe-horn in a wholly redundant love interest? Yes, it was in the book, but it was over-egged here. Fourth, Sam - please lord no! The main reason why I cannot even face the other two installments. In short, could have been great, but let down by irritating points which could have easily been avoided by better casting and more sensible use of music. 4 out of 10
10.0~A Film in the True Spirit of the Book. oscar-nicholson Sign in Permalink The big screen adaptation of Lord of the Rings, given the size of the books and Hollywood's need to fit films into a certain amount of reserve shall we say, but to my amazement they did a damn good job. Peter Jackson did an amazing job trying to balance to need to please everybody Those who live and breathe the books, and those who just want to see a good film, but have never read the books. Peter Jackson's decision to film all the three films in the trilogy at the same time I think was the first time anybody had done this. What would the results be? I mean it had to be better than the 70's cartoon version but to the extent it was surprised me completely. I do wonder about some of the skipped scenes from the book, for example why Mary and Pippin joined without Sam and Frodo even batting an eyelid. There weren't best friends really before this trip. Also in the book Aragorn has to prove himself to Sam and Frodo, this isn't required in the film. But there are the only negatives. I especially liked Elrond's council I thought it was done extremely well, I liked the way they used voice over work to explain some of the background with reduced the need for screen time and increased the dramatic tension. Further I think it was a stroke of genius increasing Arwen's role and helps the viewers to understand more about the relationship she has with Aragorn. I also liked to romance between Aragon and Arwen. In the book Tolken failed to explain fully this relationship which in the 3rd part of the trilogy affected the impact the characters had. I have to say and did say earlier the balance between fanatic and casual fan was perfect. Nobody argues you have to adjust scenes shorten, move around, generally increase the dramatic tension, its just not possible to take the story directly from the book word for word Its a film in the true spirit of the book. Excellent.
1.0~people who really "get" Tolkien will not admire this film loverealfilm Sign in Permalink ***spoilers*** 1st- whoever wrote and agreed to the musical score should be railroaded out of town. there is less sap in a pine tree. was this movie "Titanic"? It would have been better if Max Steiner was scoring, and some of you know my irony. God! I thought I saw Kate Winslet playing Sam and kissing Frodo in a boat headed toward Mordor! This music sucked out any solid substance which this film might have built on, and substituted thick sugary emptiness. 2nd- Directors should stop forcing actors to be part of the set. When Liam Neeson said he would never act in a Hollywood movie again, he blamed Georgle Lucas for treating him like a prop. TFOTR is a disaster on par with Phantom Menace. Almost every scene in this movie is storyboarded like a cheap comicbook, without any of the redeeming values that can be found in good animation or adventure. Try Akira or Princess Mononoka (sp?) to guess what magic is supposed to be in fantasy. If you are a true fan of fantasy you appreciate characters that you learn to love, characters you connect with. These hobbits have less of a fellowship than NYC neighbors. Who are Sam, Pippen, etc? If you never read the book this movie doesn't tell you, and in the movie they are just dead space. Nor do you learn about or admire Aragorn, Legolas, (the elves are ALL wrong, except maybe Galadriel in her tiny scene), the dwarf, or even Frodo. Gandalf and Bilbo make a good early impression on the audience, and shine through at moments, but the other members of the party are nothing but one-dimensional bodies. Where is the ethereal, near Godhood of the Elves? Where the grudging likeability of the Dwarves, the nobility and dignity of the Humans? Aragorn looks and acts like a 80's hairband rockstar, and the boy-Elf is from N'Synch. Even the normally reliable Bean as Borimor is lost in the onslaught of Hollywood's pandering, restrictive manipulation. I bet if you like TFOTR you loved "Sixth Sense," it used the same "methods" of movie construction employed here. I could rant on and on about the cheesy closeups, or the "oh so pitiful" and confused looks on the suffering, put-upon faces everytime something happened..."now we're scared, now we're shocked, now we're running and swinging swords"....PUKE! Not one glimpse of real characters on a real mission to save all life from evil. Have you ever seem "Wages of Fear" from the '53? Even without characterization you need convincing action like in "Blackhawk Down" to make you feel a battleship bond. 3. I have to give credit to the design effects here. The opening scenes in Mordor and the Shire are very good, and the castles and volcanoes are frightening. There is little of the obvious computerness of the "Mummy", in comparison. I thought Sauron, the digital sets, the "dragon" firework, the wizard battle, and few other scenes were intense and on the mark. The wraiths were predictable wimps who stood around in a clump pointing swords at people, and most battle scenes were hatchet edit jobs like the haphazard junk we've seen in "Gladiator", but worse. The gestation of the Uruk-Hai was suitably horrific, but aftwards he was a mockery of himself as his scary face came huffing and puffing along..."look out! it's the 'Predator' coming!!! Run!"...How silly...but the love scene between Borimor and Aragorn afterwards is sillier. Basically there is no drama about war, adventure, or heroism here, just B-movie "radioactive-man" bad guys, (except Saruman) and "singing cowboy" good guys. after 3 hours of more and more insults, then 40 minutes writing this, I'm tired. I could hammer this flick for days....but just let me say I really wanted to like this film, but it's not good. The system of making movies today is fundamentally flawed, which represents a sickness in our culture. If you can't or won't recognize that fact, you are part of the problem. I don't claim to know much about the world, or life, but I know this much; The spirit of Tolkien, which is the spirit of the universe, is not in this film, nor will it be in the others. No technically brilliant, 30 second clip, (even if it momentarily makes you exist in Middle Earth), can truly help you into another world in order to for you to understand more about your own. Tolkien was a great mythologist, humanist, and philosopher, and the wonder of living was in his words. That magic is not present here.(mostly) I'm sorry.
10.0~Bring the Magic Back to Movies noralee Sign in Permalink Seeing "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" made me feel like a kid again, bringing me back to 1958 watching "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad" with Ray Harryhausen's heroic special effects. "LOTR" claims its rightful place as one of the founts of inspiration for "Star Wars," with its conflicted good guys up against a growing stronger evil -- that resonates in a post-9/11 world as it must have for Tolkien post-WWI and concurrent with WWII (and eerily like HBO's "Band of Brothers"). The cast of Brits, Americans and Antipodeans (including obscure favorites of mine from Brit TV and indie movies) team up amidst special effects that are thrilling yet comprehensibly old-fashioned. In terms of comparing it to the book, I'm one of possibly two or three Baby Boomers who didn't read "The Hobbit" and "The Fellowship of the Ring" until this month (and will wait to complete the rest of the cycle in time for the following two movies), so I was both fresher to the material and less fanatical about it than some, including clarifications of some bits that I had misunderstood in the book. I appreciated some of the telescoping of details (such as combining the elf princess Arwen, as played by Liv Tyler, with a legendary princess' love story) and missed others (by leaving out Tom Borondil and his mate the River's Daughter, the brightness of nature is left out, making for a darker movie than even the book). The endless exposition in the book is handled well, as both voice overs and through flash-back demonstrations. The final DVD will include deleted scenes. Particularly well-handled is graphically showing the tempting danger of the Ring's evil power, on others and on Frodo -- a key difference in the mature themes of "LOTR" in comparison to "The Hobbit." I was disappointed that the songs and mythic poetry were barely replaced by Enya's hardly noticeable background music. (originally written 12/29/2001)
10.0~The ultimate story telling gila_film Sign in Permalink LOTR:Fellowship Of The Ring is definitely a master in film history. I never saw a film that's so perfect. There's nothing wrong with this film. Drama, horror, action, epic and adventure in just one film, can you imagine that? The best film ever made! I don't know what else to say. I just want to worship this film, and I hope all the two LOTR films can be great like this. 10/10
10.0~A faultless production only leaves me panting for the next 2. ashley-6 Sign in Permalink i was completely blown away by this fantastic faultless production. Everything was perfect, location, acting, atmosphere, effects, editing, music, casting - I couldn't get enough of it and can hardly wait for the next two releases as long as the producers can maintain the continuity of excellence.
10.0~Oh... the brilliance that is Peter singedelopera Sign in Permalink The more and more one thinks of it, the more one reads Tolkien and appreciates it, the more and more brilliant this movie becomes. Unlike Harry Potter, whose scenes were completely stripped from the book and had no imagination of its own (not to mention details that were changed for no good reason), this work not only has a soul of its own, but manages to keep with Tolkien's original work... I love this film! Tis Brilliance! A word on Casting: perfect. My only qualm is that Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) was a little iffy. Tolkien makes it a very clear that there is no evil in Galadriel or Lothlorien, but the audience never really gets this as we are all wondering if her skin is going to shed violently to reveal a hideous monster in the service of Sauron. Nothing to depreciate the value that is this film though. The emotional range is perfect, the quirkiness of the hobbits is perfect, the cast of characters is perfect... I LOVE YOU PETER! Now it is up to them not to ruin the next two. As Peter has done so well with the first one, however, I don't see how he or his writing team could. 10/10
10.0~An absolutely incredible film! NRGWasp Sign in Permalink Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own. Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch). The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself. The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters. What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!
10.0~Some thoughts on a great movie. *spoilers* dcorr123 Sign in Permalink I must first confess my own bias: I've been a longtime fan of LOTR, having read the work several times since the 60's as well as other Tolkien works. When I first heard of the project to make the movie, about a year and half before its release, my initial thought was: New Zealand?, Egad! That's where the Hercules and Xena TV series were made. What was produced, instead, far exceeded my expectations. Thank you New Zealand and Peter Jackson. I won't attempt rating LOTR against movies like The Godfather or Casablanca. That would be comparing apples and oranges; but within its genre LOTR stands alone. Concerning length: We live in an impatient world. If one finds three hours too long for a movie, how long will it take them to read the book. For myself, I was amazed that three hours went by so quickly. Concerning cliches: Many negative reviewers complain of this. All cliches have a point of origin, at which time they are not cliches. If one didn't take that into consideration, much of the World's great literature would be regarded as collections of cliches, e.g. the works of Shakespeare. At the time Tolkien produced his works fantasy literature hardly qualified as a genre. Most of what existed was from ancient or medieval sources. The enormous subsequent growth of the genre, as well as Dungeons and Dragons games and such is a product of Tolkien's influence. Concerning faithfulness to the original: I have seen few novels, or even short stories, faithfully adapted to the screen. Some, in fact, are hardly recognizable as the original story. This movie is a more faithful adaptation than most works. Indeed, I have seen few movies based on *actual* history done with much accuracy to historical fact, including *Best Movie* Oscar winners. I see nothing wrong with substituting Arwen for Glorfindel in *Flight to the Ford*. Glorfindel had no subsequent relevance to the story and there's nothing wrong with introducing more romantic interest into the story. I do wish *The Council of Elrond* was longer. At 32 pages, it is the longest chapter in LOTR and, in my opinion, has much of interest even if lacks action. Of course, since they already showed Saruman's treason as a separate scene, that part isn't necessary but there was a great deal more in that chapter. In fact, now that I write this, it occurs to me that some of the other events discussed in the Council could have been treated in a like manner thus illustrating the breadth of the threat. I have mixed feelings about excluding Tom Bombadil. His nature and role in the story have long been the subject of speculation among Tolkein *scholars* and there have been reams written about that subject. One part that does bother me a bit, is the gift giving in *The Farewell to Lorien* (which is in the extended DVD but not the theatrical release). In the movie Galadriel gives Sam a coil of Elven rope as his gift. In the book, coils of rope were part of the standard equipment. Sam was instead given a box of the soil of Lorien and a seed of a mallorn tree, appropriate for a gardener. This would become a great boon to Sam's work of restoring the damaged Shire in the last chapter of LOTR. My initial thought was that this indicated that last chapter would be cut from *The Return of the King*. It is anticlimactic for modern audiences. I did notice however that Sam's daughter Elanor is listed as a character in the final movie. Hopefully Galadriel will yet give Sam that gift. Concerning casting: I initially had reservations about the casting of Frodo. In the book Frodo was 50 (although that's equivalent to early 30s for a human) and Hobbits are described as having faces that are *good natured rather than beautiful*, etc. Elijah Wood pulled it off very nicely anyway. While I concur with the praise for Ian McKellen's performance, I would like to say that I thought Ian Holms' performance as Bilbo was even better, even if it was a smaller role. I also much liked Sean Bean's performance as Boromir.
10.0~Awesome ginger-white Sign in Permalink I know it's been out for a while, but it is still awesome. Great cast of actors. Awesome work!! I have not enjoyed a movie so much in my life, I could watch it over and over and over if I had the time, but of course I have to do something constructive with my life and my employer won't stand for it.
3.0~WHAT A JOKE! mortone31 Sign in Permalink That this movie could be #1 on IMDB's list only shows that there are major problems with how that list is generated. I dislike critics as much as anyone, but there needs to be some safeguard against droves of mindless fans exulting a movie that has little more going for it than hype and special effects. To be fair, the acting was very good, but I can't say more for it because the utter lack of character development in the film ruined any chance for great performances. Others have already pointed out how cliche most of the scenarios and action was and how long the film dragged on for, so I'll just mention my major complaint - the complete lack of continuity, in any respect. A perfect microcosm was the horse chase where Arwen is at one moment surrounded by the dark riders, who seem to ride at twice her speed to catch up, while in the next cut she has somehow opened up a thirty foot lead - pretty typical of bad action movies, but not of the best movie of all time! Poor portrayal action is only a minor complaint, but continuity is lacking on a much grander scale in this film. Characters just don't have any consistent qualities - is Sam really very close to Frodo? or is that just how hobbits are? How could the great Gandalf have been so mistaken about his mentor? The groups decisions while treking through middle earth are asinine - they are halfway across a mountain range and then decide to head back and go through a hellish cavern where they are sure to die. All this because Frodo gave the ok, but who would expect reason from a group that decided to bring along three extra bumbling fools, as if defeating the supreme evil power wasn't challenge enough. I could go on and on, but this movie isn't worth the webspace. I just hope that in the end people see some reason and give it the 3 or 4 out of 10 it deserves.
9.0~No one could have done better than Jackson did! artemis_5 Sign in Permalink I have read "The Hobbit" and the "Lord of the Rings" (I read "The Fellowship of the Ring" twice) and I think that Peter Jackson did the best that he could with the story. The book is more than 400 pages long and very intricate. To maintain complete accuracy and capture every charming little nook and cranny in Tolkien's novel would take far more than three hours. The spirit of Middle-earth is evident through its occupants (i.e. hobbits, dwarves, elves, and humans), who are accurately portrayed in the movie. Kudos to each of the actors for their excellent portrayals: Elijah, Ian M., Sean A., Dominic (sp?), Billy, Orlando, John, Hugo, Cate, Sean B., Viggo, Liv, Christopher, Ian H. (did I leave anyone out?). A special kudos to the younger actors, who showed a great deal of maturity in their portrayals. I can't wait for the other two "Lord of the Rings" movies to come out.
9.0~Artan Avdiu artanavdiu Sign in Permalink Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well- made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.
1.0~Dull, Pretentious, Stupid and Uninspiring skeletor500 Sign in Permalink First of all, I think this film suffered due to the arrogance of the filmakers. Before it's release, the cast and crew were going around saying things like "you've never seen anything like this!" and "I cried and you will to!". Well sorry but I have this before. ALL OF IT! There is absolutely nothing in this film that is new and in fact it seems in places like a cut and paste job from other movies. Sleepy Hollow, Jason and the Argonauts, First Knight, Camelot, Willow, The Ten Commandments, and so on. They're all represented here and some of the shots are identical to shots in those movies. And no I didn't cry because ALL of the characters are so unlikeable. What you have here is a bunch of second rate actors(Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee aside} portraying a bunch of unlikeable and dull characters. Characters who for most of the movie, run away, meet some bad guys, run away, meet some more bad guys, run away again and this keeps happening until the end. Except there is no end!!!! It just stops in a cynical ploy to get you to go and see the next movie. The story is boring and has no narrative drive. It's supposed to be an adventure story but where is the adventure?! There is no tension or excitement. And the action scenes are so muddled that it shows Peter Jackson up for the amature that he is. He should have stuck to B movies. The plot is ridiculous. A magic ring which somehow has magic powers must be taken to the "Dark Gloomy Mountain Of Murder" or something like that, and our "heroes" decide to do it without any real questions. From then we meet a mirage of incredibly embarassing creatures like Elves and Goblins and some CGI monsters which are so badly animated that it takes any realism out of the film. But the worst thing is that everyone takes things so incredibly serious! Are you not allowed to laugh in middle-earth? Everyone is so po-faced. The film has no zip. No spark and is instantly forgettable.
10.0~Favorite Film Of All Time. gagman Sign in Permalink If I need to choose between my favorite movies, then this is my favorite movie of all time."One Ring to rule them all..." This trilogy is also one of the top ones (trilogies) that could rule them all. A great start to a wonderful saga and series. The story, Acting, costumes , music etc. are so Perfect, you will need to see the movie many times to see everything. And love everything all over again! The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes. Huge thing I loved about the whole "The Lord Of The Rings" and "Hobbit" trilogies are when the characters walking to their destination and you watching them from above with breath stopping music. simply - One Film To Rule Them ALL With Passion.
10.0~wow rimohit Sign in Permalink spoilers! (like anyone cares) This movie is one major masterpiece and I'm glad I've seen it (7 times). This is what I liked about it: The batlescenes are realy intence. They keep you on the edge of your seats. The special efects are made with great care and you can't realy see most of them cuz they are imported so smoothly. Yet they tend to show off sometimes (camera following the arrow of Legolas in Moria), but not as nearly as this happened in Star Wars. This movie's efects will not ware off so quickly as they did in Star Wars becose they are not used in souch an obvious way. Most of the changes to the plot were done proffesionaly and with taste. The music has been done wery well and it blends into the movie most of the time. I was realy suprised by the choise of the black riders theme (not bad). The casting was made better than I thought it would be. Picking the actors that are not known by the most of audience was a great move (since it would be harder to concentrate on the characters and there would be always someone it the theater saying "Look, it's ***** *****!"). They all did a nice job. PJ was epic in his painting the relationships betwean the characters (but I'm so sick and tired of idiotic people asking "Is Frodo gay?") The details in the "background" are the things that makes this movie great. I only discovered the trolls that have been turned to stone (from Hobbit) in my 7th watching (you can see them when the party stops to get medicine for Frodo's wound). Did you notice that everyone is wearing an elvish cloak when they leave Galadriel? Did you see Peter Jackson in Bree!? This is what I didn't like: Some changes to the Midlearth, like making people think that Shire is made out of Hobbiton, a road and some fields. Legolas and the rest of the elves are not done well. Elves in the book like singing, joking and laughing. We just don't see that in Legolas. The dwarves are made too funny and I don't like that. The counsil at Rivendell is made 7h and 45 minutes too short (I don't mean the screening time). There's 15 minutes of boaring scenes (I didn't know should I put this into positive or negative). The Bree has been made too dark and unpleasent, and also lacked the hobbits that live there. I don't like Arowen's character being so important. After viewing this film for more times than any other I give this movie a solid 7/10....just kidding ;-) the only score that fits for this movie is 11/10
10.0~Forget the cinema version motor89 Sign in Permalink I've waited until now to review The Fellowship of the Ring, even though I saw it last January at the cinema, because I wanted to review the real version... the so-called "extended version." Well, I've just seen the real version -- and it is head and shoulders above the butchered version shown at the cinema. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the original release, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I watching a speeded up version. A version that rockets from battle to battle with little or no explanation or slow-down. I put this down to Peter Jackson trying to fit it all in and forgave it. Then I heard of the "extended version", with 30 minutes of extra footage chopped out of the original release... presumably because it would have bumped the viewing time up to an unmanagable (for mainstream picture houses) 3 and a half hours. The longer version is a much, *much* better viewing experience. It takes its time to explain things... it paces itself, and you don't get the feeling that it is a dizzying ride between impressive fight sequences. The characters are fuller... Hobbiton is not just a place where Frodo starts out, it becomes a home with relatives and culture that Frodo wants to protect by leaving with the Ring. Most important of all: Lothlorien isn't just a stop off point and a light show, it now has a purpose and plot points that will be important in later films. Boromir is also a more fleshed-out character and not just a man who goes mad with desire for the Ring. It's all a much more enjoyable experience. Forget about the cinema edit... the extended version isn't just some BS director's cut. It's how it was meant, and should, be seen.
10.0~To those that do not like LotR Laecy Sign in Permalink There are three kinds of people who do not like the movie and/or the books of Lord of the Rings. Those who cannot appreciate it, those that will not, and those who have not had the patience to do so yet. There are people who go to movies simply for the thrill factor. Or the romance. Or some other canned emotion. I don't have anything against that; I am a big fan of animated children's movies for that very reason. You can use movies as a tool to manipulate your own mood. The Fellowship movie provides the thrills and pretty girls necessary for this, but anyone who can only absorb this superficial layer of the story will feel there is something missing, because they are unable comprehend the true depth of the story being brought to life. Not to mention the fact that the movie is not an entire story. Anyone seeking emotional stimulus will leave very frustrated because this movie is merely the beginning of the story. Then there are those who claim to be able to appreciate a movie on many levels and assert this one does not hold up for varied reasons. They claim the story was flat, the acting was cheap, or the world unbelievable. Criticisms of the story must be held off until all the films can be viewed in succession. Unlike Harry Potter or Star Wars, each segment of the trilogy does not have a beginning middle and end that tie together into one big picture. The three Lord of the Rings movies ARE the beginning, middle, and end. The story was not written in volumes, intended each to be taken as a whole. This was not a three-hour movie; it was the first third of a nine-hour movie. As for criticisms of the acting, I'm tempted to say they are just preposterous. Perhaps you have to have read the novel in order to really understand how well the characters were brought to life. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf seems to be the best acting in history. If the hobbits seem too simple and childlike, it is what hobbits are. And no one but hobbits, desiring nothing but to return to their fat and everyday life in the Shire, could have both the will to do anything to protect that life and the unconcern necessary to avoid being tempted by the Ring. Sean Bean's Boromir is more believable even, I think, than Tolkien's. He takes the MAN character from the book and makes Boromir a man we all are very much aware that we could become. The absolute worst thing that could be said about the acting is that once you see the movie for the fifth or sixth time, you start to see the actor's own opinions of the story as they react to events, rather than only the character's. As for the world being unbelievable, IT IS A FANTASY STORY!!!!! If you want realism read anything from Shakespeare to Tom Clancy. If you read Tolkien, you will get elves and trolls and magic rings. And finally, there are people who just don't appreciate the story YET. I must admit, I did not like the movie the first time I saw it in the theater. It is simply too much to assimilate in one sitting. You walk away with deafened ears, a torn heart and glorious images of landscapes and battles flashing behind your eyes. If you leave it at that, this rushed and overwhelmed impression is all you will ever have. But if you take the time to read the book (more than once) and watch the movie enough times to not be swept away by the action, you can relax into the story and realize what a complete and rich world it really is. Middle Earth is not created with the Prologue and does not end with the credits. Life has existed long before Froddo and will continue long after Aragorn. In the book, you even get a sense of life going on in Middle Earth having little to do with the War of the Rings. The book is like taking a vacation in another country. You'll catch as many of the highlights as you can, but looking at the architecture and talking to a few of the natives is a sadly narrow glimpse into the richness of any culture. The movie tells one of the most important stories of this culture, but does not give you as deep a sense of it as the book, mainly through the omissions of Tom Bombadil and lyrical references to the world's own mythology and legends. All in all, the movie adaptation is as glorious a representation of the novel as the novel is a sumptuous experience of the world of Middle Earth.
1.0~A Dissenting Voice thecomma_king Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings should be a good movie. No, a great movie--the next Star Wars, the next Terminator. But it's not, not even close. This review will anger many, and before I rip into the film, I will admit that I can understand this film's appeal, with its epic scale, its solemn tone, and its origin in a book beloved by many. That said, however, this is a bad movie. One reason is that all the characters have the same personality--and a boring one at that. This problem is what I call the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Fallacy." In the first live-action theatrical film based on the turtles, all the turtles had the same personality. Not only did they resemble one another physically, but they all acted the same, all of them little more than green surfer-dude clones, constantly spewing unfunny wisecracks and slang-peppered sentences. If their masks were all the same color, no one could tell them apart. At least, though, their shared personality was an interesting, semi-entertaining one--unlike the mono-personality in LOTR. Like the turtles, every character in the latter film acts the same. Unlike the turtles, unfortunately, they all share a boring personality--that of a stodgy British English professor. All the characters utter each sentence with the utmost gravity, never displaying even a hint of a sense of humor. Although it's fine for a film to have one or two gravely serious characters, a movie filled with nothing but such characters quickly becomes tedious. And tedium abounds in LOTR, with each humorless character intoning innumerable lines of dull exposition. Because all the characters possess the same personality, it's difficult for me (someone who has not read Tolken's books) to differentiate among them. In many cases, to sort out the characters, I must rely on appearance alone. For instance, the only difference between the Spock-eared archer and the sword-wielding warrior is their appearance; they act and talk the same. Not even the main protagonist--Frodo--has a likable or memorable personality. Like the other characters, he's deadly serious at all times. In addition, he's too sissy to come across as a main protagonist, constantly fleeing from danger, usually too frightened to act. Since many people have compared the cinematic exploits of Frodo and friends to Star Wars, the inevitable comparison of Frodo and Luke Skywalker comes up. Like Frodo, Luke is young and inexperienced. But, unlike Frodo, Luke has a personality; sure, it's an annoying, whiny personality, but a personality nonetheless. Frodo is a cipher, a boring weakling incapable of carrying the crushing weight of a massive sci-fi trilogy on his tiny shoulders. Perhaps, though, an action/sci-fi epic doesn't need a hero with a strong personality. After all, a strong villain can sometimes carry such a film. But LOTR lacks even this necessary component. For whatever reason, not even the venerable Christopher Lee could imbue his character, the evil wizard Saruman, with an adequate level of villainy. Shrouded in a white robe, his long gray hair flowing behind him, Lee looks impressive but is given little to do, merely issuing commands to prosthetics-covered henchmen, never able to establish a menacing tone. Nor does Saruman's deadly-serious personality differ from that of all the other characters. Many will no doubt counter my criticism of Saruman by pointing out that he is not the main villain, a role reserved for Sauron, the mighty embodiment of evil. Granted, Sauron makes an impressive, albeit brief, appearance, single-handedly annihilating entire battalions of soldiers. Unfortunately, this appearance, little more than a two-minute cameo, fails to save an otherwise dull movie. It's too bad that, because Peter Jackson had to stay faithful to the book, he couldn't save Sauron's appearance for a climactic battle to end the film. The ending, as it stands, is a non-ending, the type of ending that provokes the viewer to say, "What the? The movie's over just like that?" In fact, when I saw this film in the theater, several moviegoers made statements similar to this one as the movie ended. The non-ending is especially infuriating in an epic of this scale, for the viewer, after investing three hours, expects a pull-out-all-the-stops conclusion. And, yes, I realize that, because this epic consists of several films, the best climax must be saved for the final part, but part one could nevertheless have ended on a stronger note--perhaps on the battle with the flame demon. This film contains innumerable flaws, but because I can write only 1000 words, I can't cover them all. I can only hope that, one day, most movie fans will see this movie for what it is--three hours of tedious torture masquerading as a classic.
10.0~This is undoubtedly the best film ever! Theme_Park_Boy Sign in Permalink This is the best film ever. And that's not just in the fantasy genre, i mean out of all the films i have ever seen, this IS the best! It has stunning Visual FX, I especially liked the battle scene in Moria and at Amon Hen (the bit at the end near the waterfall). The makeup and costumes were brilliantly done and looked better than I imagined them to look from the descriptions in the book. I think that New Zealand was the perfect setting for LOTR. It has everything you need to make a film of LOTR: Mountains, Plains, Rivers, Waterfalls etc. I cant wait for The Two Towers to come out, and, from the DVD's preview of it, it looks to be even greater than 'The Fellowship Of The Ring'. 10 of 10, i think if they had just an OSCARS award night for the Fantasy Genre, LOTR would take every award. A bit of advice for every one, Buy the videos or DVD's of all the LOTR films when they all come out even if you don't like fantasy, then at least if you don't like it, you can sell it in the future in an auction as a collector's item for a big price.
7.0~Could have made much more of an impact, but man is it still something. orourkec-292-269155 Sign in Permalink It's my honor and pleasure ladies and gents to write my first review of The Lord of the Rings to you, a film that was a famed obsession of mine when I was a small child. The third one is my favorite film of all time as of now, and I will be even more excited when I eventually end up writing this one review in particular to you. Just saying. But, let's begin rolling now shall we. Here we go. In this beautifully scripted and finely directed first movie to a now legendary trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has astonishing, Oscar-winning special effects (even if not all of them are quite "there" yet, which is a bit disappointing but understanding and forgiving for the time this was all made), and more importantly still, a classic and epic tale of good versus evil that's fascinating, at the menu. Though the film frustrates me for the fact that it fails to offer me such a compelling, powerful, and unforgettable experience, I still very much praise the film overall, if just not for its intellectual level unfortunately. The cast of The Fellowship of the Ring is excellent and flawless. And each one of the characters brings exactly the right kind of tone that's needed for the movie. The redefinition of the fantasy film genre in general is also a striking element in here that's worth taking into account, and this is made notably clear by the fearsome, first-time appearance of the menacing Ring Wraiths, mysterious black riders without a face (what?), and the frightening, burning Eye of Sauron (oh dear) whom we all know is the main antagonist, the truest villain of this trilogy - the Ring Wraiths being only the minor, yet still principal villains of the franchise, but just serving Sauron for his evil purposes of conquering and dominating the whole of Middle- Earth. But that's not all there is to say of positive. There's also that scene fight in the movie which takes place inside the Mines of Moria and finds the Wizard Gandalf opposing the fiery and monstrous Balrog, a devilish cinematic creation of first class, a true monster, and which is my favorite scene in the whole film and which for sure gotta be the best one in the film for anyone. I'm in love with that scene and it keeps playing back in my mind at times, particularly the moment in the beginning of the second movie already which curiously looks back at that scene specifically again and gives an extended insight of the aftermath of Gandalf's brave and ruthless one-stand fight against the Balrog, as we all witness his unexpected and tragic fate when he accidentally ends up falling down with the Balrog... and deep down you see him go, with the camera following closely all the way. This one I have to say really feels like a pure and iconic redefinition of a movie character's courageous and mortal sacrifice to save all others. Talking about that, the Ring also is something of a pure and iconic redefinition: a simple, innocent-like ring object, yet which carries the doom to befall the whole world and which must be destroyed in order to end all evil currently spreading. But that I believe is more obvious. Or is it? For further comments, I definitely praise the actor Ian MacKellen (is that how you spell his name?!) who shines in his performance as Gandalf, the memorable music, stunning cinematography, neat editing, grabbing opening narrative (with the right kind of voice) which really helps settle the mood for the viewers for when the plot starts to kick in, the film-mic look of JRR. Tolkien's Middle-Earth universe, subtle filming, and decent plotting. As you can clearly see for yourself, so many good things to point out about The Fellowship of the Ring. To Peter Jackson and his whole film-making crew that contributed to the making of this film, I say well done to them, for they all did an impressive job on this movie. They all worked well here. Keep it up. And for you guys, see you all in my next review for the sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers. I hope you enjoyed reading this review I just wrote. My rating for The Fellowship of the Ring: 7.0, 1 or 2/10
10.0~pure movie critique gutterbox20 Sign in Permalink i for one did not read any of the LOTR books. what i know about the series is what little i read of The Hobbit four long years ago. so going into the movie theatre i had the benefit of not knowing anything other than jrr tolkien had written the original story! i had the best time watching it. compared to my friends who had read FOTR recently i enjoyed it better. i didn't nitpick about details because it's really hard to nitpick about something i didn't know anything about. my only complaint is that i didn't really follow the story what with the names and such. actually that's not entirely true. the visual FX of the movie just really blew me away. the middle part of the movie was a little less exciting compared to the rest of the movie. i was by no means bored but it was definitely less action packed. but the last scene just drew my right back. i couldn't believe the movie was over! but then again the movie wasn't exactly over...there are just 2 one-year intermissions!
10.0~Wonderful interpretation anjabro33 Sign in Permalink Wonderful movie...I'm glad that the movie business left it alone until it could be done properly...ever since I saw Terminator 2 ,I thought,this is it,they can do anything they want with special effects now,LOTR must be coming soon...well,it took a while,but they did get it right;From watching it,I can only assume that Jackson is a Tolkien geek,which is great,that's exactly the sort of person who should have got to do it.Amazingly ,for what is presumably going to be a 9 hour movie,there is still a lot missing from the book,but,fair enough I suppose..I would have liked to see more of the relationship between Legolas and Gimli..It's not really clear in the first installment that their respective races have a touch of antagonism between them,and this makes me wonder whether their blossoming friendship,which I found to be one of the most moving parts of the Two Towers,will be overlooked in the next installment..I hope not,as Legolas is an extraordinary character in the movie. But,that is mere hair splitting;a wonderful movie,wonderful visuals,and the bravery to cast people who are right for the parts,rather than A list 'names'..Keep it up for the next two parts....9.5 out of 10,go and see it(and read the book)
2.0~One word missing from Jackson's vocabulary: Subtle ericksob Sign in Permalink The charm of the books is the complexity, nuance, and realistic details given to the characters and the story. But Jackson feels he must prove that he's telling an epic story by not allowing the viewer to think for him- or herself. Speaking of a lack of subtlety, what about the visual effects? I had heard that they were done "tastefully," so that they didn't intrude on the story or characters. Unfortunately, they were overblown, often unrealistic, and simply there to WOW an audience. The camera movements in Mordor were particularly distracting. It seemed like an entirely other movie spliced in at random junctures. The quick movement of a camera through mostly computer-generated scenery isn't a new technique and probably won't be a classic one. Jackson needs to decide what kind of movie he is making. The most unfortunate event was the business of a giving a novice the task of writing the screenplay for one of the 20th century's greatest novels. Very few talented writers could measure up to the assignment, but at least there would be warmth, humor, complexity, a lack of cliche, subtlety, etc! Finally, I must ask myself this question: If I saw the movie but hadn't read the book, would I like it? The answer is - barely, and then I'd forget about it. Simply put, if this had been an original idea with Jackson and his posse, the lines at the movie theater would be shorter than this review.
10.0~Fantastic achievement stevene20 Sign in Permalink Peter Jacksons' first major task was to make Lord of the Rings into one film. "Impossible", Peter Jackson said, there was no way he could fit all the information into one film. But one of the producers in New Line Cinema said why not make three films because there is three books. It was exactly what the crew making the film wanted to hear. So then the scripts were re-writ to fit three films. After the theatrical release, director Peter Jackson wanted to create an extended version for each film. This was because Peter Jackson wanted to capture it for posterity. The Lord of the Rings was a cinematic masterpiece, the greatest book of the 20th Century was made into the greatest film trilogy of the 21st Century. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story of a young hobbit, Frodo, who has inherited a magical ring from his uncle,Bilbo. Then Gandalf the Wizard explains the shadow of the past and that the ring is extremely powerful. Then he must set out on a quest to destroy the One Ring and stop the dark lord Sauron gain dominance of Middle- Earth. With the help of a fellowship, three hobbits, a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, and two men help Frodo to achieve his task. This is a fantastic film, which makes an unforgettable experience.
10.0~A amazing start to one of the best trilogies ever williambendavis-933-218958 Sign in Permalink I have to say Peter Jackson did a freaking amazing job at translating this into film. He got everything down to a tee. The sweeping cinematography captures the enormousness of Middle Earth as well as provides for some beautiful eye candy. The combination of practical and special effects allow for some extraordinarily detailed scenes that really bring Tolkien's world to life. The casting is absolutely perfect. Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian Mckellan as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom as Legolas?, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Sean Bean as Boromir, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and Christopher Lee as Saruman? You simply cannot do better than that, and I applaud whoever did the casting. All these things come together to form a masterpiece of a film that is the start to one of the best trilogies of all time.
10.0~What an amazing movie! larrissaprather Sign in Permalink I watched the movies first before reading the books and after I read the book, The Fellowship of the Ring, I immediately fell in love and appreciated the small details that were put into the film. On its own the movies are great with no necessity to actually read the books, this is a very rare trait for a movie based on a book. Even rarer is when a movie adds in small details that only readers can recognize and appreciate. I have so much appreciation for the Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. Peter Jackson did an extraordinary job in fitting in so much information into such short time. I strongly recommend watching this movie. Every time I watch it I pick up new details and new hidden ideas and symbols that relate to the world. The story is amazing, however the graphics is absolutely marvelous. There were times I could believe in the world of Tolkien and Peter Jackson known as Middle Earth. I was drawn into the shire and the Misty Mountains. This movie brought Middle Earth to life through great graphics and even better acting. Ian McKellen has set the standards for Gandalf. Some actors become the character, others are the character. Ian is Gandalf. No one will ever be able to remake these movies because no one will ever be able to be Gandalf like Ian.
6.0~Beautiful, but still a sorely missed opportunity ovvldc Sign in Permalink I saw this film on sunday morning in a pre-screening organised for regular customers of a big department store. Don't ask me why, my mother has a card for the place and we got tickets. The film was directed by New Zealand director, Peter Jackson, who previously made Braindead, Bad Taste and Heavenly Creatures. The first impression of the film is that Jackson did a good job visually, but in his enthousiasm and personal interpretation screwed up the story. Anyone who has not read the book will probably be overwhelmed by this fantasy film and the amazing special effects in it. To one who knows the book, the film will be a missed opportunity to bring the story and especially the character development in Tolkien's work to the big screen. I will elaborate somewhat on all of these points. Visually, the film is overwhelming. From the cute homeliness of the Shire to the architecturals of Lothlorien to the tower of Orthanc in Isengard. From the hobbit 'look' to the Uruk-Hai, from Sauron's burning lidless eye to Galadriel's temptation, it looks stunning and the computer generated effects merge with the acting like few films have done before. The problem is mainly that the visual stuff receives too much attention. Jackson's roots in horror (even 'funny horror') are pretty obvious in this film. This is most evident in Bilbo's flash of rage when he cannot have the ring back in Rivendell. Very textbook horror film stuff. In the book, the mountain troll in the chamber of Mazarbul receives a wound in the foot and makes his exit after two lines. In the film, the Company fights it for five long minutes. The Watcher at the Hollin Gate does not come out of the water in the book. Silliest of all, the Balrog of Moria is a typical huge horned demon in the film and its arrival is announced in a very pompous fashion. The leads to the film's main flaws. First of all are the plot changes. Some of these are done in the interest of film length, such as cutting out the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil and most of the chase through the shire. The expanded role of Arwen is politically correcting but not of great consequence. Other things seriously screw up the story: In the film, Saruman is enslaved by Sauron and the whole process of the transformation of Isengard to a mimic of the Dark Tower and the creation of the Uruk Hai is broadly displayed. In the book, Saruman is out for power of his own and just mentioning that Saruman mixed the vile race of orcs with those of man is evidence enough that he is up to no good. Nor is there a telekinetic battle in the book in which Saruman captures Gandalf. Jackson appears to want one single evil in charge and does not use the corrupting temptations of power by itself. Herein a human dimension of the book is lost. Reversely, in the film Isildur is tempted by the promise of power when he takes the ring, thereby causing the Numenoreans to fall from grace. In the book, the ring is much more subtle and Isildur keeps it as a token for his fallen brother and father. In the film this results in Boromir blatantly coveting the ring even at the council of Elrond and portraying him like a fool when he does not know Aragorn. Worst of all, Aragorn is changed into part fighting machine (fighting off the five Nazgul at Weathertop singlehandedly) and part angelic Messiah (not being tempted by the ring and sending Frodo off to Mordor alone with a sorrowful smile). The third case is that in the film Saruman and Gandalf know of the Balrog of Moria, which is not in the book, nor does Gimli in the book invite them to Uncle Balin's mines. In the book, Gimli came to Rivendell to get word of Balin's mission to recapture Moria. The final thing to mention here is that in the film, the interplay between Gimli and Galadriel is entirely discarded, while in the book this contributes greatly to the friendship between Gimli and Legolas. All in all it makes the group hug at the end when they set after Pippin and Merry come out of thin air. The end result, to which other factors contribute is that many of the subtleties in the book are utterly lost. The One Ring actively talks to everyone and gets on people much more blatantly than in the book. Galadriel is portrayed like the Elven witch that rumour in the outside world would have her be. The Elves and Dwarves bicker openly at the first opportunity, rather than mistrusting each other because they are unfamiliar with each other. The saddest thing is that most of this could have been fixed easily. Galadriel could have had three more sentences at the Mirror, and all would be explained and within the storyline of the book. At least some attention could have been paid to the motivations of the characters, particularly for Frodo, Sam and Aragorn, but for all of the Fellowship to some degree. Kindness, doubt and grief at the many losses are a major part of the book but the film has just made no time for it. Instead, Jackson chose an action heavy film, thereby degrading a great book of fiction to an ordinary fantasy novel. The focus is on the visual horrors they encounter and the characters are propelled by some inbuilt fate or else by Elrond's mission decree. While I have seen worse, the source material has so much more debt that I cannot but call this film a sorely missed opportunity to bring Tolkien's book to life.
10.0~Overall a superb epic, but some may be disappointed. (SLIGHT SPOILER, NO BIG DEAL) Corpin Sign in Permalink I have been a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien (the author of the books The Lord of the Rings) for many, many years. When I found out that Peter Jackson was going to direct a movie based on Tolkien's epic books, I was ecstatic and, at the same time, worried. I did not think anyone could make a successful interpretation of the books and put it on the big screen. I was wrong. This movie is fantastic, and it brings us back to the old days of movies when you could watch a movie and be taken into another place for two hours or more. Epics have always been great movies. I cannot think of a single epic that has been a bad movie, and LOTR is no difference. Critics called Gladiator an epic, and it was, but Lord of The Rings is an ADVENTURE. This movie will take you far out of the movie theater, and into places that you can only imagine. Tolkien started what has become the traditional "fantasy" epic (elves, orcs, dwarves, et cetera). He also did it the best. Now, I know this is supposed to be about the movie, so I'll get right on it. The movie does a great job of bringing Tolkien's magic to the screen. He takes into account the fact that many people have NEVER read Tolkien's books, and does a great job of explaining anything a newcomer to the series would have to know. The movie is slightly confusing at times for those who do not know the characters, as the characters do not always call each other by their names (or at least not clearly). For example, (SLIGHT SPOILER), there are two human characters. Boromir and Aragorn. They happen to look slightly alike, and at one point a few of my friends who did not read the books were not sure who was who. (END SPOILER) Other than this, it was an easy to understand film. I'm not going to summarize the movie - that's what the trailers are for. Anyway, the movie has some wonderful battle scenes, although at times they are overly dramatic. Furthermore, there are a few long, drawn out pauses in the movie when action-movie fans will be bored. However, if you do your best to follow the story, they can be interesting. The movie IS long, 3 hours long, actually. Furthermore, the ending is not the standard "ending" of a movie. There is no clear end, because this is only the first installment of the series. There are three movies total, and this is only the first. Don't expect everything to wrap up at the end - its not going to. If you are not a Tolkien fan, I CANNOT guarantee you will love this movie. I can guarantee it is a fantastic movie, however, and that if you follow "suspension of disbelief" and accept the very few things you might not understand, you will enjoy it. If you ARE a Tolkien fan, and you haven't seen this movie, what are you waiting for? You'll adore it. Go, see it, when it comes out on dvd/vhs rent it or buy it. I'm anxiously awaiting The Two Towers (the next installment in the series) to come out :)
10.0~The Lord of the Rings trilogy has replaced the Star Wars prequel trilogy as the new science fiction franchise of the 21st century! TheMovieeGuy Sign in Permalink Wow, Peter Jackson has accomplished the impossible, by bringing the most beloved book series of the 20th century to audiences of the 21st century with magnificent results. The characters really stand out, the costumes are terrific, and the special effects really give Industrial Light and Magic a run for their money. It's a shame that Jackson didn't direct Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, because he would have brought a lackluster script to life! Peter Jackson has now become one of a very select group of directors such as Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to helm a true timeless masterpiece! Nominated for 13 academy awards and winner of four Oscars, The Fellowship of the Rings is one of the best films I have seen in over ten years! A 10 on a scale of 1-10!
10.0~Take the time to see this film. You will not be disappointed! nrwaters Sign in Permalink This was an increadably well made movie. The choice of actors were perfect and the suspence was right at the level where Tolkien would have been proud. The thought and work that was put into making this movie goes beyond what is normally put into films. The film draws the viewer into the the action which helps build and feel the relationships between the characters. These elements are what make such a great film.
10.0~How can a three hour during film entertain me? Bram-714-861615 Sign in Permalink Well, The lord of the rings make it possible. When I saw this film on one of my friends party, I didn't think that it's a boring film. Well, the landscapes are beautiful, when someone said that these film is real, i'll believe him. This film was filmed in the beautiful New Zealand. The Lord of the rings is almost perfect and i have never seen a better film in my life. The actors act good. The landscapes are perfect. The personages are real and the magic is real. There is no film which is whole perfect. Therefore i'll give this film a nine. The review in dutch can you find soon on kritiekopfilms.webklik.nl. For people who don't can English, this is the option.
10.0~The Greatest Film Ever Made! tiyusufaly Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring exemplifies a perfect film. It's has an excellent setting (Middle Earth), which is boosted to an exemplary setting because of it's outstanding detail. Peter Jackson did an outstanding job, and made me feel as if I was in Middle Earth myself. The characters are also outstanding. From Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), to Arwen, princess of Rivendell (Liv Tyler), they all exhibit an amazing amount of strength and courage. Such exhibition is shown when Gandalf the Grey bravely tries to destroy the great Orc. Though he dies in the process, he leaves behind a soul filled with astounding bravery. The plot of the film is also fantastic. This is due to the fact that the producers chose to screenwrite arguably J.R.R Tolkien's greatest work. I cannot believe it took someone so long to decide to create a film out of this masterpiece of literature. The adaptation exemplified what the book was about. It covered most of the details, from the shire in Hobbiton, all the way to the caves of Mount Doom. The acting is superb! Elijah Wood, Sir Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, and the rest all play their roles beautifully. Peter Jackson did a fine job! If only the Academy Idiots could see what I see... Fellowship of the Ring deserved Best Picture a googol (1 with a hundred zeros) times more than A Beautiful Mind. Peter Jackson also deserved Best Director a googol times more than Ron Howard. But hey, what can you expect? The Academy is one of the most inaccurate Award groups that there is. Examples: Shawshank Redemption (#2 on the IMDB) AND Pulp Fiction (#14) lost to Forrest Gump (#144); LA Confidential (#38) AND Good Will Hunting (#183) lost to Titanic; Saving Private Ryan (#36) lost to Shakespeare in Love (#246); Goodfellas (#20) lost to Dances With Wolves; Raiders of the Lost Ark (#14) lost to Chariots of Fire, and so on and so forth. So as you can clearly see, if something comes out of the Academy, it's about as valuable as..........well how about that? I can't find anything less valuable than an Academy Award. An Academy Award should be voted for by the people, just like American Democracy. We've been doing that for over 200 years with American Presidents, and we've very rarely gone wrong. So, I hope that happens sometime soon. Anyways, in conclusion, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made!
10.0~Great Movie MovieFan-83 Sign in Permalink I purchased the DVD today and watched this movie again for the third time (I have seen it twice in the cinema last Christmas already). Still enjoy it and I can not wait to see the Two Towers. Great movie and definitely on top of my list.
10.0~The Only Movie Better Than The Classic Book jeclft Sign in Permalink I have to say this is the best movie I have ever seen on my 31 years on this planet. I can't put into words how I feel about this cineamatic wonder....It by far ranks among the classic if not THE most Classic flick ever to be shot and captured on film. The only complaint I have is about all the extra Buy this Buy that game. Widescreen-Fullscreen-Criterion _BLah Blah BLah.........BUT I have to say I will buy all of them with great pleasure because the love they all put into this movie. Every last breath breathed into this magical epic is more than worth it too myself. Peter Jackson is my new idol as far as directors go. Man this guy has vision!?!? I thought J.R. had vision nothing taken away from Mr Tolkien. Jackson is among the best of the best of the Greatest to even think he could go against the book full force. And too my amazement he pulled it off. They all pulled it off and I can't freaking wait for December! The Twin Towers!
10.0~totally cool crazy_pineapple Sign in Permalink This movie is one of the best i have ever seen. the cast is brilliant and their performances are superb. If you haven't seen this film then you have missed out. It deserves more than nine. Ten is the only score for this movie!
10.0~Greatest movie ever made, of any kind dervish_58 Sign in Permalink Tolkien nuts: CALM DOWN!!! I love the book just as much as you guys, but come ON. It won't be a perfect translation!!! It would be about 40 hours long, so live with it. Could YOU do better? NO! So CALM DOWN!!! Look at it as its own entity, not just as a translation of the original. That's like making the entire Bible into a movie and complaining if it isn't exactly perfect or complete!!! If you look at it with that POV, you will realize that this stomps Citizen Kane, American Beauty, Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and so forth into the ground. Nothing this grand and epic has ever been accomplished. Whenever people try, they FAIL. This movie is simply beautiful. I started The Hobbit in 5th grade (I'm 18 now), and read LotR itself in 8th, and ever since, I've been waiting for a movie to do it justice. This was everything I could have ever wished for. I teared up at almost every scene to see the places of all our dreams and fantasies come alive. The first shot showing a sizable portion of the Shire made me shudder with near orgasmic joy. The only issue I had with it was Liv Tyler. She wasn't even bad, I just don't like her. Let's go through the rest of the cast, shall we? Frodo - perfect Galadriel - perfect Aragorn - perfect Boromir - perfect (wished he woulda had his horned helmet tho) the other hobbits - perfect Saruman - mind blowing!!! Christopher Lee is the messiah, or I'm a goat Elrond - funny looking, but still great Gimli - perfect, tho he acted a bit like the dwarf from the D&D movie Legolas - second best piece of casting EVER Gandalf - BEST piece of casting ever EVERY OTHER BLOODY CHARACTER - SIMPLY PERFECT!!! I've seen a few times, and I hope to go at least 5 more times. I just can't wait to see the Ents and Shelob.
1.0~A really bad movie ever unless you've read the books Krog__ Sign in Permalink Everyone I know who has read the books lists this as their favorite movie.... But I, not having read the books, thought it sucked. NOTHING HAPPENED. They formed a band of good guys and nothing else. In usual movies, that takes like five minutes, or is part of the backstory. This is three hours of the same thing over and over and over again. Excellent filmmaking, though. Really great scenery. I just wish it would've been about 2 1/2 hours less, and that there would have actually been a story going on.
10.0~an emotional beginning t-viktor212 Sign in Permalink WHile I was first introduced to the Middle-earth movies through The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, this was the second film from the saga that I watched. While watching it on the extended edition expands the story so much that sometimes it feels a little too extended, it's my second favourite LOTR movie. What made me definitely like it is the way it gets really emotional towards the end. You'll understand that only by watching the film. I'm not a huge fantasy fan, but Tolkien's universe is one I loved, and this is one of the movies that introduced me to the whole world.
10.0~Absolutely outstanding! noodleboy500 Sign in Permalink Absolutely outstanding! When people ask me about this movie, one thing that crops up in 9 out of 10 conversations is the question `Is the movie true to the book?' To me this is an unfair question. If you had asked Peter Jackson to make a movie that was beyond all doubt true' to the book, you would have a sequence of 9 hour movies instead of 3 hour movies. Also, the movies would be disjointed, dull and unwatchable. Why, you ask? Because movies require a unique combination of flow and pace that books are not constrained to, and transferring a story to film without adapting it for the job would be a big mistake. Book and film are not compatible media. What I often say is that the movie is true to the SPIRIT of the book. I get the same feeling watching the film that I got when I'd sit up late at night, reading under lamp-light because I could not tear myself away from the story. The characters on screen look to me as though secret agents from Weta Workshops mind reading department have tiptoed in to my bedroom at night and plucked the images from my mind  and I'm not the only person who says that  all the hardcore Tolkien fans I have shared this thought with have agreed with great enthusiasm. After watching this film, I feel justified in my past comments that PJ is a genius. I have been a fan since he produced the cult classic BAD TASTE in 1987, an alien/zombie movie that relied on vision and talent as opposed to a big budget or any real kind of budget at all, to be honest. The movie was improvised from start to finish (that's right, made up as they went along), and only received any kind of funding (beyond that which came from PJ's own pocket) just before its completion. Jackson is a creative genius, and deserves every word of praise he gets. No other person could translate the greatest fiction ever written in to the greatest film ever made the way he has. I give the Lord Of The Rings a score of 15 out of 10. (This review has been submitted verbatim for both The Fellowship Of The Ring & The Two Towers)
10.0~The elf and the hobbit are so hot, the movie was amazing, it could have been better! screwoff Sign in Permalink The movie was amazing! I think that it would have been better if it had been closer to the book, but obviously they had to edit it for time. Orlando Bloom was SO HOT! (Orlando was the elf in the fellowship!!) And so was Elijah Wood! (Elijah was Frodo!) -note to self: fantasize about Orlando and Elijah A truly fantastic movie. But the book is MUCH better. If I could, I would have voted for this movie, giving it an 11! If you have not seen it, see it! Now! NOW! Go now!
10.0~What? niphredil Sign in Permalink Beautiful, wonderful, excellent! Peter Jackson is a GENIE! But the best was Frodo and Leg...;-) Middle Earth's so real...Is it just a film or...History? The BEST I've ever seen.
5.0~Overall disappointment but good entertainment regardless craigsmith Sign in Permalink The reality is that The Fellowship of the Ring is a long and complicated story and one not really suited for the screen. In this respect the script writers and producers have actually managed to do some justice to the story, which is good to see. It could have been worse, although the scenes between Saruman and Gandalf made me wince, and Arwen should have remained the background character she is. The greater faults of the film lie in its editing and smaller details such as the almost pathetic humor which pervades the story. Tolkien readers will recognize some derivation of the lighter side of the book, but the silly little one-liners are more annoying than funny. Even at three hours time was precious in this film and it would have been better spent in other ways. The Fellowship of the Ring opened with some promise, thanks to the introduction narrated by Galadriel. We were given the best sequence in the film right at the start with the fly-over of the foothills below Mount Doom, and the following battle scenes were nothing short of spectacular. It is these scenes that will make The Lord of the Rings as a trilogy of films, and it is just a pity that the editors of the films haven't seen to take advantage of this. The shots (whether virtual computer animations or real) are too short, use too much motion (the temptation of CGI!), and the audience is left wondering what they missed. Directors of older films such as Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver) understood the philosophy of allowing audiences time to process what they were seeing. Speed does not always create excitement and anticipation. The opening scenes in Gladiator (Ridley Scott) are a good example of a well done big scene (think of the long, panoramic shots of the forest from the POV of Caesar). There are also technical issues with the film, although these can perhaps be forgiven. Some of the CGI characters are noticeably lacking in detail, eyes are poorly rendered and look hexagonal, and some frames have a jigsaw effect where it is obvious they have been cut and joined. I am amused to see that The Fellowship of the Ring, out less than a month, has jumped to the top of IMDB's top-rated list. There is so much hype surrounding these films I think that most people actually hesitate to criticize the film, agreeing with everyone else that it's the best ever. Nevermind. The good features in The Fellowship of the Ring will no doubt be more heavily relied upon in the upcoming two sequels (which feature large battle scenes, he he) so let's look forward to them.
10.0~Middle earth finally comes to life... karenlynn1 Sign in Permalink I must say I was skeptical when I first heard my favorite novels were being made into films. I dreaded A-list tow headed actors and actresses over-dramatizing and/or faking their way through one of the greatest journeys ever. I feared they'd cast Tom Cruise as Aragorn, and Brad Pitt or some other overindulgent, overconfident "golden boy" as Legolas--a character I've loved since I first read the chapter about The Council of Elrond. ...but then I heard That Elijah Wood, a fine young child actor now grown up, was playing Frodo. I was intrigued. Sir Ian McKellen would be playing Gandalf--and I felt it would be refreshing to see him play such a good, likable character after watching him play Magnetto in X-Men (another performance of his I enjoyed.) The rest of the cast was either unknown to me at the time, or I hadn't heard that they had been cast in it yet. Needless to say I was DYING to see this movie. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the film when it first came out. In fact, I finally got to see it several months later. Definitely worth the wait. The cast, the script, the entire production was simply flawless. Within the first scene the shire that I read about when I was a child, came to life... Middle earth where I longed to escape as a child had come to life, and was even more beautiful than I imagined. THe characters were almost exactly how I had pictured them, and the excitement, the drama, and everything else seemed very, very real. My hat is off to Peter Jackson for his excellent job in bringing The Lord of the Rings to life, for those of us who grew up dreaming of Middle Earth. He did a wonderful job of (more or less) sticking to the original story, and bringing his vision of The Lord of The Rings to the big screen for all of us to enjoy. Hat's off to the cast too, who not only looks exactly like I imagined them...they act and speak, even walk just how I pictured them. Some long-time Tolkien readers may scoff at scenes that were cut out, or rearranged...or Arwen taking the place of Glorfindel in the Flight to the Ford... Well some scenes don't always translate well onto film,...I would have been bored watching Frodo wait a full ten years at Bagend waiting for Gandalf while the Sacksville Baggins' raided and pilfered what Bilbo had left behind... The Tom Bombadill scenes would have been rather bland, and taken away from the central story... And I didn't mind at all that Arwen was the one to save Frodo...that scene was so spectacular, F/X wise! I'm not going to nit pick about a female elf saving Frodo. Regardless of such changes, the movie is spectacular! If you don't like it...well then maybe fantasy movies, or classic literature brought to life is just not your thing. To each his own. But it's a must see for all Tolkien fans, all fantasy fans, and all who want to escape reality for approx 4 hours... and wander into Middle Earth.
10.0~Worth the wait Jestercard Sign in Permalink Rumours had been flying about for years about a live action version of Lord of the Rings, and being a fan of Jacksons films and Tolkein's books I was almost drooling with anticipation when the first details were released. I'm happy to say the first film in the trilogy totally surpassed my high expectations, and like so many people I know that saw the film I'm almost counting the days till the Two Towers is released. Everything about this film oozes class. The pacing (nessecarily altering parts of the book) is spot on, and for a three hour film to grip you for its entire length is a glowing testament to all involved. The only critisisms I've consistently heard are the occasionally dodgy use of extras to show the size difference between hobbits and men (fair comment I'm afraid) and the downbeat end to the film. To those of you that agree with the second point my advice is to stay well clear of the Two Towers when its released if Peter Jackson again finishes at the end of the book. Downbeat? You ain't seen nothing yet!! But standing on its own, there is so much to recommend about the Fellowship, from the designs and breathtaking scenery, to the wonderful performances and Jacksons masterful direction - this man seems to improve twofold with every film he makes, and many of his American colleagues could learn a lot about narrative from him.
10.0~Awesome! shokugeki_no_souma Sign in Permalink Honestly one of the best films I have seen in a while. Honestly, while Star Wars and Star Trek were good, these were better. A great adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's classic books. I thoroughly enjoyed reading them, and the cinematic experience was just as great - which is saying something. I really enjoy these types of films - slightly geeky, but excellent. These will surely go down in history as one of the best movies ever. If you enjoyed these films, I would recommend George R.R Martin's Game of Thrones. It is the same sort of adventure type, but different all the same. No doubt you've heard of the TV series, but be sure to read the books as well! The series follows Frodo, a 'hobbit' - a small creature from a place known as Middle Earth. It tells of his quest to destroy the 'One Ring' created by the Dark Lord Sauron. It is truly fascinating and I'd recommend it to anyone. 10/10!
10.0~The Best Movie of Fantasy and Adventure Ever Made claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink In my opinion this is the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made. The journey of Frodo Baggins and the Fellowship of the Ring is outstanding, stunning, a masterpiece. I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie. My vote is ten.
10.0~simply amazing. uberbrodie Sign in Permalink I will not say that the lord of the rings is the best film that I have ever seen, but masterfully incorporating all aspects of cinema into one package peter jackson has created a truly amazing film. I was ruing the day that some yahoo would bastardize this classic tolkien saga into a live action film. But this film, from start to finish... it simply defies usual praise. This is filmmaking and storytelling at its very best.
1.0~The greatest letdown of my life. denis-morin11 Sign in Permalink I am a great fan of Tolkien writings. In fact, I have read the trilogy of The lord of the Rings about eight time before I saw the movie. And boy, was I in for a big let down. I really toughed the characters were different from the book. Gandalf was nowhere as interesting as in the original stories. And where was Tom Bombadil? Of course, nobody cares about poetry or beauty. And there was not a whole lot in this movie. But in the books! Plenty. And to read somewhere that Jackson read passages from the book while filming this. And to think that a Whole Generation of non-readers will think that this is the Lord of the Rings. Please, do yourself a favour and go read the book instead. In the top 25 movies of the new Millennium. To me, that's absolutely amazing to see.
10.0~The greatest fantasy epic of all time! apfortony Sign in Permalink Any movie that lasts for three hours and leaves you wishing it weren't over is an excellent film. Seeing this movie is like watching an elaborate dream you've had come to life. Of course parts of it are more like a nightmare. I've read some of the criticisms but I can't understand how anyone could not be impressed with this film. With the exception of a car in the background in one scene, this movie is almost flawless. The battle to save middle earth is painted with such rich detail that even those unfamiliar with the novel should find it easy to follow. It's basically a very simple story about good versus evil told with many characters and intricate detail. It's a lot like Star Wars.
10.0~An Excellent Movie Choice! spider_webster Sign in Permalink I absolutely love this movie, partly because the acting is really good, but also for the CGI effects and the good storyline. I watched the extended version and realized that it isn't boring like some people think because some people I know think that FOTR is quite a lengthy movie because of all the talking, but in my opinion, if there's not talking, there's no story! If they just jumped to the fighting scenes without any of the introduction, then you won't know where the movie started from. I love the scenes where they get to fight, whether Orcs or Nazgul, the fighting scenes are still the climax of the movie. Another good movie to see after FOTR is TTT, of course. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes. Most probably, you'll enjoy that more than FOTR but don't shun this movie just because it's a bit lengthy. Overall, it's a great movie to see and it is really worth spending the money to buy/rent the extended/special DVD to watch too. Definitely a 10 out of 10 on my scale! Actually, in my opinion, 10/10 doesn't even come close!
3.0~An adaptation of the book? fagin-3 Sign in Permalink I think not. Forgetting for the moment that the movie was mediocre on its own merits there are just tons of differences between the movie and the book which make it laughable to call this an adaptation. From the raping of almost all the major characters, from Saruman to Galadriel, to the sell-out pandering to the big wave of Celtic-love which started with Braveheart, this movie retains none of the character of the original book. I wouldn't have been surprised if hobbits had been portrayed as eight feet tall, that being a "valid interpretation". No, I'm not a purist. I didn't even finish the first book until after I saw the movie. I like the book a lot, I didn't see it in the movie. Why are the Hobbits, the most British of the British portrayed as Irish peasants? Why is Loth Lorien a pit stop on the side of the river? Why is the wise Council of Elrond arguing with each other like so many Congressmen? So many changes were made, so much needless fluff (like the CGI collapsing staircase scene in Moria and the 30 seconds of "Whee! Aren't these two statues almost real? Take that ILM!") added. Do the Jackson apologists really believe what they say, that Jackson read the books and tried to be true to them? For those who say "It's just a movie" and I shouldn't rant, doesn't the calculated use of the name Lord of the Rings demand they do the book some justice? Most of this film's success is due to that name and cashing in on its legacy. How much money would the film have made if it had been title 'Ring Party', 'Ring Party II', and 'Ring Party III--Revenge of the Short People'? Feh. A poor effort--or lack thereof.
10.0~One ring to rule them all. redflames185 Sign in Permalink The best movie I have seen in my lifetime. I would pay to see this again. This movie provided all kinds of movie making elements, such as: drama, suspense, horror, and even a bit of romance. I suggest this movie to all ages. My little 3 year old brother liked it. This is by far one of my favorite movies.
10.0~as perfect as films get takatomon Sign in Permalink what is there to say really. the votes say it all. more than 1/2 give it a ten, and it's average is 8.9/10 and it is #5 in the top 250. why? excellent cast, huge scale, incredibly beautiful sets, super special effects, timeless story getting the treatment it deserves, and no cheesy 90 minute run. it's an honest 2 1/2 hours of pure enjoyment. escapism doesn't get any better than this.
10.0~Timeless, and Transcendent rivotall Sign in Permalink It's easy to sit back and be a critic. It makes you sound intellectual and above the crowd. I've read many of the reviews here and I have come to the conclusion that some people will never be satisfied, no movie will ever meet this abstract ideal that they have. Well those people will never expierience the absolute joy of watching this film either and I suppose it is deserved. I walked into the theater having just finished the books and highly sceptical as to how faithful to Tolkien's vision this movie would be. I absolutly enthralled to say the least. This movie brought to life all that I had imagined while reading the books, and though I knew the story, it held me in suspense, filled me with awe, and moved me with its music. I have seen it three times since, and each time It has not diminished in its impact. This movie is timeless and transcends movie entertainment as we have known it for the last decade, perhaps more. I couldn't recommend it enough.
10.0~My favorite movie! oats_declintow Sign in Permalink Wow! This movie was incredible. All 3 hours of it were unbelievable. Though some things were cut out or changed from the books, it was understandable. Peter Jackson did a really great job in bringing the story to life. A must-see movie. ***** out of *****. Unbelievable. Very close to the books (which, by the way, are even better than the movie, but the movie still is a must-see). How many praises can I say to compliment this movie? Also, the acting was really great. The locations for the movie were so good! A real must-see. Two thumbs up (or, if you are an an extra-terrestrial, three thumbs up)!
10.0~Amazing myyellowbutt Sign in Permalink I, like many people, waited a very long time for this movie to come to fruition. Granted, we have the cartoon from 20 years ago, which for its time was done nicely. But looking back on it, it seems dated and at times painful to watch. But to truly see a live action version of this was the real dream. And to be blunt, this is 50 years of nerds, bookworms, and sci-fi and fantasy buffs waiting for this to come out. The general concensus seems to be for many people that they either loved this movie or hated it. A great number of the people who walked away disappointed in this movie are those who have read the book and managed to pick out every single little tidbit that Peter Jackson either left out completely or changed. Yes, sadly there is no Tom Bombadil. Yes, there is no reforging of Aragorn's sword. Yes, Frodo is not saved by Arwyn. But when looking at this movie, one needs to remember a few things. First of all, to be fair one must look at the movie objectively for what it is, a seperate entity from the book. And second of all, for all you pretentious nitpickers out there, this movie was not made for you and you alone, it was made for everyone. Fans of the book and newcomers alike. Did I want to see an inflation of the romance between Aragorn and Arwyn? Not particularly. But did it ruin the movie? Not by far, and it made a few romantic folks in the theater happy. Just as I'm sure it gave the female viewers a kick to see a strong female character rescue Frodo amongst an almost entirely male cast. So please, let up on the nitpicking and get off your blasted soapbox. Now on to what's good about the movie. Where to begin? Should I mention how visually stunning the Shire, home of the hobbits was? Or maybe I should mention how frightening the Uruk-hai (a race of warrior orcs for you who haven't read) were? The opening sequence and battle scene was superb, and gives the viewer who has no idea what he or she is about to see a quick back story so they don't get lost too quickly. Visually, as a whole, the movie was breathtaking. From the view of the countryside, to the snow covered mountains of Caradhras, to the Mines of Moria, the scenes were candy for the eyes. Also, quite visually appropriate were the Elves. They are just one of many signs that Peter Jackson did his homework for this movie. The Elves are tall, slender, and quite endrogenous looking. Many a girl walked away from this movie with a crush on Orlando Bloom who plays Legolas, an Elf of the Fellowship of the Ring. And we see just enough of Gollum, the foul creature who craves the ring (and one of my all time favorite characters of literature) to tease us and await seeing more of him in the movies to come. The most fantastic part of this movie was the performances. Elijah Wood plays Frodo, a hero torn between his will to do good and his fear of failure in a performance that would make Mark Hamill jealous. And for those of you who have complained that Elijah Wood is about 30 years too young, go back and read paragraph two again. His companions are no less spectacular. Sean Astin reprises a role he does very well as the underdog and puppydog companion to Frodo you can't help but love. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monoghan as Pippin and Merry respectively, are quite amusing as Frodo's other two hobbit companions and provide much comic relief amongst a serious story. Boyd in particular, is hilarious, and I'm really hoping to see more of him in the future. Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins gives much life and cynical wit to the old hobbit and gives a stellar performance. Sean Bean, whom I myself was not familiar with prior to this movie played Boromir in an excellent fashion as somewhat of a tragic hero who is tempted and eventually redeemed in a very well done scene, that in some ways almost steals the show. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies, unfortunately do not receive nearly enough lines as Legolas and Gimmli, the dwarf, though make do with what they give very well. Gimmli, in particular delivers some of the best lines of the movie. His defiant statement of, "Nobody tosses a Dwarf!" had me rolling. Even Liv Tyler manges to put on a good, if not beautiful portrayal of Arwyn. I could keep praising several other performances of other actors such as Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett, and Hugo Weaving, but I want to save most of my breath for two in particular. Viggo Mortenson, as Aragorn, also known as Strider, plays the part with stride (no pun intended). When I casted this movie in my mind, Mortenson never came to mind, but now, even when rereading the novels, I can picture no one else in his shoes. His loyalty to Frodo and will to finish what he starts runs deep and is one of the best performances of the movie. But the real praise goes to Ian McKellan. McKellan has long been heralded amongst the critics as one of the best actors of his time, though he hasnt received much name recognition. Though in my opinion, he deserves to have his name mentioned in the same breath as names like Alec Guiness, Gregory Peck, and Humphrey Bogart. I've been a big fan ever since I saw him in Richard III. And in this movie you will see why. He doesn't just play Gandalf, he becomes Gandalf. He brings every bit of character to the wise, brave, funny, and kind old wizard. When you see him battle the Balrog, an unusually terrifying creature, and he plants his staff in the ground in defiance and yells out, "You shall not pass!" you will know why I praise him this much. Well I could keep going on forever but see it and judge it for yourself. And don't forget to leave your preconceptions and the door and simply enjoy this movie for what it is; a masterpiece that was long overdue. P.S. a note to George Lucas, if you are reading this, watch this movie several times and take notes. THIS is how you deliver a promise.
10.0~Best Movie Of 2001 wesjordao557 Sign in Permalink This was a great movie. I loved it. The story was great, the action was great, the charecters were great, and even the acting was great. Lord Of The Rings is my 2nd favorite movie. Star Wars is my 1st. I can't wait when Star Wars Episode 2 and The Two Towers come out this year!
10.0~Exceeded my every expectation wetzel Sign in Permalink When I first learned that this movie was being made I unconciously conjured images of the horrid Lord of the Rings made in the '70's. There were so many things that could have gone wrong with a movie of this magnitude, but to my great pleasure none of them did. Peter Jackson and company did an extraordinary job of bringing this incredible book to life. The sheer amount of detail is astonishing. Nothing since Star Wars has created such an amazing fantasy world. But none of this would matter if the acting wasn't executed to perfection. Every actor fits their role to perfectly. I only have a couple of complaints. The romance between Aragorn and Arwen was only briefly touched and seemed a little forced. We're only given a couple lines of dialogue about the impact of their relationship but nothing that shows why Arwen should want to give up her immortality. I can only hope that this will be fleshed out in the sequels. I was also a little disappointed to see so much of Lothlorien cut out of the movie. We don't get to see any of Gimli's affection towards Galadriel or the gift-giving scene and much more that occured there. But these are very minor complaints. As long as you aren't a die hard fan who will be mortally offended by the changes from the book to movie or just plain against anything fantastical in nature, then you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. I give it 10/10.
1.0~big disappointment jamieandzero Sign in Permalink After 1 year of anticipation TLOR has been a big disappointment. Granted, beautiful scenery, granted, spectacular computer techniques, but this is not the way to make a classic novel into a good picture. The casting of for instance Sam, a very important character in the story, is totally wrong; they made him into the fat clumsy schoolboy. Where are the lines of wisdom on Elrond's brow? How beautiful the scenery may have been, Tolkiens love lay in the Northern part of England and Scotland, where the names of the fells and river reflect those he used in the book. So why New Zealand? Most importantly, the acting was unforgivably stiff and unnatural. I don't know what people mean when they argue otherwise. The only way the director thought of showing the actors to play grief, for instance after the fall of Gandalf, was in letting them act in slow motion, already a sign of paucity. Frodo staring for minutes on end, with a tear running over his cheek, call cheap gipsy boy pictures in kitsch interiors to mind. One of the most important scenes of the first book, of course, is the council of Elrond, were the decision is made to destroy the Ring. What an opportunity for dialogue and what a farce the director made of it. The members attending the council were not properly introduced, nothing about the possibilities of using or getting rid of the ring, only a lot of noise and in the end a softheartened Frodo saying he will take it. That was that for a pivotal part in this classic novel. The music was simply awful and stomach-ache inducing. Nothing to be compared to the intelligent use of music and songs in the BBC-radioplay of 10 years ago. Arwen rescueing instead of Glorfindel's horse is doubtless put in because of Hollywood=dollar reasons. So TLOR done by this director is nothing more than a spectacular adventure story, as starwars, the lost menace and all that is. Happily the novel is so great that it won't suffer from this film; may be in twenty years time another director will have a go at it. This production is nothing more than a I think the film is a mere sacrifice to dollars and in that the quest has failed.
10.0~great movie that will last for ages along with its sequels maxatlas19 Sign in Permalink This is truly one of the all time most exciting and beautiful movies to ever hit the the screen. It has all the right moments to it and it has such an attention to detail that it feels so authentic and that this setting(middle-earth) could actually be a real place. It's just very cool.
10.0~Perfection on Screen Tomomir34 Sign in Permalink I am by no means an easily impressed person, especially when it comes to film. I have been known to look at such masterpeices as "Lawerance of Arabia" and "Raging Bull" and find some little insignificant detail to upset me. When I walked into a movie theater on a cool, windy night in Orlando, FL on December 28 2001 and decided that since I just missed the 11:30 Harry Potter showing I should find a descent replacement I happened to glance at the 11:35 showing of something called Lrd of the Rn (which I later deduced by the movie poster meant LORD OF THE RINGS) I figured, "Eh, it's got a wizard, why the hell not?" SO I bought my ticket and entered the theatre totally unexpecting of the maginficent ride I was about to take. From the very beginning I was hooked. I laughed and giggled in Hobbition. Recoiled in my seat and covered my eyes during the black rider chase, listened attentively during the council and awed by the amazing jounrey to end the film. I left the theatre with tears in my eyes, for two distinct reasons. One was just due to the touching ending (even though some refuse to call it that) where Sam and Frodo head off to certain peril. And the other reason was becasue I had just had my first true movie experience of my adult life. Now, when you're a child the prospect of the "going to the movies is entertaining you do it for birthday parties or family outings. As you grow older and "mature", however, movies (at least in my case) lost a lot of their magic. I would go out if friends invited me or if a really attractive girl was nice enough to ask, other than that I rarely went to the moveis for their sole purpose which was to entertain and touch me in their own way. When I walked out of that theatre on that cool windy night (or I should say morning) I thought movies like those were extinct. No one made "epics" any more and if they did they were to a ridiculus scale totally overflowing with hammy acting and eye candy. Yet this film, this exprience grab you by the seat of your pants and took you on an emotional roller coaster where if you compared the begging of the movie to the end you would question if it were the same movie. I could go on about the brilliance of the cast, crew, and Peter Jackson for bringing this remarkable story to the screen. Yet, if you have read this far you have surely realized this in seeing the movie for yourself or if you haven't (shame on you) I would suggest renting it and unplugging your phones and secluding yourself to a basement or whatever may be and just take in the beauty and grandure of one of the greatest films of all time. My love for this movie is in it's characters and landscape and the overall experience that is the "Lord of the Rings". The movie stands out on it's own even though it is about the masterful books written by Professor Tolkien. I think Peter Jackson sent out a message to all film makers and said "look, it can be done, you can make a terrific movie and still have a big box office draw". I hope Hollywood got the message, because if they did we can look forward to a bright future in the world of cinema.
10.0~the best films i have seen yet rings_luver Sign in Permalink I absolutely LOVE this movie. I liked the effort put into the make-up and costumes. I liked how they combined so many emotions into the movie. There's the feeling of love and passion, which is obviously potrayed by Aragorn and Arwen. There is the feeling of the tension and then followed either by relief or (most of the time) greif. when Gandalf fought against the Balrog, that was the tension in the movie and as well in the audience, then the slight feeling of relief, then the feeling of emptiness inside if you, like your insides have shrivelled up to nothing. There is also the feeling of dread and regret, most of the time potrayed by Frodo. He sees no hope to his endless last. I really liked how they used Merry and Pippin as the comic relief in this movie. In my opinion, this is the best movie to date.
3.0~I couldn't stay awake moozerboy Sign in Permalink I guess I just don't get the facination with this movie. I found it to be far to long, goofy, and boring to stay awake. I actually dozed off for a bit after struggling to stay awake for the middle hour. I haven't fallen asleep during a movie since the Robin William's disaster 'Toys.' I was told before the movie that this was one of the greatest movies ever made. The Academy Award nominations further prompted my belief that this movie would be exceptional. I must have been expecting much more than I got. What I expected was to be drawn into this magical, legendary J.R.R. Tolkien universe for 3 plus hours. I had heard of the great special effects, scenery, and characters. I prepared myself to be amazed. What a dissapointment. The characters, with the exception of Bilbo Baggins, were all one dimensional and boring. I found myself unaffected when they were in peril, since I could care less if one of them were to get offed by an inept Ork. The Orks were scary looking, but when you consider that there were probably 300 of them and they couldn't defeat the 9 in the fellowship, their bark is obviously worse than their bite. They are as inept as a Star Wars Stormtrooper. The scenery did live up to the hype, but I think it is pretty bad when you consider the surroundings and not the story as the high point of the movie. Special effects? Maybe I'm a spoiled 'Star Wars' junkie used to the Industrial Light and Magic standard that has been set. I saw nothing special in the special effects but the fireworks at the beginning of the movie. While it may sound like I hated this movie, I didn't at all. It was an entertaining film, but I expected much more. I held this film to a very high standard based on the reviews and feedback from my peers. I don't know how this film cracked the IMDB's top 10 let alone the top 250. This wasn't even close to the best movie I've seen this month. But I will end up with the DVD as my wife loved the film. I will watch it when I need help falling asleep.
3.0~Peter Jackson, not Tolkien, knows best??? Whatever. Awful! John Bethea Sign in Permalink As "Harry Potter" is one of the best book to film adaptions ever, and one of the most satisfying, considering that Chris Columbus and Steven Kloves wouldn't seem to be ideal candidates for making a great film, "Fellowship of the Rings" has to be about the worst ever. Why? Because Peter Jackson had the resources available to make an honest adaption rather than the overblown, unfaithful special effects extravaganza that he gave us. Stick to the source material, and it's amazing what the results can be. Imagine yourself more creative or smarter than the author, and you just plain stink. As does this "Hollywood" movie. BTW It was nice to "learn" that Saruman was actually under Sauron's direct command the whole time, and that Gandalf was aware of it, and that Arwen is actually the amazonian version of the elves.
10.0~Is breathtaking Legolaslvr01 Sign in Permalink It is breathtaking. There is nothing to say,except that it is breathtaking. If you don't watch this film, you will seriously regret it. I strongly suggest everyone and anyone, whether you like comedy, romance, drama, horror, action, and of course, Sci-Fi, to watch this. It is truly the movie of all times. You will love it, guaranteed. It deserves a 10 or above. Absolutely outstanding.
10.0~I'm going to see this movie for the 7th time tomorrow, and I STILL love it!!! blacksleeves Sign in Permalink 10/10!!! I've always loved the books. I got caught up in the hype way before the movie came out... (when I came out of the theater after seeing "Harry Potter" in November, my first comment was: "well, that was great. Now: December 19th, who's with me?") I've seen it six times so far (ask me tomorrow, and I'll be able to say SEVEN), and I still can't get enough of it! Wow! I was so hyper after seeing it for the first time in the theater, I couldn't even fall asleep that night because all I could think about was "when can I see it again?". :o) I've never looked forward to any movie with this much anticipation before... and never seen such a good movie-based-on-a-book. Everyone knows about certain scenes and characters that were altered or left out of the movie, and I'm not even going to START on the exaggerated character of Arwen... (if people need a "strong female character", just wait for Eowyn in "The Return of the King"). And while I'm looking forward as much as anyone to seeing all the deleted scenes on the DVD version, it's not going to stop me from going to the theater as often as I can and loving the movie more each time!!! The scenery... awesome! New Zealand just made it to the top of my vacation list!!! The acting... perfect! Even Elijah Wood was better than I thought he'd be. Orlando Bloom, yay! And Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn, a.k.a. Strider (especially at the Prancing Pony scene... that was SO true to the book!) And GOLLUM!!! EXACTLY how I imagined him!!!! the first time I saw the movie (opening night) everyone in the audience was COMPLETELY QUIET (which, I think, is rare in a movie theater) because they were so caught up in this amazing movie! The second time I saw it (two days later), I think a lot of other people had seen it at least once before, because.... *** minor spoiler below! *** When Aragorn hacked off the Uruk-Hai's head at the end of the movie, nearly the entire theater started clapping. I've never seen and audience do that before... when I went back a THIRD time, my friend and I clapped, but no one else did. Since then, we've been trying to get the audience to clap with us at that part, but no luck so far. :o)
10.0~extended version dvd review Opus-16 Sign in Permalink To those who are here wondering if it is worth buying the 4 dvd disc extended version of the film, my recommendation is to buy it now with no hesitation! Renting it will not give enough time to appreciate all this set has to offer. This is truly one of the best dvd packages I've yet seen. Every part of the set, from the packaging to the extras to the film itself show extreme attention to detail, and is truly remarkable for the package's consumer friendly price. The picture quality is phenomenal, and justifies splitting the film onto two discs. But as wonderful to behold the transfer is, the DTS 6.1 soundtrack blows you away. This has replaced Star Wars Ep. 1 and Gladiator as my "show off" film for what my system is capable of. Even if you are not in love with the film itself, you should have this set in your library just to show off your audio/visual home theater setup. Top notch! And for those who love the movie, you're in for a treat. I can see why some scenes were chosen to be left out, especially some of the "shire" scenes that give a different feel to one of the lead characters or that became unecessary after the choice to include a prologue in the theatrical version was made. Some of the restored footage is pure treasure, though--it is amazing how a few seconds here or there flesh out some of the familiar scenes, and how some of the restored scenes add to the storyline and scope of the film. In the theater these extensions would definately add up to (more) of a sore butt, but they are a pleasure to watch in a home setting, where you can pause at any time. The extras add up to somewhat of an overkill, what with 2 discs full of documentary footage, interviews, and interactive features, not to mention the 4(!) commentary tracks. Just about everything is covered, but there is some repetition. One annoyance I had was that in the cast commentary track, they obviously had the actors in the same room together where they were free to interact with each other while they recorded...but sometimes they edit in pieces of interviews found on the extras discs where the actors talk about their fellow actors who were not present during the interview...to kind of a disconcerting effect. All in all, though, not much to complain about. Hidden features include the theatrical preview of The Two Towers, and MTV's hilarious spoof of the Council of Elrond from the music video awards. I am not going to say the extended version is superior to the theatrical release version, but it is certainly a worthy reinterpretation of the available footage that I enjoyed immensely. Kudos to New Line for going all out with this, and Peter Jackson and all the other people involved for taking the time and attention involved in such a release. I think even Tolkien may have been grudgingly impressed.
10.0~A true Epic NL-Proud Sign in Permalink I just finished watching the extended version of the film. I had watched the theater release last winter. And I am in agreement with those who rate this film so high. But I also see that most of the negative reaction comes from those who have never read Tolkien. I had read the Hobbitt before seeing the film, and it gave me an appreciation for what Jackson tried to do with this movie. I have since read the novel Lord of the rings. The movie stays true to what Tolkien wanted to portray. For those who haven't read any of Tolkien's novels, the dialogue and description shown in the film could easily be lost. But for those who have read, they can understand what is being said, and know that it is vital to the whole story. Remember, this movie is only part one. A lot of what is in this film, will reflect in what will be shown in the following two movies. As for length, I marvel at those who think they can shorten this film any more then was already done. The theater release was 3 hrs long. The extended version got something like an extra 30 mins added. Still Jackson has left a great deal of the book out. The whole 2-3 chapters of the book concerning the Old Forest and Bombadil is never mentioned. Nor the encounter with the farmer at Brandybuck. These alone would have been an extra 30 mins minimum to show. After all this babble what am I saying. LOTR-Fellowship of the rings ranks as one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its right up there with other of my favorites such as The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars, Gladiator, and so on. But I have read the books. Maybe this is a pre-requisite to watching and being assured you will like it. 10 of 10
10.0~best film ever made andynortonuk Sign in Permalink this should have deserved some more Oscars. Never mind. There's alway the sequel! This film has everything I like in a film; special effects, thrills, monsters, a good cast (particulary Christopher Lee and Sir Ian MacKellen) and a good adaption of a good story. I hope Peter Jackson does not disappoint me with his next film being awful, particulary his King Kong project which i have doubt on! See this film! 100 times better than Star Wars or any fanatsy film i have seen! This deserves to be a classic and be with all the greatest films of all time, like Citizen Kane!
10.0~Shockingly phenomenal tsangaridesi Sign in Permalink I went into it not really knowing what to expect, and I came out of it knowing it exceeded any and all my expectations for it. The story is brilliantly thought of, and the writing is just as well. There were no completely unnecessary lines or addition of silly details just to show off the depth of this new world. Everything fell into place very well. The acting was excellent. The actors excelled with their performances, and did not fail to not only entertain, but to impress their audience. I loved how there was always some sort of comic relief in serious or tense scenes. The reason I liked it so much is because it was subtle, and the screenplay writer didn't just drop a huge sign saying "comic relief" in the middle of a serious scene. What really impressed me though, is that the movie not only offers imagination, tension, and a few laughs, it also offers emotion. There's always an unexpected twist to make things more interesting than they already are. There is nothing this movie doesn't have!
10.0~THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!! pooh2tigger Sign in Permalink You people who thought this movie sucked are crazy! This Movie is the best of its tines!Orlando Bloom is hotter than ever! Every one in this movie did a grate job! If you have not seen this movie see it! You'll love it.All the people I know loved it!I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!
10.0~AMAZING!!!!!! a brilliant work of art!!!! carbon_69 Sign in Permalink I just have to say, that The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the best movie's that I have EVER seen!!! Although most of Peter Jackson's films weren't that great, he hit a goldmine with this one. And the cast was perfect. Ian McKellen had the perfect ability to seem both kind and friendly, as well as appear frightening when called for to portray Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen possesses the right amount of mystery and cunning to play Aragorn. Sean Astin has the dimwitted and homely quality to play Frodo's loyal friend Samwise. Elijah Wood, in a surprisingly new role astounded me as Frodo, able to show both his frightened side and his brave side. John Ryhs-Davies portrayed the proud and somewhat snobbish (in the line of elves) Gimli. Orlando Bloom, in an amazing breakthrough performance captured Legolas' quiet and graceful demeanor perfectly. Sean Bean played Boromir's greedy, yet nationalistic character wonderfully. Dominic Monaghan and Bill y Boyd played the dim-witted sidekicks of Frodo, Merry and Pippin, without flaw. It was a powerful adventure and I can't wait until December.
1.0~Awful movie wimg Sign in Permalink I'm sure some people will hate this comment, but hey... try to look at it in an objective way. It's not because you're a fan of the Tolkien-stuff, that you actually have to like everything about it. Allright, the acting is good, the graphics are good (although the fighting scenes are filmed with too much movement in the camera, which makes it too blurry, especially if you're close to the screen) and the directing is generally good. So, you might wonder what's bad about it ? Well, for someone who hasn't read the books, doesn't know the mystical atmosphere of Tolkien and his stories, the movie is quite confusing at times. Furthermore, it seems Tolkien had an over-impressive imagination... it's as if he said : "I'll take a troll, let it attack them, but they'll be saved by an elf with flaming eyes and if that elf is killed, a wizard will strike them by shooting dead dwarfs at them." Basically anyone can write a story like that. But apart from the too-fictional story-line, which I'm sure will intrige a lot of people, the worst thing about the movie is its ending. I went to see this movie because I heard a lot of good things about it and because the trailers indicated it was a great movie. But, as I said before, I haven't read the books and I certainly didn't know the movie was just part of the story. So while I was interested in what was coming next, the credits appeared. I was stunned that someone could make a movie with great effects, good acting, etc... and then come up with such an awful ending. Even with this being just books 1+2, the movie didn't really put me in the 'mood' to be ended yet. There was no atmosphere to close the story with at all, not even the scenic view and the words "I'm glad you're with me" created such atmosphere. Overall, this movie left me with a feeling of having payed for something that was incomplete. Maybe Tolkien-fans will love it, non-Tolkien-fans will possible don't like it, except when you love some of the special effects and monsterous creatures.
10.0~Two hobbits and a gulf of love and friendship. Sinnerman Sign in Permalink I have since come to terms with people's polarised views on LOTR. Taking into account differing tastes and preferences, I thus see no end in fighting with "LOTR" detractors. Fact of the matter, nobody is wrong in film criticism. We are all entitled to our opinions. As such, I have decided to write this piece for myself and maybe for people who do love LOTR. Below, my take on one particular scene from the movie which profoundly moved me. Approaching the end of the film, there was an underwater shot of a motionless Sam, framed with a sad, blank stare. Next, we saw Sam's hand just beneathe the water's surface, slowly sinking. What followed was sublime. Another hand(Frodo's) dived in from above and grabbed Sam's wrist. After a short pregnant pause, Sam reciprocated by grasping that hand which pulls the hobbit back up to safety. In those few stolen moments, we were able to experience the unspoken bond between the two hobbits. To me, that was the most evocatively heartfelt scene of the entire film. With each successive viewing, I find myself loving LOTR that little bit more. And I think to myself, if this movie can affect me on such a profound level, it is bound to touch many others (though not all) in this big diverse world of ours. I thus take comfort in that.
10.0~Very few movies based on books live up to the book. Thankfully, this one does. crazyassbartlett Sign in Permalink When you think of movies that have been made from books names like Jurassic Park, The Shining, and Clear and Present Danger may come to mind. All of these movies have been good, but the books were amazing and the movies did not live up to the standards set by the authors. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, does live up to the story. It did leave some character. and scenes out, but they did bring the stunning books visuals to life with a very well made movie. From the legendary actors like Ian McKellen to younger up and comers like Elijah Wood, the acting is stupendous and the set design is eye popping. I can not wait for this movie to come out on DVD and also I am waiting on the final two movies that will hopefully live up to the first.
9.0~Loved it ancelita Sign in Permalink I really loved this movie. I watched it only a couple of months ago for reasons I can't explain. All of my friends did see it years ago and I finally decided that it is time for me to at least get some of LOTR movie references. I was surprised how detailed and well made this movie is (in fact, all three movies are). Actors are great and story is awesome. Considering that books are huge, I loved that screenwriters actually managed to keep the essence of the story and make a great script. At some points movie seemed a bit slow but as I said - it is a lot of details to put in and consider. Overall, I loved the movie and it was a great entertainment for a Friday night in.
10.0~The best movie of all time! bijek-1 Sign in Permalink It is nearly half a year have been passed but FOTR is still remain the best movie for many of people here in Russia. Especially for those who have read the Tolkien book befor. Thank to Peter Jackson and his courage I have the possibility to imagine the world of Middle-earth. Unfortunatelly here I can't find the extended version. I am sure Peter Jackson, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar. They did a perfect job.
1.0~Against my better judgement, a 5/10 amber-14 Sign in Permalink Possible spoilers... I recognise the worst impulses in myself, in that I want to stamp my foot, shout "no, no, NO!" and give this turgid epic a petulant 1/10 -- if only to counterweight the inexplicable adulation it seems to have generated across IMDB. But really, that reaction isn't fair to The Lord of the Rings. It is visually spectacular. Then again, having visited the stunning New Zealand three times, it is no more or less stunning than the country itself. The attention to detail in the costuming, props and sets is painstaking. However, I had to commit to a "making-of" special to finally appreciate it as I had nodded off in the movie itself. The casting is right on the money. It has to be -- because no character has any inherent depth or motivation within the film itself, just a handle, like "ethereal elf queen" or "bad wizard". In place of character and plot we have storybook cut-outs as flat and two-dimensional as a sheet of paper, spurred to action by portents of doom and gloom and a selection of apparently dangerous paths which derive their only tension from their ostentatious titles and the grandiose echo with which they are pronounced -- usually by Gandalf. Who was Gandalf? Kindly wizard, foolish ditherer -- guy who fell in a hole? By the end of the movie I was none the wiser. I kind of got the Bilbo and Frodo thing, I even kind of got the whole Ring thing, but who was Sam in relation to Frodo, really, and when and why did Mary and Poppins show up? Sure I know what we were TOLD, but whatever happened to SHOW don't tell? Who were that travelling band of... travellers? Yes, they all had different weapons and hair (and Legless had very lovely hair), but who they were and what they were about could have been scratched in toto on the inside of a finger ring: "Feckless Hobbit", "Blond spunk with crossbow", "short, growling dwarf", "Cate Blanchet", etc. It wasn't until Boromir (sp?) made his exit in what seemed a significant fashion that I decided to lean over to my trilogy-reading friend and finally ask what the hell his name was. I did ply Tolkien fans for a few of the whys and wherefores that were missing from the movie, enough to realise that essential components of the characters interrelationships *were* defined in the novels. But nobody insisted when I bought my ticket that I needed to have done the requisite reading. A feature film should be self-contained. I have in fact read SOME Tolkien -- which explains why I haven't read any more. Even Tolkien fans of my acquaintance are divided on whether this is a worthy adaption or only a very visual interpretation devoid of much of its essential text. To bring these books to the screen was undoubtedly a challenging task, but as of this writing I am still undecided as to whether "Fellowship" is a good adaption of a horrible book, or a horrible adaption of a good book, or just a horrible adaption of a horrible book. All I know is that, as a fan of characterisation who hasn't read the trilogy on which this series is based, this movie failed on almost every level to reach me beyond a renewed appreciation for the beauty of New Zealand. I might even have liked Frodo or Sam or Legolas or Aragorn or Boromir if the director had shown me who the hell they were beyond people of different height all going in the same direction. I know many other people who haven't read the novels have managed to enjoy the film anyway. I can only assume they place less importance than I on really caring what was actually supposed to be going on. I think a movie needs more than good scenery, props and casting to earn Best Picture or Best Director kudos. It seems that puts me out of step with the majority.
10.0~Best Film of 2001 Darth_Voorhees Sign in Permalink LOTR FOTR is a tale about Frodo a hobbit,who gets a ring. Little does he know that it is evil. He soon begins a quest with 9 companions,called The Fellowship of the Ring. The movie is altogether powerful,dramatic,and action packed. Very good! 5/5
10.0~Simply Stunning myyellowbutt Sign in Permalink I, like many people, waited a very long time for this movie to come to fruition. Granted, we have the cartoon from 20 years ago, which for its time was done nicely. But looking back on it, it seems dated and at times painful to watch. But to truly see a live action version of this was the real dream. And to be blunt, this is 50 years of nerds, bookworms, and sci-fi and fatasy buffs waiting for this to come out. The general concensus seems to be for many people that they either loved this movie or hated it. A great number of the people who walked away disappointed in this movie are those who have read the book and managed to pick out every single little tidbit that Peter Jackson either left out completely or changed. Yes, sadly there is no Tom Bombadil. Yes, there is no reforging of Aragorn's sword. Yes, Frodo is not saved by Arwyn. But when looking at this movie, one needs to remember a few things. First of all, to be fair one must look at the movie objectively for what it is, a seperate entity from the book. And second of all, for all you pretentious nitpickers out there, this movie was not made for you and you alone, it was made for everyone. Fans of the book and newcomers alike. Did I want to see an inflation of the romance between Aragorn and Arwyn? Not particularly. But did it ruin the movie? Not by far, and it made a few romantic folks in the theater happy. Just as I'm sure it gave the female viewers a kick to see a strong female character rescue Frodo amongst an almost entirely male cast. So please, let up on the nitpicking and get off your blasted soapbox. Now on to what's good about the movie. Where to begin? Should I mention how visually stunning the Shire, home of the hobbits was? Or maybe I should mention how frightening the Uruk-hai (a race of warrior orcs for you who haven't read) were? The opening sequence and battle scene was superb, and gives the viewer who has no idea what he or she is about to see a quick back story so they don't get lost too quickly. Visually, as a whole, the movie was breathtaking. From the view of the countryside, to the snow covered mountains of Caradhras, to the Mines of Moria, the scenes were candy for the eyes. Also, quite visually appropriate were the Elves. They are just one of many signs that Peter Jackson did his homework for this movie. The Elves are tall, slender, and quite endrogenous looking. Many a girl walked away from this movie with a crush on Orlando Bloom who plays Legolas, an Elf of the Fellowship of the Ring. And we see just enough of Gollum, the foul creature who craves the ring (and one of my all time favorite characters of literature) to tease us and await seeing more of him in the movies to come. The most fantastic part of this movie was the performances. Elijah Wood plays Frodo, a hero torn between his will to do good and his fear of failure in a performance that would make Mark Hamill jealous. And for those of you who have complained that Elijah Wood is about 30 years too young, go back and read paragraph two again. His companions are no less spectacular. Sean Astin reprises a role he does very well as the underdog and puppydog companion to Frodo you can't help but love. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monoghan as Pippin and Merry respectively, are quite amusing as Frodo's other two hobbit companions and provide much comic relief amongst a serious story. Boyd in particular, is hilarious, and I'm really hoping to see more of him in the future. Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins gives much life and cynical wit to the old hobbit and gives a stellar performance. Sean Bean, whom I myself was not familiar with prior to this movie played Boromir in an excellent fashion as somewhat of a tragic hero who is tempted and eventually redeemed in a very well done scene, that in some ways almost steals the show. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies, unfortunately do not receive nearly enough lines as Legolas and Gimmli, the dwarf, though make do with what they give very well. Gimmli, in particular delivers some of the best lines of the movie. His defiant statement of, "Nobody tosses a Dwarf!" had me rolling. Even Liv Tyler manges to put on a good, if not beautiful portrayal of Arwyn. I could keep praising several other performances of other actors such as Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett, and Hugo Weaving, but I want to save most of my breath for two in particular. Viggo Mortenson, as Aragorn, also known as Strider, plays the part with stride (no pun intended). When I casted this movie in my mind, Mortenson never came to mind, but now, even when rereading the novels, I can picture no one else in his shoes. His loyalty to Frodo and will to finish what he starts runs deep and is one of the best performances of the movie. But the real praise goes to Ian McKellan. McKellan has long been heralded amongst the critics as one of the best actors of his time, though he hasnt received much name recognition. Though in my opinion, he deserves to have his name mentioned in the same breath as names like Alec Guiness, Gregory Peck, and Humphrey Bogart. I've been a big fan ever since I saw him in Richard III. And in this movie you will see why. He doesn't just play Gandalf, he becomes Gandalf. He brings every bit of character to the wise, brave, funny, and kind old wizard. When you see him battle the Balrog, an unusually terrifying creature, and he plants his staff in the ground in defiance and yells out, "You shall not pass!" you will know why I praise him this much. Well I could keep going on forever but see it and judge it for yourself. And don't forget to leave your preconceptions and the door and simply enjoy this movie for what it is; a masterpiece that was long overdue. P.S. a note to George Lucas, if you are reading this, watch this movie several times and take notes. THIS is how you deliver a promise.
1.0~it's good, but it ain't all that... tim-305 Sign in Permalink don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the book, love the world of middle- earth, am a fan of peter jackson, but this movie breaks no new ground and in no way blew me away. i enjoyed it. it was good, but i'm tired of hearing about it already...there are some nice FX, but there are also some really bad ones...there are some nice performances, but most of them are just middle of the road...in fact, if anyone should get an academy award nomination for their performance in this film, it should be sean astin. he really does a bit of acting, because most of the time, i can't stand him. but to give it to ian mckellan for playing an old man in a pointy hat...please... on a scale of 1 to 10...this movie is about an 8, but i'm giving it a 1 and will continue to give it a 1 until it drops far enough down the all time 250 on this site...this movie has reinvented nothing for the world of film and does not deserve to be ranked above the likes of blade runner, indiana jones, or jaws. and i am not sure if i want to live in a world where this film can be nominated for an academy award for both best picture and best director over moulin rouge...it's this year's titanic, i'm afraid...
1.0~More Boring than Golf! Actor317 Sign in Permalink ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ i barely sat through this movie once but when i had to watch it a second time i simply feel asleep. This movie was a combination of bad acting and bad writing. It is no where near as good as some people say. i don't care how many awards it got. It was such a waste of time. I mean come on, Elijah Wood can't act to save his life, and the guy that played 'Sam' was a good actor in other stuff i saw him in but he was terrible in this. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt though and assume it was the writing. I mean i can get past the cheesiness of Star Wars because I love both the original and the new trilogies but LOTR is ridicules! I know this is just my opinion but i mean you're insane if you honestly thing this movie deserved awards.
10.0~Sheer magic showgirl626 Sign in Permalink I'd forgotten how much I LOVE this movie. I probably watched it 100 times the first 2 years it was out on DVD (I'm not kidding...I could quote large portions of it verbatim), hadn't seen it in a while, and just finished watching it again for the first time in probably more than a year. I was fortunate enough to see all three movies on the big screen, and this one grabbed me so utterly and completely from the first moment, pulled me body and soul into that world and hasn't let go since. No other fantasy has done that before or since. As you watch the movie, you're also a part of it...you're there feeling every little nuance of Elijah Wood's expression, you're left breathless by the beauty of the land, you fall in love with Aragorn and Sam for everything they both do to protect Frodo, you echo Frodo's screams with your own when Gandalf falls into darkness with the Balrog (I've never seen a mythical creature brought to life more amazingly on the big screen!), and you can believe totally Boromir's pain as the arrows pierce his body (by the way, attention, Entertainment Weekly - I nominate Boromir's final 7 minutes in this film as the Best Death Scene Ever in a Movie!). There are so many other things I could list, but I'd rather leave them for you to discover. Though I love all three movies, neither the Two Towers nor the Return of the King will ever usurp the sheer wonderment of the first in the trilogy for me. Peter Jackson took Tolkien's amazing imagination and intelligence and brought both to the big screen in a way I wouldn't have believed possible. The music sung in Elvish, the lighting, the CGI, the ACTING! - all of it...utterly spellbinding. I'll watch this movie again and again and again, and possibly love it more every time I do. If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you run out and buy it (I can't imagine you won't want to own it after your first viewing), come home, turn down the lights, turn your phone off, and give yourself over completely to the spell this film will cast. Enjoy!
10.0~no fantasy movie to date rivals this GreyFox37 Sign in Permalink one a cold winter morning, a few days before christmas, my family and i were driving over to tinseltown (name of our theater), and were very excited to see lord of the rings. well, the whole time, my bro and i were glued to our seats. the acting was great, the special effects were outstanding, the story was told nicely in comparison to the book, and the camera shots were well executed. this is one amazing movie, and if it doesn't get anymore than 3 stars, i will be mad.
1.0~The longest 3 hours ever spent in a cinema illcuzz Sign in Permalink I know it's a matter of taste, but I CANNOT believe this film is rated so highly!!!??? I found it to be an awful, pompous, humourless, simple-minded, way too long film for any sane person to sit through and - even more bewildering - enjoy. Whether it's the zillion childish fantasy names that get thrown at you constantly, or the seemingly endless string of battle sequence after battle sequence without any real dramatic development ("oh my! watch out! yet another group of really weird looking gnomes out to kill us, quick, that way everybody!! Phewww... we just barely survived - on to the next!"), or the annoyingly dreamy blue eyes of the main character, or the simplistic way of looking at good vs. evil - i just couldn't stand it. If it wasn't for my girlfriend who loves the Tolkien books and who i ha d promised to give it a fair shot (which i REALLY did), i probably would've walked out after 45 minutes at the latest. Kitschy, over-budgeted, highly overrated heroic fantasy spectacle - Yuk.
10.0~this is not a spoiler keolani1992 Sign in Permalink wow. this movie is so good. i saw it about 6 or 7 times on video in only...yeah, about 2 months. this series is one of the best i have seen so far. some fantasy movies that are not cartoons have been kinda stupid, or silly, because they cross the line & go overboard with fake stuff. like how they may put in genies or wizards that look more like mickey mouse in costume. this movie does have two wizards, Saruman the white, & Gandalf the grey. they look, all the characters in the movie look so much like the real thing. i can't help but wonder... haha! i have not seen the two towers yet, but i hope to go to the theater sometime soon. for anyone who has not seen the movie, i must warn you that there are sad parts, GRUESOME parts, & so on, but this is a wonderful movie otherwise, so enjoy these three hours of fun! (only if you like adventure & if you are over 9 or ten years old. opinions may vary)
10.0~The definition of epic! pablo2896 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring review I have always viewed the Lord of the Rings trilogy as the incarnation of the word epic. It is bathed in moments that will pull out a tear rout of even the manliest of men just by a monologue, a part of the soundtrack, a victory in a battle, a moment were friendship shines. It will make you cheer for the main characters and join them in their journey. I could talk about this masterpiece (yes I refer to the trilogy as one experience) all lifelong, so I will do my best to summarize my feeling in these three parts. My username is pablo2896 in IMDb and Pablo22in Metacritic by the way, so you can visit my three reviews. So let's get to the first one, the first movie. The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story of a young hobbit who is put in an overwhelming quest to rid his land of evil. And for me this is one aspect that makes me tear up a bit, the fact that one so small can squeeze out so much courage from himself. And this is no other than Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins. Elijah does an amazing job acting as the main character. So the movie starts with a prologue explaining the founding of the one ring and how its master was defeated long ago. This clearly shows you what sort of a jaw dropping ride you are going into. It shows the amazing achievement of the special effects and the scale of these films. Then we are introduced to Frodo (Elijah Wood), this hobbit lives a perfect live in The Shire, a town were these hobbits live, eat and smoke weed (yes they even say it in the movie). His uncle Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) has carried the One Ring for a while, this entity that is consisted of the other half of the soul of Sauron, the evil bad guy. So he leaves it to Frodo who is then given the (almost) impossible task of taking it to the fires of Mt. Doom, the only place it can be destroyed and by doing so, vanquishing evil. And in the mean time Sauron sends his nine wraith to find this ring and kill everybody who goes in their way. Easy, right? Gandalf a powerful wizard, played by no other than Ian McKellen who perfectly portrays you the wisdom, the charm and the power of this conjurer, swears to protect Frodo at all costs in this journey and they take Sam with them, played by Sean Astin (who's incredible acting and character I will describe in my third review) Frodo's gardener with them. In their journey they meet some characters like Merry (Dominic Monaghan), Pippin (Billy Boyd) and no other than the badass Aragorn who 's actor Viggo Mortensen plays it amazingly, he is able to make you know he is a badass. So to summarize that part this movie has some of the best character developments I've seen in any movie. In the elvish sanctuary Rivendell they form the Fellowship of the Ring, which is consisted by the six characters I mentioned up there and three more, Boromir (a man), Legolas (an elf) and Gimli (a dwarf). Sean Bean, the actor who plays Boromir, does a good job in setting this character's conflicts and desires for the Ring of power, but it portrays his honor and loyalty also. Legolas and Gimli I thought would be more like filler characters but you feel interest for them and you connect to them immediately. The same can be said for Merry and Pippin. From Rivendell they embark to their destination, Mordor the Land of evil. God, I have to talk about the montage of the Fellowship traveling. It is an epic compilation of amazing landscapes and hair rising soundtrack. This is where I really felt the epicness of the movie. By the way this was pretty much the half of the movie, the buildup. So was it a typical long boring buildup? No, not in its least. They encounter dangers like spying crows sent by Saruman, an evil wizard who sides with Sauron at the beginning of the movie, and a treacherous storm (also sent by Saruman, what a dick) in the middle of a dangerous mountain which forces them to take another path, the Mines of Moria. Gimli explains to them that the dwarfs will welcome them in there but he's WRONG. They get there and the place is a graveyard, a graveyard made from dwarfs! So to summarize it they get trapped in there (blame the giant octopus) and now have to get across the dwarven city. Warning: EPICNESS! They soon find out they are not alone, and no other than Pippin (fool of a Took!) wakes up every goblin infesting the mines. This leads to an awesome battle were you are cheering for the Fellowship while it slays goblins and a cave troll! They escape and make a run for the bridge of Khazad Dumb with an army of goblins on their backs and an awesome score which is beyond epic. But they realize something else is in those mines. A Balrog. A foe so powerful, only Gandalf can defeat it. They get to the bridge and the wizard faces it. In the most epic moments of the film he takes it down but unfortunately he goes down with it. You feel the loss yourself at this moment, seeing everyone in pain. In the rest of the film they more awesome characters like Galadriel and lose some like Boromir. Another thing that I love about these movies is the fact that no one is obligated to follow Frodo to his destination. They do it for friendship, one of the most important values in these films alongside honor and loyalty. I'm reaching the limit of words here so to summarize everything, 10 out of 10! Amazing.
10.0~Response kupe Sign in Permalink It would be interesting to see what the response rate of this movie has been compared to other movies. Have the impression love it or hate it (and most love it) there is a strong Internet response to anything about this movie. The LOTR seems to have struck a cord that genders a response of some sort that no other movie to date has managed. Many movies go appreciated or hated but do not generate the sort of response that FOTR has managed. It is a standard by which many movies in the next century will be judged. If you have not seen it because you are not a fan of this sort of movie all I can do is recommend you see it in the cinema. I am sure the DVD will be more to my liking but the large screen viewing is a must to get an appreciation of the grandeur of this epic.
1.0~One of the worst movies I have ever seen! dmitchel-1 Sign in Permalink After all of the build up leading up to this movie, I was vastly disappointed. It was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Granted there were moments- like the beautiful villages of the Hobbits and the Elves. Absolutely breathtaking. But over all the movie was too dark and gory. Much more so than the book. The movie overrode the book in many places to have long, drawn out battles. Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) was something out of "Carrie," it was too bizarre to be believed. Casting 20 somethings to play 40-50'ish year old Hobbits (Frodo, Sam, et al.) also struck a jarring note. Over all a very bad, highly unfaithful adaptation of a very fine work that deserved better justice. I do not what the academy is thinking with all of it nominations!!
10.0~wow, amazing wookie406 Sign in Permalink All that i can say about this movie is that it is simply the greatest movie I have ever seen, including star Wars, my next choice, and the "trilogy" which it really isnt, but is just one epic, is the BEST ever. I HAVE read the books and Peter Jackson did some of the best editing from a book ever. Thanks Peter, keep up the good work, ill be there to see both of the next ones!
10.0~The best film of 2001 Agent10 Sign in Permalink Epics aren't easy to make, but Peter Jackson created a masterpiece of a film. This movie will easily detract all of the failed efforts he has engaged in, especially the god-awful The Frighteners. While Star Wars may be considered the superior series and Harry Potter the more popular of the fantasy epics, LOTR's depth and more subtle use of CGI effects proves to be far superior to the saturated blue-screens and matte paintings Star Wars and Harry Potter employ. I never took Elijah Wood seriously as an actor, nor Sean Astin. I was very apprehensive about these two being in this movie, but those fears were quickly alleviated when I witnessed the seemingly natural friendship the two displayed in the movie. Maybe that is why New Line made all of the movies at once. Eventually, friendships had to form in this type of setting, and such ideals would become rather convenient throughout the scope of the story. This is by far a good beginning, and fans of the books (like myself) won't be subjected to inconsistencies and older looking actors considering all of the principal photography is finalized. Which leads to one question. What kind of money would one get having to be the film clerk for this trilogy?
10.0~One of the movies each person should have on dvd. linklord Sign in Permalink This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen, not only because it happens to a revolution to normal movies but also because it is a good attempt to transfer a book into a movie something which is extremely difficult and most of the times proves to be a failure. The second part will be even better and all i can say that everyone should have lord of the rings at his/hers personal movie collection.
10.0~Fellowship Manages To Thrill Desertman84 Sign in Permalink New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release.This fantasy film based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.Set in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is seeking the One Ring. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions who form the Fellowship of the Ring begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval "Middle-earth" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo is in fact the "One Ring," a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn and Boromir; Elf archer Legolas; and Dwarf soldier Gimli. The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen, her father, Elrond, and Queen Galadriel. In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron. The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor. Peter Jackson has not only attempted the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he's pulled it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, too.Visually striking, thematically poignant, and morally weighty, the first film of Lord of the Rings is superb for it manages to thrill and enthrall despite its length and repetition.The production design is a marvel, and the special effects are dazzling but nevertheless,it manages to stay attuned to the story and the character.
10.0~My mouth is watering bigguy728 Sign in Permalink I left this movie yearning to see it again and again! And I did so- four times in the theater. I can't wait till it is released on DVD, or until the rest of the trilogy is released. From one who has read the books, I have to say it stayed very true to them. A few omissions were made, but they were necessary to keep the movie down to three hours. Now onto the good stuff. Casting was excellent. I can't think of a better person to play Frodo than Elijah Wood, nor a better person to play Gandalf than Ian McKellan. The other hobbits were played very well, and notable performances were given by Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom. Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler played their parts very well, too. The landscapes, shot in New Zealand, were simply breathtaking. The Shire and Bilbo's house were just as I imagined them. The background music complimented the action very well, and the visual effects, especially the Balrog, were stunning. I am also particular to the storyline, but I think it could not have been done better. Good luck at the Oscars!
10.0~A Really Great Movie MySilentReverie Sign in Permalink I just saw Lord of the Rings for the first time and I thought it was fantastic. The special effects were awesome, the acting was awesome, everything was awesome. I must admit that I was kind of skeptical about how good this film was going to be but it went way beyond my expectations. I haven't read any of the books but I am beginning to read The Fellowship of the Ring because the movie was just so great that I know the book is great too. I had the book for a couple months and I would read it whenever I had time but lately I haven't had much time but I am making it a goal of mine to finish all the books before the 3rd movie comes out in December 2003. I would give this movie an A+++. It was amazing.
10.0~i loved it vanjo-1 Sign in Permalink EXCELLENT, AWESOME, GREAT. GREATEST movie ever. That Aragorn was so ruggedly handsome. I am desperate. i cant wait to see them all. 7 times are not enough. i want to see it again & again
10.0~Beyond belief Aggi-3 Sign in Permalink Well, what can I say? I had high expectations and was worried that I would be disappointed, this is Lord of the rings after all. Peter Jackson pulled it off big time, surpassed my expectations. He takes my favorite book and brings it to live on the screen and sucks me so right into it that I was feeling shellshocked afterwards. It was definately the best movie of the year and it's wonderfull beyond belief. When I walked out I just wanted to go back in and see it again. There are no words who can describe what I felt when I watched it and the only complaints I got about it, it ends and I'll have to wait for one year to see the next one. Peter Jackson, I salute you!
10.0~Three Rings for the Elven Kings, Under The Sky........ Bob_Tanaka Sign in Permalink I wish I could quote the whole poem. The Lord of the Rings is, far and away, the BEST MOVIE OF 2001!!! And #2 of all time!!! Right behind the Star Wars trilogy (which I count as one movie) and right above the Longest Day. The movie does it's best to follow the books (and cuts out several pointless parts) and is just as I pictured it. AMZING acting, UNBELEAVIBLE fx, AND ALL AROUND ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! 10/10!!! and I only resurve that for the BEST the most FLAWLESS of movies!!! Nominated for 13 academy awards and should've won all of them!!! but the academy ALWAYS goes for the artsy movies!!!!
1.0~Not Too Impressed jspratjr3 Sign in Permalink Finally took in Lord of the Rings and I'm wondering why this movie is so highly praised (#4 of all time? - not even close). The battle scenes are far too cheesey Western/"A-Team"ish (1,000 bullets flying around (arrows in this case) and no one gets hit - except of course the "bad" guys). The dialogue was hard to hear on more than one occasion because the background music was so LOUD and the special effects were not all that "special". In fact, based on the technology of the time, The Wizard of Oz runs circles around Lord of the Rings. Finally, as other's have mentioned, each movie should be it's own entity. The ending was a total let down.
10.0~A Fantastic Start to A Beautiful Trilogy sayemutain Sign in Permalink This, in my opinion, is the best trilogy that has ever been written and that ever will be written. The storyline in this movie is amazing and the acting and directing was magnificent.
10.0~A Amazing Cinematic Achievement!! Tolkien Would Be Proud! CharlestonNole Sign in Permalink I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. It it certainly one of the best movies in the last 20 years, if not ever. From the beautiful landscapes of Middle Earth to the top notch acting of Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortenson, the Fellowship of the Ring truly delivers the goods. Peter Jackson has proven himself to be this generation's George Lucas or even the man Steven Speilberg. His visual style is breathtaking. This movie hinges (obviously) on the Fellowship. Their interaction and growth as characters is what makes this truly an epic film. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie now. Bottom Line: 10/10!
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring WubsTheFadger Sign in Permalink Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novel has finally hit the big screen. Peter Jackson has created a film that is spectacular and grand it deserves all the praise and glory. Jackson swiftly enters us into the world of Middle Earth and fluidly shows the characters that are unique and genuine. The story is an epic that deserves to be experienced by all movie watchers. This film is a masterpiece. The acting is amazing. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Andy Serkis, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, and Hugo Weaving were all perfectly cast. They all perform very well. The pacing is perfect and the runtime allows you to enter the fictional world. The special effects are very good and the scenery is beautiful and mesmerizing. Pros: Epic, spectacular, and grand story, unique and genuine characters, amazing acting, perfect character casting, perfect pacing, wonderful special effects, amazing scenery, and a runtime that allows you to enter the world Cons: None Overall Rating: 9.9
1.0~A three hour film about walking. Goataid Sign in Permalink Ok, so forget all the hype and think about it for a second. 3 hours in which nothing much happens except a bit of walking and then a bit of fighting does not a good film make. There may be those who are fans of the book and I don't doubt that to them this is a great film. But to anyone else who have never ventured into the world of Tolkien then it is a huge let down. There seems to be too much reliance on knowledge from the book as none of the characters seem to have any back story and we haven't got a clue to why they are prepared to take on the quest. The action scenes are few and far between and when they do come they seem a bit lacklustre. The acting is nothing special and there are some scenes (The council meeting) where the effects people must have taken the day off. Which leaves the walking... there's a lot of it. In fact they're some of the best bits as New Zealand looks very nice. However that's all that gets done and after a while I was convinced that the film was going to show and advert for Millets or the Rambling association at the end. Painfully dull though if rambling or fantasy is not your thing.
8.0~The second one is 4 hours long......Kill me. Badmoviessuck Sign in Permalink This movie is good actually. It's and enjoyable fantasy adventure that will give you a fun ride. It has some pacing issues at the beginning of the movie but after like 1 hour or so the movie get's better with it's pacing. The action is well done and i enjoyed it throughout the movie. But there is this one problem with the movie which i will talk about. CHARACTERS The characters are very weak. Frodo is a weak protagonist, Sam is barely there in the movie. Mary and Pippin are weak characters and pretty much all of the gang are weakly written. But i'll give it the benefit of the doubt that they will be developed on the second and third movie and this movie had clearly story driven characters cause Frodo is kind of a passive character. Frodo made about two choices in the movie. The first one that starts the adventure, that choice was so that he could survive and that the world would go under and that gandalf told him to make that choice. The second one was Frodo decided all by himself but the rest of the movie Frodo and all the other characters are let stuff happen to them which makes them passive. It's nothing wrong with that and they could do alot to change that anyways but they should have atleast gave all the characters a little more depth not a lot but just a little. And i think Frodo should have somewhat changed in the first movie like for example he is going a little bit more crazy cause of the ring but i believe that they would keep that in the sequel and i am sure that the sequel is going to be better than the first one. VERDICT Overall a solid movie with some problems but they aren't major problems and i recommend this movie
10.0~A Triumph! MrWhite2 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best films ever made. This definetly makes my top ten list. The film not only has dazzling and unbelievably magnificent visual special effects, but has other wonderful qualities. The acting is surprisingly really good (Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean, John Rhys-Davies, Christopher Lee and especially Ian McKellan). The directing is also top notch. Great filming locations also. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the only movies that is actually better than the novel! If you haven't seen this, you're out of your mind!!!! Grade: A+.
10.0~My thoughts on the hype and the ending coleslaw1017 Sign in Permalink Throughout many of the comments already made, many people are questioning the hype for this movie. For me, it was the fact that I had just read the Hobbit at the beginning of the year for the first time. I saw the movie when I was about 3/4 through the FOTL. I couldn't wait to see how Peter Jackson would portray everything in the book, because frankly he had a very tough job. Personally I think he did a fine job. Better than I could have imagined. I am no movie critic by any means. I mean some people found the FX to be horrible while others were blown away. I would be one that thoroughly enjoyed the FX and the rest of the movie for that matter. I did not mind that the movie was 3 hours long. It needed to be to contain as much of the knowledge from the book as was possible. I also did not mind the ommision of Tom Bombadil(sp?) Honesty I really don't think that that scene really needed to be included to understand the main focus of the story. All in all the book surpased my expectations. I look forward to the next two movies! P.S. As to the ending of the movie. I thought it was done well. I really don't know how Jackson could have ended it better, considering how the books read. Those who have read the books, can you think of a better way to end the first installment?
2.0~It's a good kids movie. rooprect Sign in Permalink In all fairness, it's a good kids movie. But I'm afraid that all the hype & numerous awards will fool some people into believing it has artistic merit. Once again, let me stress: IT'S A KIDS MOVIE. You'll find no subtlety, no symbolism, no real character development, no underlying theme, no clever dialog, and nothing really to challenge your mind. Instead you'll get action, dazzling landscapes, special effects, a rushing musical score, good costumes, good makeup and action (I say that twice, because it's the best thing the movie has going for it... really, the action scenes are pretty good). But if you're looking for an *artistic* fairy tale (like City of Lost Children, Brazil, Big Fish, The Crow, Nosferatu [1979] or Arizona Dream), you'll not only be disappointed... you'll be downright annoyed.
10.0~I Almost Gave It A Nine (9)... hawkeye_pierce2 Sign in Permalink ...but gave it a 10 because the stunning visuals (and I don't just mean "FX" I mean actual retinal intake at the utter aesthetic level) made up for the tiny bit of creeping out I got from looking directly into Elijah Wood's face all movie (not kidding). Short of that, I am almost excited and giddy such a new movie has climbed to #4 all time (on IMDb at least) but frankly it earned it. Any movie almost as good as Rain Man (but in polar-opposite ways) deserves to be #4...(I too loved Godfather and especially The Shawshank Redemption, but Rain Man is arguably the greatest film ever for many, vastly different reasons). I digress, no one should miss Lord of the Rings and I'm just glad I caught it at the Blue Ridge in Raleigh 8mos after it premiered (seeing this for the 1st time on video/at home would have been my loss).
10.0~Of course, the best thriller of all time! chrishewittpiano Sign in Permalink As most of the 10s of thousands of people that have taken the time to put in a vote for this movie had said, this was a great movie, you get to hear it again. This was a terrific and amazing movie! I have read this book and have to say that it follows all the key points of the story. It did leave out a few main events, but they were not all that important and still let the movie flow wonderfully. This is one of those movies that is very comforting to watch and keep you wanting to watch it over and over again. First of all, it starts out so pleasing and delightful with shots of the shire accompanied by the warm, soothing music that puts it all together. It makes it seem as if there really is such thing as the Shire in a place called Hobbiton in Middle Earth. Every single actor and actress in this film are far beyond outstanding. Especially Elijah Wood who as you probably already know, plays the haughty little hobbit, Frodo. The flaws of this engrossing movie are not as major as I would have thought they would be. There are tons and tons of little nit-pick problems in this movie like "Sam Gamgee is too tall to be a hobbit", but they don't strike me as important. With all the time and tough effort it took and all the key points that make this movie interesting that the creators had to capture, I say that they are no flaws that come to mind without being thought of. One thing that I took to work was the camera angles in the part where Gandalf was in Bilbo's hobbit hole and Bilbo was serving him tea. You see, in the movie it looked as if Gandalf was somewhere around 8 1/2 ft. tall and bilbo looked about 5. In real life they only differ in height by about 1/2 a foot. I am not sure if that is a pro or a con. All of the worlds that are in the first "Lord of the Rings" movie are very enchanting. The Hobbits, the Elves, the Dwarfs, every one has their own special gene to their nationality, if you could call it that. Having this story about a silly little ring may seem pointless, but J. R. R. Tolkien makes this story very thrilling and somewhat scary in his own ways. This movie deserved everything it got from the public and frankly could have deserved more. I am sure that the second movie and especially the third movies will just as great and if not, better. I would give this movie an 11, but I can only give it a 10/10.
10.0~Not as good as the book, but does it justice litlepeoplescary Sign in Permalink I'm not going to go into this for 1,000 words, for one word sums it up, excellent. I have been a fan of the LOTR trilogy since 4th grade, even though I did not understand much at that age. It has caught my attention and I am going to be reading the books and watching this movie for the rest of my life. There were some parts missing for which I am disappointed (Tom Bombadil, the Barrow Downs, Glorifindel, the wolves near Moria, Gollum floating down the Anduin, and the winged Nazgul). Some parts were not essential to the story, but hopefully will appear in the DVD. For all those who rated this movie a 7 or lower and commented on it only to scorn it, I recommend you read the book before commenting again. Then realize what an amazing job Peter Jackson did converting the greatest story ever written (in my opinion) to possibly the greatest movie ever filmed.
10.0~At last, Lord of the Rings is visualized. partalios Sign in Permalink At last, a dream of millions becomes reality with the creation of the movie trilogy. From a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien : Thank you Mr. Jackson ! I think the film is excellent for non-Tolkien fans, but I would prefer a more accurate transfer of the book. For example, the scene with Liv Tyler does not exist on the book. But it's still a fantastic film.
10.0~YAYYYY! amhassell89 Sign in Permalink I LOVE this movie! My absolute favorite! Then again there are the other two coming out...well, those ones are my favorite too! Well, I loved how real it was and how much work they did to put in to it. I just really wish they would hurry and release the other two movies because if they're better than this one....they're good.
10.0~The Best Film of All Time, so far. sempergumby Sign in Permalink Its interesting that approximately two-thirds of those who have viewed this film give it a 10 out of 10, and yet you read reviews that infer this was a terrible movie. I guess there is no accounting for taste, but if 60% of the voting public thinks this movie is a "10" then I think you are safe in spending the time and money to view it. Having just watched The Godfather a few months ago after discovering this website, it is difficult to understand why it is rated above LOTR:FOTR. FOTR is more exciting, with more beautiful scenery, equal direction, equally convincing acting, better camera angles, less offensive language, funnier comedy, and much better special effects. The only areas where The Godfather could be argued superior is specifically the realism and drama of the film. Yet isn't a films value based on its ability to take you from reality, captivate your senses for a few short hours and communicate with your soul through your emotions. Fellowship of The Rings is a rollercoaster of humor, joy, fear, disgust, beauty, responsibility, duty and love. I have read many reviews and those critical of the film rarely can point to specific failings, because the scenes are masterfully done. The opening scene in the Shire is warm and cozy with an air of mystery and a dollop of humor. Even the fireworks display is a spectacular display of eyecandy. Each scene that follows moves the story along and simultaneously is enjoyable in and of itself. A movie can't be too long if you enjoy every minute. I also was sad at the end, like others have commented, because I wanted to continue to admire Peter Jackson's masterpiece. One of, if not the Best Films of All time, till Christmas 2002. (I hope)
10.0~Very impressive...Lord Of the Rings is rife with extreme hard work. saiyanloveruk Sign in Permalink I have only just seen Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring(04/04/02), and I was very impressed with what I saw...while I was skeptical about what the film would be like, the skepticism was washed instantly away when Frodo began his perilous journey... My personal favourite highlights were whenever Legolas was on-screen, but thats me...others included when Boromir(sean penn) died after valiantly fighting the orks, and when Gandalf died..so sad I almost cried. in conclusion...Very impressive...Lord Of the Rings is rife with extreme hard work.
10.0~Perfect finslens Sign in Permalink This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Tolkien provides a brilliant story, and Jackson provides breathtaking sets, special effects, and well directed performances from the ensemble cast of underdog hero's. It's charming, funny, action packed, and completely captivating. Fans of the Tolkien books will be more than satisfied by this celluloid adaptation, and newcomers to this timeless story will be blown away by the depth and romance of not only the plot itself, but in each character a well. If you haven't seen this film, you're cheating yourself.
10.0~Why oh Why Wasn't the EE the Theatrical Release??? Doc Scot Sign in Permalink I saw the EE version of FOTR on the big screen and it was so much better than the theatrical release. The flow of the film was smoother and the additional scenes would certainly have been helpful to those unfamiliar with the book and a delight to those of us who missed such scenes as the presentation of Galadriel's gifts to the fellowship. Not to say that the theatrical release wasn't fantastic; I saw it 30+ times. I am just so glad that PJ and New Line decided to release the EE's on the big screen to prep us for ROTK. I am looking forward to seeing the EE of TTT next week. I hope at some point PJ and New Line will screen the EE of ROTK after they make their bundle on the theatrical release and DVDs.
10.0~Great Movie Making jbigdaddy@earthlink.net Sign in Permalink Certainly one of the great Movies of any time. Should have won best movie in 2002 but it's not over yet, is it. Anyone who thinks this movie is below a 7 should check them selves. I give it a 10 as it did exactly what a great movie should do, entertain with style and great story telling. The sets are beautiful, the costumes are stunning. What more do you need?
10.0~The greatest movie of all time. Period. End of story. fullveracity28 Sign in Permalink Okay. This movie has now become my religion. I have fallen in love with the grandeur and beauty of the universe that Peter Jackson has shown us. Lord of the Rings sometimes seems less a movie, and more a window into a world of wizards, hobbits, and breathtaking landscapes. I just want to thank Peter Jackson for what he has given us. I find that most of the crap Hollywood tries to throw at us are not worth watching - even for free. This is one of those very special films that can tell a story so well, and be so grand in scope, that it can literally take the viewer to another place for three hours. For this, I am truly grateful to Peter Jackson.
10.0~The beginning tomimt Sign in Permalink I am a fan of the book. I admit it right here in the beginning. I have also been waiting for someone to turn the books into a movie or movies since I first time saw incomplete animation by Ralph Bakshi. Then some years ago I began to hear rumours, that a director from New Zealand, Peter Jackson was about to take on this task. The name wasn't unfamiliar to me: I had seen his previous movies, Brain Dead, Bad Taste and The Frighteners. I didn't know what to think. I did like the movies, but then again he was a splatter movie expert, not fantasy. Then I watched them again, and I saw the visual tricks and camera usage he had achieved in those little films and I became more confident. The subtle fantasy elements in Brain Dead convinced me of his abilities. But still, I was little afraid: could he pull it off? Then, sometime later, after hours of studying rumours and leaked photos in internet I and my friend finally got our hands wrapped around the tickets, tickets to get us in one of the first viewings after the premiere around here where I live. My throat was dry and I was anxious to see the final product. Couple of hours later my friend and I left the theatre mesmerized. It had been more than we expected, light years above anything we'd seen before on the screen. We spent hours talking about the experience and we came in conclusion, that if the quality of the first film were a promise from things to come there wouldn't be anything to worry about. Besides of the stunning cinematography, music and special effects there are amazing actor performances seen all over the film: Ian McKellen as Gandalf, a wise old wizard who is leading the fellowship through perilous journey. Sean Bean as Boromir, son of Denethor, steward of Gonodr. Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, corrupted head of the wizard's council. John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, son of Gloin, a dwarfish warrior. Billy Boyd as Pippin and Dominc Monaghan as Merry, two loyal friends of Frodo (Elijah Wood), and Samwise (Sean Astin). Only two actors I didn't immediately fell for were Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, or Strider if you will, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. There wasn't anything specific in Bloom's case; the part just wasn't a huge acting part, mainly just looking pretty. In Mortensen case I was little bit distracted by his, perhaps little too calm at first, portrayal of Aragorn. But I got over it. The special extended edition didn't bring anything crucial to the movie, just some scenes adding more depth to the story, like the journey of the elves, where Frodo and Sam see the elves travelling in the forest, going towards the Grey Havens, in order to leave the Middle Earth. Fellowship of The Rings was and is extremely good start for the one of the most stunning trilogies of the movie history.
10.0~Great movie i want to watch it again iPawan Sign in Permalink I love to watch it again and again. Because this movie have some kind of magic that take me to another world. Whenever i watch this movie....also the charterer of this movie is awesome and so realistically design by the makers. and in the end i want to say the whole series of the movie is awesome. cool. best. love to watch it again in future if any new part will release. the approach of this movie is very good to pull our whole consideration towards to the movie. i felt if i were be part of this movie. but this would be not possible. but anyways thanks for the movie. although the all part is good but the last part is awesome. please release all new parts asap. i'll definitely buy tickets and go to hall for watching this.
10.0~One of the best BasAlivE Sign in Permalink I am going to be very brief: It should have won the Academy Award for best movie. It is all one can ask for in a movie. It depicts the book in a magnificent way. Even though it is very long, time flies by and all you wish for at the end is to see the next part of the trilogy. A must see.
10.0~Go to the bathroom before it starts. Evil Iggy Sign in Permalink 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is Potentially one of the greatest films of all time. Its only detractors being its length, (178 min) and that the end seems abrupt. 3 hours is a long time to sit still (especially after you've had a 44 oz. soda) but few would argue that it wasn't worth it. As for the ending, think of it as a cliff hanger ending for the next 2 films. I'll say this, it has motivated me to read the LOTR series (truthfully I'm just not patient enough to wait for the movies).
10.0~To the point.. silverandblack72 Sign in Permalink I'm afraid that I do not have the time nor the reference to go on about my opinion of this film, nor do I think you want to read another lengthy opinion about this film so I just simply sum it up in one word. Perfection.
10.0~LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring...the King of the Fantasies. Sharkey360 Sign in Permalink I will be very honest here. Star Wars is NO LONGER the supreme fantasy movie franchise. LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring INSTANTLY KILLS any Star Wars movie for that honor hands down and no questions asked. The Fellowship has an extremely high level of quality and excellence. Never have I seen a fantasy epic that featured a perfect-cast, very deep character development, excellent pacing, excellent special effects and best of all, an excellent story that was perfectly translated from Tolkien's books. Right from the beginning of the film, which details the history of the Ring, I was blown away by a wave of cinematic excellence. As far as fantasies go, The Fellowship has a perfect cast and each character is excellently cast, like Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf, VM as Strider/Aragorn, Liv Tyler as Arwen...etc. Heck, by seeing them onscreen I don't think of the actors but more about their characters...it comes to show that the stars instantly vanished to transform into the famous characters many people know worldwide. LOTR: The Fellowship is nothing less than excellent as a fantasy...and as a movie in general. I highly recommend to EVERYONE to see this film and I promise you...forgetting about Star Wars is worth it as long as there is LOTR. A lot has changed when I saw this movie. I never knew Peter Jackson before LOTR but now I greatly respect him as a master of fantasy and story detail...I am not afraid to say that Mr. Star Wars himself, George Lucas, has finally met someone who has BEATEN HIM to the punch. By comparison, Lucas is responsible for the decline of fantasy entertainment value of Star Wars since he made The Phantom Menace, and no, Attack of the Clones is not enough to entertain me. Perhaps he should try hiring Peter Jackson for Episode III... Sorry Star Wars, I am sticking with LOTR. My salute to Tolkien and Jackson!!!
10.0~Old J.R.R. Tolkien would have been proud! hutchcal Sign in Permalink I was nervous that this great fantasy novel would be watered down and chopped up as to be almost unrecognizable. I am happy to report that the movie is true to the very soul of middle earth and the people that inhabit it.
10.0~Wow RatBoy1323 Sign in Permalink This film is a triumph in almost every aspect. I had never read the books upon seeing the film and was a little sceptical about what many people were claiming that it would change the way films were made. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has become my favorite movie of all time. And I have seen a lot of freaking movies. Every aspect of the film works. The cast works their respective roles to perfection with Ian McKellen(Gandalf), Elijah Wood(Frodo), Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn), Sean Bean(Boromir), and Sean Astin(Sam) being the standouts. From the epic prologue of the film you realize that there is a great, epic journey ahead of you. And along the way you meet and care for every single character in the film. Director Peter Jackson has really crafted a beautiful piece of work that will be remembered for ages. It's a perfect balance of action and great character moments. Character development is not sacrificed for more action like so many other films of its like. There are many moments of the film that make you realize this is more than just your typical fantasy film, moments that transcend filmmaking and have a profound effect on you. The last 30 minutes are particularly powerful and moving. Basically, this film is an epic, incredible experience. A film that will be looked at years down the road as a great piece of filmmaking. If you're a fan of good fantasy, or if you're just a fan of great movies, you'll love this film, plain and simple.
6.0~Is everybody blind?!?! DaKingTM Sign in Permalink I just saw this movie rank third in the top 250 movies of all-time, and steam came out of my ears. Who are these people that rate the worst movie released this year so highly? I will tell you who they are. They are people who have read the book a quadrillion times, and love it so much that they are unable to see this movie for the horror that it is. The book may be great, I wouldn't know because I haven't read it, but as a movie it sure bites! Yes, it's beautifully made. Yes, it does the book justice in the representation of it's characters. Bla bla bla. But you cannot fill three (3!!!) hours of a movie with a story that could be told in just one! The horrendously slow pace and ever lingering storytelling made me want to pull my hair out after the first hour! And to imagine they are going to make two more of these monsters... The mind boggles how ones vision can become so clouded by memories that this film actually becomes good. Same sort of story with the Matrix, but I've told that to a lot of deaf ears already, so I'll stop now. Sweat dreams...
10.0~By Far the Best! Defiance37 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings is by far the best movie ever made! The graphics were great and although I had never read the book I completely understood it. It was casted, filmed and altogether great! I loved this movie and can't wait for the second!
10.0~A true classic. tobys-1 Sign in Permalink I believe LOTR is one of the best movies made in recent years. As a fan of the classic movies I've long thought that the modern film industry has gone at least somewhat off course. If it follows the lead of LOTR it will be on its way back. It was refreshing to see a movie like this. Never having read the books, I did find the plot somewhat hard to follow the first time I saw it. That would be the movie's weakness. But it has most everything that makes a great film--adventure, action, plot, scenery, effects, good acting,etc. I'm anxiously awaiting The Two Towers. I believe the LOTR trilogy will become a true classic.
10.0~I love this movie Rochwen Sign in Permalink I can't really say so much more than I love this movie.. I saw a show once and they had a short piece when they talked to Peter Jackson, and he said that some people have seen the first movie like ten times during the time they've been waiting for film number two... I thought, ten times? I think I've seen it about 30... I mean... it's really great... all who have been working with it should be really proud... one thing that makes it so great is that you can see it and understand it even if you don't know anything... I did. but now I've bought all books in Swedish, but I'm saving to afford them in English too. and you can read a lot and go deeply in the story, and still understand it... it's really great... I don´t think I can words for how good this film is... not in Swedish and not in English... if you haven't seen it you really should!!!
10.0~Monumental masterpiece Jordankenney6 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The first chapter in Peter Jackson's beautiful re-imagining of Middle- Earth created by J.R.R Tolkien's best selling novels comes a story of friendship, trust, hope and tragedy. A small, shy Hobbit Frodo Baggins gets more than he bargained for when he has to protect a magical ring from evil hands and save Middle-Earth from eternal darkness. I could go into a lot more detail but I don't want to spoil the superb story-line. Just know it's of memorable quality and definitely keeps you engaged until the end. Story: 10/10 I'll touch on the wonderful visuals created by Peter Jackson, from The Shire all the way to the Mines of Moria and Amon Hen these all look beautiful and unique, Peter really wanted to create something memorable, unforgettable and spectacular here. The characters all look unique and easy to tell apart. Elves look like Elves, Dwarfs like Dwarfs and Orcs like, well, Orcs. The costume design is great, the CGI effects and locations are stunning, even to today's standards. With the Blu-Ray edition of these movies you are getting a real treat visually. Visuals: 10/10 The next thing to explain about, is the sound design. Howard Shore gives his musical excellence here to provide a truly breath-taking soundtrack. When the audience is meant to feel happy, the music is heart warming and cheerful, when you are meant to cry the music deepens down and hits your heart strings emotionally. The music does a perfect job of immersing you in this fantasy world and really keeps you there until the experience is over. The dialogue is key to success also, the actors all provide key and believable dialogue here, the sound design is also as fantastic as the visuals. Audio: 10/10 The acting is key here, you wouldn't a bad actor in any main role of such a high expected movie. Elijah Wood provides his role as young Frodo Baggins and plays him extremely well here, accompanied by Sean Astin as Sam-Wise Gamgee. The stand performance in this movie has to be Ian Mckellen as Gandalf the Grey, his timing with his lines is perfect, his facial expressions are spot on and his commitment to the role is also worth mentioning, all the actors seemed to have fun in their roles and all seemed pleased with their deliverance of performance. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett also provide roles as chief characters in this masterpiece as all the acting is of top standard. Acting: 10/10 The overall verdict of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is ... Perfect visuals, a masterpiece of a soundtrack and superb acting. Overall I put this as one of my favourite movies of all time and this is definitely worth the highest mark. Movie: 10/10
10.0~An incredible beginning to (in my opinion), the most epic fantasy film series! OneRingToRuleThemAll13 Sign in Permalink First I must begin by telling you that I did not read the books of the same name that this movie is based on until this year actually, and I first saw this film shortly before the second entry came out in the theaters, so you shouldn't have any problem with watching this film, or any of the other two that showcase the next two books in the series (The Two Towers and The Return of the King), and will your enjoyment of the books after watching the films will diminish only slightly (if at all) because you already know the plot. This film begins the tale of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), a young ''hobbit'' (creatures thought of originally by the books' sadly long- dead author, J.R.R Tolkien), whose caretaker Bilbo (Ian Holm) who took him in after his parents died, makes up his mind and leaves for a one- way trip to Rivendell, land of the elves which is ruled by Elrond (Hugo Weaving, and leaves to Frodo the ''One Ring'', creation of the Dark Lord Sauron before his demise. Frodo learns from the wizard Gandalf (played pitch-perfect by Ian Mckellen), that the Ring is evil, and is the reason why Bilbo has reached the age of 111, due to the ability of the Ring which gives you immortality. He also tells him that part of the malice of Sauron's spirit lived on in the Ring long after he died, giving the Ring a mind of his own and a desperate desire to return to the hand of his master. Bilbo found the ring when he fell into Gollum's (motion- capture genius Andy Serkis) cave, and took it from the ground. Gollum, who had possessed it for a very long time, was deformed and driven mad by the Ring. Gandalf gives Frodo the task of taking it to the village of Bree, and later on to Rivendell, where he forges a pact with Gandalf, Sam (his dear gardener, played by Sean Astin), Merry and Pippin, hobbits and old friends of Frodo (played by Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, respectively), Aragorn and Boromir (both of the race of Men), Legolas the Elf, and the dwarf Gimli, to carry the Ring to Mount Doom in Mordor, Sauron's domain, to destroy the evil Ring, for the sake of Middle-Earth, (the setting of the books and films). The acting here is top-notch, with special notice given to Ian Mckellen, Elijah Wood, and Sean Astin as Sam. (who gives it his all) Sam (as many other readers and movie buffs alike, moi included), is the true main character of the films and books(you'll see why in next installments). The pacing is perfect, I never get bored while watching (and, believe me I have seen this film THOUSANDS OF TIMES!). The music is one of the best around (composed, orchestrated, conducted, and produced by Howard Shore), and will keep you humming, excited or at the edge of your seat whenever the occasion warrants it. However, the most incredible part of this film series is the ability for the film crew to bring to life the beautiful and exciting locales of the book series. Filmed in New Zealand, The Lord of the Rings is beautiful. Also among the chief reason for LOTR rabid fans to watch this is how they only strayed from the plot of the book in minor details (at least in this one), and stayed true to the core spirit and heart of the books. The most epic parts of the books are still here and are sometimes even better (for example, the sequence of The Bridge of Khazad Dúm is seriously the most epic thing I have ever seen in any film :P), while sometimes I feel they didn't unleash some parts' true potential (yes, I am imagining you, Lothlorien >.>). If you haven't yet seen Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, and you are a fan of the books, please do yourself a favor and rent this right away (after you've seen the theatrical version, you might be interested in the EXTENDED edition of this, which is one of the rare cases in which the extended version is actually BETTER that the original). IF you haven't read the books and you are just looking for an epic fantasy or action film, then by all means, sink your teeth into this an enjoy! I guarantee you will thank me later ;) *NOTE: I will be posting a review for The Two Towers and also another for The Return of the King shortly. Please, check back tomorrow or in the near future*
10.0~An excellent film; drags on a bit but otherwise phenomenal krimple Sign in Permalink This film did for me as an adult what Star Wars did for me as a child. It delivered on every level. Those who didn't like the film can give their reasons; I think that it faithfully (as possible) told the Tolkien story in the proper spirit. I do agree that some of the dialogue could have been clearer, and that it did drag just a little bit, but Peter Jackson should be commended for delivering a spectacular, moving epic. I read the books as a child, then as a young adult, and am reading them again now as a 33 year old. The books and the movie work on multiple levels. I must admit I didn't even see the Nine as clearly in my mind's eye as he did. I knew the plot, but when Frodo and the hobbits were cowering under the tree roots I was as scared as anyone else. Hats off to Peter Jackson and the rest of the LOTR crew. They did a phenomenal job.
10.0~The best film I've seen all year! Kerenza_ Sign in Permalink This is definitely my favourite movie of the year and possibly of all time. It keeps the watcher interested and enthrawled the whole way through, even if you have read the book and know what is going to happen! The way they make the hobbits look so real is fantastic and the scenery is just amazing! The three and a half hours went more quickly than some half an hour shows I have seen. Go and see this movie whether you're unsure or not. You won't be disappointed!
10.0~Possibly the best film of my lifetime. elliehemm Sign in Permalink I have seen LOTR twice now and I absolutely adore it. I had previously read the trilogy and I am very pleased with the translation from book to screen. I love every minute of this movie, from Cate's (Galadriel) opening speech to the last shots of Frodo and Sam. In particular I loved scenes in the Shire, in Rivendell, the mines of Moria and the trek up Caradhras. The acting was fabulous, my favorites being Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf and Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, however the whole cast did a phenomenal job and all praise goes out to them. I thought the scenery was breath-taking and the musical score added to the movie as a whole. The loyal hobbits, the beautiful elves, the bravery of the men and the strength of the dwarves, as Elijah said this film is really about courage and good triumphing over an evil force. My favorite characters on screen and in print are Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin and of course Legolas. I don't undertsand the problems some people have with this movie, if you disliked the sudden ending I advise you to read the books. To people who are criticising this film because the genre is 'fantasy' I urge them to go watch the film and see if they can understand what we all see in this movie, it does not matter elf or man, it is a fantastic story or friendship and bravery. I think this is the best film I've ever seen, to me it is perfect. but don't take my word for it, go see for yourself. I also urge you to read the trilogy before the release of 'The two towers' this Christmas, I for one can't wait. Congratulations LOTR!!!!!
10.0~My goodness andrew_flay Sign in Permalink This film ages so beautiful, a masterpiece for all ages to come, Peter Jackson I salute you, thank you for this brilliant trilogy in fact I think best trilogy period.
10.0~THIS is a Masterpiece. hauksdottir Sign in Permalink As a long-time admirer of Tolkien's works (his scholarly commentaries as well as his fiction), I was apprehensive about yet another attempt to film Middle-Earth. Jackson is not only a brave man, but a brilliant one. His direction is not absolutely perfect, IMHO as a world-builder, however I can lay my quibbles aside and walk in his recreation with joy and certitude that the work is in good hands. The previous attempts have been disasters, but THIS is a Masterpiece. I have seen it more than 20 times, and am still finding new things to appreciate: the details are spot-on accurate and everything and everyone is believable. This isn't fantasy, this is history... before it became legend and myth. I can hardly wait to own the complete Director's Cut (maybe 10 hours with all 3 movies and comments?) It will quite possibly be the Movie of the Century. A daunting task has become an incredible achievement.
10.0~Cinema has come full circle. greengeek_85 Sign in Permalink I am 17 years old, and I work in a theater. About 5-6 months ago we got a poster of a ragged looking Elijah Wood holding a gold band with no text except for "The Trilogy Begins". I had heard of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings but never read them and I had never heard it was being made into a film. Upon the first trailer I saw I bought and read the books instantly, and I must say if this film lived up to the book, I would have for my generation what a certain space opera provided back in 1977. The books are masterpieces, no questions asked, if you did not like them, your either void of creative intuition or just can't enjoy reading. Needless to say with every poster and trailer reel we recieved I had a shiver down my spine, my only thought, this Jackson guy better not massacre this film as was done in the animated version back in the day. The night we recieved the prints, we spliced it and played it after closing. I can honestly say that I would have sat through it 8 more times, wich I eventually did, but that's another story. Elijah Wood was always that goofy looking kid in the movie with Macauly Caulkin, but he owned the screen, no one can take that away from him, except every actor in the movie. In no way am I taking away from Wood, but everybody in the film put 110% into this gem. I must say that of all the hobbits, Sam was the closest to my vision, a little chubby, a lovable round face, and displaying his loyalty to his friend without saying a word. Sean Astin was never overshadowed or overlooked, he was honest and a generally great guy. I wish they would have tied in that he, Merry and Pippin were all in cahoots waiting for Frodo to make his move, but since his process of leaving the Shire was cut down from over 10 years to one night the change had to be made and I understand. I did miss Bombadil but I will not complain, his character would have seemed corny and out of sync if kept intact and actually might have hurt the films dramatic integrity, some characters are great on paper but just can't be translated to film. I need to say no words about Ian Mckellan because I cannot bring justice to his performance, if a course was taught on great acting, his performance would be at the heart of the curriculum. I loved Legolas and Gimli as the unlikely pair, Rhys-Davis is one of the best character actors ever and he is really funny, I think they could have spared some more comedic back-and-forths between the two, which may have ended up on the cutting room floor. The battle scenes are all spectacular, spellbinding and well...cool. Done with the scale and skill that I think no other film has accomplished, considering the special effects and make-up required alone, I love the scythe swipe performed by a battle line of elven warriors at the beginning of the picture, it was a great little bit of choreography. All in all I think Peter Jackson was robbed at the Academy Awards this year and I know I am part of the many masses that agree. But there are two more films, and hopefully someone will kidnap Russel Crowe (hehe). Jackson and his rag-tag group of hobbits, elves, dwarves, wizards, and oh yeah, men will have the last laugh. Two Towers and Return of the King were superior books because the story's wheels had been set in motion. If that transfers to film, wich I have no doubt it will, 2002 and 2003 will bring the story so much gold Frodo could just pitch the ring in a lake and go home happy, for all his troubles will not have been in vain.
10.0~Ian Mckellen and Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for their portrayal of Gandalf and Frodo. bijek-1 Sign in Permalink The Academy showed their blindness once more. I' m sure that both Ian Mckellen and Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar. I truly admire their perfomance. For many people Gandalf and Frodo had their faces. Ian and Elijah are so marvellous actors and they should be praised for their hard work.
10.0~Absolutely incredible gnielsen1 Sign in Permalink What can you say about an experience like this film? It is beautifully as well as lovingly done. The only negative I have heard is that the ending was not an ending. Well, it isn't, there is more to come. I saw this in an IMAX theater and it was great.
1.0~disappointed Boomdeay Sign in Permalink I read the books before seeing the movie, and I was horrified at how much they tore apart the book. I felt that they made changes to it that were unnecessary. such as Arwen's part in the movie. in the book she doesn't even speak, and in the movie, she saves frodo's life. just because you hire liv tyler to do a part, doesn't mean you have to invent things that aren't true so that she can be in it more. that's hollywood for ya. and they left out something that I thought was a big symbolic thing in the book. the sword that was broken is reforged. also, galadriel is made out to be some sort of evil lady. she isn't made that way in the book at all, they are actually honored to be in lorien with the elves and with her. and the breaking of the fellowship happens completely differently. I could name a million things that bother me. there was one thing that I was thrilled about. the visuals. they did an excellent job with the characters, places and things. everything is pretty much as I would picture it. in short, I won't be seeing the second movie, or the third. I recommend that you read the books. the story is put together so much better than the twisted cinema version
3.0~Utter Failure andrew7 Sign in Permalink I'm shocked at how immensely popular this film is so far. I'm used to finding fault with overwhelmingly popular films. For instance, I think "American Beauty" is good, but far far over-rated. But this is something new for me. This is a film that is overwhelmingly adored, which I find to be not only over-rated, but not even any good at all. This is a bad movie, plain and simple. Its got a really bad script. The characters are terribly thin (with one exception: Gandalf), and certain events have been so hurried that either they lack all dramatic force (The Council of Elrond) or they are utterly impenetrable to someone who doesn't already know what's happening (Lothlorien). I realize that Jackson had the near impossible task of condensing The Fellowship of the Ring into a mere three hours (I think four is necessary, at an absolute minimum). But the decisions he made (what he omitted, what he condense, and what he lengthened) reveal his intention to make an epic action film, rather than an epic fantasy adventure film. Even the flaws of this movie are entirely in keeping with that goal. Action movies don't need good characters. They need good special effects. Action movies don't need drama, they need fights. There is a very small minority of filmgoers who feel that action is boring. As long as the characters are fighting, they are not in any way advancing the story. And for a story to be good, it has to move. There is plenty of movement in The Fellowship of the Ring. But there are also massive sequences where the story advances not one jot for unendurable stretches of time, to allow the characters (or their obviously computer-generated counterparts) to battle some massive computer-generated foe. The worst offender is the Moria sequence, which was at least twice as long as it ought to have been. To those of you who say that this is the best movie ever made, I must strenuously disagree. It's not the best movie I've seen this year, much less ever. Nor is it the best movie I've seen this month, or even this week. This movie is bad. And I loved the books. Drew
10.0~I have a plan... mr_fatbody Sign in Permalink Anyone who wastes their time without refund to say bad things about this film is a waste of life. No matter how much you love or hate this movie, this will satisfy everyone as the last review of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings to ever be displayed on the internet: This is by far the best motion picture in history. And the only other films to be equal with this one will be The Two Towers and The Return of The King. Anyone who thinks otherwise can burn. So there is no need to spend the time writing about this film anymore. This is the best film in history. Nothing else comes close, except for the sequels of course. Everyone knows that. Some people just don't want to admit the truth. Just remember, everyone who has seen this film knows deep in their hearts how beautiful it is. I feel sorry for those who thought that Titanic or Ballistics: Ecks vs. Ecks were among the greatest works of art. Sadly they are not. Remember loyal LotR fans, if you see these people on the street begging for change, they only want it to buy tickets for bad movies. Spare them and pity them. Don't even turn your head. Just keep walking.
10.0~This is as good as it gets cjeager Sign in Permalink Like many others, when I saw that there was to be a film version of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was dubious. I doubted that Tolkien's great work could be handled, translated into a visual medium, with any degree of success. The BBC radio broadcasts are a separate and excellent thing entirely. I was prepared, therefore, to be disappointed. I wasn't. This film wildly outlived my expectations and almost met my hopes. I first read "The Hobbit" almost 35 years ago, "The Lord of the Rings" over 30 years ago, I know those books and I have loved them from childhood. There was a lot there that could go wrong, feel wrong, look wrong, be wrongly interpreted. It didn't really happen. Peter Jackson got it right in so far as a person with their own interpretation of the inside of somebody else's head can get it right. I and everybody else in the cinema was totally absorbed by the film from the very beginning to the very end. OK, so in one or two places the special effects weren't that special. There were places where they seemed blurred and out of focus. BUT, oh but, all the things that were right. The casting was excellent. Nobody looked wrong, nobody didn't fit. I had not come across the work of many of the cast before. I was concerned that Aragorn would be too young, but he wasn't. I was struck by the beauty of Legolas, the humour of Gandalf and the sense of power concealed in several characters. The quality of the acting was generally outstanding. The costumes, the scenery, the props belonged. The ensemble pieces were balanced and finely played, the intimate moments were intimate, at times one almost felt like an interloper. Quibbles? A few. Not enough was made of the interplay between Legolas and Gimli, the gradual change from wariness and possible hostility to respect, trust and real friendship. Galadriel's transformation scene may be overdone a little. The unmasking of Saruman as a traitor could perhaps have come later - we knew about it before Frodo I'm not sure about that as a dramatic device, maybe we shouldn't know more than Frodo. Boromir's scene with the shards of Isildur's sword didn't somehow ring true to the character. The way he left it lying on the floor. No. If nothing else Boromir would show respect for Isildur's sword, with it Isildur achieved a mighty victory and Boromir would honour it for that reason if nothing else. He wouldn't leave it lying on the floor and walk away. I was sorry not to see Bombadil and Goldwater, but I can appreciate that they don't exactly carry the narrative forward to any great degree. I would like to know how the Hobbits got their weapons, since the provenance of at least one of those weapons is key to later events. I have seen the film twice now. The first time I was swept up and away with the power and the beauty of it. The second time I had time to appreciate the subtleties of the acting, pay more attention to detail, enjoy the comedy. No doubt I shall go again. As with the book, I suspect that the film has more things to offer on subsequent visits. The Prologue was necessary. There was, after all, a prologue in the book (although dealing with other matters). Without it the vital significance of the ring would be less urgent. The ending was just what I expected the ending to be. Except that it didn't quite end at the same place as the book, but after Chapter 1 of the next one. That makes sense to me. This film has been crafted with love, attention to detail and respect, it would be nonsensical to force some kind of closure where there is no need, just to round off an end that is really "the end of the beginning". Special moments? The race through Moria, the Balrog, the Birthday Party (what happened to the flash and bang when Bilbo put on the ring and vanished by the way?), Durin's tomb was perfect, so was Hobbiton, the cave troll looking for Frodo, a moment of comedy amidst high drama. The crossing of the fords of Bruinnen was another highlight.I could go on. I am looking forward, with excitement and high expectation,to the nextsegment, and to the time I can go to the cinema and watch all three parts of the trilogy on the same day. Lovers of the book need not be afraid, in all the essential details this film is the book.Move over Harry Potter, this is real wizards, not trainee. When it comes to film translations of books, it really doesn't get any better than this.
1.0~A Boring, Boring movie! conor_ds9 Sign in Permalink This was way over rated and I think that it was hyped so much that people were almost scared to say anything bad about it! Terrible movie - no one should be subjected to over three hours of absolute boredom! I did think the actors played their parts well, but the directors seemed to be desperate to make the movie three hours so they placed a load of pointless scenery and tedious speech in the film - again BORING!
10.0~Greatest movie ever made. BiggDaddy Sign in Permalink What else can be said about Lord of the Rings. It is awesome. I could get lost in this movie many times and am pleased to see they did not stray from the book. The next movie in the series is not coming fast enough for me. If it is any way shape or form as good as the first I will be in the theater many nights watching it.
10.0~Great movie.... Love-4-ever Sign in Permalink This is one, no, it's the best movie I have ever seen, from beginning to the end, it's an entertaining movie, with magic, science fiction, fantasy comedy, romances and lots of action. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who loves a movie full of exciting stuff and, well...you know the rest.
10.0~childhood feeank Sign in Permalink Do you want to go back to your childhood and remember how eager u were to believe those fables and stories your parents readed to you? This might be the movie for you. Above all considerations for J.R.R. Tolkien written masterpiece, this movie goes beyond the realms of everyone's own "mind" picture and sets a believable world full of magic and, much more important, realism. Director Peter Jackson took the daunting job to adapt this amazing story and he succeeds in a graceful way. Great performances by Sir Ian McKellen and Ian Holm as the wizard Gandalf and the aging Hobbit Bilbo Baggins respectively provide strong support for the rest of the crowded cast. The ageless tale of the struggle between good-old "Good Vs Evil" constitutes the core of this plot, the complexities of the original novel are poured into a powerful script, deep and humorous. The overall mood of Tolkien's world is exalted by Jackson's handling of light, color and shadows, a stunning visual experience. Composer Howard Shore also contributes with a original score worthy of a review of it's own. If you haven't seen it yet, give your inner child a fest and go rent it
1.0~Whats all the hype????????? papillon_bleu Sign in Permalink I've seen this movie and I dont see what all of the fuss is about. Its not that great and i dont know why people think it is. I struggled to stay awake and fell asleep several times trying to watch this movie. It a tedious movie and once you finally get into the movie it ends. I'm not saying it was a horribly bad movie or anything I just dont understand why people think it is so good.
9.0~A great adaptation of a classic story Tweekums Sign in Permalink This is a great film, unlike most films that are the first part of a trilogy you really do have to watch the remaining films to get the most out of the story as there is no sense of closure at the end of the film, it is merely the end of one part of their quest and the beginning of the next. This is not a bad thing; just make sure you'll have enough time to watch all three films fairly close together. The film is very long but I don't think there were any scenes that could have been removed or trimmed so the length is justified. I think the film followed the book fairly well, although I confess it has been a while since I read it. After a short prologue where we are given a history of The Ring. We then find ourself in the Shire, the home of the Hobbits; the wizard Gandalf has come to attend a birthday party for his old friend Bilbo Baggins. During the party Bilbo announces that he is going to be leaving the Shire, he then slips a ring onto his finger and vanishes into thin air. When he takes the ring off again he is confronted by Gandalf who tells him he must leave the ring behind when he goes as it is dangerous. Unfortunately his use of the ring has been noticed by the evil Sauron who has dispatched nine wraiths; horsemen who's sole purpose is to retrieve the ring for their master. Gandalf instructs Bilbo's nephew Frodo to take the ring to Elves at Rivendell. On the way he and three Hobbit friends meet up with a mysterious man who helps them flee from the riders although Frodo is wounded and needs the Elves to recover. At Rivendell the group learn that their quest is not over, they must continue on to Sauron's land of Mordor where they can finally destroy the ring. The group are joined by Gandalf, an Elf called Legolas, Gimli the Dwarf and a man called Boromir. This film doesn't go as far as Mordor, in fact it only shows the first part of the journey which will see our heroes battling Orcs, other strange creatures and their own desire for the power the ring may bring; not all of the group will survive. As this is a fantasy film they are a lot of special effects, thankfully they are so well done that they don't look like effects even though we know they must be, I especially liked how they made the hobbits look so small, had I not seen the actors in other films it would have been almost possible to believe that the actors really were that short. Peter Jackson did a great job on this film getting a good performance from all his actors; a combination of well known veteran actors and young actors who will probably go onto be stars although I suspect this is the film they will be remembered for.
10.0~One of the best book adaptions of all time. todd1701 Sign in Permalink After reading some of the comments listed for this movie, it is obvious that some have not read the books. This movie has taken a 500 plus page book and narrowed it down to 3 hours. Obviously some minor parts of the story are either glossed over or left out completely. But over all this has to be the best adaption to the big screen of any novel I have ever seen. A suggestion I would have is watch the movie, then read the book. You will see that this is a very close match.
1.0~the most overrated piece of crap in movie history!!! Dmale Sign in Permalink This movie abosuletly is overrated, no. 7 all time, I could probably think of 100 better films in the fantasy genre alone. I cannot tell you how unorignal this film is, it's too long, it's not very creative and this movie is designed for children between the ages of 10-12 all you lord of the rings geeks out there, read the book, i guarantee its better than this movie, if you want to watch a good movie that really deserves to at no. 7 rent the matrix,it's a lot better and more creative.
10.0~Absolutely amazing barbwc Sign in Permalink This is a great movie. All the important pieces of the story are there, and the acting is great. The special edition, extended DVD is an even better movie since it adds important story elements and allows you to understand the characters better. I was originally afraid that a movie just wouldn't do justice to the story, but I was very pleased by the result, it may even be better than the book (I never say that) since Tolkien can be very difficult to understand at times.
10.0~EVERY shot was GORGEOUS! MichaelJMcNeese Sign in Permalink I am amazed at the work that was put into this picture. Every single shot of the film was absolutely gorgeous. And so much detail was put into every shot, every motion, every cut. Watch it again, and look at the things that you should never look at: blistered fingers, textures of costumes, the detail in the sets, the tiny birds far off into the distance of the special effects shots, and the freakish detail that was put into the Horseman's costumes. Folks, this is a three and a half hour movie. And we have never seen this attention to detail, ever. A ton of work went into it, and it really shows. Let's hope the Academy takes a serious look at this revolutionary pice of art.
8.0~A Precious Beginning slokes Sign in Permalink {This review is for the 178-minute theatrical version.} The first installment of Peter Jackson's famous fantasy trilogy, "The Fellowship Of The Ring" may not give you the entire journey, but it's a pretty terrific engine-revving. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is a hobbit whose quiet, pastoral life in an unregarded corner of Middle Earth changes abruptly when he is entrusted with a Ring of Power which carries with it the power of ultimate evil. To save Middle Earth, he must destroy the Ring by casting it into the fiery pit where it was made – with or without the aid of various companions. "Even the smallest person can change the course of the future," Frodo is told, and that is the message of "Fellowship" in a nutshell. Hope is precious, no matter how frail the vessel. Nothing frail about "Fellowship Of The Ring," which is designed to impress and succeeds magnificently. The visual design is as splendid as it is varied, not just the lush New Zealand countryside that gets such deserved attention but the snowy mountaintops and grim, bone-laden mine shafts Frodo's party must traverse. Also impressive is the way Jackson and co-screenwriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens recapture the scope and grandeur of the first book in J. R. R. Tolkien's "Lord Of The Rings" trilogy, while still delivering digestible cinematic entertainment. There are notable trims from the novel, and some twists, but the focus on Frodo's burden and his quest are if anything stronger than what Tolkien gives you, and makes for a ripping good yarn. The film is not a stand-alone entertainment; you need to see it in concert with the other two LOTR films, and that's not always to its advantage. Often you get lots of exposition regarding entities like "Emyn Muil" or "Argonath" which are obviously inserted to please the Tolkien faithful at risk of alienating outsiders like me. Other things annoy me, like a slow opening section introducing Frodo and his shire and Cate Blanchett's too sly and arch performance as an elven queen, but what's good is much, much better. Ian McKellen is splendid centering affairs as the mighty wizard Gandalf, while Wood and Sean Astin as his sidekick Sam showcase solid chemistry. Viggo Mortensen is the glue of the film, and a uniquely capable man of action as Strider. Orlando Bloom and Liv Tyler may be too pretty for me to like under normal circumstances, but here they manage to be load-bearing and brilliant. The score, the CGI, the ugly orcs; there's not a frame of this film that doesn't reflect thought and care. "Fellowship" proves quite a trip, and the best news is there's much more to come. Frodo's pain is your gain.
10.0~A timeless epic has been beautifully brought to life. coldfuzz Sign in Permalink This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I've seen in the past ten years. This brilliant rendition by Peter Jackson brings a new dimension to an already powerful epic. Many of the characters are given an emotional depth that was sometimes greatly lacking in Tolkien's pages. It is difficult to not be terrified of Sauron's Eye or his servants, the Nazgûl. Likewise, anyone watching the movie cannot help but be moved by the hardships endured by the members of the Fellowship. This is a testament to the great skills of a wonderful ensemble cast. Undoubtedly, self-proclaimed Tolkien afficionados will nitpick and belittle this movie and the two that will follow it to no end. Such pettiness cannot take away this film's merits. The excellent acting, cinematography, and soundtrack achieve a true unity of the arts that is sorely lacking in the majority of today's films.
10.0~Take a back seat Star Wars, a new leader is in town! rob_goody Sign in Permalink How often can you truly say that you have been sat watching a movie at the theatre and dreading the inevitable fact...it was going to end? I can find no better compliment for this movie - every feature will take your breath away - not just the big chunk of CGI that plays such an important role. The lead actors all provide solid shows, the story holds up - apparently its not original though - it was really a book first? No, seriously, this first instalment of 3 provides a good mixture of character development with action sequences building up to the first of 3 climaxes. George Lucas will be sleeping with one eye open for the next few months - who ever thought a 50 year old story might break the reign of the Skywalkers in the upper echelons of cinematic history!?
10.0~The most breath-taking movie of all time. Angafuin Sign in Permalink I can't believe there are so many people disliking this movie, thinking that it's overrated and boring. To me this is one of the most beautiful movies of all time, and I wasn't even a Tolkien fan before seeing it for the first time. From the very first view it captured my heart, and it still does after seeing it for the 12th time. In my opinion it has everything; a wonderful story, great actors, breath-taking scenery, powerful battle-scenes and beautiful music. It successfully captures the magic and beauty that is Middle Earth. I can't wait for the next two installments in this trilogy! Score: 10/10
7.0~Probably the best of the three trminator-35198 Sign in Permalink A great story with near proper intros for each character, convincing acting, and great cgi scenes. The film is quite long but people who like fantasy usually don't notice due to the complexity of the characters and constantly evolving story.
10.0~An awesome achievement zapdude Sign in Permalink I still snicker at some of the wordy trashing comments being posted here. I especially like the arrogant little know-it-all who called this film arrogant. Ever since the 1950's when the Lord of the Rings books were released, virtually every fantasy ever made can trace some aspect of its origins to these stories. Even Star Wars is based on this story, and much of the Led Zeppelin imagery came from here. Directly. To tell most stories, all you need is to pack a little two hour package together. This story is bigger than that, it is sweeping, majestic, and powerful. It is the granddaddy of fantasy stories, so to speak. The point that many people miss is that there is supposed to be ugliness, the ugly parts are to contrast the bright parts. The placid Shire goes up against the horrors of the grown-in-the-dirt Orcs, who are not exceptionally powerful as individuals, but overwhelming in numbers. This first movie is laying the groundwork for the epic struggles to follow. We are merely meeting the characters and setting the stage. If you don't have the patience to accept that this background is neccessary to tell the rest of the story, then I truly pity you. The Extended Edition DVD is marvelous. I am still struck by the incredible attention to detail and overall "feel" of this work from Peter Jackson, and I don't think I'm being disrespectful when I say that his previous work does not foreshadow this achievement at all. 208 minutes of this movie is barely enough. The texture is stunning, in spite of the overly lingering Liv Tyler sequences and a few other minor niggles. Maybe you don't have the time to comprehend why this movie is awesome. Perhaps you can't see the value of the intense personal sacrifices being made in every scene of this movie. Too bad for you. The Lord of the Rings was written with the memory of World War II fresh in Tolkien's mind. Wars, battles, and struggle are the nature of the tale. In spite of it all, there are pockets of sunshine and peace, and these pockets are our story. Good will conquer the evil!
10.0~Visual marvel Kakueke Sign in Permalink The storyline in the "Lord of the Rings" is well constructed and interesting, the film is well-paced (you never get bored tho it is long), and the action scenes are well done. But most of all, it is a dazzling visual marvel. Whether outdoors--scenes of forests and trees, valleys, streams, mountains--or in caves and the like, the visuals are superb. Color, design, intricacy, detail, contrasts. The backdrops are excellent. There are battles with monsters and things like that, but the special effects are not overdone or pompous--they work very well. A key for me here was not too much sped up action to create excess and pomposity and to have a hard time following what is going on, like in sci fi space battles or the Mummy movies or flicks like that. Indeed, not only the pace of the plot, but the action, has economy. In the outdoors, the backdrops are very pretty but for the most part realistic, but in the caves things are done up, with somewhat exaggerated or surreal colors, designs, effects. However, there are other movies with good visuals, even tho it is difficult to think of ones that outdo this. But what sticks out most, in my mind? Not specifically the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but the LIGHTING. Yes, that overlaps with the other things--backdrop, colors, etc., but it is particularly this item and the obvious sophistication and care that went into it, and the resulting artistic brilliance and beauty, that make the visuals, the cinematography, so excellent in my mind. Whether indoors or outdoors, the lighting effects, the beauty, blending, and contrasts, are the highlight of the film. 10 out of 10.
1.0~Pathetic. brianface5@yahoo.co.uk Sign in Permalink This film was over-hyped rubbish and a COMPLETE letdown. I almost fell asleep when I watched it. Right, so this film has excellent special effects and nice scenery; that doesn't make it a good film. It's 3 hours long and glacially paced. Many of the characters I found to be extremely annoying, including Gandalf, Frodo and Sam. Frodo's feminine tone is enough to drive anyone insane. The elvish dialogue with subtitles is laughable and all of the actors play second fiddle to the special effects.The performances are wafer-thin and Elijah Wood is shrill and bland. His performance is wooden. Then the film just ends midsentence........ thanks but I don't want to go to the cinema next Christmas to see what happens. If there's as little plot development as in this installment, its sure to be as boring and disappointing.I think the media frenzy surrounding this film was completely uncalled for. It's not that good of a film. In fact, it's awful. A real turkey in my humble opinion.
10.0~Best adventure film of all-time Sneaky_Pete_XXVI Sign in Permalink Who can deny the power of the rings? Anybody who watches this film with any remote interest will find it to be utterly amazing with a childish flair and heart-felt bondage to the characters. No other film in the history of cinema has been able to capture the intensity of traveling across mountains to marshes. This is Peter Jackson's best film, although he was more than rewarded for the return of the king. I believe that this film is the best of the ring trilogy because it is so simple to understand if one pays attention. I've heard countless people state that this film is boring, but then I retort by saying, "Did you know what was happening?" And they reply with a simple, "they wanted to destroy the ring." This is true to a first grader, but so much more is happening around the film. Ten out of Ten.
10.0~Finally, a film that's worth all of the attention. Gabrielle Joan Sign in Permalink It has been a while since I've seen a film and enjoyed it this much. To be perfectly honest, I walked into the cinema not knowing what to expect. Let me just say that it is worth all of the commotion; I went back four times. The 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is not the easiest thing to read. It is lengthly and complex, so it is no wonder that the idea of a film version caused many raised eyebrows. But the first installment of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy of films shows plain enough that, not only could it be done, it could be done well! The film's story line has been modified in places, with both omissions and additions to Tolkien's original plot. The good thing is that these alterations do not change the overall outcome of the story (unlike some of the disasters that Disney has created.) The film is well edited and and flows nicely, allowing the viewers (especially those who are unfamiliar with the novel) to follow with ease. Every cast member gives a great performance here. They understand their roles and settle into their characters remarkably well. I have to give special mention to Sir Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf and Sean Bean as the ever-troubled Boromir. Viggo Mortensen shines in his role as Aragorn, and, of course, Elijah Wood is the perfect Frodo. The beautiful and mystical locations are worthy of special mention. New Zealand is ideal for the filming of the trilogy. It is encouraging to see such a celebration of natural beauty. This is a film worth seeing more than once. Bringing the classic story to the screen has served to acquaint a much larger audience with Tolkien's work. I don't think I can applaud it enough.
8.0~Sauron opened his eye other-files Sign in Permalink Sun isn't going to shining anytime. Sauron opened his eye and he is looking for ring. What is the ring? What is its skill? If you want to listen this, i will explain it. Story of the ring was starting when Dark Lord Sauron made the ring. Sauron wears his ring and goes to war. Isildur cuts the ring from Sauron's finger and Sauron loses. Isıldur killed in the River Anduin and the ring was lost. Gollum is finding it. He called it 'my precious'. It was story of the ring. Dark Lord Sauron found the Gollum and he learned the ring is in Shire and Baggins's house. Fellowship members have a Baggins... Frodo Baggins. Frodo is half-ling but he is the first enemy for Dark Lord Sauron. Sauron won't be loser again.
10.0~Very good indeed! kfg30 Sign in Permalink I really liked this movie and I have read the books several times and some changes or omissions annoyed me but overall I am very pleased. A lot of people are under the mistaken idea that the Lord of the Rings is a trilogy, it isn't. Tolkien originally wrote it as a single book but the publishers forced him to divide it into three parts. Because of this there are no midway endings, the story just continues so the fact that the first film ends abruptly is unavoidable, unless you film the entire book or start doing really radical changes. So "Fellowship" is not the first part in a trilogy but rather the first part of one book. My final comment is that for those, like myself, who were bothered by some of the changes, try a second viewing were you can judge the film by itself and not compare it to the book.
10.0~OK, let's separate the movie from the book. marshm Sign in Permalink I grow tired of the petty reviews by those who constantly compare the book to the movie. For anyone who has read Lord of the Rings, no movie(s) could ever possibly do them justice. Let's set that aside for a moment... Imagine, if you can (and this is difficult for those who HAVE read the books), that you had NOT read the books. How, then, does the movie stand on its own? Does the story make sense? Does it follow? Is there flow? Does it maintain my interest? Do the characters have depth? Is the cinematography good? Costumes? etc....... For the first installment, I find the answer to all of the above, YES! This is a truly great movie - on its own - and deserving of a spot in the top five movies ever. Now... I have read the books - several times. I am willing to both forgive some inaccuracies for the sake of expediency, and understand the "literary license" taken for the sake of a shortened story. When you consider that an alternative would be a series of three 14 hour movies, these are minor items. I am eternally grateful for the care and loving that went into this movie. I commend Peter Jackson for his fine work and for staying "very close" to the original story.
10.0~A perfect rendition of a book I've loved since childhood Emubird Sign in Permalink I approached the film with trepidation, afraid it simply might not live up to the pictures I'd had in my mind since childhood.I needn't have worried. My jaw hit the floor during the opening battle sequence, and stayed there until the final frame. Impossible to mention everything, but top honours must go to Viggo Mortensen as the Aragorn I'd always imagined - wild, ferocious, slightly unearthly and yet unimpeacahably noble - and Elijah Wood as Frodo, who sidestepped any pitfalls attached to playing a stunted, hairy peasant and made Frodo's quest have all the high seriousness and quiet sacrifice it needs to have. Sometimes he looked a thousand years old. There was barely a false note in the entire piece. The next two? I can't wait.
10.0~IT IS ENCHANTING EXPERIENCE !!!!! bag_frodo Sign in Permalink Finally Peter Jackson improved that he has a heart of a hobbit and the madness of a wizard...Lord of the rings is a fantastic film with an excellent script...it is enchanting experience!!! The cast gives fantastic performances...they feel all the emotions from the characters of the book and they have all the beauty and the magic from middle earth... Now we know were can we find the hobbits and the way to Mordor... to NEW ZEALAND....Middle-earth it is a true place now!!! SO, THE ROAD GOES ON to THE LORD OF THE RINGS : THE TWO TOWERS THE BEST MOVIE FANTASY EVER MADE!!!
10.0~One word.......wow! bruce-142 Sign in Permalink The fact that Peter Jackson was working on three Rings movies at once, and was still able to create such a masterpiece, should be enough to elicit the word "wow". But this movie stands alone as one of the greatest of all time. The acting is crisp, the story moves at a great pace throughout, and the adherence to the book(while only cutting unnecessary nonsense like Tom Bombadil) is that which only a true fan of literature and film alike could have brought to the screen. While George Lucas is turning his films into nothing but special FX, screaming to the public, "Hey, look what I can do now!", Peter Jackson has proven that while FX are important, characters can still be depended upon to tell a great story. And the score........Howard Shore has outdone himself, and if he doesn't walk away with an Oscar....there truly is no justice in Hollywood! Thumbs up!! See you all in December 2002 in line for the next one!
10.0~The Best thing to ever happen to the movie world! beckster_1979 Sign in Permalink This film is amazing! I could take up three times as much space as I'm given to just gush about it. First of all, the sets are absolutely breathtaking, and the attention to detail that has gone into everything that appears on the screen is immense. Peter Jackson has done what many people think was not possible, he's brought Tolkien's world to life, it is almost exactly how it is described in the book, and the casting is a dream. The cast bring so much to their characters and look so at home in their surroundings that you find yourself getting sucked right into the screen, it's exactly what I envisioned Middle-Earth to be! My personal favourites would have to be the casting of Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn/Strider. The screenplay that has been produced is also fantastic, the inevitable cuts are there (I would have liked to have seen Tom Bambodil), and there have been scenes added, but it carries you along for three hours so completely enraptured that it feels as though you've been watching it for no longer than half an hour! This is by far the best movie I have ever seen, and Peter Jackson has done J.R.R Tolkien proud. It's a shame the author himself will never get to see this masterpiece, how someone took his vision of Middle-Earth and transferred it perfectly to the screen. A Movie Masterpiece that will go down in history as one of the best films ever made. Fantastic!
4.0~Not sure I saw the same movie as everyone else MikeG-1221 Sign in Permalink Based on the long-running hype surrounding this movie, not to mention the critical raves it has generally received, I knew that one of two things would happen when I went to see this movie: 1) It would truly live up to the hype as one of the greatest movies of all time or, 2) It would not match up. I am not surprised that, given the nature of mainstream, Hollywood blockbusters, that I fall into the second category. "The Fellowship of the Ring", though exciting in parts, fails to maintain a constant stream of interest and energy, thus making it fall far short of the "epic" that many viewers are already calling it. Since most people on planet Earth are already familiar with the story, I won't go into great detail here re-creating it. From a plotting standpoint, the movie has several problems. Since Tolkien's work is so masterfully detailed, it would be difficult to completely portray every character with the depth and understanding that he did. But the beginning of the movie does just that, as the moviegoer is painted an excellent picture of the Hobbit Shire and the beauty and peace that this diminutive-sized but big-hearted race has achieved. But then the movie gets bogged down. Character after character is hastily introduced, as we are pushed through fight scene after fight scene. "Fellowship" suffers from the same syndrome that many action movies suffer from: despite the fact that the heroes are constantly pitted against insurmountable odds (in numbers, resources, etc.), they never seem to be in any real danger. And the movie generally stages a fight scene, gives the audience a few minutes to breathe, and then stages another fight scene. Although the fights are done well, what is lost is a true understanding of characters, as we never really get to know any of the main combatants. Worse yet, we eventually forget why they're fighting in the first place, since so many of the fight scenes fail to explain what is going on. Visually, the movie is occasionally stunning. But there are certain scenes (like the battle scene at the beginning of the movie) that look obviously computer-generated. Even the tightest military formation does not move in complete synce unless it is a COMPUTER SIMULATION. I did think that the camera angles and the way that the movie played with the actors' height was pretty great, though. I've heard a lot about how the acting in this movie was tremendous, but this is not a character-driven movie, so how can you tell? Except for Elijah Wood, I didn't feel like anyone really gave a performance worth remembering. There were no bad performances, mind you, but no one (except for Wood) really stood out. The monotony of the fight scenes made me anxious for the movie to end. I could feel the length of this movie, and that's generally not a good sign, unless you're dealing with an historical piece like "Schindler's List" or "Ghandi", where the time isn't as important as the story that's being told. In the end, this movie is not a "Star Wars" or a "Godfather" or anything of that nature. It morphs into a generic action feature that presents its audience with some exciting scenes, but ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive movie. I give it a 4/10, since it has some value, but isn't anywhere near the "classic" that people are hastily calling it. A final note on this movie being #1 in the IMDB. I wouldn't get worked up about this. Though the database has a great deal of value, weighing the historical importance of movie is difficult. We will have a more balanced picture 10 to 20 years from now about the importance of this movie. Even great movies that seemed like they would last forever after they were released (remember "The English Patient"?) have faded into the background after a few years.
10.0~The first classic film version of a classic PRSLRider Sign in Permalink A classic can be defined as a work of art or literature that is viewed or read long after it was created. Different people have different ideas on what "long" means; some say 50 years, some say 100 years, and so on. However many years "long" means, Tolkien's writings about Middle-earth, particularly The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion are well on their way to becoming classics, if they are not already so. Others have made film adaptations of The Hobbit and LOTR. Others will do so again. Perhaps somebody will make a movie or series of movies based on The Silmarillion. Some of these will stand the test of time and become classics, others will not. Of all the movies that do become classics, the three made by Peter Jackson based on LOTR are the first, in my opinion. I've only seen the first, like everybody else, but I believe that seeing all three in a single session would be like seeing a nine-hour movie with two intermissions. It's true that the movie I've seen does not conform 100% to the text; no movie does, nor can it do so. But it's about as faithful to the text as is humanly possible. It's obvious that PJ, the cast, and the crew really cared about the story. They wanted to do the job and do it right. Did they succeed? The results speak for themselves. Here we have three movies that you either love or hate, based on a book that you either love or hate. The intention is that, having seen the movies, those who hate the book will learn to tolerate it, and later love it, and those who love the book will love it more. I think it succeeds in its intention. Read the book, see the movies, and make up your own mind.
10.0~Total Fulfillment!!!!! ruudiruudi Sign in Permalink I just saw the extended DVD version of LotR: Fellowship of the Ring and, to my absolute delight, it has met my every expectation! It simply is a flawless enrichment of an already fulfilling experience! On a personal note, Peter Jackson's vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's Trilogy appears to be an exact replica of how I myself perceive the Tolkien universe. I recall seeing the original preview for LotR: Fellowship of the Ring in the theatres almost 18 months ago and instantly recognizing all the scenes and characters from the books. I recall hoping for the elimination of Tom Bombadil from the story line, a character, which I perceived as Tolkien's touch of eccentric attachment to an otherwise irrelevant persona. And now, having just watched the extended DVD version of the film, I find it a stroke of genius in its simplicity as to how Meriadoc and Pippin come into possession of the Noldor blades. Furthermore, I am absolutely thrilled to see Cate Blanchett's Galadriel presented in the completeness, which her character truly deserves! All in all, the extended DVD edition of LotR: Fellowship of the Ring is filled with perfectly enriching sequences, breathtaking to both veteran Tolkien followers and newcomers to the world of Middle Earth. With highest recommendations, Mithelemir
1.0~Nothing more than an action movie... terrible. kelly_farmer Sign in Permalink I can only hope that Tolkien isn't turning over in his grave after watching this movie from wherever he might be. I should begin with the disclaimer that I didn't dislike this movie because of its deviations from the book. Peter Jackson has performed a small miracle condensing a 400+ page book into three hours, so alterations to the plot were acceptable. That being said, Fellowship of the Ring was a terrible ACTION movie. In an of itself it was entertaining enough, in the same way that Armageddon or Independence Day are entertaining movies. But the fact that this movie graces the top 100 movies (IMDB) of all time is ridiculous, if not laughable. To put this movie, an ACTION movie, in the same category as Schindler's List, The Godfather, or The Shawshank Redemption is an absolute tragedy and mockery of objective film criticism. My main criticism is simply that this movie in no way analyzed the complex characters and character relationships so vividly depicted in Tolkien's books. In fact, hardly any characters were developed at all. And not only were the characters not explored, but in their stead was substituted pathetic things like an attempt to incorporate a Hollywood-ized love scene between Aragorn and Arwen that didn't exist in the first book, and was not even acknowledged until the third book (and in hardly the detail). The plain fact is that this movie was an ACTION movie, and by no means does it deserve an IMDB rating above a 7. Don't get me wrong, it was a good ACTION movie, but by no means excellent. So in my vain attempt to offset the myriad of obviously myopic viewers that have voted 10 for this movie, I give it a 1/10.
10.0~An Amazing Fantasy Feature kellydyche-78529 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings is an amazing fantasy feature with a fantastic cast, a gripping storyline and a memorable location. A must watch for anyone who loves a bit of everything. Romance, action, adventure, drama and so much more. We follow Frodo Baggins and his companions, which consists of two men, a wizard, an elf, a dwarf and three hobbits, as they travel across Middle-Earth to destroy the one ring of power, but there are many foes who wish to stop them, and return the ring to the dark Lord Sauron. Towards the end of the movie, we lose two of our lovable companies, and the rest spit off in to three separate journeys. Will Frodo make it to Mount Doom? Will he destroy the ring, or will he be overcome by the dark magic it holds?
10.0~Classic fantasy movie oceancloud67 Sign in Permalink Loved the books and didn't believe it could be done properly. Boy, how wrong I was. "The Fellowship Of The Ring" has it all, of course "The Story", the "Fairy-tale"-vibe in the beginning and plenty of action. So many layers in both book and movie. One can see that there's so much love put into. Quite unique in my opinion (watch the extra's and you know what I'm talking about). The casting has done perfectly. Director Peter Jackson has really done a perfect job. His vision brought us some magical moments, married with beautiful classical music. The special effects could have done better nowadays (but not at the time the movie is made), but the experience is nevertheless overwhelming. It starts with a lot of colors and brightness and then it becomes darker and darker... Don't hesitate to watch this one, even if you're not in fantasy that much...
1.0~Despite Hype A Most Hollow Ring to It enidward Sign in Permalink I defy anyone to sit through this almost 3 hour piece of tripe without thinking of euthanasia. It is pretentious, complicated and the last hour is almost unbearably confused. But don't take my word for it. Read the CNN movie review critic. He (or she) thinks LOR is the greatest movie ever. But of course he/she draws a salary from AOL Time Warner who have much to lose if LOR bombs as it will. They produced it. Trust me on this. Shrek was better
10.0~Close to perfect m_richardson Sign in Permalink I am a fan of Tolkien and have been eagerly awaiting someone to make a serious attempt at LOTR. The horible animated thing from the seventies - was, well, horrible. This movie succeeds fantasticaly well. The look and feel are just right - the technical aspects of the production - costumes artwork and photography - all done in such a way as to immerse you in a vision that respects the feel and spirit of the books. The casting is generally excellent - Elijah Wood is the perfect Frodo, Ian Mckellan an impressive and strong Gandalf. The screenplay keeps the essence of the story very well while shortening it to reasonable movie length (I am a fan - but I find the books have overly long bits that leave me wanting the story to progress a bit faster!) The other minor plot changes - such as having Arwen rescue Frodo are all enhancements that strengthen the story and help keep it "tight". The Mines of Moria were always a favourite scene from the book and when I saw it on the screen it was just as it had seemed in my head - something no other movie adaption of a book has ever achieved to to the same degree, for me. I am hard pressed to find anything but the most trivial criticism of what is a fantastic achievement.This movie is so close to perfect it would seem petty to point out its trivial faults.
1.0~Boring & Painful horsehockey100 Sign in Permalink If you like 3 hours of almost continual sword fighting then go see this monotomous, boring movie. I never looked at my watch so much during a movie in all my life. Every few minutes the same fight scene was repeated in a different setting. At the end of it all, the movie has no conclusion and the audience is left hanging. Why? Because it's a trilogy and you have to see the next two movies to know the ending. In other words, what you have to look forward to is many more hours of continual and similar fight scenes. This was one of the most painful movie experiences of all time.
9.0~The best movie made from a book I have ever seen! sarahrah911 Sign in Permalink I have imagined every scene in the Lord of the Rings story after I read the book. After watching this movie, those imaginations came to my eyes. Everything that I have imagined so long has appeared realistic in the movie. This movie is a bit different from the book. Some places are cut, and some are changed. This makes audiences who have not read the book a little confused. I think this is not a bad idea to change and cut the story though. After cutting many scenes from the book, the movie is still nearly three hours long, if the whole thing is put into the movie, I guess it would be at least eight hours. I think it's a bit too long for a movie, and it will be really boring. Other than this, the modifications of the story are good. It made the story more suitable for a movie. A good example is in some fighting scenes, they cut some dialog and moves of the characters and added more action for them. This makes the rhythm of that scene faster and more intense. This movie used a lot of computer cinematics. I think the technique is very high. The one that impressed me most was Isengard. Those underground 'factories' of Uruk-hais was very detailed. Everything was minuteness, even the farthest and smallest object.
10.0~They got it right. Merlin-65 Sign in Permalink When I first read The Fellowship of the Rings, 15 years ago, I thought, gee, why can't they make a movie that's worth seeing? Maybe contact Jim Hensen, work with Lucas... But all of that is in the past. After seeing the movie last night, I can honestly say I am not the same person I was 24 hours ago. I have a true understanding of what it means to describe a film as epic. I have a fuller understanding of what it means to attain perfection. I have seen my childhood dreams realized in full, vivid, living and breathing color, and I am not in any way disappointed. I'm excited because I can take my son to see my dream. I'm thrilled with the opportunity to tell everyone I meet that this is one movie that they will be sorry to miss while it's in the theater. There are no weaknesses. It neither dwells to long on the love story or spends to much time inacting tedious fight scenes. It gives you tantalizing glimpses then hits you with in your face examples of tenderness and brutality, all in the name of power and love. I've seen the future of filmmaking. And ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
10.0~The greatest movie ever made. daleerbadiei Sign in Permalink This was the best movie I'd ever scene. The acting, costums, sets, landscape, music, and special effects where all flawless. Cinematic perfection! The books by Tolkien are fantastic and I was worried that the film wouldn't do them justice. In-fact - ever since seeing the film, I can only picture the characters as they were portrayed in the film!
10.0~A feast for your eyes! kehaar Sign in Permalink Not the best movie of all times, but never the less it has to get the highest possible score on a scale up to 10. Why? Because time flies while watching it. See it in a big screen theater and let yourself be introduced to a world that is not like the one you know. Harry Potter is a mere stage magician compared to Gandalf, Terminator is scared of the ring wraiths and you would rather face Rambo in a dark alley than even know of the existence of a Balrog. And, still, it is just a prologue.....
10.0~A Great Start to the Greatest Fantasy Trilogy of All Time thetmbk Sign in Permalink Rated: 9.6/10 Rounded to 10 This movie could not have been any better. Peter Jackson starts the Lord of the Rings trilogy with a tremendous movie. We can start with the effects. This movie offers some amazing special effects, everything was so well done, it all looks so real. Next is the acting, the cast couldn't have been any better. Ian Mckellen was born to be Gandalf, nobody can play that role better. Whoever was in charge of casting did a great job. Now the final perks go to the director, Peter Jackson, for an amazing job of making the book into the best movie it could possibly be. This movie and its sequels are a must see for anyone.

10.0~"Remember what Bilbo used to say, it's dangerous business Frodo, going out the door." classicsoncall Sign in Permalink When I first read "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" Trilogy back in the early 1970's, I recall saying to myself that the story would make a wonderful movie. "Star Wars" still hadn't come out yet, and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R. Tolkien, it was simply best left to the imagination. Well, imagination has found life in "The Fellowship of the Ring", a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy, just as the books did for the written word. Upon first seeing it during it's initial release, I couldn't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure. Everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind; it was as if Peter Jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on. I feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of Middle Earth, as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation. For example, when the Black Riders appear for the first time, it's difficult to grasp what they're all about, other than the fact that they're after the ring. Strider's explanation of the Nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men, neither alive nor dead, who always feel the power of the ring. Coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place. The real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other. Though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear, can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves, dwarfs, hobbits and wizards actually exist. Even orcs and evil Uruk hai have a place in this world, for without the danger they pose there is no triumph. If the movie captures your imagination and you haven't read the trilogy or it's prequel "The Hobbit", you'll be doing yourself a favor to do so. There in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as Elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of Middle Earth. It's a world easy to get lost in, and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land, people, and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone.
10.0~Opened my eyes to the wonderful world of Middle Earth brindlescruff Sign in Permalink I, like so many others, have never read Tolkien's books. However, the movie was so incredible that I instantly rushed out to Barnes and Noble right away! Now, I'm not sure whether to read the books, or wait for the shock, awe, excitement, and utter captivation I can expect from the next two installements. Oh, what *tortue*! (I thank Peter Jackson whole-heartedly for it.) I won't try to explain the plot, for that's been done so many times in so many other reviews. However, I will state that "The Fellowship of the Ring" rose to number one on my list after my first viewing, surpassing such classics as "Forrest Gump," "The Godfather" and new wonders like "The Matrix" and "Moulin Rouge." LOTR embodies both, for lack of better terms, "movieness" and "realness." It is "Moviefull" because of the strategically placed and oh-so bloody and vicious battle scenes, which holds the viewer's attention (and this is a lady speaking!)The love element is also there, yet underplayed, making it not "in-your-face," and therefore appreciated and even wanted. The melodious background score captures the perfect emotion for each part of the film, ranging from terror to torture to triumph. The plot is explained, is understandable, and is riddled with foreshadowing, symbolism, and all those other literature tidbits that us Advanced-Placement English nerds adore (this is also a student speaking!). The movie is intriguing, understandable, captivating; the perfect begining for the next two installments. Peter Jackson did a wonderful job in making us, the huddled masses, feel the suspense and aniexty well enough to want- nay NEED- to return to theatures next Christmas. The movie is also "realfull," (for extreme lack of a better term) and by that, I mean I agree with the cast and crew when they say you can believe that this event actually happened. This is, of course, strictly a fantasy film. However, the animals do not speak. The characters do not fly. When wizard Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) does his magic, he does not wave a wand like Harry Potter, but manipulates nature and utters ancient words. While imaginary races(i.e. Hobbits, elves and dwarves) exist in the story, the plot is down-to-(Middle)earth, making it classic. The movie differes from the book, because while Tolkien alone slaved over his novels, countless crew and cast members devoted themselves to this work of art. My hats off the lead actor Elijah Wood (good job, buddy!) and Mckellen, Tyler, Weaving, and Holm. Fellow Hobbits Pippin and Merry are loveable, and tall, dark and handsome Strider rises as my favorite character. While Mckellen received an Oscar nod this year, I hope the Academy will not forget Elijah and Viggo next time around. Aside from the respectable cast, the crew deserves a standing ovation! Oh god, those sets! Thos weapons! Those costumes! Those FEET! Every staue, tree, building and every little everything was unbelievably beautiful. Even the shots taken by the camera crew and the editing done are so right; there's nothing in this feature I can think to critise. Except, of course, the long wait between Christmasses. (Dammit, I want the next movie NOW!)
10.0~A masterpiece of its time. Zakjt Sign in Permalink The lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is a masterpiece in the genre of fantasy, and could contend for the best fantasy picture of all time. A grand epic tale, of friendship, adventure, and heart, you will grow to love each of the main characters as they set out on their quest. The movie is beautifully shot, very well acted and directed, and has great visual effects that still hold up very well fourteen years later. The message of the movie and really the whole trilogy is one of the most inspiring. Even the smallest of people can change the course of the future, they are words to live by. Peter Jackson really did shine with his first big budget film, and it shows his talent with handling a film with this large of a scope. What really matters, is that you can watch this movie without watching the other two as it feels like a complete story, that will move you till the end credits begin to roll. It's always hard for me to decide which of three are my favorite but fellowship most of the time is my go to choice.
10.0~The most remarkable fantasy adventure film of our time. JoeMojo Sign in Permalink There are few movies that so fully immerse you in a wonderful fantasy world where you not only admire it but want to visit and explore. Who wouldn't want to stand shoulder to shoulder with Aragorn and slaughter Orcs! Well, perhaps with a rubber sword and stage blood to avoid any puncture wounds. :) This movie brings out the little boy inside who dreamed of slaying dragons. I watched the DVD (theatrical and extended version) at the edge of my couch and simply didn't want it to end. I'm not a LOTR geek yet I've seen the movie 3 times and will certainly watch it again (probably all three in a weekend when the trilogy hits DVD in 2004-5). Simply put, this movie is masterpiece; a word that may have lost its luster through overuse yet understates the brilliance of this film. Remarkably, the Two Towers looks to be even better. Get used to moviegoers saying: "It was great, but it was no Lord of the Rings".
10.0~FOTR, an excellent film teigetje182 Sign in Permalink Excellent movie I must say. People keep complaining that Jackson left to much out, but what do you expect. To make a movie on a book like this, means making decisions. If he had exactly followed the story as Tolkien wrote it, the movie would have lasted hours longer. I absolutely enjoyed the movie, it left me with an unfinished feeling and the desire to see The Two Towers as soon as it gets to the cinema in Holland. For me it was absolutely the movie of the year, so far. I'll have to look hard to find one that can impress me more.
10.0~One of the three best movies ever! fireandwater Sign in Permalink a pinnacle of cinema, absolute genius from all sides. the best acting i've seen since...ever, the best special effects, best props, CGI, costumes, lighting, script, source material, let's just say, fellowship of the ring is the best of the best, second only to its sequels. Peter Jackson is truly a creative genius, a king among men. Howard Shore has created the most beautiful score i've ever heard on screen, and all the actors played their roles so well. especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf. McKellen is the ultimate in theatre acting, and plays a unique gandalf that no other actor could ever dream of portraying. Truly there is no one who can hold a candle to Sir Ian McKellen, a creative genius just as Peter Jacksn is. Fellowship of the Ring is amazing beyond all reckoning...
9.0~A fantasy tale that draws you in samyaksambuddha Sign in Permalink Not to mention this is one of the finest fantasy series based on the fight between evil and the good. This part was more on the introduction of the main characters like Frodo, Aragorn; forging of the rings and its going in the hands of a hobbit. The elder Gandalf understands the dark side of the ring and the little Frodo and his friend Sam are sent for the great expedition. Along with the storyline this movie has a great deal of graphics with gigantic structures that that are bound to take your attention. The imagination and the execution are impeccable. Evil gathers as the good powers are not yet ready to fight.
1.0~This Movie SUCKS! napalm-6 Sign in Permalink I'll tell you why this movie is so incredibly stupid and why it irritates me when people talk about how "awesome" it is. It's not, folks. This movie is a 3 1/2 hour long hunk of cheese and is loaded with some of the most boring and pointless moments, and is acted out by Elijah Wood and his co-actors who, as any decently intelligent person knows, will only be remembered for these movies and will never be anything more than the LOTR's one-hit-wonders. Whoo! Sign me up to have my memory erased! Here's the part of the movie that made me actually yell an obscenity in the middle of the theater (it starts with "bull" and ends with another word beginning with an "s"): Frodo has the RING OF POWER and he and his buddies are just skipping along in the woods. They are being tracked down and hunted by EVIL DEMON THINGS ON BLACK HORSES who can sense the power of the ring from anywhere in the world (or Middle Earth, as you geeks like to call it). They catch up with Frodo and the hobbits, and Frodo quickly ducks behind a LOG. One of the SUPER EVIL DEMONS suddenly halts and doesn't know where the ring is. Need I say more? This movie is terrible. So is the second one, and so is the third one. I don't care if JRR Tolkein was a "genius" or a "brilliant writer." This movie, and its sequels, should have never been made. And while I'm at it, I want my nine bucks back!
6.0~Boring DarkSchumyFan Sign in Permalink This movie is a great cure for insomnia. Instead of you going to see it, I'll summarize it for you. Frodo and Gandalf get ring. They want to destroy ring. So they set off for a big mountain where they can destroy the ring. About 30 minutes in, some monsters attack them. They fight them and then continue on. Soon some more monsters attack them, they fight them and move on. Then they go in a cave where a big monster attacks them. They run from it. After that there is a council and some more people join their party. Then they continue on and some more monsters attack them. They fight them, then get on a boat. This one guy starts drowning but Frodo saves him and they hug and the movie's over. I just saved 3 hours of your life that you would have wasted.
10.0~A movie to touch all lives. dixiebelle30223 Sign in Permalink Tolkien was a master story weaver. The magnitude of this movie may not be known for a while. As people digest what it tells, then hopefully, read the books, we may see an even bigger audience for the next movies. If Tolkien's family had reservations about the movie industry taking on such a task, I think they should feel Tolkien's words were brought to life. Gandalf, well, he is just Gandalf. I anxiously await the next movie.
10.0~how can this be followed up? oliphaunt_of_harad Sign in Permalink I saw the original in the theaters three times, and even though I loved it, I didn't think it had what it took to be number one on my list. Then I saw the Extended Edition, and I thought, okay, that's the best film I've ever seen...I have a list of my 100 favorite films, and movies have to be extremely good to just get into my top twenty. But the special edition of this movie swept up till number one. Now when it is only more than a week till the Two Towers comes out, I still wonder how director Peter Jackson can follow this up. I mean really.
10.0~success! kallepister Sign in Permalink More than 20 years after Ralph Bakshi's pitiful 1978 crossover disaster, here's the unrivaled "Lord Of The Rings"-adaption. Peter Jackson finally made it. One of my all-time favorites. i do prefer sci-fi in general, but this one shifts the boundaries with striking ease. The reasons why earlier attempts (despite all memorable effort) just had to fail, were Bakshi's enormous budget problems and (most of all) the impossibility to bring certain phantasmagorias to convincing life on screen. Nowadays no really too big thing with vastly improved computer aid. But the massively enhanced visual impact is not the biggest improvement here, the best thing about LOTR is: this movie works! It's immediately captivating, stunning, pleasant, weird, frantic, funny, sad, freaky, tough, foolish and wise, depicting all the chicken skin plots of Tolkien's literary artwork with humble respect, credibility, style, and industrial strength. And it has stars: Viggo Mortensen is the only possible Strider, Liv Tyler and Kate Blanchett excel in medieval, exotic weirdness, and Elijah Wood gives one hell of a haunted Frodo. Not to mention the other actors, each one of them performing brilliant and awe-inspiring. The only pity about it: Gandalf is not played by Donald Sutherland. But you can't have everything, i guess...
10.0~Number One! strabo1021 Sign in Permalink What more can I say then my favourite book of all time has now become my favourite ever film. I was worried at first that the story couldn't be done justice on the big screen but my fears were unfounded-well done Peter Jackson!
10.0~Amazing LeThAlWeApOn389 Sign in Permalink This is definitely one of the most amazing films ever made. The book finally comes to life. Elijah Wood was great as the character Frodo and he really shows the suspense and thrills that he encounters in this movie. The visual effects were very awesome and it made the movie as good as it is. It deserved the awards it received. I think Frodo is a very interesting character because he is a normal person that has possession of the most powerful object in the world and it really showed how important the decisions he had to make so the world would be a safe place. I thought the movie was fantastic and I recommend it to all viewers who like suspense and fantasy. It was a great movie.
10.0~ORLANDO BLOOM ROCKED! pooh2tigger Sign in Permalink This movie is one of its best! Peter Jackson is BRILLIANT!!! Anyone who didn't like or didn't get it needs to watch it again!!! The actors they pick where perfected for the parts! The best thing about the movie was Orlando Bloom ( Legolas )!!! Elijah Wood is a wonderful actor. He really makes Frodo come a live! This movie is the best of its time! I give two thumbs up!
10.0~I love this film! ringbearer2003 Sign in Permalink I have always loved the books written by J.R.R. Tolkien, but I never expected that anyone would ever make a film out of it, or that it would be such a big success! Peter Jackson made the books real to me, and I try to watch it at least once a month, if not a lot more than that! The entire cast was perfectly placed, and they all worked so good together, that I am so mad that they don't let the other two films out on DVD right away!
10.0~An objective look at a masterpiece... JoshL007 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Critique: 9 out of 10 Hollywood does the same thing every year. In the attempt to make money, films are released whether they have good artistic merit or not. The film genre's usually vary, as well as the time slot they are released. Gross, sick comedies are released fairly often, with the filmmakers throwing as many lewd jokes in as possible to shock the viewer. Romantic comedies are usually spaced fairly far apart, as so the viewer doesn't realize they saw the same exact storyline a few months ago. Action films come out occasionally, and yet when they do it's either hit or miss. Sadly these days, they seem to be more misses than hits. Adventure flicks, such as the 'Indiana Jones' classics, come out rarely, and when they do, they are embarrassing cheap rip-offs. However, the release of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has certainly proved otherwise. The plot although somewhat original, is a good solid one. In a land called Middle Earth, a number of rings were created and given to several beings, with the dark lord Sauron forging one to control the land and all life. When Sauron was defeated, the ring fell from him and was passed down for centuries to other beings. The latest being, a hobbit known as Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo's close friend Gandalf, a powerful, yet wise wizard persuades Bilbo to hand the ring down to his nephew Frodo who knows very little about the ring. Bilbo reluctantly gives it to Frodo, only then does Frodo find out that the ring is full of evil and that Sauron has risen and is searching for the ring. Gandalf persuades Frodo to leave his home, and accompanied by some friends, Frodo leaves. Soon Frodo finds out that the only way the ring can be destroyed, is to cast it in the fires of Mount Doom where it was made. The only problem with that is, that's exactly where Sauron dwells. After almost 50 years, J.R.R Tolkien's beloved classic finally makes it to the big screen, and to say it bluntly, I was not disappointed. The movie is a perfect example how to make an excellent film. The direction is something fabulous I haven't seen in quite a while. Peter Jackson just might earn himself an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Jackson does an excellent job of bringing the beauty of Middle-Earth to the screen. The task was no easy one, filming three movies at the same time had never done before in cinema history. Yet, the film never feels confusing, and it plays out perfectly on the screen. The storyline is never hard to follow, and Tolkien's story is followed closely. While some scenes were omitted and others were added, the film never strays too far from the book. While some 'die-hard' Tolkien fans might have a problem with that, the changes were really made to make the film more understandable. The transition from book to movie is quite a difficult one, yet Jackson and his team were devoted to staying close to the storyline, and they did nothing short of a great job. The film is a marvel on the screen and definitely a wonder to behold. The scenery is beautiful, and the sets look very believable. The choice for filming location New Zealand was obviously an excellent one. The cinematography is something that makes the story so believable. If the film had been shot in any other location, the film's storyline wouldn't seem so real. Yet, when we see the camera sweeping around the beautiful scenery, we know it's New Zealand, but we are tricked into thinking Middle-Earth actually did exist. Besides feasting your eyes on the gorgeous landscapes, the special effects, are definitely something to behold. The folks behind all the eye candy, really outdid themselves. A CGI effect team created a project called WETA, a state of the art program to bring the monsters and villains in the movie to life. WETA did such an amazing job, one wonders if the hideous monsters displayed on the screen really did exist. As with any film, in order to make the story believable the performances have to be strong. The chemistry the actors perform is excellent, with Sir Ian McKellen ("X-Men", "David Copperfield") doing an excellent job as the quick tempered, yet wise wizard Gandalf. Eljiah Wood ("Forever Young", "Oliver Twist"), does a perfect job as the young precocious wide-eyed hobbit Frodo, suddenly thrown into a sea of danger. Viggo Mortenson ("Witness," "28 Days") plays the perfect Aragorn, perfecting the rugged hero's character. Supporting performances are excellent as well, with Sean Astin ("Rudy", "Courage Under Fire"), Billy Boyd ("Soldier's Leap", "Urban Ghost Story"), Dominic Monaghan (British TV Series "Hetty Wainthropp Investigates") and the rest performing marvelously. Not to say the film doesn't have it's share of problems, it does have them, yet they are quite few. One thing I objected to was that the film seemed a little too dark for my taste. While the books were just as dark, it really depended on how far your imagination went. Some will complain that the film abruptly ends, while that's not a major flaw to anyone who has read the books, other's will find themselves scratching their heads out of curiosity wondering what in the world just happened. Though the film has a few problems, the film's many fascinating scenes obviously outweigh the darker ones. The film works so well, the filmmakers should be definitely be noticed during award time. Yes, it's that good, and is easily one of the best films of the year. As such The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings rates as a 9 out of 10.
10.0~An Absolute Masterpiece kevhill Sign in Permalink Now that the inevitable hype upon its initial release has subsided, the time is right to properly appreciate and marvel at director Peter Jackson's classic masterpiece. For masterpiece it most certainly is and my personal hope is merely that the forthcoming `sequels' live up to what has gone before! Firstly however, it is pertinent to dissect the various criticisms that have been levelled at the film from some uninformed quarters. To slavishly emulate JRR Tolkien's original work would be virtually impossible; the book is far too detailed to allow such an undertaking but what has been delivered is a superb adaptation that maintains the spirit of the original publication. (Indeed, the original novel suffered from more than it's fair share of padding and the removal of sojourns such as the group's meeting with Tom Bombadil do not detract from the overall tale). The screenplay, in presenting the story, does indulge in poetic licence  but within the parameters of the overall theme. So to those who moan `it's not like the book', use a little commonsense eh?! Likewise, the `anti-climatic ending'  anyone with even a modicum of intelligence will appreciate that this is Part One of a Trilogy, an ongoing story, so if you're more disposed to a `crash, bang, wallop' finite ending then you're probably better off watching the latest Arnie release! Yes, it certainly leaves the viewer hankering as to know what transpires next but all will be revealed in December's forthcoming `The Two Towers'. And finally, as to the whole `Star Wars vs. LOTR' debate, for my money there really is no comparison. Effects-wise `Star Wars' may have been ahead of its time on original release but, please, take just a moment to consider the simplistic storyline and shallow `characterisation' before even contemplating the remote possibility it could compare on any level with LOTR! So, what is it all about? At the beginning of time, nine magical rings are forged that bestow upon the various races within Middle Earth the power by which to rule. But a further, secret ring is also forged by the Dark Lord Sauron that has the power to bind all nine together and thereby plunge Middle Earth into a future of darkness and despair under his domination. Fate decrees that a young Hobbit, Frodo Baggins, inherits this magical ring who then undertakes to destroy it  and therefore Eternal Darkness  once and for all within the fires of Mount Doom, the place it was originally forged and the only location where it might be destroyed. So begins his perilous journey from within the comfortable safety of The Shire to the evil domain of Mordor assisted by a motley collection of fellow Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves and Gandalf the Wizard  all the while insatiably pursued by the terrifying agents of Sauron. So the adventure begins as we witness the intrepid band on their journey and all that they encounter on their way to the outskirts of Mordor, wherein the ring must eventually be destroyed.. Ian Mckellen is absolutely outstanding as Gandalf the wizard, the personification of the paternal grandfather we'd all like, the focal point of wisdom and guidance and his omission from the recent Oscar Winners was a grave misjudgement of the Academy's behalf. All round the casting is inspired but it is slightly disappointing that both Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett's contributions are little more than cameo roles. The imagery is breathtakingly stunning and the choice of location (principally New Zealand) genuinely inspired; wonder in awe as the camera sweeps into the depths of the mines thousands of feet deep or soars above the glorious landscapes - and the obligatory special effects are the pinnacle of the art. At three hours duration the film may appear lengthy but I for one remained absolutely captivated throughout and I defy anyone with a smidgeon of imagination not to be enthralled likewise. Faultless save for a few of those annoying `humorous' interjections Hollywood seems unable to resist entwining into plots, Lord Of The Rings is simply, a thoroughbred classic in the real sense.
10.0~As good as it gets. PTOLHURST Sign in Permalink Given that this has as much a history in fantasy circles and Stars Wars has in Sci Fi circles the anticipation of the movie has been growing steadily for ages. Simply put you could not have done it better, this rates as the best fantasy film of all time and along with Harry Potter represents a great boost for the genre that films like Dungeons and Dragons have gone a long way to dent. The scenery is stunning, the Characters are spot on, the story lovingly recreated. It answered all my expectations and then some. My only gripe is that as films like these get longer could we not have an intermission like the days of old?
10.0~Without equal jpolywog-52354 Sign in Permalink Simply the first part of the greatest trilogy ever screened. I have watched the trilogy on numerous occasions. Without equal in my opinion. I wish I could rate it 11 out of 10.
10.0~THE best fantasy epic of all time tripwires Sign in Permalink I hate Star Wars. Granted, I have never seen any of the films, but seeing clips from it during various awards ceremonies and things like that tell me I never want to see any of them, the originals included. I'm also not a big fan of fantasy films, so it was pretty damn daring of me to make that statement in the summary box. The thing is, The Fellowship of the Ring just REEKS with brilliance. Every single second of the movie is astounding, from the first battlefield scene until the last few scenes. I don't need to watch any other fantasy flicks to know that this is the best. Now, I'm not a Tolkien reader. I bought "FOTR" after watching the film and watching a National Geographic documentary on his life. I've owned the book for maybe 3 months now, and so far I'm still at page 94, thereabout. But I have seen the movie 3 times. And each time, it just got better. Peter Jackson deserves all the best director awards the industry could ever give for his beautiful masterpiece. How he managed not to get the Golden Globe for Best Director is beyond me. Actually, how anyone can think that this picture is anything but brilliant is beyond me. 3-hours too long? Hell no. 3-hours too short. I truly hope the Academy awards Mr. Jackson for his great eye for detail, and all-round awesome direction, and I sincerely think this movie is Best Picture material. The acting is also superb. I've always liked Elijah Wood, but I loved him in this. Not only are his eyes beautiful, he is able to speak volumes with them. I don't understand how the Academy and the rest have managed to overlook him for a Best Actor award. Orlando Bloom is devastatingly gorgeous as Legolas. He has captured the hearts of teenaged girls the whole world over, myself included. You can't blame us. Legolas is the perfect man you'd want by your side in times of danger. His movements are agile, like a cat's, and you couldn't tell in the movie that Bloom has taken only 2 (or was it 3?) months of archery classes. My only gripe about the character was that there wasn't much developement in the movie. I hope we'd get to see more of Legolas in the coming two movies, which I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE. Viggo Mortensen was dashingly handsome as Aragorn, Sir Ian McKellan radiated gentleness and his Best Supporting SAG award was well-deserved, and the hobbits were excellent. You simply cannot fault the acting, or any other aspects of this movie. I love everything about the film, from its breath-taking sceneries to the grotesque appearances of the orcs to Howard Shore's beautiful music. EVERYTHING! The only -- and I truly mean only -- negative thing I have to say about the trilogy is that they're making me wait an entire year for the next part. It's like feeding me a piece of delicious cake and taking the rest away, and then telling me, "You'd get the next bite next year." The cake is lovely, and I want to eat it whole, all at once. And to anyone who wonders why "FOTR" is best picture material: it draws you in, it makes you care whether the characters lived or died, and it gets under your skin and refuses to leave until the whole movie is over. It stays in your mind when it's over, and you know you want to go back and relive every moment of that wonderful journey you were a part of. Three times. All hail "The Lord of the Rings".
10.0~nothing has changed onur_karaoglu Sign in Permalink Everyone agrees that this film made a magnificent change for the cinema history. However, in my opinion, at first sight, our imaginative mind pretended to be aware of the difference just. That is, it was a trick and in fact, nothing has changed. It is obvious that in spite of its unreal cinematic spelling, this film is the most effective movie all the time. Thus, we can think of this film as a master piece.
10.0~AStonishing miguelangel-23 Sign in Permalink great,amazing, astonishing,well made,bedazzling,a master piece. Flawless, well directed, photography is perfect, acting is powerful, The story is magnificent... What else do you want me to say....
10.0~A Masterpiece! Elswet Sign in Permalink I wasn't going to review this movie. There are hundreds of reviews on it and I frankly wasn't going to waste my time repeating the same words of praise. When I first learned that they were doing these movies, I thought, "Great! Another series of movies I'll hate, modeled after a trilogy of books that I love." Stephen King's work, being a prime example. I love the literary works, and the movies all just die on the screen; be it big or little. Then I learned that Peter Jackson was directing it and I was even less eager to see the movies. I never liked the Frighteners and Meet the Feebles?! Wow, did that movie stink UP the place! And then I discovered they had no plans of making the prequel; "The Hobbit," and that was that. I wasn't going to like the movie, and I refused to be excited about it. Any of it. But then, I was GIVEN tickets as an early Yule present and so I begrudgingly attended its premier here in the Smokies. I was very pleasantly surprised. I ended up seeing this movie twice in the theaters, and have since bought the extended edition gift set of this work. The opening sequence was so well done, that I couldn't find any reason at all to not accept it. They didn't do "The Hobbit," true enough, but they filled in that time and gave the viewers enough of the beginning that I could thoroughly subscribe to the movie. Many critics have literally bashed Peter Jackson's omission of one of the characters in Frodo's party, but the character was hardly relevant to the plot, the storyline, or the story itself and was best left out. I didn't even miss old Tom "what'shisname," to tell you the truth. I do have a problem with Aragorn's character's emotionality in the movie. His character in the book was a seasoned Ranger. His emotional instability; ie: his crying openly scene after scene, is completely out of character. It lends to the storyline with Arwen, and furthers the movie along, true enough, and personally, I didn't mind it. It was just out of character. He's rough, he's tough; a seasoned ranger. He shouldn't have been as emotionally portrayed as Jackson did him, although the reasons are clearly due to time constraints. It would have taken forever to develop Aragorn properly, and they frankly did not have enough time, even with the three-plus hours of screen time. BUT, Jackson's characters were very well developed, the story was very well told. There was a LOT of dialog, but there was a lot of detail that would've been left out; many, many finer details that never would've been able to be expressed without the richness of dialogue and Jackson and his company saw that, thankfully. All in all, as a Tolkien fan from WAY back, I feel that Peter Jackson did a marvelous job with this, the opening edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It rates so far above, "The Godfather" trilogy (to which it has been compared), that there IS no comparison. The acting is exemplary. There is no stiffness, no badly delivered lines, no hesitation in performance. Sean Astin truly and greatly surprised me with his brilliant performance as SamWise. The scenery and cinematography is brilliant. The sets and scenes are so well done, I only spied a single flaw...and I was looking! There was a car in the background of one shot! But the car will be missing from the DVD release, I'm sure. The wardrobing and costumes were finely hand-made; treated to look worn and imperfect, as they should and the Shire was so well done, I was as delighted as any child on Yule morning. But the thing which captured me the most and held me spellbound was the casting. They put just the right people into just the right roles. I simply loved the characters.. Each and every one of them felt just like the book (except for the deviation I already mentioned about Aragorn's emotional state). First we had "The Godfather," then we were given the "Star Wars" trilogy and now, we have the Lord of the Rings to love. I look forward with great anticipation to the rest of this series. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for giving of yourself to this extent. It is above and beyond all for which I could have hoped. This first installment rates a full 10/10 from... the Fiend :.
10.0~Excitement All the Way (nb. may contain spoilers) AJ-007 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is quite simply a great movie. It relates to the book by J.R.R. Tolkien very well and some of the characters, like Gandalf, are almost exactly the way I imagined them to be. The length of the movie is fine as well. There is lots of excitement and tension in the movie, as well as a lot of fighting scenes. It also explains the story very well, with the making of the ring etc. This makes it enjoyable to watch. There is some problems with the movie I think. For example, how Arwen takes Frodo to Rivendell is totally different to the book, and also how she makes the flood, instead of Gandalf and Elrond. Apart from this, the differences between the movie and the novel don't really bother me, as it would have made the movie too long to have things like Tom Bombadil and the elves in the Shire in it. All up, the movie is really enjoyable to watch and I am eagerly anticipating the release of The Two Towers in December '02.
5.0~Just can't get into it Sandcooler Sign in Permalink At last. I've finally gotten through "Lord Of The Rings", presumably as the last person in the world to do so. I've started watching it numerous times though, but somehow my head just kept tuning out. The story probably isn't the problem: it's about as classic as a story structure can get (protagonist-goal-antagonist), the world they live in might be complex but overall the movie is hardly difficult to follow. The cast is great as well, pretty much everybody's a perfect fit. What can you really do wrong when you get Christopher Lee? But still, I just don't find the movie compelling. The plot moves along so slow in this one, it's three hours long but as the credits roll it still feels like the trilogy has barely begun. There are some amazing special effects thrown around as well, but I'm not going to love a movie because it's incredibly difficult to make. I love movies because they're entertaining, and frankly this first part of the trilogy often just bored me. I guess it's an acquired taste I just can't seem to acquire.
10.0~Great adaptation. dsted Sign in Permalink When I first saw this movie I was disappointed. I did not think that the movie did justice to the book(my personal all-time favorite). It distorted the time-line, and most importantly, left out the old forest and Tom Bombadil(my favorite character) altogether. The second, third, and forth time I saw it though, I got over that. The movie was great, and added extra parts that could not have been written. There are references to the book(names of chapters) and great new scenes with forshadowing(scene where Frodo drops The Ring). The movie was presented well, great cinematography, great location(very Tolkien-like landscape), great special effects. I give this movie a very strong 10, and I can't wait to see The Two Towers.
10.0~A cinematic milestone! jaesboxer Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's The Lord Of THe Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is, without a doubt, one of the most spectacular epics ever made! Not since Gone With The Wind has such a beloved novel been adapted so successfully. This is truly a fantasy to rival all fantasies, bringing Tolkien's magical Middle-Earth to the screen while at the same time holding on the myth and the characters that made the novel a classic. Almost everyone I know loved this movie, many of whom felt it was an improvement on the book. Even adamant Tolkien fans are pleased with the results. When I first saw Lord Of The Rings, I had never read the book. I was looking forward to it, but, knowing little about Middle Earth, it was purely objective anticipation. I was hoping this would be the kind of of movie we sit and wait for, the next Star Wars, or Titanic, something which the media has not overhyped, that is as good as everyone expects. This movie surpassed all those expectations. I have seen it 5 times in the theatre to date, and at a running time of three hours, I am still not bored of it. Enthralled by the movie's recreation of Middle-Earth, I recently read the book, mainly as an epitaph to the movie. While it was a definite classic, I feel the movie surpassed it in characterization. All the creatures and characters of the book were made more human by the scripting. Ian McKellen offers a brilliant portrayal of Gandalf, while Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood make stalwart heroes. The orcs are positively hideous, the sets of Rivendell and Lothlorien are amazing, and the story has translated to the screen beautifully. I honestly cannot wait for the Two Towers this christmas. I feel that Peter Jackson has given us the sort of movie we hope for. I believe very strongly that in due time this will become a classic, reminiscient of Star Wars, yet with superb writing and beautifully portrayed characters, it manages to stay away from the cheesy dialogue that plagues the Star Wars trilogy. This is a cinematic milestone, and I feel it was shamelessly robbed at the Oscars, where, defying all convention, being the film with the most nominations (13, the second highest amount ever) did not garner the best picture oscar. It is a brilliant film, to be seen and seen again.
10.0~I was not in the target audience TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews Sign in Permalink I have never read a single word of anything by Tolkien. This is not my genre; I have always disliked fantasy, and largely, adventure, as well. Prior to my viewing of this, I didn't care for Jackson, although The Frighteners had its moments. I put off watching this until tonight, where it was on TV. In other words, I cannot judge this as an adaptation, nor can I comment on the Extended Edition. What I can say is that this gripped me from the first frame and did not let go until the last one. That ought to give you an idea of how well-crafted and brilliantly executed a cinematic achievement it is. The plot is compelling and well-told. In spite of a large group of characters, this keeps track of, and develops, them all quite nicely. The acting is spot-on. I did find the comic relief to be annoying, but there's immensely little of it if you look at the overall running time, that aspect of it wasn't made for me(I can imagine kids enjoy it, and it's harmless and inoffensive), and it's easy enough to look past. This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant. There is nothing really offensive in this, though children might find the battle sequences too intense. I recommend this to everyone who can see themselves getting into this. 10/10
10.0~This movie is the best jameskortar Sign in Permalink This is one of the few movies I've seen that does justice to the book it represents. True, it doesn't follow the story exactly, but Peter Jackson did about as good a job as you can expect anyone to do in three hours. This movie is incredible. There simply is nothing to complain about. The acting is superb, with several cast members giving the performance of a lifetime. The special effects are breathtaking, and the stunts and fight scenes very memorable. This film captivates you from the very start, when it tells the story of the rings, and holds you until the last moment, where we are left to wonder about the fate of the scattered fellowship (well, those who never read the books, at least). I knew this film was a masterpiece when my wife, who hates the fantasy genre, insisted on seeing it 3 times in theaters. This movie is the best! i highly recommend it for anyone but small children. the battle scenes are great. Elijah Wood was once more playing the innocent hobbit on a journey. There is nothing but pure perfection in this film, and doubtless it will become as classic and legendary as the book that inspired it.
10.0~Best Movie of the Year Galadriel16 Sign in Permalink I think that this movie was the best thing to come out of 2001. Some of my friends said that it lagged on a bit, but I don't think they could have been more wrong. I think what made me like it so much (besides the great story) was the way it looked. Literally this movie glowed! I can't wait to see the second movie!
10.0~Peter Jackson for best director! TheLastStop41 Sign in Permalink I know it's my second time writing a review on Lord of the Rings, but this isn't it particularly about Lord of the Rings. As some of you have read my last review (it was only posted yesterday, so the chances you did read it) you could tell just by my one line summary that I loved the movie. This year's academy competition for my guess will be Lord of the Rings vs. A Beautiful Mind. One of the nominees for both movies, which most of you know, is the best director award. Though I have not seen A Beautiful Mind, I would like to say that Peter Jackson should win for two main reasons. 1. He's a director that has not done a lot of movies and he has just created a masterpiece. And 2. Since he's a director who hasn't done many movies, it's very hard to make a movie that's going to be nominated for best picture which he has accomplished, but it's even harder for a a rookie director to make a masterpiece that is based on a book. Yeah Ron Howard is real good director, but many people aren't capable of making a masterpiece movie based on a masterpiece book trilogy. I know there's nothing any of you people can do about it, but I just felt that Peter Jackson is the one who I think truly deserves Best Director.
9.0~Adventure on a Huge Scale joehemmings68 Sign in Permalink The film that birthed a huge franchise, and for me this is easily the best. For me, the magic of something reduces the more you see it, and so future films just don't wow you in quite the same way. The slow building and exposition elements here are justified since it is our first taste of this world on screen. This applies to all the Lord of the Rings films, as they all have the same strong suits. The music is flawless. The film looks amazing, it's an absolute treat to watch. The world is perfectly realised and believable. Many of the characters are charismatic and fun, and all are performed well, by a very talented cast. Being the opening, this was the best suited of the three to be a film structurally. It's paced far better than any other, and keeps you moving through with evenly distributed character introductions, talky bits and big set pieces. I felt the early moments of this film featuring the Hobbits and the Nazgul were unique in tone for the franchise, and were filled with genuine menace. This film is also better humored than the other two, that are a bit more drawn out and harrowing. All in all this is one of the best blockbusters there has ever been, and perhaps one of the last truly impressive spectacle films if we keep moving towards CGI dependence which is much less work but also much less impressive. Nine out of Ten.
10.0~A wonderful relief JRaynmaker Sign in Permalink I dreaded this movie. As a fan of "The Lord of the Rings" for decades, I'd learned to fear any announcements that it was about to be made into a film, cartoon, mini-series, TV movies, or any other entertainment besides the book. The BBC's radio production was the only other medium that I thought got close to the book, and even it felt short ultimately. So this new version was a scary thing to consider. I approached it with dread and left the theater in a state of joyous, celebratory relief. It was right! They did it right. It wasn't cutesy or fey. It wasn't all D&D monsters mightier than thou. Gandalf twinkled and roared. Sam was nervous and loyal. Frodo was scared and grimly determined. Merry and Pippin were perfect friends, excellent foils. Legolas and Gimli were believeable. The hobbits looked like hobbits, not children in grownup clothing.The characters looked like they knew what they were doing with swords and bows and axes, and they all eventually looked liked they'd been far too many days on the road. It's the little things that make a film, for me. The right details, the unmentioned background touches, like the "statues" behind the main characters in one forest scene (a treat for readers of the books) and the design on Boromir's bracers. And no, I'm not forgetting Boromir or Aragorn. As the two least "magical" characters in the group, they could easily have been overshadowed by elves, dwarves, wizards and the lot. But they gave a good accounting for we mere humans - limited, tormented, but strong, firm, and ultimately capable of doing the right thing, no matter how hard. This is an incredibly good adaptation of Tolkien's astonishingly wonderful story. The movie, like the book, gives me hope for the human race. And it's a darned good rip-snorting action adventure, to boot. See it. Then see it again, to appreciate Peter Jackson and his amazing crews' work on the details.
10.0~Absolutely Magical inserrtnamehere Sign in Permalink This film (along with the entire trilogy) is regarded as one of the greatest, most influential films of all time and with good reason. This movie has audiences captivated from the beginning to the end. Even watching it in 2015, I am still stunned by the special effects, the set, the scenery, the acting, the plot, the camera shots and angles, the make up, the costumes, and the editing among many other factors. Most note-worthy is the score which brings a whole new perspective and sound to science fiction and to fictitious worlds and characters. Even though the story contains a lot of sci-fi jargon, the writing and dialog do a very good job in relaying the information to the audience. The writers did an excellent job in simplifying and clarifying an intricate and brilliant story. Well done Peter Jackson. You deserve the fame and fortune you received from this movie.
1.0~In a word, this movie SUCKED! MotownMan Sign in Permalink I can't believe that so many of you people loved this movie! First of all, I completely agree with others who have complained about its lack of character development. What happened there in that Elf village where the Fellowship suddenly formed? "Okay, Frodo, you carry the ring, and we'll have an elf, a dwarf, 2 humans, an old wizard, and three other useless hobbits tag along with you." To the people who read the book (I did not), you need to remember that for a movie based on a book to be "GREAT," it should be self- sufficient. I should not have need a Lord of the Rings fanatic sitting next to me explaining every scene and telling me things like, "Oh yeah, those guys are called Ringwraiths... no, the bad guy is Sauron and the wizard who became bad is called Saruman, can't you keep these names straight? ... No, Tolkien couldn't use names like Fred and John because he needed unique and magical Middle Earth names! (except of course for the arbitrary naming of Sam the hobbit)...." What is all of this hogwash? Are you people all on drugs? Can't you see what kind of nonsense this movie is? Don't you realize that by reading the book, you got all of the character development and background story that the rest of us just did not get? Clearly, you all used your previous knowledge to fill in the gaps that the rest of us just had to endure. I'm just stunned at how many weirdo Dungeon and Dragon freaks there are out there who ranked this movie so highly. Bottom line: This movie was terrible in every sense of the word. Long, boring, filled with useless scenery shots (which were really just CGI enhanced shots anyway) and shots of Elijah Wood's blank expression as he stared at the ring in his hand, devoid of any character development (I couldn't even remember main character's names, let alone motivations or backgrounds), and filled with cheesey action sequences that made "The Mummy Returns" look like a masterpiece. You need to be a huge Tolkien/Fantasy fanatic to appreciate this movie. Otherwise, go see "Ocean's Eleven", which is much better and more entertaining in every respect.
10.0~Jackson is Lord of the Screen... eemorrison Sign in Permalink At first I did not know what to expect from Peter Jackson's version of LOTR. The New Zealand master of low-budget gore films seemed the least likely candidate to take on the tremendous Hollywood undertaking that was the LOTR. However Jackson remained true to Tolkiens work, as well as allowing his unique style to shine through... the result is possibly one of the greatest American Studio films of all time...
10.0~cannot stop watching this movie nacky1 Sign in Permalink i must admit when first watching this movie i got abit side tracked and lost the plot, i however bought the video, picked up everything i had missed, as i have not read the books at all i suppose i got a little lost, but into watching it again i just couldnt stop rewinding and replaying this terrific movie. i found it to be unpredicatable, sad, scary etc...... lets face it who would ever think gandalf would go wow, was exciting a tremendous fantasy. high 5 to peter jackson and all great movie, now im counting days for twin towers.
6.0~Big budget... but then? TheOtherFool Sign in Permalink First off, I'd like to make a statement: I have not read any of the LOTR books by Tolkien. I once started out in The Hobbit, but didn't think much of it. So I'd like to review the Movie, and will not relate it to the book. So I don't care if Middle Earth 'came to life' to some viewers, or if the Orks really had 3 eyes or whatever. I don't care about that. Let's start with a view at the story. A ring that has the power to destroy the world falls into the hands of young Frodo (Wood), who with help of several friends has to destroy it on a special place. The first movie of the trilogy basically are these people on their journey to that place. And that's it. I don't care where that place is, which member of the Fellowship really is the son of whom, what is going to happen in the next movies or whatever. This is the open ended story presented, and it's really not that interesting. Way too many (unimportant) characters are involved, the movie is lacking in story and pace and isn't as epic as a lot of people (mostly fans of the book), make you believe it is. If you analyze it, the movie goes like this: Group of people taking a journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey, etcetera, etcetera. These fights might be against different enemies (Orks, Uru-kai, a huge monster or black knights), it all comes down to the same thing. And that, to be honest, is a bit boring. The worst part though is that when Lotr:Fotr finally does finish, nothing has really happened. They're still on their journey, still losing guys and I'm sure they're gonna have a lot more fights in the other 2 films, of which I already saw The Two Towers. Is it really necessary to expand an easy (mind you, I didn't say bad) story to a 9 hour movie extravaganza? For instance, is Cate Blanchetts character really of importance to the movie? No, the only reason she's in there because she's in the book. And that's a pretty lame reason, since this is Film-making we're talking about. Now, it's not that the Fellowship is a really bad movie. It all looks phenomenal and we have to congratulate Peter Jackson for the fact he got those studio people mad (or, in retrospect, wise) enough to spend so much money on it. We have to respect Tolkien for creating an exciting world, full of imaginative details. But, for the many things Fellowship is (a cool look at the book for fans?), a good movie it most definitely is not. 6/10.
10.0~One of the best movies of all time. RaveN_ImW Sign in Permalink All I can say about this movie is that it had everything you could ever want in a movie ( except an ending, but yo all know why ). This Movie is my joint number 1 in my all time 10 ten movies with " The Matrix " The only way this dead lock is going to be broken is by seeing the next two movies in the respective trilogys .
10.0~no words, best movie ever MissMyrtleTurtle Sign in Permalink I have no words, just speechless. Can not explain how much I have enjoyed this movie. 3 hours non stop watching, and I did not notice I was in the movie theater. How about that for a movie! And when it was over, instantly bought another ticket and went again. and I'd do it again, but they took it off the screen (after months of anxious people who would commit a murder to get in the theater). And I.., I can only buy the DVD. Alas, that's a comfort.
10.0~must see, best trilogy of all time. madalyn-frearson Sign in Permalink the lord of the rings is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. not only did i enjoy watching it over and over again but i also loved the feel the movie gave me, it was like an urge to finish it, an edge of you seat kind of sensation, and just waiting for the next movie to come out was too much to bear, it left you wanting more. this is a series of movies that you could watch over and over again and still be scared, still cry and still love it as much as the first time. this movie gave me chills as they walked through beautiful, scary, treacherous and breath taking scenes. i literally fell in love with this movie, my mum though i was obsessed. i would recommend this to anyone willing to have their minds blown. this is a great movie that has many genres including : fantasy, action, a bit of romance and a bit drama. this is an instant classic and no matter what the haters say this is and always will be the best trilogy of all time. please watch because i assure you will not regret it.
10.0~Haven't felt this excited since I was a 12 year old kid coldnakedman Sign in Permalink Whether it was the opening action sequences or the finale, my heart rate was going a mile a minute watching this movie. FOTR did everything every other fantasy film should have done; it had fantastic creatures and beings that had previously only appeared in my dreams and my imagination. Jackson did a tremendous job making tangible what I previously had to visualize by reading the books. Without getting too specific and spoiling the ending, my only critique of the movie was that it was a little anti-climatic. Then again, the book was also anti-climatic because it was the first part of a trilogy. I would also like to comment about how many people have compared Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to this film. My advice is to see them both, don't compare them, and enjoy the each as the great stories they are. This is one of those movies that I will watch over and over again and never get tired of. It wasn't boring. It didn't lack action. It wasn't overhyped. The acting was good. And those that said it had too many "Scenery" shots should consider Doctor Zhivago...it was 4 hours of trains and snow, but still a classic! Give this movie a shot, and enjoy it for what it is; the visualization of a classic tale.
10.0~Good Movie Tridana Sign in Permalink How to make a Legend: Take a great and/or timeless story Add a twist to it (in this case a ring that controls the fate of the world) Put some music theme(s) that plays throughout the movie/series every now and then Introduce great and memorable characters to the mix Kill off some lovable characters Make the situation seem hopeless Top it off with a great ending or an ending open for a sequel This is Lord of the Rings, book and movie. Acting: 10/10 The acting totally blew me away for this movie. Even Liv Tyler (who has an inscrutable reputation for her acting) did a tremendous job as Arwen. Ian McKellan's performance stands out the most. Orlando Bloom honestly didn't have as many lines as the others, but did a great job as Legolas. PJ made a smart movie replacing Stuart Townsend with Viggo Mortensen. Viggo is the exact right age and has the exact right look that Aragorn should have. John Rhys-Davies played out Gimli much like he was in the book. Dominic Monaghan did a good job as Merry and acted out the lines like he really meant it. Pippin's character was portrayed closest to his character in the book thanks to Billy Boyd. Sean Astin playing Sam was right on and almost portrayed closest to his character in the book if only it showed more of his character changing and becoming more brave (later depicted more in The Two Towers and then even more in Return of the King).Elijah Wood is pretty much the only person who could get Frodo's character right and transform him both from a cheery, upbeat hobbit to a depressed and frightened hero while at the same time showing the ring's corruption on him (mostly shown in The Two Towers, but there is the odd hint here and there).Cate Blanchette and Christopher Lee were pretty much born for the rolls of Galadriel and Saruman. Elrond has a great character tone that could only be brought on by Hugo Weaving. Sadly though, Sean Bean's acting is short lived throughout the trilogy. ( For those who have seen the movie/read the books you know what i'm talking about and for those who haven't, see the movie/read the book to find out) Story: 9/10 The only reason this didn't get 10/10 is because, to put it blandly, the idea of a ring controlling the fate of mankind does sound far-fetched. However Tolkien (pronounced Tol-KEEN) put such a vivid story behind it that to this day its amazingly fresh. The story itself fits in with the problems of our time such as the recent war and even everyday life. Friends, Courage, Sacrifice, Rising up against the odds. Mind you, Tolkien was in both World Wars so its bound to have that sort of theme in it. Music: 11/10 What many composer's fail to incorporate into their movies, Howard Shore does in this. Every place pretty much has its own theme and Howard Shore sticks to this idea throughout the entire Trilogy. The Uruk-Hai, Mordor, The Shire. All has its own theme. The choir really adds to the experience. Especially in the 2 very emotional death scenes through the movie. The score on its own is beautiful and touching. If the score makes you cry, then the movie will make you bawl your eyes out. Enough said. Visual Effects: 10/10 From Special Effects to camera tricks, PJ applied the newest tricks to make the Trilogy seem as real as possible. Hobbits are short, wizards are tall. All thanks to camera tricks and camera angles. Amazingly, the movie keeps its realism even from the lack of gore and blood. It's even more amazing when they do it in The Two Towers (still managing to only get a 14A rating). MASSIVE helped a complies all the large battle scenes (The Prologue, Moria, so on)
10.0~Extended Edition Recommended t_todd-14266 Sign in Permalink A world so distant never feels so close. The Lord of the Rings is an immersive experience, taking you along a journey of emotions as you absorb the beautiful landscapes in New Zealand along with one of if not the most iconic scores in film history. Attention to detail in costumes is some of the highest quality seen in film history, and CGI still holds up to many modern movies and tv. While not an exact replication of the novels, LoTR is possibly the most perfect.
1.0~it's about elves jdfoster-1 Sign in Permalink did anybody realize that it's about elves, how can a movie about elf get on the top 250. Do you love computer graphics? don't they look so real. How can a movie about computer generated elf bet a real movie like taxi driver or any other movie without elves. people should watch real movies about real things there is no emotion in a movie about elves, does it hit close to home when the elves fight the wizard? No a fantasy can never beat an drama it doesn't exist.Also it is to new (even if it was good) to become one of the best movies ever it hasn't with stood the test of time. Basically I'm trying to say elves,wizards, computer graphics,do you love it? Would it kill them to use real models instead of computer graphics. computer graphics are taking away real artist jobs.
1.0~Really Bad keith2000 Sign in Permalink Before this film was released, New Line said "We hope to beat Titanic". John Rhys Davies said "This is going to be the biggest film ever". Ian McKellan said "I cried the first time I saw it, you will too". As the box office and the wave of indifference proves, they couldn't have been more wrong. Perhaps the arrogance of the film makers is one reason why so many people don't like this film. Perhaps that's why it hasn't broken into the top 50 of the all time "adjusted for inflation" chart. Me? I was just bored to tears. The story is very, very simple. A group of characters have to take a "magic ring" to a special place where it can be destroyed. Along the way, they run away from some monsters, then they run away from some more and this keeps happening right up until the end. Only there is NO end. The film just stops which of course is a cheap marketing ploy to make you see the next two. The script is awful. It's like watered down Shakespeare and some lines are such nonsense that there were a few groans in the cinema I saw this in. It also has a total lack of humor which makes it all the more pretentious. The characters are never fleshed out and some of them take on charachatures. Gandalf is the worst of them all. A caricature of Merlin from the King Arthur stories, he is so 2D he could have been created by Walt Disney. The direction is average to say the least and it seems that Peter Jackson has no real style of his own. Instead he borrows heavily from the likes of Tim Burtons "Sleepy Hollow". The action scenes are very poorly done and so is the use of CGI. I wish I could talk about the score but I really don't remember it. The acting is reasonable enough but some of them must have thought "what am I doing here?" when they had to read such banal lines. Overall it is just a really bad movie. Never living up to the hype and, to be honest, never coming close. No matter how much the cast and crew tell you how great this is, the simple fact is, it's not. 3 out of 10.
10.0~Do not miss this movie, you will be glad you watched it!! bp7677 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an awesome movie. I have read The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers. I have yet to read The Return of the King. While there are imperfections here and there, overall the movie is extremely worthwhile. I absolutely love Tolkien's enchanting books and would recommend them to anyone before I would recommend the movie just becuase there are several more events included in the novel and because Tolkien is such a brilliant writer. Back to the film: I was very surprised that it followed the book so well (compared to other such films based on books). Yet, I was still disappointed that it did not include the scene at Crickhollow, the house of Tom Bombadil, or the incident at the barrow-downs. Also, the most disappointing element was the appearance of Arwen, who does not act as a major character whatsoever in the novel The Fellowship of the Ring. However, I praise the film on many aspects. I thought it was very appropriate to include the "history" of the ring at the beginning, since many of the movie-goers have never read the books and therefore it would be difficult to understand the whole thing about the ring, etc. Also, the scenery was GREAT....just as I imagined it...especially Bilbo's house,the Mines of Moria, among others. The music was very fitting for the movie, as was virtually all of the excellent actors to their characters. Ian McKellan as Gandalf was superb, Elijah Wood as Frodo was great, and Viggo Mortensen as Strider was absolutely perfect...just as described in the book. I highly recommend this film, if for nothing else its brilliant storyline, breathtaking scenery, and excellent actors. Don't miss it!
10.0~A fantasy threat wrapped in childhood nostalgia lee-thorneycroft Sign in Permalink The lord of the rings trilogy is my all time favourite trilogy. My first encounter with Lord of the Rings was when my Dad bought me the Fellowship on video when I was 8. I had no idea what the film was supposed to be about. I just looked at the artwork on the cover and asked my Dad to buy it. We went home and watched the film together immediately. Then we watched it again for a second time the next day. And then again the day after. And for whatever reason, I just couldn't stop watching it. As an 8 year old, I assumed it was because I loved sword fighting, monsters and cheap scares. Now, 24 years old, I think I know why I did it. It was because of the immersion I felt - and still feel today. Not many fantasy series - TV and film - are this immersive. I think what really strikes a cord with me is the attention to detail in the world building. Director Peter Jackson brought JRR Tolkien's Middle-Earth to life and gave the films a suitably dream-like fantasy quality despite also being historically credible. I thoroughly believe that Middle Earth could have been a real place in times gone by. So even though the story itself - which is amazing - is a classic tale of good vs evil (Another reason why my childhood self immediately fell in love with it), the attention to detail in the film making and overall world-building is the reason why the film still has the replay value that it does for me even today.
1.0~Shambles! genoxy Sign in Permalink As a huge LOTR fan from early childhood, it pains me to write this review - but they've completely missed it! The Lord Of The Rings is about, and should be about, and always has been about two things: story and atmosphere, both of which are missed completely in this film. As any other epic story, the plot needs time to develop and breathe, as such, thus creating a connection, on a very deep emotional level with the heroes. What the production team in this case had done, is crammed a huge story into three hours that make a VERY boring viewing. Boring, since the story has no credibility whatsoever when you don't understand why the heroes are where they are at, how they got there, or how long it took them to get there. All it leaves you with, is looking forward to the battle scenes, in which you will find yourself thinking: 'yeah right, whatever', on more than one occasion. On top of that, or rather because of all that, with the exception of Sir Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, the heroes seem ridiculous and pathetic and you are left feeling completely indifferent to them! Unheard of! Indifferent to the heroes of the LOTR! Oh dear, you got it SO wrong! Shame! Whenever I think about this film, I can't help but thinking about Gladiator, which I thought was fantastically written and executed. LOTR HAD the potential to be as good, but, and it pains me to say that, is not even in the same league. My money back please.
1.0~One Disappointment to Rule Them All bartman-10 Sign in Permalink I am a big fan of the books and have read them several times. I was warned about the plot differences from the books, but no warning could have ever prepared me for what I had to endure. The disrespectful adaptation of the book (Arwen saving Frodo for example) is just the beginning. The way the director made the characters so one dimensional makes it hard to expect any development of them in the upcoming two movies (who could not guess that Boromir would go after the ring one minute after you see him in the movie). The special effects - NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS - should help develop the storyline of the movie, this movie is a clear example of a movie made to showcase the special effects. I could go on rambling about this movie for long but will not waste more time on it. MY VOTE 2 out of 5
10.0~Storytelling at its best nicksd05_02 Sign in Permalink This series is simply the greatest story ever to be told. It's an adventure in the world we all see in our dreams, and the action would thrill a person of any age. I will be giving all three movies 10's and will pray to God to see "The Hobbit" on the big screen.
10.0~not bad jonyw Sign in Permalink Christmas 2002, Christmas 2003... I don't want to wish my life away. Still, the release of the DVDs should alleviate the wait. Nothing could have prepared me for this film. I know the books inside out. My Dad, however, has never seen the point in this fantasy codswallop. When we walked out after the film and he said 'that was fantastic' I almost cried. I was worried that it wouldn't live up to my expectations, be like the Bakshi rubbish. I was worried it would be ridiculed by those who never looked at the books. I was worried they would can parts 2 and 3. I needn't have worried.
8.0~THE BEGINING OF A GREAT STORY SUPERNOVA HEIGHTS Sign in Permalink Lord of the rings could be one of the best film in the history for many reasons. 1.The direct transcription Book-Film:In the film all the details that appear in the book appear also in the film 2.Great Roles Great Actors and Actresses:Elijah Wood is the perfect hobbit,Ian it´s the perfect Gandalf and Cate Blanchet Is supreme. 3 THE O.S.T.

10.0~Amazing Sebastian-20 Sign in Permalink For those of you who are still reading all the comments of Fellowship, I can tell you I was pretty astonished by the beautiful pictures of the landscapes and special effects. The actors and actresses are good and the music too! That's all I have to say, because everything has been mentioned at least a thousand times before.
10.0~My favorite movie of all time nunyabisnesss Sign in Permalink The one line summary explains it. This movie is just absolutely magnificent. My breath was taken away. The acting is perfect, special effects are perfect, what they added was perfect. This film is perfect! I have seen it 38 times. I can't wait to see the Two Towers this December. I hope it is as good or better than the Fellowship of the Ring.
9.0~Beautiful, if breathless, adaptation j30bell Sign in Permalink If you want to know how to do the impossible, watch Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring. When I was growing up, I thought no one could translate such a sweeping book onto the screen successfully, and yet the man who brought us Bad Taste has done it. Just so you know in advance, the film takes plenty of liberties with the story; no Old Forest, Bombadil, Barrow Wights or Glorfindel. No Wargs in the wilderness - and you have to wait until the third film to see Narsil re-forged. In fact if the film has a serious fault it is that so much of the story is cut, it could leave the audience breathlessly hurtled from one action sequence to another - dazed, and maybe (if you haven't read the book) even a bit confused. But what the film does so successfully is recreated the atmosphere of the story - rather impressive considering the film is shorn of much of the textual richness found in the book. As someone who has read LoTR more times than a man of sound judgement ever should, I found myself more engrossed in the story than I had been for years. The film gets its atmosphere from the scenery, the camera-work and some beautifully adept computer enhancement. In many cases the characterisation was also richer than the original - both Aragorn and Arwen are significantly more "human" than in the novel, as is Gandalf. Tolkien's heroes are often to perfect to be truly interesting - after all, in Mallory, it is no co-incidence that Galahad finds the Grail, but two thirds of the book is about Tristan and Lancelot. In Jackson's LoTR we see the human frailties of the characters; Aragorn's self doubt, Gandalf's fear, Elrond's unconcern (basically, "you deal with it Gandalf, I'm off on holiday with all the other elves"). This is not to say the film is without its flaws. Whoever decided that elves needed...tooo...speak ....sooo.....slowly clearly needs shooting - as does the guy who thought that a WWF-style wrestling match between Gandalf and Saruman was a good idea. Indeed there are a number of moments when a lighter directorial touch would have been better. Galadriel's demon-witch impression, for example, or Gandalf's power-vocalisation at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. Merry and Pippin have a rather disconcerting resemblance to Ant and Dec (all three films show an astonishing heightism, more of which later). Nevertheless, this film is an enormously impressive attempt do something I though next to impossible. At over three hours it was a long, but thoroughly enjoyable, action/fantasy film; it makes Star Wars looks like the kind of tenth-rate kiddie movie it is. And the best thing is, the special addition is even better. So not perfect, but 8/10 anyway
2.0~Every cliché in the book. Alex-Tsander Sign in Permalink I read "The Hobbit" in school. Even as a twelve year old I thought it was childish. Obviously I never read "Lord of The Rings". I have no problem with fantasy. As other posts of mine on this site show. The problem with this, book or film, however, is that it is accorded such status as implies it to be worthy of regard as in some sense a "serious" work of art. Concentrating here on the film, I found the whole enterprise grindingly y tedious and even quite objectionable. From the unending, detailed narration at the start onwards. As we jump to Hobbiton we are accosted by the jeepy-jerky lilt of the cliché movie-land "Oirish" folk music. Every moment of this struck me as a dreadful lie. I may not have read LOTR but I know some things about it's background. Tolkien used as his source paradigm for the "Shire" references to the culture of South-West England, particularly around Somerset. That is WHY it is called the flaming "Shire" ( like Wilt-shire, Hamp-shire, Gloucester-shire ) for Pete's sake. Where the hell does all this yip pity-yo line-dancing soundtrack come from? Not to mention the smattering of characters with ginger hair and American-Irish accents! It is as though the need was felt to accommodate the kind of American audience for whom bucolic innocence is only conceivable in terms of the Hollywood "Old-Country" of "The Quiet Man". These people are anyway nothing like Hobbits. They resemble regular Caucasians with pointy ears and a bit of hair on their nearly-normal sized feet. They are too clean. Hobbiton here positively gleams with newness. Cleaner than any place I have been to in the real world ( as I have not visited Switzerland ). Bilbo's palatial warren has the gleaming un-lived look of scenes in a furniture catalogue. No dust, no dirt and no wear or tear in sight. This is more the subterranean show-home of an environmentalist billionaire than the modest under-hill burrow of an impecunious hominid ground-hog that it is supposed to be. The music get's even worse. For one thing the repeated cheaply manipulative interjections of a few sentimental bars of Sibelius. For another the kind of dreadful fake-liturgical choristing that we associate with films such as "The Omen". This even employs an old, oh so VERY old B-movie technique of patterning lines of music to sound like lines of text. Most famously evident in Lon Chaney's "Werewolf" in which the orchestra sounds like it is saying "The were...wolf, the were...wolf, the were...wolf." Here it comes up to grating effect when the Black Riders appear and the fake Latin choir seems to sound like "The evil, it's here, the evil, it's here, the evil, it's here..." Clichés, clichés everywhere. Take the design of things, resembling as it does the kind of Celtic and Gothic clichés one sees in the work of tattoo parlours. These past twenty tears. Liv Tyler's pendant that she waffles on about at length in awed terms looks like something you would buy for a fiver in the high-street comic-shop. The architecture, festooned with ridiculously useless points and wings seems to come straight from the doodlings made by a bored schoolboy during Friday afternoon chemistry class. Then the over-blown battle scenes. If there are that many creatures willing to go to their death in Middle Earth, where the Hell are they the rest of the time? The place seems to be empty until a war starts when fifty million CGI battle-fodder suddenly show up to do service, from nowhere. As if by...magic. More grating, irritating features: Elisha Wood's perpetually perplexed look after a while really begins to irritate a part of my anatomy beginning with a "T". The "action" is mostly talk. The story positively d..rrrr..aa....g.g.g....sssss along. When something happens, it is usually more talk. However, the film is not simply tedious, boring and unimaginative. I find that it is positively distasteful. The story is presented as some kind of vehicle of wisdom and morality. But it is precisely there that it is at it's weakest. The world we are shown revolves around magic, but contains no religion. The creatures fret continually about spells and invisible forces, yet they appear to have no moral framework, no compass of ethics, no churches and no worship. Good and Evil are presented as self-evident, like day and night. The evil are ugly. Ugly people are evil. Is that wisdom? Questions of practise are reduced to arguments about tactics. Obviously the convention of "White Hat, Black Hat" is customary in the cinema. But usually presented only as escapist entertainment. Here it is implied that we should attach some significance to proceedings. Such significance being the very attitude that plagues politics in the U.S and Western Europe, where followers of one ideological camp see anyone who disagrees with them as self-evidently stupid, misguided, even, evil and worthy of death-threats. LOTR hit the big time in the Sixties as an unofficial "Green-Book" of Hippiedom. This is at the heart of it's vision, as here found in the film. In this story, only the bad-guys, the evil ones, use technology. We see this asserted in the patently industrious mien of their kingdom, all forges and furnaces and cauldrons brimming with production. Contrasted to the bucolic, literally airy-fairy aspect of the lands of the "good". In fact, that world of industry, having forged the Ring is implicitly asserted to be the very source of all that is evil in the world. This film proselytises for a Rousseaesque fantasy of pre-lapsarian innocence and moral virtue. An attitude that refuses to accept the harsh truth's of nature, renounces Humanity's tools of advancement and abrogates the harsh responsibilities that are necessary for survival. This is the very mind-set that is today, in the real world, threatening the survival of Western Industrialised Civilisation. The only civilisation with the leisure and free resources to indulge in such a fantasy.
10.0~One of the best I have seen. jazzdrive Sign in Permalink Great music. Great cinematography. And, of course, a great story that is timeless. When you see this movie, you'll just be wanting more.
10.0~I Loved the movie! Unclemoe77 Sign in Permalink Warning: Might contain spoilers. I loved the movie. I don't know why so many people didn't. I thought the acting was great as well as the plot. I read the book. The movie wasn't exactly like the book but if it had been that movie would have been way too long. It seemed a lot like the book and I think the book is great. Tom Bombadil was cut out of the movie and he was kind of important but again the movie is long enough as it is. My favorite character both in the movie and the book is Legolas. In the movie he is played by Orlando Bloom. Orlando Bloom acts just like Legolas does in the book. The other actors portray their characters very well. I think the movie is wonderful and I give it a perfect 10!
10.0~Now that's more like it. Acolyte-2 Sign in Permalink The summary above relates to Lord of the Rings, The (1978) which I detested. Peter Jackson did a superb job bringing Tolkien's Middle-earth to the screen. However, I think it's current high rating is seriously premature. This movie cannot stand on its own. Like the book, it's a single continuous narrative split into three parts for reasons of length. Any ending such as it has will not be seen until Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The (2003) arrives in theaters. Right now it's a work-in-progress. Evaluating it should wait until the entire story is finished. No one who has been a devotee of the book as long as I have can resist comparing the movie against it even though that's not really a valid thing to do across media. So here it goes below. There are POSSIBLE SPOILERS, although they're so highly contextual you probably won't understand them unless you've already seen the movie, so they shouldn't give away much. I don't think I give away any major plot points. What was done right: Rivendell was beatuiful. I used to want a castle someday; now I want the "Last Homely House" as Jackson showed it to me. Bree was very well done. Many probably disagree with me about this, but if there wasn't enough time to develop Butterbur as a character, Bree is best shown as a rough-and-tumble waymeet along a road traveled by a large number of highly questionable characters. This is very much like any place so situated would be. Hobbiton. Gorgeous. Casting, for the most part. An exception is noted below. Frodo really should have had brown eyes, but Elijah Wood did a *far* better job than I had anticipated, so it didn't matter. The Council of Elrond. Impossible to shoot as the book has it, but it provided a stark demonstration of the Ring's true power. A highly skillful adaptation. The Mirror of Galadriel. Perhaps the sfx were overdone at a crucial moment, but at least the deep moral import of her choice was preserved and that was the important thing. Hollywood usually glosses over moral issues, or at least the kind of moral issues important to someone like Tolkien. The Balrog. Very frightening and demonic of course, but there's something else. There's a running debate in Tolkien-related newsgroups and BBS as to whether or not it had wings, as Tolkien's own description is very ambiguous. Jackson succeeded in being just as ambiguous visually, thus pleasing (or displeasing) both camps equally. I nearly laughed out loud in the theater when I realized what he'd done. Having cut out all the other supporting characters to simplify the script, the method of Gandalf's rescue was perfectly in character. We see a brief shot of Minas Tirith. Beautiful. And anything else not mentioned below. What was done wrong: The time compression at the beginning. Seventeen years were supposed to have passed between the Party and Gandalf's revelation of the true nature of the Ring. Instead it looked like a year or two at most, and this introduces a plothole. Bilbo's sudden aging was attributed to his putting the Ring aside, but why wasn't Gollum, who'd possessed the Ring for centuries, similarly affected? Arwen's expanded role and Aragorn's mangled motivation. I thought Liv Ullman was just not up to this part. It was expanded at the expense of Aragorn's, Elrond's, and Gandalf's, and she would had to have been extraordinary to satisfy offended book fans. She wasn't. A line was given to Elrond that inexplicably removes a strong motivation for Aragorn to fulfill his heritage, whereas in the book it was a condition that he himself imposed before he would consent to their relationship. Since it would have enhanced both the romance and the adventure, why not leave it as it was? Moria. The entire complex was supposed to have been a thriving city in the past, so what's with the impossibly steep staircases and the unrailed bridges over yawning abysses? It couldn't possibly have functioned. Even populated by Dwarves they would have lost a dozen or so pedestrians a day, and it dilutes the effect of the *one* unrailed bridge over a yawning abyss (part of Moria's defenses) near the exit. Gimli. John Rhys-Davies has a wonderfully mobile face and a marvellous voice. Both were buried under so much latex and fake hair as to be useless. The actor was completely wasted here to the detriment of the character. Blond elves? Who says? Saruman's expanded role during the mountain crossing. The Fellowship was defeated by a malevolent nature spirit responding to Sauron's growing will, *not* a cranky wizard several hundred miles away acting at that moment for no reason we can perceive. Mostly, this is just the kind of nitpicky stuff a geek like me would pick up on. If you've never read the book, it won't bother you at all. No one who has not read the book who saw this movie that I asked even noticed, and all enjoyed it immensely. Go see it.
8.0~Technically brilliant movie triple8 Sign in Permalink I must admit of all the movies out there Lord of the rings was on my list of "don't go sees". The reason was simple. I had no interest in the lord of the rings(books) nor did I care to see a movie based on any of them. But a good friend of mine insisted that I go-and so amidst many a mumble and grumble on my part I acompanied this friend to the movie theatre silently gloating over how I would prove my friend wrong when I hated the movie as much as I envisioned. MY FRIEND HAD THE LAST LAUGH. I was wrong-way wrong on this one and will say right here that if someone with as little interest in the Lord of the Rings Saga as me could fall in love with a pic like this anyone can-and I do mean ANYONE-so SEE IT if you haven't! I'm not gonna get into reviewing plots or anything like that. Here is what I will say: Aside from the fact The movie is engaging, wonderfully written and acted etc etc, the people responsible for the technical visual aspects of Lord of the rings are geniuses. The visuals in this movie are technically amazing, breathtaking, and are so intricate you wonder how HUMAN BEINGS could actually put something like this together. At the very least even if you don't like the film(which is doubtful) your mouth will be hanging open at the sheer ARTISTRY of the film. I think Lord of the Rings is the type of movie that could inspire someone to start a career in movie making. Lastly, I will say one of my pet peeves is movies that run a long time and don't seem to end. Lord of the rings had a long running time which was one other worry of mine when viewing this movie. WELL-the time passes so quickly it barely feels like half the time has gone by. And during that time there are very few moments one will actually be bored. So all in all, I have to recomend Rings. Probebly most people reading this have seen it already but in case there's that one person who, like me is a skeptic, check the movie out. Because you DO NOT have to be a Lord of the Rings(book) longtime fan to REALLY enjoy this movie.
10.0~Embrace the power of the Ring... MaxBorg89 Sign in Permalink I've always loved fantasy and science-fiction novels, and I'm very grateful for that, since the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the reasons I fell in love with movies (the other reasons are Spider-Man, Casablanca, The Godfather and Pulp Fiction), it's so incredibly excellent. Some people refer to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as my generation's Star Wars (I was 12 when TFOTR was released), but I actually think it's better than Star Wars, and basically for one reason: the way director Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's beloved classic to the screen. Jackson has perfectly understood CGI is nothing but a tool that enables the filmmaker to tell stories more easily: while in Star Wars we see dozens of different worlds, which are visually stunning but appear for only a couple of minutes (or seconds), in LOTR everything we see is there to make sure the story goes on. Oh, another important thing too: in this movie, plot and character come first, the visuals are added later. The director takes his time to introduce the various inhabitants of Middle Earth and the chain of events that will change their lives forever. The movie is almost three hours long, so what? It's a story we really care about, and the characters make us feel for them every single moment: we cheer with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) when he learns he won't have to face his difficult task alone; we laugh with them when Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) make fools of themselves; we cry and worry with them when things start getting bad... That's probably also the reason for which this movie is superior to its sequels (N.B. I'm talking about the so-called "theatrical versions"): in parts 2 and 3, important moments of character development are ditched in favor of long, breathtaking battles, and the audience knows something's missing. That's not the case of The Fellowship of the Ring: the extended version is better, that's true, but the first movie is the one with the least deleted minutes, and therefore the one that feels less incomplete than the others. As I said before, Jackson values characters more than effects, and he uses the latter only to tell the story more successfully, so that the world where those people live will look more realistic on screen; now, since the characters are more important, the cast is a crucial element, and luckily the actors chosen for this movie are pure perfection: Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dom Monaghan and Billy Boyd are career-best as the four hobbits, the most vulnerable members of the Fellowship, therefore the ones we care about the most; Viggo Mortensen is 100% convincing as the conflicted, layered Aragorn; Ian McKellen gives Gandalf the Grey the warmth and wisdom he deserves, and finally, Christopher Lee is just THE only actor who could flawlessly play the Darth Vader-like good-turned-bad Saruman, proving once again he's the N°1 choice when it comes to casting someone as the really bad guy. Like Dracula, he has gloriously resurrected to spread horror another time. An amazing beginning for an even more amazing trilogy, perhaps the best I've ever had the pleasure to see. Should have won Best Picture of 2001 (as well as Director and Adapted Screenplay). One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them... well, you know the rest!
1.0~3 hours of exposition... actorguy2001 Sign in Permalink I voted "1" for this just to balance out the geek vote. This had to be one of the most boring movies ever. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. For the record, I thought The Two Towers was a much better movie, but neither deserve to be in the top 100...
9.0~Determination kevin142 Sign in Permalink Peaceful life in the Shire was broken by the ring with evil power. The Hobbit Frodo was forced to involve in the incident. When no one would accept the task to destroy the ring by throwing it into the volcano in Mordor, a little man stood up and said that I will do it. What an exciting moment. Although Frodo seemingly was weak, his determination was stronger than anyone else. In the other hand, maybe only his pure heart could resist the temptation of the ring. Even powerful Gandalf could not do it. So the huge task was given to the small Hobbit. However he was not alone. A nine-man-expedition formed. Their determination to protect Frodo from hurt and complete the task could not be overlooked. Even one of them was killed for that. In reality sometimes we are hesitating to make a decision. But once it is decided, you should do it firmly. No return, or gain nothing. It is the first film of TLOTR trilogy. A very good beginning that pushes you to watch the following one. 9/10
2.0~They're in trouble, they're out of trouble... Belakovska Sign in Permalink ... and so the film appears to continue in the same vein, repeating this pattern every half an hour or so. I am a pretty patient person - I don't need loads of action or constant surprises to keep me on the edge of my seat. However, I do appreciate a semblance of a storyline. I am told by friends that the reason I didn't enjoy this film was because i haven't read the book, but to me, this is simply not good enough as an explanation. Yes, we all know that this film is an adaptation of a famous book, but shouldn't the aim of the director then be to draw in new fans, as well as bring the book to life for those who have read the book?? I was so disappointed with this - I don't buy into hype, but I did expect a good bit of escapism with this film. Unfortunately, as already mentioned, I failed to find anything that could retain my attention. And, from a person who gets irritated if people so much as sneeze during films: I began a conversation with the person sitting next to me halfway through the film and continued to do so sporadically, whilst simultaneously checking the timer on the DVD player, wondering when my own ordeal would come to an end... I honestly cannot remember how this ends, so no chance of spoilers from me - suffice to say, it doesn't matter in my case, as I have no plans to watch the sequels.

10.0~The granddaddy of fantasy stories. antiwolf Sign in Permalink If elements of Lord of the Rings seem familiar to you, it is because other books and movies have borrowed heavily from LotR. To have covered every scrap of material from Fellowship of the Ring would have made it not 3 but probably about 9 hours long all by itself. Lord of the Rings is, without question, the book of the 20th century. If any novel of the 20th century is still read 500 years from now, it will be LotR. This was an excellent movie. It's a shame that when something comes along with actual depth it goes over some people's heads. It definately isn't "kid stuff".
1.0~A nightmare for a Tolkien fan who read the book in the '60s MichaelORourke Sign in Permalink I am assuredly in the minority when I state Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy is some of the worst film making I have ever seen. It would appear that he and his production team read the books, sort of, maybe 30 years ago; bought the Cliff notes, and from that wrote the screenplay. To illustrate my POV, I recommend listening to the superlative 13 hour radio adaptation produced by the BBC, recorded I believe in 1981. Jackson and crew erred when they depended too much on computer fx, and spent too much time on the spectacle of combat and war. I often thought I was watching a slasher movie. What makes the original Trilogy compelling are the relationships and the subtext characters carry with them from beginning to end. To be sure there are mythic battles, both large and small. But they come out of very carefully crafted relationships and a deep well of subtext. I don't quarrel with the New Zealand locations, I do quarrel with the dumpy looking sets that were haphazardly glossed over with computer grafx fixes. I don't quarrel with the casting except Frodo, and yet I found the direction so superficial, and often perplexing, if not simply muddled (Galadriel as an English Vamp?!). A clue to my dissatisfaction can be found in the omission of Tom Bombadil, the only character in the original not affected by the Ring. His eccentric wisdom and unexplained powers ground the plot because there is something, someone who is outside the Dark Lord's power. There is in the Tolkien universe a power unimaginable which Sauron cannot touch. And that is essential to the fabric which holds Middle Earth together. Which Tolkien in his craft and his wisdom knew he had to give expression to. And Jackson in his foolhardiness ignored. Why didn't Jackson's team follow the books with more trust? The master had already worked it out perfectly. Well, almost. The Trilogy wasn't long enough, which Tolkien realized after its completion. Nevertheless, the project would have been immensely improved had Jackson and his team laid out a six episode franchise to match the six books of the Trilogy, taken more time to film it in their excellent locations of choice, and above all, truly paid homage to its original creator by following his work faithfully. These films are a mish-mash which titillated the masses for a brief time. And that is tragic, because it will be long, long before someone will be able to do them justice.
6.0~Good beginning to a memorable trilogy Horst_In_Translation Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is the first of Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings"-trilogy and possibly my favorite from the three movies. After a sole writing nomination for one of his earlier works, Jackson started his big run with the Academy awards here back in 2002. The first hour was pretty great here. I thought the female narrator was a good introduction to the films and I also really enjoyed looking at all the juicy green from the Shire. And we should be glad the headless horseman did not manage to get little Frodo after 60 minutes as then the whole tale would have been over already. That Frodo seemed quite a survivalist anyway looking at the quantity of situations where he came out alive, almost like the Chosen One from "The Matrix". However, the actor who plays Agent Smith is one of the good ones here. They all seem to have a talent to stay away from death, even if they are getting in the most dangerous situations, like Gandalf falling deep down and becoming the White Gandalf. This applies also to many other characters who keep getting missed by Orc arrows by centimeters. Lucky bunch. Anyway, back to the story. This is obviously a fantasy drama, but it has its fair share of comedic moments as well. Most of these involve the two other Hobbits or pretty much every scene with Gimli the dwarf, for example when he asks to not be pulled on his beard. While we're at it, that nasty creature down there in the dwarfs' graveyard is truly disgusting. Most of the film is about the journey, though, the whole adventure when the group is still together. At the end, they split up. Frodo and Sam keep going to destroy the ring. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli try to free the other two hobbits. I can't say the film did not drag a single second during its 3.5 hours runtime (for me it mostly did during the fight sequences), but at least we get to watch beautiful landscapes and cinematography from start to finish. Also all the creatures included here are fairly special and memorable. One of my favorite scenes is when we see Frodo's grief and regret when Gandalf allegedly dies as Frodo was the one who wanted to take the Moria route and Gandalf did not. Another one I liked was the Elf marching scene early on when Sam says it makes him sad for some reason. It's almost like a special march of animals (penguins for example, or birds flying south). Two scenes I did not like that much were when we saw what the ring does to people. Bilbo and Galadriel look almost like horror movie creatures during their respective scenes and that is not a course the film takes at any other point. This film is all about Sauron's invisible danger and these two transformation scenes did not work in its favor. Nonetheless, Saruman felt more like the main antagonist in this film here, first of all of course because of his fight against Gandalf and then also because he pretty much commands the Orc army. During one scene he gives the order to kill all those who accompany the Hobbits. Then there is the usual components to this kind of movies, such as the enemy within the group, who (luckily to Frodo?) gets killed by the Orc army. Elijah Wood was one of the most promising young actors back then, so it was no surprise he got cast. The bigger surprise is possibly Sean Astin, who was not that well-known, but worked wonders during the whole trilogy and is possibly my favorite actor from the whole cast taking all three films together. Today he is possibly the epitome of the loyal friend in movie history. The movie ends with an Enya song (also Academy award nominated). She did the super successful song connected with the 9/11-tragedy some months earlier and her song here works very well too. Taking all components, together, this is a pretty good movie and a must-see for everybody with an interest in the fantasy genre.
10.0~Most Impressive Book-to-Movie Rendition Ever Seen Jerry Fletcher Sign in Permalink This movie was a tour de force of detail, and true to the book spirit. I have been a Tolkein fan for many years, and was anxious to see the on screen version. I was familiar with several of the leading actors that were to play in it, and was a little unsure of their ability to fill their characters properly- when i finally saw the movie (6 times in 4 different theatres over the course of three weeks) I was amazed at the transformation in each of the actors/actresses, especially Wood. I believe this Trilogy of masterpieces (though Tolkein would not have called it that- he saw the series as one whole book) will rise in popularity as the two following pictures are realeased, possibly even close to Star Wars levels....we'll see! But if you haven't seen this movie, please do yourself a favor and see it!!
10.0~addition to my summary PiperHalliwell Sign in Permalink hey all, it's me again. i just read the other comments. anyone who said this movie is unoriginal is out of it. unoriginal? tolkien was the best author of the century, and you're all right, he's the basis for sci-fi/fantasy. another thing i would like to point out is that this was one of the most original movies of the year. honestly! how many movies were made during world war 2 this year? how many were additions to a previous movie? you hail all of these and forget that tolkien discovered that and developed it first/ the movie is a masterpiece. think about it. all the digital people, all the stunts, all the fake ears and feet, filming on location, all the extras, all the costumes, all the props, this movie has a whole lot more to offer than "the phantom menace", in which the acting was horrible and the plot boring.
10.0~Epic fantasy literature becomes epic fantasy cinema zorn24601 Sign in Permalink I have never, in my whole life, been so impressed with a motion picture as I was with this masterful adaption of Tolkien's classic epic. The acting and direction are flawless, and the visualization of Middle-Earth is breathtaking. Every detail, from casting to scoring, was handled as if Tolkien himself was watching over the production. As far as I can tell, the movie's main critics are a) uptight Tolkien purists, and b) people who didn't like or haven't read Tolkien's work. The uptight critics say that Jackson left too much out, but the truth is that much of Tolkien's narrative is just too slow to be filmed well. I, for one, was glad to see the story tightened up a bit; I got a bit tired of those happy little Hobbits singing silly songs and falling ass-backwards into extraneous troubles every few pages. Also, Tolkien never actually described Lord Sauron in the novels; he left it to the reader's imagination what the Dark Lord looked like. That worked perfectly in print, but the cinema is a different medium altogether. The scene where Sauron the Great takes the battlefield is one of the most heart-stopping in the whole movie. If your idea of a good fantasy film is wall-to-wall swordplay with lots of scantily clad chicks in chainmail, this isn't the movie for you. If you think the genre of epic fantasy deserves better than Xena and D&D, if you like movies with an intelligent plot and story, if you think dialogue is more important to a fantasy film than the sound of swords clashing endlessly, then Peter Jackson's vision of the greatest heroic fantasy is for you. I give it 10/10.
10.0~A wonderful beginning which sparks a fantastic middle and perfect ending. SeminolePhenom Sign in Permalink A hobbit named Frodo (Elijah Wood) has been given the task of taking a powerful ancient ring to the fiery pits of Mount Doom, so it can be destroyed with the help of The Fellowship, which consists of Boromir (Sean Bean), Gimly (John Rhys- Davies), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) and three hobbits named Merry, Pippin, and Sam (Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, and Sean Astin). The ring once belonged to a powerful warrior named Sauron, who it wishes to return to, causing him to rise to power once again. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three Lord of the Rings films and sparks the journey that has intrigued millions of people. Peter Jackson does an excellent job explaining the background of the ring and the background of the characters as well as tying their pasts into the journey they all begin to take. Contradictions between the heroes and the enemies are frequently found throughout, making the film quite complicated, which I found to be one of Jackson's greatest success with character development. The most mind-blowing thing about the film though has nothing to do with the characters or story. It is Jackson's creation of Middle Earth that fascinated me more than anything. Jackson puts so much detail into the setting of every scene that the audience visualizes a whole different world without even thinking. Jackson's success at making the audience accept this different world and all of the different types of mythological creatures that live on it was really the key to making the films what they are. Overall, The Fellowship of the Ring is just an incredible beginning to the greatest trilogy ever put on film. Bravo Peter Jackson, Bravo. I highly recommend this film.
10.0~an eternal movie!!! daughterof_forest88 Sign in Permalink When i saw this film,i was 13 years old.Very small.I didn't like movies.I even thought that this movie would be boring.My mother wanted us to see it.She was right.We actually saw it in cinema 3 times!!!!!After 14 years this movie(along the two others of trilogy)is and will be my favorite.3 hours and still very interesting.It is not just a silly movie where good wins.It is a masterpiece.Everything was perfect from the beginning till the end.Enya was fantastic.Pity she didn't sing in the other soundtracks.Her voice was like an angel.Howard Shore also did a great job.The landscape was a paradise.(i must find the money to visit New Zealand definitely).Elijah Wood should have an Oscar .Not that the others didn't play well,but this movie is based on him.Sean Astin was a really good Sam.Ian Mc Kellen was an excellent Gandalf("You shall not pass.....)Viggo Mortensen was a very handsome,real Aragorn and in the right age .I wish more kings were like Aragorn .Christopher Lee who died recently also excellent.R.I.P Christopher.Every actor/actress,supporting actor/actress and even Orcs were acting as all of these were really.Contains SPOILER!!!!!!My favorite scene(of the trilogy) is when Eowyn kills the king of Angmar.I really like that a woman was so brave.(Tolkien was open-minded)Thank you all,and especially you Peter Jackson who made all of this .You will never be forgotten.You showed us that "there is some good in this world and it is worth fighting for."All people give battles ,maybe not like Frodo but every battle has pain and suffering .We much choose the hard way not the easy.And i close with another favorite line"May it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out"
10.0~A Beautiful WHAT???? cshark Sign in Permalink The "Academy" clearly missed the boat on this one. The Fellowship of the Ring is the BEST PICTURE of 2001 by far! There are so many great things to say about this film. The most finely crafted movie ever must be seen to be appreciated. SEE THIS FILM!
10.0~I was moved beyond belief! cuneglasus Sign in Permalink As a longtime Tolkien fan I waited for this movie with fear.I didnt think the books could be ported to film and was concerned that the text would not be respected.But Peter Jackson is a prince! He made what I consider one of the greatest movies of all time.He had to cut some things and alter others but the spirit of the book was more than respected.In many cases the emotional content was magnified to epic proportions.It is this emotion and the acting ability which brings it to us that makes this movie so special.Yes there are great special effects,beautiful scenery,and breathtaking sets but it is this Heart that sets FOTR above the rest.I have seen the movie 12 times so far and plan to see it much more now that it is the lower cost theatres.With the next two movies promising to be even better,it looks like a new film legend is born.
10.0~an amazing movie, great story and beauty str8dking Sign in Permalink the lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring is probably the most beautiful movie i have ever seen. Every scene is breathtaking, it is truly an amazing job jackson did. If you have ever read the lord of the rings or the hobbit, you know what i mean when i say its almost exactly what you would imagine middle earth to look like. Sure, they changed some things from the book, but i think they did a better job than most movies taken from novels. I wouldn't say that this was as good of a "film" as the usual suspects, fight club, or the shawshank redemption, but it was probably the best "movie" i have ever had the pleasure of viewing.
10.0~AWESOOMMEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! nifabs Sign in Permalink This movie and Harry Potter were showing at my local cinema on the same night.I had been bamboozled by my nieces and nephew to see HP, however my friend dragged seven of us(whining and muttering about the cost) to see LOTR instead and I came away thanking my stars. The movie blew us away, what scenery, what acting! what effects. The effects were so real. Sean Bean's Boromir was tragically human, his change of heart or reversal to sanity(?) in the end when he dies defending Frodo and re-affirming his respect for Aragon is poignant. Mortensen's Aragon is a case in point but his humility is understandable in the light of history. The other characters are rivetting especially Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett. But I give cred to Elijah Wood for an outstanding performance. His Frodo Baggins is strong enough to survive, human enough to stumble and lose his way time and time again, weak enough to draw on our sympathy but brave enough to keep moving realising his mission is the ultimate goal. The characters do it for me in this classic adventure fest!!! 10/10
10.0~WOW heatherfrancesstanton Sign in Permalink Absaloutly amazing. One of those rare films that has style AND substance, visually took my breath away. It's another rarity for me to find a film that makes me laugh and almost cry in two seperate moments but this did. All the actors were superb, I particularly liked all of the actors in the Fellowship who gelled together well too. All round amazing, I loved it! Three great quotes- "It's not up to us how much time we get, but how we use it" (I think) from Gandalf, "Nobody tosses a dwarf!" and "Let's go hunt some Ork!"- really great, the last two will bring a smile to my face guaranteed! Well adapted too, and did the book justice. If this film does not take the Best Picture Oscar I will never have faith in the Academy Awards again.
9.0~Brilliantly brought to the silver screen. A must see. tnzk Sign in Permalink The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the greatest films of modern times, and definitely should not be missed. Peter Jackson proved with this movie that he was not just a "splatter director" that couldn't handle such an epic project. In fact, he showed the world that he was the ONLY one who could handle it. Tolkien's first chapter, the Fellowship of the Ring, has young Frodo Baggins being entrusted to take the Ring to Rivendell. At Rivendell, he is called upon to take the Ring to the heart of Mordor, to destroy it, taking with him a group of comrades who shall aid him on his journey. Along the way are Orcs, dangerous creatures and the harsh natural environment; a perilous journey for any intelligent being. Tolkien's story is regarded as one of the finest pieces of fictional literature. So how does Peter Jackson's adaption fare? Everything is superb. The cast truly take on the role of their characters, and you couldn't imagine anyone else playing their parts (three cheers for not casting Sean Connery!). In fact, when you watch the movie, you don't see actors: you see the characters on their fateful journey to destroy the One Ring. Very few movies can do such a thing. The script is nothing short of masterful, that Tolkien should be proud. Fran Walsh, Phillipa Boyens and Peter Jackson have done a marvelous adaptation. Be it comical, sincere, or depressing, all the emotions Tolkien had weaved into "Fellowship" are here in full force. It is wonderful that the actors bring these emotions forward well. Visually, "Fellowship" shines like no other before it. Weta bring all the special and computer effects to life, rivaling even Industrial Light and Magic and Digital Domain. It is a shame that Peter Jackson didn't win Best Director from the Oscars for this, because this film is more memorable than whatever film won that back in 2002. From the sets of Hobbiton to Rivendell, each and every one is believable. The Dwarven Moria is dark, ancient and worn, whilst the Elvish haven of Lothlorien looks timeless and pristine. Kudos to Alan Lee and John Howe for conceptualizing and bringing to life what Tolkien only described. Howard Shore has done an amazing job on the musical score. His work on all three films could easily rival that of John William's Star Wars. An orchestra plays softly over sentimental moments, whilst the choir chants over big battle sequences; Shore has everything covered. Action junkies won't find much luck here: Although the action pieces in this film have never been on a scale like this before, they are few and far between. But the fight scenes that are there are nothing short of fabulous. The only gripe one could have against this film is that it clocks in at 3 hours: the extended edition being 20 minutes or so longer. Unless you have a very short attention span, you won't even mind it being this long, because every shot is just as intriguing as the previous one. Easily a must see and definitely a defining epic of our time. 10/10
8.0~Good story that won't confuse. Well done and appealing to anyone seeking fantasy and action. CinematicInceptions Sign in Permalink This movie is a classic, even though it is not much more than a decade old. The story is already a classic, which is probably why this, the first of the trilogy, was so much more successful than most other films in its position. Another reason why it probably got a lot of attention and success was because of the visual effects breakthrough marked by this movie. Having seen it in for the first time in 2010, I must say that the effects were as good as anything else I had seen at that point. In short, the CGI of the movie did nothing to impact my great appreciation and liking for this series. The story, as stated before, is a classic and will be admired for centuries to come, however, as with most classic books, Tolkein's style has lost its original appeal with the changing tastes of the literary audience. I think it is a great relief to most fans that the theatrical production of the books has the same spirit and some of the same style that Tolkien put into it, but also has modern touches that make it a best of both worlds, because honestly, I find the text's descriptions of the epic battle scenes to be rather dull when they are actually amazing. Neither style seems to interfere with the others, and the movies are widely regarded as masterpieces equal to the books. Unfortunately, the new Hobbit movies do not have that same balance, though they are still well done and successful thus far. As to the execution, there aren't many flaws. Howard Shore's score fits the mood perfectly with songs creating feelings of suspense, adventure, menace, and tranquility. Of course, the effects are as good as they get even by today's standards. The cinematography has a distinct style not found anywhere else, but flows well in the various series of shots. The script keeps the dignity of Tolkien's original text, but is briefer than the book, as it should be. I find the acting to be satisfactory, though Ian Holm doesn't always make the best transitions from the cheerful Bilbo to the slightly possessed Bilbo. Every character is given a moment of heroism, if not in the first movie, then in one of the other two. The character that is most impressive in this regard is Boromir. He is only included in the plot for about an hour and a half, which isn't that long considering that he is a supporting role and only has a brief introduction. His character is developed naturally but distinctively in very few scenes. Nothing he does at the end is at all incongruent with what we have seen up to that point. The same can be said of Sauroman, though his villainy is easier to get across with his fight scene with Gandalf and his incredibly menacing voice that pronounces all of the strange names of Middle Earth perfectly. I personally wan't thrilled with Elijah Woods performance, but it wasn't really bad. The same could be easily said about any of the main actors. There is no actor whose performance stands out on either end of the spectrum. Finally, I will address the action. It is primarily an adventure film. There is a pretty well spread amount of action scenes throughout, but most of the ones from the first half are flashbacks, so they don't have the same effect as the ones that come later. Still, it is all well choreographed and lives up to the PG-13 certification of "epic battle sequences", with the emphasis on epic. To close, I would recommend the movie to anyone who likes fantasy action or The Lord of the Rings books. It is very serious, so don't watch it with a big group unless that group is interested in the movie instead of socializing. The elephant in the room is that the movie is extremely long, so if you refuse to dedicate three hours in any variations of division to one movie, watch the cartoon version. Overall Rating: 9.5/10
6.0~Tiresome computer game lbk Sign in Permalink This film moves nothing. It's Hollywood humdrum done hundreds of times before. A little more computer graphics in this one - and so!?? You get every cliché not one time, not two times but 200 times. What a bargain! Why do I feel the action scenes are trite and tiresome? You have the big strong fearless bad guys coming in by the dozens and they are slaughtered like swatting flies. When they finally get one of our heroes, he doesn't even have the grace of dying in an orderly fashion. He takes blow after blow still standing and then linger on in I don't know how many last words and tear-jerking remarks. Yawn!! Heroes everywhere, please have the courtesy of dying before the audience is killed from boredom. The plot is easy: heroes enter new game level, kill all bogies, heroes enter new game level, kill all bogies (repeat and count for yourselves during 3 hours). This is a glorified computer game, jump-kill, jump-kill, kick-kill, jump-kill ... ad nauseam. And the romance, oh we musn't forget the romance must we? Vision the clever producer with a bit cigar leaning back in the chair getting the original brilliant idea: "we gotta have a broad in there, she gotta look gorgeous but what's she gonna do? Ahh, hell, doesn't matter ..." And when you have heard the characters "I-do-declare" for half an hour that's enough. The rest is tiresome. In another environment the acting would have been deemed hammy. Why this film is cried out to be the masterpiece of the human history I just can't figure out.
10.0~Jackson is a genius! beveraldo Sign in Permalink An awesome book made into an even more awesome film! This is legend! Sir Ian McKellen is awesome as are all the cast. Peter Jackson gave an indication of what he was capable with the 'Frighteners' & he really has stepped up to the plate & spanked a 'Home Run' right out of the ball park with this one! My anticipation of the 2nd & 3rd installments is almost unbearable!
10.0~An Amazing Achievement Fayaz_zulfikar_meghani Sign in Permalink 'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books, I have read it several times, and remember thinking the last time, about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this, but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment. This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, and Sean Bean's Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, 'no, that's not right', however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it. I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision. However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in "The Matrix"), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can't fault an action film for being an action film. This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success. Check for other user comments.
10.0~The greatest film ever made in all history!! andyking26 Sign in Permalink Right then. I have to comment on this film. I am 21. I am single, so I am free to do anything I want. I love films. In fact not even 48 hours ago I went and undergone 135 minutes of torture watching Cameron Crowe's new film Vanilla Sky starring Tom Cruise. Anybody reading this it is the worst film EVER!! (I mean Vanilla Sky not Lord of the Rings). Right then. Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring is by far in the history of cinema the greatest film EVER!! There you have it. The acting, the action, the screenplay, the directing, the score, the actors, everything about this film is simply outstanding. I am going as far to say that I hope and pray that this years oscars are dominated by this film and in honesty it should (and I hope) pick up a historic record breaking 13 academy awards. This film is a must see on a epic scale.
10.0~The greatest epic so far produced and it's only the 1st of 3 dshand_316 Sign in Permalink I have been a fan of these books for many years and have read them on numerous occasions. So i was thrilled when the movie finally made it to the big screen. I went to see it at the theatre with an open mind and the understanding that that i was not to be disappointed by it as i knew it would be near impossible to take this book and make it into a good movie. Well was i blown away. The three hours flew by and left my mind abuzz with excitement. The quality of the detail in every scene was just amazing. Truly the most fantastic movie ride i have experienced. (A little disappointed in the added seens between Aragorn and Arwen, but we shall see maybe it will add more to the overall story?) I have seen it several more times at the movies as well as on DVD and i still find it a great ride. I recently watched the extended version. I thought you could not make this movie any better.Well i was wrong. For the true LOTR connoiseur this is the only only way to take it. The added seens just add more context to the movie and make it feel whole.There where always a few gaps in the original but as a knowledgable viewer i was able to see past them and fill the holes myself. I'm off to see The Two Towers tonight. I know i will not be disappointed. Cheers from NZ.
10.0~You Shall be the Fellowship of the Ring - 16 Years Ago I entered a Magical World that had me hooked and enhanced ever since a-games-136-715468 Sign in Permalink 16 Years ago when I was 9, I bought a VHS of Fellowship of the Ring and as soon as I watched it, I was enhanced with the world, the characters, creatures and visuals and my mind was blown - I had not seen a film like this. The movie is more than sheer brilliance - its phenomenal and undeniably passionate movie-making on a flawless scale - from the unforgettable and fantastic acting from a brilliant ensemble to the splendid writing that develops the character, kick- starts a great story with thought-provoking themes and builds a glorious fantasy world to the intense and impressive action set pieces. Based on the book with the same name and set in the world of Middle- Earth, The Fellowship of the Ring sees young hobbit Frodo Baggins inherit a magical ring from his uncle, Bilbo, that is revealed to have been created by the Dark Lord Sauron, who was destroyed during a battle with the forces of Men and Elves. If Sauron regains the ring, he can regain physical form and bring destruction to Middle- Earth. As Sauron's forces desperately seek the ring across the land, Frodo and a group of eight companions - comprising of the wise wizard Gandalf, mysterious ranger Aragorn, Frodo's loyal companion (and love interest) Sam, Frodo's mischievous cousins Merry and Pippin, elf prince Legolas, fearsome dwarf Gimli and the troubled, but heroic warrior Boromir - set out from Rivendell to the fires of Mount Doom where the ring can only be destroyed. So where can I start? The film perfectly captures Tolkien's world from the books by using beautiful sets and using New Zealand landscapes to visualise it, backed up by fantastic performances from the entire cast (including the creatures), the use of brilliant CGI with prosthetics & practical effects and big-atures, an intriguing script to bring a monumental story to life and the unforgettable action scenes (intense and thrilling fight in Balin's Tomb, Gandalf's stand against the Balrog, the prologue with Sauron as a bad-ass and the heart- poundingly stirring fight at Amon Hen). The film, like its successors, is epic in every way - from cinematography to costumes to its music score to its flawless directing - setting the standard from filmmaking and being the most revolutionary films in the fantasy genre. Even though The Two Towers is the best installment (and my preferred favourite) in the Rings Trilogy, I'll admit that Fellowship is the most flawless in the trilogy. Overall, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an undeniably outstanding achievement in cinema and a fantastic start to the greatest trilogy of all time and all three films are utterly phenomenal. Pros: The script & story, the cast & characters, flawless direction, action scenes, beautiful cinematography, Howard Shore's stirring score, practical effects/prosthetics with great CGI, the use of on- location and Boromir's death is the most emotional (and possibly the best) death in the entire trilogy Cons: Frodo is a bit stiff in a few scenes, I didn't care for how the characters make Boromir look untrustworthy when he's a deeply troubled individual, Galadriel and Arwen could have been more developed as characters and Sam crying out for Frodo in the cornfield is the most cringiest moment in the entire LOTR trilogy
10.0~Star rating: 5 out of 5 jennifer_litchfield Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring, is triumphant proof that despite frequent evidence to the contrary, it is possible to adapt excellent books into equally excellent films. Of course, at the heart of any good film is a good story, and this is provided par excellence by J. R. R. Tolkien. In a time before recorded history, the peaceful inhabitants of Middle-earth are threatened by the reappearance of a long-lost ring, in which resides the life force of the evil Dark Lord Sauron. Seemingly by chance the ring comes to young hobbit Frodo Baggins who must destroy it by throwing it back into the fires from whence it was forged. In his quest he is joined by a wizard, two men, a dwarf, an elf and three hobbits - representatives of the free people of Middle-earth - whom together form the titular fellowship. This film is monumental in scale, but it is director Peter Jackson's attention to detail and the all-important (and sadly oft-forgotten) humanity involved that really makes it a masterpiece. Although the black faceless ringwraiths, the orc and goblin hordes, and the claustrophobic darkness of the mines of Moria are certainly frightening, the moment when the viewer truly realises the insidious evil of the ring is when kindly bumbling Uncle Bilbo Baggins becomes (for a split second only) a raving demon in its presence. The outstanding cast has made it easy to become involved with the characters and the computer graphics wizardry of Isengard and Rivendell, et. al., is astonishing and almost seamless. Ultimately, any film which, after almost three hours, can leave a viewer exclaiming "No! It can't end there! I want to see what happens next!" is well worth watching. Roll on the sequel!
10.0~Even my daughters love Fellowship whitmoremike1 Sign in Permalink So, I have 7 kids. My oldest, 18 & 15, boys, read the trilogy. So did I as a teen. The 3 of us enjoy late night discussions about all sorts compelling topics of our own creation. We loved watching Fellowship and have watched the DVD several times. My 2 older daughters, 12 & 10, to my surprise, have absorbed much of our enthusiasm for the trilogy. They've watched the movie and quote lines from it. I encourage creative thinking in our home. LOTR is fantasy. I feel some sympathy for folks you can't suspend reality for 3 hours. I suppose it's as much human to be critical as it is human to be imaginative. Still, I prefer the companionship of the kind and creative to the company of the mean and critical.
10.0~Does justice to Tolkien's vision Snotra Sign in Permalink I really do think this film does justice to Tolkien's vision and for any LOtR-fan it's great that there finally is a real movie, with proper actors and a budget! The settings are gorgeous - anyone else want to move to the Shire, or to Rivendell? Most of the actors do a great job and there really isn't very much not to like about the film. There are one or two novel-film discrepancies that bother me a little, but I won't go in to them, so as not to spoil anyone's fun...
10.0~Excellent action movie jbt136 Sign in Permalink This movie is a very well done action movie. The visual effects are stunning and the acting is superb. I can find nothing wrong with it except for a few parts that dont quite fit with the book, but that is to be expected with a book like Lord of the Rings.
10.0~couldn't be better.... dprb23 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite books of all time. Tolkien is a genius and created this fantasy world beyond imagination. Peter Jackson steps to the plate and directs a movie that will be criticized regardless of how good it is. I was never more excited to see a movie than The Fellowship of the Ring. I was going to see one of my favorite books on the big screen. I was overjoyed but I still knew it couldn't match the personal vision I had in my head from the book. After viewing, I couldn't have been any happier. Peter Jackson well exceeded my expectations and needs to be commemorated. The scenes amazingly matched my personal vision from the book. Was it Tolkien's story on screen? Not completely. Could it have been better? No way in hell. I'm sorry it didn't have Tom Bombadil and singing hobbits that would negatively impact the movie. Critics and Tolkien fans who speak negatively towards the movie need to quiet down because Peter Jackson gave you a mighty treat that no one would probably dare. The Fellowhip of the Ring easily deserved the Best Picture award but it got screwed because it's a trilogy. The Academy should be slapped for giving it to "A Beautiful Mind." It wasn't that beautiful. Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Ian McKellan) belonged to the Fellowship. Maybe the Academy will be nice and give the LOTR's their respect after the third movie. In the meantime, I can't wait for the Two Towers. Tolkien fans, thank Peter Jackson. 4 out of 4. No questions asked.
4.0~oh my pbarrrgh8617 Sign in Permalink lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring, was one of the most entertaining movies of 2001. it was also highly overhyped. this was a very enjoyable movie, and a very good action movie. of course, being a good action movie, means that it is permissible to overlook mediocre acting, wooden dialogue, stereotyped characters, terrible corny humor, and excessive and sometimes (oftentimes) phony CGI. first, the acting. i have seen people on this board actually suggest that people such as elijah wood, viggo mortenson, and orlando bloom should be nominated for oscars! now, i will grant that the oscars in no way reward the best performances of the year, but that would be carrying things just a bit too far. of course, it might not be the actors' fault, it could be... the dialogue. i fail to understand why seemingly all "epic" films, and fellowship of the ring is no exception, have dialogue that is apparently meant to seem completely contrived. almost every line feels as though the characters speaking it has put about ten minutes of thought into it, and this is while running from monsters and creepy-crawlies! then there are the characters themselves. we have frodo, the humble little guy that everyone roots for. gandalf, the grizzled, wise sage. aragorn, the pragmatic and skilled leader. legolas, the stoic and noble silent one. and boromir, the greedy, unlikeable human. merry and pippin, the goofball, comic relief. the list could go on to include almost every character in the movie, but this review is getting long as it is. i believe even fans of the movie will concede that much of the attempted humor is corny and often unbearable (especially the dwarf). if you have seen it, you know what i mean; if not, be glad that you have been spared. and finally what i found to be the biggest flaw: the CGI. there is just far too much! granted that it some instances it was used with splendid effect, and in these cases, i am all for it. however, just to throw out an example off the top of my head, in the scene in moria, there is no need to have various people jumping on the cave troll's back. it just looks fake! it is entirely unnecessary! what is it doing on my screen? much of the CGI could and should have been cut out. it detracts from the movie as its overall effect is to give a very impersonal feel to what should be a personal and moving story. well that about sums this rant up, so i will leave you with the following advice: if you are in the mood for a solid action/adventure movie, then fellowship of the ring is for you. but, on the other hand, if you have unwisely chosen to accept the opinion of the lord of the ring freaks on this board that this is a quality film and even one of the top 5 of 2001, then you will be sorely disappointed.
10.0~Beautiful,Superb,Amazing,Masterpiece gerrymcd Sign in Permalink A lot was said about this film and its all true. Although the above comments about about the ending are stupid. As there is no ending as the ending sets the story up for the next Film the 2 Towers, as in the book. The scenery is superb, New Zealand is seems a beautiful place just as ireland is. Its amazing to take the book and to do it justice on screen, which is what has been done. Although if you like Action movies then this is not for you. As your only gonna moan about how long it is. But if you like Movies then its well worth the look. im now reading the nexk book the 'The 2 Towers' so as i can understand the film better when its realised in December. I hope the DVD set in november will give more insight into the film than the August Version which documentries arnt too good. An extra 30 minutes will be very interesting as its already quite a long film but i will defenitely buy it. This Film is beautiful and it can only get better. A Masterpiece of Film Making.
10.0~An incredible success for Peter Jackson jmo154 Sign in Permalink I previously saw many of Peter Jackson's movie and I will say that I was extremely apprehensive about him taking on this project. The maker of Dead Alive couldn't possibly bring this masterpiece to the screen. I'll admit I was wrong. Now I could go on for a looong review, but it's not necessary. There was not a single thing wrong with this movie. Brilliant casting, acting, music. . . but most of all: This movie was the most visually dynamic movie I have ever seen... period. Crouching Tiger, The matrix, and all of the Coen brothers movies previously held that title, but Lord of the Rings edged them all. Even if you don't like the books or even fantasy stories in general, if you like the pure images that movies deliver, see this movie NOW.
10.0~Stupendous! HumanoidOfFlesh Sign in Permalink I've never been a fan of fantasy(not read Tolkien's books),but Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring" totally blew me away!This masterpiece is simply amazing!Everything here is excellent:the acting,the sets,the special effects by Richard Taylor etc.The film was shot in New Zealand for example in Matamata(Hobbiton),Kaitoke Regional Park(Rivendell),Glenorchy(Lothlorien)etc.My favourite characters are:Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen),Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood),Galadriel(Cate Blanchett)and Boromir(Sean Bean).The film is full of incredibly beautiful images(the Dark Riders galloping on their horses etc.),some scenes like a fight with a huge Troll in Moria are literally unbelievable.I still can't believe that Peter Jackson,who was responsible for such excellent(and extremely gory-I might add!)horror movies like "Bad Taste"(1987)and "Braindead"(1992)created this masterpiece.I only hope he'll return to his splatter origins.10 out of 10-what else?I am waiting impatiently to see the following two parts.
10.0~God bless you yadgarrwandz Sign in Permalink This movie talk about what human can do if we want getting it. Darkness not cover our eyes if we start fire candle. But when we lose Faith and hope we lose our life. Let's do the best for our generation. Gandalf try to do impossible by hobbit he showed us everyone can do the best for people. But why we try kill each other if we have another choice? Why not trying to love each other when we can? Human started war at the beginning for getting what he needs, but now we not see it. Godbless everyone.
3.0~Action movie yes, a classic ? not in my life Other_side Sign in Permalink The hype surrounding this film is unbeliveable, everyone who eighter has seen it or just read about it in internet rushes to proclaim that it is the best movie ever. Still the movie is flawed beyond belief, the spirit of the books has been completely forgotten emphasis is given to action and thriller sequences. So you keep telling me the movie is almost or completely flawless, let me point out some "minor" errors. First in the story, book vs. movie starting from the beginning Frodo did not read a book in the tree, Frodo didn't ride Gandalfs wagon, Gandalf didn't bump his head in Bag End, Rosie was not a barmaid, there was a tent Bilbo's birthday, Merry and Pippin didn't make pranks, Gandalf provided some effects at Bilbos dissapearance, Bilbo didn't drop the ring, Farmer Maggot grew mushrooms not carrots, etc etc etc, I could make this list a couple of pages long, while some "alterations" are of no importance some drastic things are also changed eg. the fight between Gandalf & Saruman, Strider carries another sword than narsil, Strider just happens to carry suitable magic swords for hobbits, Boromir holds ring at caradhras, Aragorn battles orcs at Amon Hen, Frodo talks to Aragorn about parting the fellowship ... I mean the timeline is completely lost, all possible is done to make action more intense, there are orcs that climb the walls of moria like spiders............ And you dare call this faithful ? not by a long shot, sorry. The fight scenes are awful, they look like something from the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with the ill timed zooms & slow motion... Those pepole who call this the best movie ever, or even of the year are yet to see a good movie then, or are at their early teens. It is a quite nice action / adventure yes, but it is also just a popcorn movie that has taken a brilliant story and turned and twisted it untill it's almost pure action, no character developement and most of all no spirit, nothing that would make think about anything, nothing that would change your views of the world, it's just a action movie, nothing more, nothing less. I am so dissapointed
10.0~Best movie EVER! frodo3005baggins Sign in Permalink SPOILER WARNING!!! Is there a better movie in the galaxy? THINKING...THINKING.... No I don't think so!!! Thank you Peter Jackson for turning a classic trilogy of books into a soon-to-be classic trilogy of movies. I just hope the next movie will be better than this, and the third better than the second. The cast was superbly chosen. Infinite times better than Harry Potter. Great stuff. And you should try watching the movie with surround sound. But you won't need that to feel part of the adventure or the Fellowship's pain after Gandalf falls into the shadow of Moria. All in all SEE THE MOVIE! and if you've already seen it see it again! and again and again!
10.0~A Masterpiece aerie01 Sign in Permalink What more is there to say about Fellowship of the Ring that hasn't already been said? To tell the truth, it is my favorite of the trilogy, because of the incredible sets and scenery, the loving attention to detail, the emotional arc, from lighthearted to peril, which perfectly sets up the other two films, and the gorgeous, saturated colors. But FOTR will always be first and best because of the amount of time it spends letting us get to know our hero, Frodo Baggins, played by the supremely talented Elijah Wood. Was there ever a more beautiful young man on the screen??? And Elijah weaves magic here in every one of his scenes. Whether he's laughing and having a good time, as he is at the beginning, or realizing that his comfortable world is about to drastically change, or reacting to danger, his facility with his expressions and emotions is beyond compare. Never have I ever seen another actor who can command the swift and subtle shifts that he is called upon to perform as Frodo. Sublime. Peerless. Superb. Bravo, Elijah. I hope you continue to thrill us for many years to come.
10.0~What a film! mhalvorson Sign in Permalink What a film! No doubt about it. If you've read the books you are at an advantage (unless you consider them some sort of holy relic and can't get past that to actually enjoy the film for itself). I think knowing the characters and story pretty intimately allows you to effectively "fill in the blanks" where the films let you down in terms of taking the time to flesh out characters and relationships or where it jumps from one set piece to the next. Having said that I went with someone sho has never read a fantasy book let alone LOTR and she loved it. Go figure. I thought it was as good as anything I've seen in a long time, but it is virtually impossible for those who loved the books to review the film as a stand alone piece. ****MINOR SPOILERS**** Viggo M was perfect. Ian M was pretty damn good too but Sean Bean was my pick. It's a good story that can make you cry over a character that failed the test and betrayed the fellowship. I think it mostly hit the mark in terms of what to edit from Tolkien's work. Let's face it, Bombadil was a side trip. Glorifindel was irrelevant. Thank God they cut the songs. The only aspect that annoyed me was the over-the-top portrayal of Galadriel, leaving her a much less sympathetic character. She is not the wicked witch of the west! But it's a minor point. As a whole I sat transfixed for three hours and then snuck back again a few days later. After a month I'm still getting shivers thinking of it (YOU SHALL NOT PASS - great in the book, just as good on film). The cinematography, special effects, etc was all superb. The fight scenes were very jumpy so the detail were hard to capture ... but that sounds to me like what it must be like in a battle. I suppose a comment re greatest of all time is in order since it has polarised opinion so much ... Who cares? Noone will ever convince anyone else to have the same opinion as themselves so give it up. How can you compare a fantasy three film epic to a prison drama (Shawshank Redemption) or a mafia film (Godfather) or anything else? 9 for me and can't wait for The Two Towers.
2.0~After an hour and a half I though 3 hours had passed mel_romyn Sign in Permalink If someone is into effect and cinematography only - then they would probably enjoy this. I had never read the book (if I had I may feel differently). There wasn't much to this movie in terms of plot, dialogue or entertainment. The best parts where in the previews. The mountains, the trees - over and over - people staring all the time. Just boring, boring, borning. Truly the great cast and effect were the only reason I sat through it.
1.0~Longest torture ever! medicinestudent Sign in Permalink Longest torture ever possible! I have hated many movies before but this one i have to use superlatives because it was long as well as bad. I have read Tolkien's The Hobbit, and i will accept that i am not big fan of such fantasy concepts yet i liked the way he wrote the book and after hearing such big things about this movie was really eager to see it. But what a royal wastage of time!!! What could have been a real good movie has been treated so slow, so insanely that i can't believe people actually went to theaters to watch the second movie. I mean isn't it like first movie is what makes the sequels work, here the first movie is so bad that i can't figure out how did the others work? And how can someone kill the army of dark forces by just hitting stones at them? How can someone have so many arrows without ending them up? What was the scene where the Hobbit drops some stuff into the well supposed to convey? So many questions unanswered? Its not only these points that make me feel bad for the movie, there are numerous others, its just that these are the only ones i can remember now. Never knew it would be so bad. Sorry if i am hurting many people, but really i am still trying to figure out how could people like it and rate it so high. No way Jose from my side.
10.0~The greatest fantasy film of all-time Geeky Randy Sign in Permalink An absolutely gorgeous adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum—while TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe—the movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath. The greatest fantasy film of all-time. **** (out of four)
10.0~Real men mrbisco Sign in Permalink I think this should top the Top 250 Movies list. Some things that stand out to me: (I do realize this is based on the book and is true to the book, for the most part, but it is still a movie) There is no mention of God or any sort of God. This is wonderfully refreshing. The men all display real emotions and real feelings. They treat each other humanely. This is a far cry from modern day America. Everyone who worked on the film put their heart and soul into it and the movie shines with that effort. This movie just exudes love. This is a movie of hope. There are such great quotes to ponder and maybe apply to your life. Frodo: I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. Gandalf: So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. :D
10.0~Really excellent kfg30 Sign in Permalink There is little praise that I can give to this film that has not already been said by others but it truly is one of the best fantasy films to date and a very good movie as well. Unlike some others I do not feel that you must have read the book in order to understand the film, I saw it with five others of which three had not read the book and everyone liked the film. Another common mistake is the "no ending" complaint, the Lord of the Rings is not really a trilogy of novels but rather one book that was cut up in three parts by the publisher as they felt that one 1000+ pages book was too long. There are no real "endings" in the first and second books because Tolkien wrote it as one book. So this film is essentially one third of the story and as such there can not be an true ending until the third film. In closing this is a great film and one that grows with repeated viewings and I look forward to the next films. Charles
10.0~Amazing!! sugarbot Sign in Permalink This is truly the greatest movie of all time! No other movie will win me over like this one has. The acting, sound effects, special effects, make-up, etc. were all wonderful. They did really good by not putting some REALLY famous actors/actresses in there to make people go see it, it was good enough on its own. The actors they did choose were excellent! My favorites were Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom. I am thrilled that it is nominated for 13 awards and wish it were nominated for more! I saw couldn't get enough of this movie, I ended up seeing it five times, that is before it was taken of the theater. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, it truly is the best, most brilliant movie ever. Those who haven't seen it really should, you won't regret it. I can't wait to see the next two movie sequels, they will only make the whole movie better. As for those who totally don't the movie, I can only say one thing. I read in a newspaper article that tests show that those who disliked the movie had a lower I.Q. than those who liked it. What else is there to say? Besides Lord of the Rings RULES! and hurry up with the next movie!
10.0~One of the best films ZodiacSix1 Sign in Permalink After reading the books and seeing the movie i would have to say the movie is great and it does a good job (within the 3 hours) to cover most of the book. So parts i would have likes to see but it is Peter Jackson's version of this great story.
10.0~A brilliant film. eirtaenabaree Sign in Permalink It is a wonderful film, that truly gives justice to the books. Some of my commenting counterparts seem to forget that the books were supposed to be one novel not three but due to publishing was broken up. The movie is really a first segment of the nine hour movie. Fellowship was one of those films that drags you into its world and you don't come up for air until the end. All I would like to say is before making comments read the books. If you still hate it. That's just sad.
10.0~Better than the book!! abrafocus Sign in Permalink When I first watched this film, I had no idea what the subject was. I hadn't heard of the author, J.R.R. Tolkien, and the story was confusing. I also was watching the short edition, not the extended edition, now available. However, when the movie was over, I had changed. This movie was superb! Fantastic! I loved the prologue, the music, the sword battles. I also loved the fact that the director made it so, when an arm or head was cut off, nothing gushed out. He also followed the book very well, although I didn't read the book until after the third movie came out. The cast was perfect. I don't see how anyone wouldn't like this trilogy. The next two films were even better. But this film was a great classic, and earns a spot on my Top 30 movies.
9.0~The best film ever Patrigonc2 Sign in Permalink I completely love this film. But I think that it depend of each person. For example Im completely crazy about fantasy like this one. But this is completely awesome principally because for a film of 2001 this have a brilliant image and amazing special effects. In this movie we have Orlando Bloom making the rather of an elf. I prefer ten thousand times the books but of course if they put everything just like the book instead o being 3 films it would be like twenty films each one with more than two ours. So yo realizing that is not that simple. But still a good creation which the main charades are fro do with the ring is big friend that goes with him no matter where, the wizard with is big and funny hat and of course the elf's and the future king that is in love with an elf
10.0~The Best johnabrahante Sign in Permalink The most fantastic film. Attention to detail, great acting, comedy, and action sequences that can stand the test of time. I was also scared of the Orcs when I first saw this film. Unfortunately I don't have anything bad to say, but I must say I watched the animated version of this, and it too is a fantastic rendition of the books. I think it goes unnoticed and the story is basically exactly the same. So if you are reading this. The only suggestion I can make to you is to watch the three animated, "Lord of the Ring" films. One is actually the story of the Hobbit, but they are so damn entertaining, I don't know what it is about fantasy that I enjoy so much, but I believe that this is the true reason for films. To not only be timeless, but to engulf the viewer and take them away. We go to the movies to be entertained.
10.0~WOW! oftenwrong Sign in Permalink I hadn't even read the books when my husband dragged me to see the movie. Three hours wasn't long enough when the movie ended. I was completely enchanted and hooked. The characters were so well suited. Loved all the comic relief, never saw so many unsavory characters in one movie, gave it a great contrast next to the 9. I have now read the books thru twice and before the next one comes out, will read it all again.
10.0~A Powerful and Moving Movie SweetEvil Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was the most magnificant movie I have ever seen. From the sets to the costumes; from the acting to the directing; this movie has a stunning outcome. The most truly wonderful thing about this movie is the story. J.R.R. Tolkien had such a brilliant mind. His languages and creatures were ingenious. But, Peter Jackson was also brilliant in his glorious attempt to bring the books to life. First of all, the scenery was amazing. Hobbiton was exactly how I imagined it. Bilbo's hobbit hole at Bag End was quite a site. Moria was as dark and scary yet bold and beautiful as a mind could imagine it to be. Lorien was so incredibly beautiful. The quick glimpse shown of Minas Tirith was enough to tell us that Gondor will be a stunning site. The Great River and Amon Sul were also sights to behold. But the most beautiful thing created on the set was Rivendell. That is the closest thing any mind could compare to paradise. The sculptures and intricate carvings were amazing. The sets alone were a true accomplishment. The costumes were perfect. Arwen and Galadriel both wore stunning, flowing dresses. Gandalf wouldn't be Gandalf without his tall pointy hat and long staff. The elves magnificant garments and the hobbits adorable apparel only made the movie better. What pulls any movie together, to make it worth seeing is the acting. Elijah Wood has always shown off his wonderful acting talents and he proved once and for all that he is an amazing actor. Ian Mckellen seemed so wise and magical that if one didn't know better, you would have assumed he was a wizard. Viggo Mortensen was amazing. He turned from a mysterious ranger to a bold King. I know in the next to movies he will continue to amaze us. I wasn't too fond of Arwens increased part but Liv Tyler made it count. Sean Astin was perfect for Samwise Gamgee, the best friend someone could have. Two of my favorite characters of course were Merry and Pippin. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd made the movie very enjoyable adding some comic relief. The rest of the cast were just as good in their roles. And it doesn't hurt that Orlando Bloom is incredibly attractive. All in all, everything about this movie helped to make my favorite books a reality. I hope I'll be able to wait for the next two.
10.0~Absolutely Magnificent... LadyHawke41386 Sign in Permalink The incredible story that began with nothing more than a ring, and led to a fellowship sworn to destroy it before it destroys them, comes to life with Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring. I have been a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings ever since I first read the books, and when I heard that the trilogy was being turned into movies, I wasn't sure whether to be excited or disappointed. Most movies tend to bastardize the books they are based on, so I went to the theater in December prepared for a bit of a disappointment. To my surprise, I found it to be excellent. I happen to be one of those people that, when reading a book like Lord of the Rings, can in my mind's eye picture every little detail as I trace the paths traveled by the characters, from how many clouds are in the sunset sky to the linden trees by the narrow road to the hoofprints left in the dirt by a cantering horse. So I had my own sets already pictured when I entered the theater, and I grimaced at the thought of what they might have used for the movie. But the sets were almost exactly how I had imagined my own to be, from the dark, almost Gothic streets of Bree, to the ethereal, elaborate elvish worlds of Rivendell and Lothlorien, and the towering immensity of Isengard. Almost unbelievable that this was all filmed in only one country. When I first looked over the names of the cast, the only ones I recognized enough to put a face to were Liv Tyler, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, and Hugo Weaving (though it was a little strange to see Weaving without his earpiece from The Matrix). The rest were unfamiliar to me at the time. But I think that having any bigger names, like Braveheart's Mel Gibson or Die Hard's Bruce Willis, would have detracted from the characters that these actors portrayed-when I think of those movies, the first thing that pops into my mind is who is in them, not the stories or the characters or anything else that should be what makes a movie good. But the acting by the cast in Fellowship was superb nonetheless. Elijah Wood's honest, innocent, young features contrast sharply to the ruddier appearance of the other hobbits, and his portrayal of the nobly courageous Frodo is so believable and convincing that the hobbit comes far more to life than I had expected him to in the movie. Liv Tyler brings with her the courage touched with femininity that the books were seriously short of, replacing an elf by the name of Glorfindel who has no other part in the books; this I believe to be a good choice since it gives a beginning to the romance between Arwen and Aragorn that the book only explains in the appendices. Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel was as ethereal as I had hoped it would be, and having her explain some of the history of the ring at the beginning of the movie really set the scene. Viggo Mortenson fit Strider/Aragorn incredibly well, and he brought the rugged nobility and royal gallantry of his character to life. The ever-so-loyal-to-the-end Sam Gamgee-my favorite character in the books-is played to bumbling perfection by Sean Astin. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd give a comic edge to their characters, Merry and Pippin, that really portrays the laid-back, almost child-like personality of true hobbits. John Rhys-Davies makes an excellent dwarf in his gruff bravado, and the talented Orlando Bloom looks so natural shooting his bow and arrows in that machine-gun style you would expect of an elf. Sean Bean plays the valorous but struggling part of Boromir extremely well, portraying very believably the torture of one who has held the ring but knows he cannot have it. Christopher Lee commands respect as Saruman, the sage wizard who has been led astray by the deception of the ring. And as for Ian McKellan's performance, there is nothing to say-he, as the great wizard Gandalf, is magnificent beyond words in his role. But even a movie as stunningly well-done as this cannot be completely without fault. Not only did they leave out the verse about the original rings, but they also cut out Strider's verse (All that is gold does not glitter,/Not all those who wander are lost;/The old that is strong does not wither,/Deep roots are not reached by the frost./From the ashes a fire shall be woken,/A light from shadows shall spring;/Renewed shall be blade that was broken,/The crownless again shall be king.). And then there were (although a minor detail when compared to the rest of the movie) the elven-cloaks from Lothlorien. These I had pictured in my mind as something slightly more elaborate than made of fleece-type-flannel-looking material. And also, they never once referred to the Balrog as 'Durin's Bane' as they did in the book. But for each of the few things cut that should not have been, there were a score of things done right. The Balrog was impressive for not having much of a physical description in the books to go on, Orthanc was intimidating, and the Uruk-hai invoked the fear that they were meant to. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole three hours and five minutes (both the first time I saw it and the second) as it was shown to me that even today, great movies can still be found, one without the objectionable material that movies get attention for today, one that places emphasis on loyalty and friendship and sacrifice. It was breath-taking; it was stunning; it was magnificent. It was Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and awesome in its greatness. This is one movie that definitely deserves a thirteen-and-a-half out of ten in my book.
1.0~Bore of a Ring FoxGarrison Sign in Permalink Before getting into the actual review it would be beneficial to know from what angle I'm coming from when giving this review. I've read some of Tolkien's work so I knew what to expect when watching this film. However, to make it fair I also don't remember much of what I read so I pretty much came in with an open mind hoping for the best not expecting the worse. Therefore, it came as a big surprise when I finally finished watching this movie that I was bored silly. There are a number of reasons for this and I'll go through them one by one so as to elaborate on my boredom. *** SPOILERS MAY BE AHEAD *** 1) John Woo slow motion -- I don't mind a film having slow motion, in fact in certain scenes a sense of solidification of that scene takes place when slow motion occurs. It firms up the act in the viewer's mind when it is done in slow motion. In the "Lord of the Rings'" case it was a nuisance. Almost every other scene there tended to be a slow motion event that kinda got tiring to watch and would have brought John Woo to shame. 2) The story itself was one big quest -- Had the director modernized the places and people and given them names like Brad, Tom, Scott or John the movie would have then been viewed for what it truly was: a not so great story with nothing more than a few vignettes to keep us entertained until the anti-climatic conclusion. 3) The ending -- What ending? A movie is not a promo for another movie but a self-encompassing entity that can be viewed on its own without having to watch other ones. This movie just ends and basically tells us, "...oh, and by the way...see ya next year". 4) Gladiator type battle sequences -- Does every movie now have to emulate Gladiator in some form or another? Here are just a few, "The Mummy II", "Planet of the Apes", "Attack of the Clones" and now "Lord of the Rings". Each one emulated the opening battle in some form or another. In "Attack of the Clones" it was the arena battle. 5) Cheap special effects -- A special effect is good when it's not readily evident that it is a special effect. How many times has this film brought a close up on an actor only to find that the background was plainly a green screen? Take a look at "Cast Away" for incredible outdoor special effects. Half of the movie is not real and yet you believe it is filmed on a beach because it looks real. 6) Similarities with "Black Hawk Down" -- The movie had 9 guys on a quest to destroy a ring, yet on the way they defend themselves battling thousands and live! This is very similar to "Black Hawk Down" not only with a handful of men battling thousands of enemy fighters, but also with having some real accident-prone men constantly getting into trouble, whether it be dropping rings, tripping over themselves or just standing still and causing excessive amounts of noise. 7) "Merlin" was better -- A few years ago there was a movie called "Merlin" on TV that still shows up every once in a while on reruns. The general gist of the movie was somewhat similar to "Lord of the Rings" in that a quest had to take place for something extraordinary to happen. Unlike "Lord of the Rings" though, "Merlin" was interesting, well conceived, filled with surprises, and the effects were done quite nicely with a fraction of the money "Lord of the Rings" spent. Had "Merlin" not been made then such a dreadful comparison would not be owning. 8) "Jurassic Park" type of plot -- I think I've watched "Jurassic Park" 1, 2, and 3 oodles of times and I pretty much know how the story goes: people are stuck on a park full of dinosaurs, run, run, run, escape, run, run, run some more and then look ahead to the future. Similarly, "Lord of the Rings" has the same type of plot: stuck in a land full of monsters, run, run, run, escape, run, run, run some more and then look ahead to the future. Pretty original yet boring if you've seen it done before. By the time the movie was nearly over I was thankful that one of the members of the fellowship was killed. Not only did it put the story out of its misery but also it finally brought a little human quality to the mystical story thread. Oh, did anybody notice how the arrows moved out of place up and down when he was moving about in his death scene? Kinda cheesy. As the "Lord of the Rings" ended so shall I end this review... ...abruptly.
10.0~If you do not think this is an amazing film...then you are brain dead. ericdmiles Sign in Permalink I've been waiting my whole life for this movie to be made, and when I found out Peter Jackson(God of cinema) was taking on the enormous challenge of bringing Tolkien's trilogy to the big screen over 3 years ago, I felt as if I had stepped into a dream. I finally saw it opening day at the midnight showing with my two friends, and I remember the awe and silence that filled the sold out theatre. From the moment I heard Cate Blanchett's voice, narrating the history of the Ring and Middle Earth, to the beginning of the credits, I experienced(as did many, many others in the theatre) one of the most exciting and breathtaking movie experiences ever. My friends and I had to go see it again the next day. This film has absolutely everything a movie needs. First of all the cast and their performances were top notch. I was not disappointed at all. At first I was somewhat skeptical about Elijah Wood playing Frodo Baggins, and I was never too impressed with his acting ability to begin with. Now after seeing this film, I can't see any other actor portraying Frodo, other than young Elijah. I was very pleased by his performance, but very disappointed that he did not get an Oscar nomination. As for Viggo Mortenson playing the heroic Aragorn, I knew he would be great the moment I saw him in the trailer for the film months before it was released. He looked and breathed Aragorn, just as I imagined Aragorn would when I read the books years ago. Sean Bean was terrific as the brave, but weak -willed Boromir. And of course Sir Ian McKellan was perfect as Gandalf the Grey. In fact, he is Gandalf. Every time he was shown on screen, he stole the scene. I'm just upset he didn't win the Oscar. The rest of the cast was great as well. I was very happy with their performances. The scenery and cinematography is indeed flawless. After seeing this movie, I immediately wanted to visit New Zealand. It's as if New Zealand is Middle Earth. The art direction and costume design is extroidinarily detailed. Everything from the celestial buildings of the Elves in Rivendell, to the Celtic designs in the Dwarven armour, to the dark and Satanic vision of Sauron's fortress are truly awesome. The make-up and creature effects are the best I've ever seen. The Orcs aren't just stupid, mindless killing machines. They really are terrifying. The Black Riders were my favorite though. They stole the scene every time they were on. As for the visual and computer generated effects, you couldn't do any better. The demonic Balrog was amazing. It was definitely one of the movie's best parts. And of course, Peter Jackson's direction was top-notch. I was so pleased when I found out he was doing the film, and not some huge, big-time Hollywood filmmaker like Lucas, Spielberg or Cameron. Don't get me wrong, they are brilliant filmmakers, but they all tend to throw in something very cutsey for the little kids so the movie would be more commercial. I knew of course Jackson would never do that. The action sequences and battle scenes are very exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more. I felt it ended very well. On a final note, this movie has it all. An adventure movie that is unlike any other with compelling drama, about a world of people who are facing a common danger. Everyone in this world of Middle Earth are in one way or another preoccupied with the difficulty of power. Whether it is political, personal, spiritual or the power to live, or to control, every character is forced to seek or reject power. This is truly a masterpiece in filmmaking and I cannot wait to see the next two sequels.
10.0~Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! Hirudroid Sign in Permalink LOTR I filled all my expectations after I had read the books like 12 times. Fellowship Of The Ring contains awesome fx's, animations, graphics, music, costumes, casting, post production etc. Peter Jacksons directing surprised me totally. It was a huge risk to take this scale of picture to direct. Something about perfectinism - Brian called the filming crew back to New Zealand after watching the rough version of LOTR II. The fighting sequences were too lame and had to film again. I think it's good news because only thing that bothered me in LOTR I was the lack of blood. I can't wait the next to come...!!!
10.0~Can't wait for the next two! salchi182 Sign in Permalink It was very well done/written/filmed. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. You may see those guys always critiquing every single aspect of every movie. What happened to the days when people just went to the movies, sat and relaxed, and just let themselves be entertained. It seems to me that people limit themselves too much with excuses and they actually try to find errors. Just enjoy the film! or at least give it a chance. This was the same case with Episode II, Attack of the Clones. People looked into it too much investigating every single apsect of the film/mythology/etc. They didn't take the film as a single entity and just forget themselves in the theater. People need to just let go once inside and turn themselves over to their creative minds when viewing these types of films. If these types of films don't fit your particular interest of genre, that's fine, but don't come up with excuses of poor this or that. I am stoked to be entertained by a good and classic story in the next two films and I'll leave it at that.
10.0~Probably my all time favorite! ferdyremijn Sign in Permalink When I left the theatre with my dad I was totally amazed by this fantastic story that I first knew nothing about.. My father read the books as a child and he was blown away by this film. Everything that you see just seems so real as if you're watching an historic adventure movie. The scenes with the elven folk are pure magic, and the Orthanc scene with Gandalf and Saruman is exhilarating. Overall this movie is going to be a classic if it comes down to the fantasy genre, and it'll probably be my all time favorite! Thank you Peter Jackson and his crew for making this happen, the world is by far more beautiful with a movie as the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Ring.
5.0~But it could have been so much more... JamesRMiles Sign in Permalink If I had been given the means and opportunity to make a Tolkien movie: 1. I would have made the Hobbit first. Why in the world did this book not get made first? 2. I would have made each Lord of the Rings movie alone, and broken the books up into more manageable chunks (look at the three trilogies of the Star Wars series, for example). Part I of Book One could be one movie of its own. 3. I would have been more faithful to the books; having less material to cover per movie would have allowed this. The Fellowship of the Ring suffers for having to cover too much material. And for all of its attention to detail, some of the most interesting parts of the book are skipped over, while silly additions like the "wizard wrestling" scene and the "all-seeing eye everywhere" and Arwen and Aragorn's romance are allowed in. I cannot claim fanatical fan status; I'm very familiar with the Hobbit but only just now I'm finishing the Fellowship of the Ring. But for all the amazement and wonder I'm finding in the book, I'm more amazed to find so little that is wonderful about the movie. A great book deserved better.
10.0~From the beginning... dee.reid Sign in Permalink ...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the "goriest movie ever made" (1992's "Dead Alive"), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of "The Lord of the Rings" saga, which include "The Fellowship of the Ring" (2001), "The Two Towers" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner "The Return of the King" (2003). ***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page. Not since "Star Wars" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing "The Lord of the Rings" films. "The Lord of the Rings" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the "PG-13" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get "into" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and "The Enemy," who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live ("live" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a "fellowship of the ring." There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called "The Lord of the Rings" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right. 10/10
10.0~One of the Best Films Ever Made carlos3999 Sign in Permalink THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a true masterpiece. No, it's not because of the hype. No, it's not because of the popularity. No, it's not because it was a huge box-office success. No, it's not because it earned 13 Academy Award nominations. It's because it is a truly amazing achievement in the history of cinema. Films like this are usually never made. Only every once in a while we get a truly great classic. Luckily last year director Peter Jackson and his team delivered a truly great motion picture. Let me say first that, I am not a fan of the LOTR books. I have never read the books. In fact, I went into the movie without knowing what to expect. I had only seen the trailer and it looked like it was going to be a good-looking movie, so I went to see it. When it was over, I could not believe what I had just witnessed. It surpassed my expectations and the hype that it had created. I was mesmerized. I was blown-away. I kept thinking: "I have never seen anything like this before". I was captivated by the powerful look of the film, the powerful and epic story, the characters, the excitment, the cinematography, the score, the visual effects, the action, the drama, and everything. I guess I can call this film, in so many different ways as "the perfect film". Because it is a film that puts together all of the pieces that one can love in a film. Everything, absolutely everything about the film is great: the direction, the acting, the story...etc. It doesn't have flaws in my opinion, and although some people complained about the length (3 hrs) of the film, I wasn't bothered by it. In fact, it didn't feel like three hours for me. When it was over, I wanted more. For anyone who hasn't seen this film (who hasn't?), I truly recommend it. It is a triumph. It is a masterful movie that will be remembered for generations. For a movie that's 3 hrs long, and leaves me wanting more, hey, not so many long movies can do that. And I am hugely anticipating the next two sequels. * * * * out of * * * *
10.0~Must see! andrew-247 Sign in Permalink This is an amazing film, brilliant special effects and a unique contrast of characters. I thought the press was over-rating it, but I was wrong. It's well worth 3 hours of viewing. The only problem is I have to wait until December to see the second part!
10.0~WOW! Cell_02 Sign in Permalink It was even better then I expected. I had read the books before, and I think that the movie is just perfect. All the great battles and monsters... I can't remember myself breathing during these three hours. Can't wait the next two films.
10.0~Excellent, but could be better dipe_c Sign in Permalink The movie is truly fantastic... especially the gloomy darkness that broods over the entire film, with islands of light and respite. I'll talk about the good bits later, first let me talk about how the film could be better, and come closer to the book. The first part that establishes the hobbits, their lands and the starting out has been so telescoped that the film feels disjointed. The interaction between the hobbits is also very different from what Tolkien described. In the film the hobbits are more egalitarian, back-patting kinds, but we must remember that Tolkien was writing at a time when society was a lot more structured. Sam is a servant who goes on to become a very close ally, ie, from a servant to a personal attendant. In the film version, the relationship is a lot more casual, and that, to a diehard Tolkien fan feels odd. So too with Frodo's friends, Merry and Pippin. They are his equals, but always exercise a restraint in their relationship with the ring-bearer. Not so in the film. In fact, I find most of the 9 walkers except Frodoand Gandalf frightfully miscast. Aragorn, and Gimli are particularly bad. But Gandalf is truly fantastic! And the Moria sequence is actually better than the book! Peter Jackson has done a truly wonderful job of the story. But sometimes it is easy to lose the story, characters and flavour of a film when mind-boggling technique (as is there in the film) takes over. I quibble at the flaws as this is truly the once-in-a-lifetime film.
10.0~The First Instalment of the Greatest Trilogy in Film History. powermandan Sign in Permalink Star Wars, The Godfather, and Indiana Jones are the best trilogies ever. Among them are the three adaptations of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth epics: The Lord of the Rings. What makes this trilogy superior to the other three I mentioned is that they feature an instalment that is considerably inferior to the others. Return of the Jedi is the worst Star Wars, Godfather III is the worst Godfather and Temple of Doom is the worst Indiana Jones. I would have to call Fellowship the worst Lord of the Rings movie, but it is not considerably inferior to its sequels. Australian director Peter Jackson brings the timeless sequel to The Hobbit to life. In Middle Earth, Rings were made to different races that gave power. One Ring ruled them all, owned by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron lost the ring in battle and is stubbled upon by a hobbit named Smeagal (Serkis). He goes crazy as the Ring consumes him and becomes a little creature known as Gollum. The Ring leaves him and is found by another hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Holm). When Bilbo leaves, the Ring is no longer left with an owner, so Sauron and his ugly band of Orcs are reawaken and seek the Ring. After wizard, Gandalf (McKellen) discovers the Ring's unspeakable powers, Bilbo's young nephew, Frodo (Wood) becomes the carrier and is joined by a group of warriors to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece. I found each sequel better than the last. But there are some people that are not fans of any of them. Famous film critic and award winning journalist, Richard Roeper, gave this movie thumbs down when he and Roger Ebert reviewed it. he later changed his mind after seeing the other movies, but still. And I know of people that don't like these movies because they found the whole fantasy subject to be too cheesy and unrealistic. Well, that's what a fantasy movie is: unrealistic. People that don't like these movies are completely ignorant to movies and storytelling. The whole premise of these movies are long and complex that need lots of explaining. Most people generally don't understand the story, which is why my summary is long. It may follow the general monomyth archetype, but it is full of subplots and backstories that make the plot more complex and original than other monomyth archetypes. But what people love to praise is the general filming. People that don't like the LOTR movies fail to understand how difficult and masterful the movies were made. Take any five minutes of this, and think about how much work was put into it. All the make-up, costumes, set pieces, choreography, etc, etc. That is why these movies are such joys to see and why you can't take your eyes off of them. I honestly don't think there has been any movies since that have been harder to make than this. If so, they're not that much harder. Peter Jackson recently finish his trilogy of The Hobbit. The Hobbit is one novel that's a prequel to LOTR. Jackson made three epics of one 400 paged story. I don't think he should have done so. The Hobbit movies are not at the level of the LOTR movies. If you ask me, Jackson should have done two Hobbit movies in 1998 and 1999, then do the LOTR as is. He would have ended on a better note then.
10.0~A Masterpiece in Literature adapted to a Masterpiece in Filmmaking BerZerK_Bavaria Sign in Permalink Tolkien inspired most of the fantasy games today, and as i love medieval roleplaying games it is no wonder that i found my way to the "origin" or the "bible" of this all THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I read it the first time only a few years ago and it IS all that i ever wanted. And these movie are an absolute breathtaking adaption! There are some things i would have done changed but nevertheless i am absolute gratefull for what Peter Jackson and his crew has presented to us!
10.0~if you haven't seen this movie you've seen nothing yet maloosack Sign in Permalink This movie was the best. It had all kinds of expressions. I cant wait to buy it. The music was also very grand (i bought the sound track). One of my favorite parts was the beginning. The introduction was so perfect. I hope they make a movie for the rest of the Lord of the Rings series. This is probably one of my top ten movies to buy!!! I totally recommend it.
10.0~Its IMDB No.1 Ranking speaks for itself. Sinnerman Sign in Permalink With the staggering 1000 over comments posted here, coupled with its meteoric ascend to the top of the IMDB Top250, and all accomplished barely 2 weeks after its opening, 'Fellowship of the Ring' have indeed achieved an amazing feat. That it is but only the first part of a trilogy not only intensify the anticipation for how the story will unfold, it is astonishing to realise that we will likely be watching a future movie classic when the chapter closes on the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I am not a radical crusader for LOTR. But on reading some unfathomable wrongful comments posted here, I see a need to right certain misconception/expectation. Below two nagging points of contention I shall address. 1. (It's IMDB Ranking of No.1 is hard to stomach for some fans...) No one is disputing the artistic merits of Schindler's List, Shawshank Redemption or the Godfather series etc. But the IMDB's Top 250 ranking should not be a barometer for artistic merits alone. It is also a free-for-all popularity poll for all fans of movies. One should not be too harsh on FOTR as it is infact voted by the general masses. And boy, have they spoken? As such, it is really not suitable for the harsh remarks about the worthiness of FOTR, what with two more parts of this epic saga yet unleashed. I will suggest all to wait till then for a more balanced and critical judgement on the films' artistic merits. More importantly, such rhetoric debates should be fought out in forums other than the IMDB Top 250 ranking. 2. (The Book is better and certain plots were omitted/changed) It is generally acknowledged and accepted that the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is a literary masterpiece of the 20th century. As such, comparison of any kind between the book and the film is inevitably subjective and very often, personal. I would rather ask for discerning viewers out there to understand the limits of cross medium comparison. One is to know that IMDB is devoted to the entertainment medium for FILMS and not LITERARY arts. It is thus unfair and inappropriately pointless to compare the merits between the book and the movie. Instead of nitpicking on their incomparable merits, one should commend on the astounding achievement accomplished by Peter Jackson. It is to his credit that artistic and sound business decision were synergistically considered to ensure the best possible film adaptation from a literary classic of LOTR's magnitude. It is in my opinion that his translation was accomplished to the best of his ability, understanding and the utmost love and respect for a story so masterly told by J R R Tolkien. (Conclusion) As far as I am concerned and with all due respects to JRR Tolkien and his 'literary' fans, I am not much of a literary aficionados. But I am a fervent lover of movies. I rightly believe that I am in the position to say that FOTR is one of the best films I have ever seen. Infact, the succeeding episodes of the trilogy may propel its excellence to greater heights. I was fascinated by its wondrous sights and sounds. I was enthralled by the twists and turns of its powerful, riveting story and I shared the joys and tears of the characters on screen. These, if not already enough, are the makings of a great film. In time, I dare to proclaim that the Lord of the Rings trilogy will even elevate itself to movie classic status, evolving into a film series which will be cherished by generations of discerning movie lovers. Hopefully, it will also finally stand on its own merits and be fairly judged as a respectful film adaptation of a literary classic and in itself transcends into what shall be a masterpiece labour of love from a visionary director and his inspired cast and crew.
10.0~Personal views on lotr fellowship of the ring. aantont Sign in Permalink I went to see this film the first day it came out not for all the hype but because i love the Tolkien books.No body could create the same world on screen as it is in the book but Peter Jackson did a great job.There was action,sadness ,comedy and a bit of romance.My wife and i were on the edge of our seats my wife had tears at the sad parts and also laughed at parts.The computer graphics are very good the cast is almost perfect Elijah wood is in great form especially at the snow scene at how tired he looked very good.All the cast were good especially the main ones.I can't wait for two towers ,fellowship of the ring is the slower part in book so i am very excited about two towers.my last words are this was the best 3 hours of entertainment i have ever had 10/10.
10.0~Wow, what a movie djangoose Sign in Permalink Great, excellent, brilliant, marvelous, magnificent, fantastic, amazing, superb, really really really good. What more can i say, one of the best movies i've seen. Can't wait for the Two Towers and The Return of the King. Lord of the Rings is gonna be the best movie trilogy ever made!
5.0~yes, it's beautiful.... but Butch-7 Sign in Permalink What am I missing? Yes, it's a beautiful movie. The visual effects and scenery and costuming are awe inspiring. But effects don't make a movie. People are getting lost in their childhood memories and loving this movie. Sorry. It's dull. Sure there are some stunning scenes and some exciting action. Then there's the rest of the 3 hours. ZZZZZZ. It's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon all over again. Whoo-great effects -- Whoo-excelling film making -- zzzzzz-boring experience.
8.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) MartinTeller Sign in Permalink I was rather surprised and saddened to see that some of the lustre has worn off. Too much of it silly, overwrought, tedious or logically inconsistent. The Nazgul and Uruk-hai that we're constantly being told are the most fearful, awful things ever are laughably ineffective and incompetent. And the less said about Gimli's comic relief, the better. But I won't dwell too much on the negatives. It remains possibly the most impressive production ever, and the very definition of "epic". Some of the casting choices are drop-dead perfect, and the characters of Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel and the four hobbits still resonate. The visuals are stunning and there are moments that still produce thrills. Nonetheless, I couldn't help being a bit disappointed that the film didn't enchant the way it did on that midnight screening 10 years ago.
10.0~A work of art beaver0524 Sign in Permalink This movie is simply amazing! A true work of art! Peter Jackson did a wonderful job directing this film, and the acting by Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortenson were outstanding! This movie takes you in with it. To the lands of the Shire, Rivendale, the mines of Morien, the mountains of the dark land Mordor, and much more! This is a must see movie if you have not seen it!
1.0~My Humble Opinion... c.g.brannigan Sign in Permalink I went in expecting to not like it but I wanted to see it to form an opinion and that I have. Now I haven't read the book, nor am I inspired now to read them. I did kind of enjoy the film but it was nothing fantastic. The special effects wern't anything to write home about. Sure they had fantastic scenery and landscapes and some nice CGI graphics whatever there called] but it was nothing any better than the big battle sequences in The Mummy Returns [in fact I was more impressed with them]. The best special effects were in the first few minutes of the story [not the recap] when they did the fireworks. Other than that Special Effects wise there was nothing new....I'd seen most of it before in other movies and it wasn't as impressive as everyone makes out. The make up was quite cool with the hobbits and the dwarfs, Costumes were excelent also. Tyler looks nice as usual but was not in it enough [I know she's not in the book at all] Ian Holm was brilliant as was McKellan and Wood. Cate Blanchet was also not in it enough and her character left me confused to her point [which no doubt will be explained in the future] As for the acctually progress of the movie. The first half hour basically explained the history of the ring and, I assume, was telling us what happened in The Hobbit, it wasn't really needed coz they re-explained everything later and it made those parts boring coz we already knew. The next hour or so was good, got into the story and everything, started to like and care for the characters and wanted them to be successful. Then it got boring. They reached a certain part of their mission and I thought we were comming to the end...check my watch and though...woa thats only been an hour and a half...Then the story didn't advance anymore and it really slowed...the characters didn't become more interesting or anything, it was just people walking and having conversations about the history of the ring and society which was explained in the first half hour, we already knew it all and they didn't need to tell us again.... it got boring. Then the last half hour got much better again....there was just that hour in between that was really boring...checking my watch every five minutes.....if they had cut out all the boring bits in between and kept it at about 90 to 120 minutes of the good bits then it would have been excelent. With it all in, it was just good...in fact, it was just OK....no oscar winner. I would probably nominate Ian McKellan or Sean Astin for Best supporting actors and I'd give it a nomination for costume, makeup and scenery but I dunno about anything else. I'll no doubt see the other two when they release them but I won't hurry to the cinema to see them. ChrisB PS: I'm commenting on the movie, not the book, two separate entities...shouldn't be compared
10.0~My Opinion AragornElendil Sign in Permalink My Opinion on this movie is that is the best movie ever filmed, I've read all the works by Tolkien, and Peter Jackson did a great job on this movie! He Picked a wonderful cast, Mortensen,Wood, Astin,Holms, Mckellen, bloom Wonderful all of them. I just think this movie was filmed well, and should be appriciated for what it is, and who wrote it.
10.0~Prepare to be amazed... wolf307 Sign in Permalink This is quite simply one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. Now, I'm fully aware of the fact these movies aren't staying true to the writings of Tolkien, and that certain concessions were made. I'll be honest, I have not read the books, but I will now. I'll spare you to plot details that have been repeated ad infinitum, and get on with my opinions. It is a rare occasion that I am transfixed for 3 hours like I was with this film. I was transported into the world of Middle-Earth and enjoyed every minute of it. Beautifully shot, edited, and scored, the actors brought these legendary characters to life. I went from being in awe of some of the landscapes, to being on the edge of my seat during the intricate battle sequences. At the end of the movie, I literally said out loud "NO! I have to know what happens next!" As for the people who are complaining that the movie is too long, go back to your MTV-induced short attention span drivel, and leave the fascinating films such as these for people who can truly appreciate them.
10.0~At last!!! There is hope for the film industry yet! IanTheGenius Sign in Permalink I have been waiting so long for this film. By that I don't mean an adaptation of the brilliant novel (I haven't even finished reading it yet) But I mean an epic masterpiece like this. Peter Jackson has brought us a truly beautiful and believable vision of Middle Earth (Filmed entirely in New Zealand) onto the screen. Also, he has made a unique decision that will set him aside in our memories for a long time to come... He has focused the entire films on the characters and their relationships to each other. Rather than just a heartless retelling of the story, like Chris Columbus has done with Harry Potter, he has created something that is - in essence - an epic independant film.The result is truly something we have never seen before. It is like no other film in existence. However, at certain points this feels a little rushed. The Lothlorien sequence comes immediately to mind. It seems that this has been done in order to fit in the full emotional ending in all of it's epic scope, having not been allowed to go over three hours. This is a minor problem though and is entirely expected in adapting such a huge tome into a three hour film. Fans of the book may be upset to here that most of the first half of the episode has been trimmed considerably. This is so we can get the fellowship of the title together and create a wonderful ensemble chemistry in reminiscence of The Magnificent Seven or The Great Escape. Also, Jackson has brought us an adventure with more action than Tolkien did in his brick of paper. This is a faithful adaptation but is still a new experience, even to people who know the book off by heart (they are out there) because of Jackson's injection of adrenaline and humour (not that they were totally missing in the book). Also, whoever cast this film is a genius. A flawless ensemble, which consists of Sir Ian Mckellen, Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortenson, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom and - robbed of his oscar nomination here - Sean Bean (the nomination did go to Mckellen who lost gracefully to fellow Brit Jim Broadbent). The sheer concept of Rhys-Davies as a dwarf may be laughable at first but he brings an incredible strength that no-one else could, he has a wonderful Welshness about him that is easy to warm to. Bloom has the least dialogue but his character will shine in the future. Wood is a remarkable lead to begin with but is soon outstaged by Mortenson who commands respect as a future King of Men. The supporting cast are also perfectly chosen; Sir Ian Holm, Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee. The Two Towers promises to be even better and we will soon have an entire trilogy of epic adventures that will forever be better than Star Wars.
10.0~Magnificent when viewed again Ptero-valley Sign in Permalink I saw this film several times in theaters, and tonight watched the new dvd. The first time I saw FotR, I thought it was good, but too long and overwhelming. The second time ... Wow! Suddenly the wonderful characters, perfect dialogue, metaphysical storyline and Jackson's unsurpassed craftsmanship just lept out at me from the screen. This isn't a Hollywood-style story of Frodo's Big Adventure, this is an extremely powerful and poignant study of great evil and and how it can lure and seduce everyone who comes into contact with it. This film is extremely well done, very sincere and heartfelt (obviously should have won Best Picture) and improves greatly with each viewing. One of the true film classics!
10.0~Best movie of the year Rock-51 Sign in Permalink Honestly I wasn't that big of a Tolkien fan when I decided to see Fellowship of the Ring. But any three hour fantasy movie should be good. After a year of disappointing movies, I hoped this one would be good, and damn it was. What surprised me was how well everything worked. The actors were great, the direction was sheer awesome, the effects were excellent, etc. There was nothing wrong with this movie. Sure they took some liberties with the story and cut out some parts, but it was just to make it look better in my opinion. I can't wait till the next movie comes out.
10.0~Superb movie, the end could be more normal though... Skatanas Sign in Permalink All included in the one line summary. amazing movie from the start till the end...that was kind of sudden. It could end more normally. I think that this is exactly the same way as the first book ends but I could be slightly different in the movie. I was surprised by the end of the movie...Waiting for the other two parts...
10.0~Great Movie, Better Book Glen-5 Sign in Permalink This is a fantastic movie based on an even better book (well the first book in a trilogy). I can see how those who have not read the books might not appreciate the characters, the world of Middle-Earth, or the epic adventure that they are on, as much as those who have read (and loved) The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I have watched this film about half a dozen times now, and I love it more each time, however the first time I saw it, I was a bit disappointed. Not so much because of the parts of the book that were left out or abbreviated, but mostly because even though the movie was three hours long, I did not get nearly the sense of adventure that I felt when reading the books. The books obviously go into more detail about the characters and locations, and although these things are translated onto the screen, by the mere fact that it takes longer to read a description and visualize it than it does to see it for a few seconds on the screen, I got the sense of the movie being rushed. Watching the movie a few more times, one can begin to appreciate it for the movie that it is apart from the books. Although I must stress that a reading of the books will provide a better understanding and appreciation of the characters, world, and adventure of this movie.
10.0~A brilliant film rachi1409 Sign in Permalink I was sceptical going to see this movie, thinking it couldn't possibly live up to expectations. I was also afraid I would be disappointed if it didn't stay true to the amazing novel by J.R.R. Tolkien, which is one of my favourite books. However, I was pleasantly surprised by not only how true it was to the book, but how well done it was. The acting was superb, the costumes and scenery were perfect, (scarily, just how I had imagined them, it was like the film makers read my mind), and the story was extremely well done. Even though it was a long film at around 3 hours, it didn't seem long at all and the script writers managed to keep the main storyline while omitting the "side stories" which are in the novel, and which would only make the film complicated, confusing and far too long. This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and I cannot wait to see the next installment. Unfortunately, it doesn't come out in Australia for another 6 months. But I have a feeling it will be well worth the wait. If you haven't already seen it - do so! You won't be disappointed, especially if you are a fan of the novel.
10.0~An Epic for the Ages rhinds Sign in Permalink There are few movies that make you want to turn around and walk right back into the theatre after you have seen it for the first time. For me, this was one of them. I don't know if it was the story, the music, the amazing visuals, or just the timeless sense of adventure I got, but I was hooked on LotR immediately. And that was before I even read the books! Peter Jackson pulled off a masterpiece. The highlight of his career. Do yourself a favor if you haven't seen it: find the biggest TV you can, an extended-editing Blu-Ray, some surround sound speakers, and shut off the rest of the world (including your phone!) and enjoy THIS world for a while!
10.0~One of the greatest works of Fiction of all time done justice iainconnor Sign in Permalink There is no way to describe the sensation felt during the first time I saw the title LORD OF THE RINGS fade onto the screen. The feeling is akin to seeing the infamous STAR WARS scrolling credits in the theater for the first time. Simply put, this movie had everything. Superb acting, casting, costumes, sets, special effects, music, storyline, dialog, action... everything. Truly, if any movie deserves a ten out of ten rating, it is this.
10.0~Utterly brilliant. cobb_aja Sign in Permalink I never thought I'd be lost for words to describe a film, but LOTR has finally done it. This is, without doubt, my favourite film of all time - an acolade I always tried to avoid since it was always difficult to compare brilliant films like The Third Man with, say, Star Wars - but LOTR really is worthy. From the melodic, lyrical beginnings setting the scene with the silky dreamy voice of Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), to the sweeping away of Boromir down the great river, this film is truly epic. Elijah Wood is simply perfect as Frodo (I can't imagine Frodo any other way now) and Sir Ian McKellen was made for the part of Gandalf. New Zealand as Middle Earth is just sublime. How this didn't win an oscar for the best film last year really does undermine the integrity of the Oscar event. It is Peter Jackson who makes this film so brilliant - the fact that some parts of the book are omitted or perhaps even slightly exaggerated without losing the general feel of Tolkien's work and indeed enhancing it, is tribute to Jackson's genius. Simply one film to rule them all.
10.0~A great film fiwentelcontar Sign in Permalink I am a huge fan of Prof Tolkien's works especially his writings of Middle-Earth. I felt that this film stayed extremely faithful to the books. Although some parts of the books have been moved or changed in the films, such as Arwen being given a larger role in the Fellowship of the Ring it still stayed as close to the books a possible. Another great point about the film was the casting. I knew who each character was before seeing their name. For example when I was shopping with my parents, I saw a jig-saw puzzle of LOTR and their was one character who I hadn't seen in the mags I had bought I still however recognised that it was Elrond, the elven lord of Rivendell. One other feature that makes the film so good, the cute guys! All in all this film is one of the best films of all time and I'm sure the next two are going to be.
10.0~A Cinematic Epic that Would Make Tolkien Proud sasnelling Sign in Permalink I suspect that viewers of Peter Jackson's movie, Lord of the Rings, will respond to it much as they do to the novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Some will not be put off by the three-hour length any more than they are put off by the three-inch thick book. Some will not mind that this movie is just the first of three anymore than they mind the fact that the novel is the equivalent of three books. Others will complain, much like one eloquent but utterly clueless viewer has done here previously. It's too long...too historical...too unbelievable. If your idea of quality entertainment is reading the latest celebrity magazine or watching a 90 minute action film, The Lord of the Rings in either print or film IS probably not for you. But...if you delight in diving into a fictional work replete with imagery and detail, if you relish the intricate fantasy Tolkien created on paper, you will quite simply fall in love with Jackson's cinematic version of this 20th century classic. Everything about this motion picture shines. From the perfect casting of each character to the detailed sets and staging, from the costumes to the musical score, this movie is an incredible rendering of Tolkien's finest work in careful detail. Painstaking care has obviously been given every element of this production, and the resulting epic sweeps the viewer up into Middle Earth, bringing to vivid life a world that readers have vividly imagined for half a century. Grab your popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the journey!
10.0~I love it Jadzia_015 Sign in Permalink Hello Everyone! I've never seen any better film! I love it!! I love it so much! Everything about it is wonderful, the Hobbits especially! Thank you Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd! I love what you did with Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin!! They are wonderful! And thank you Peter Jackson! I saw LotR 5 times! And I enjoyed every time! I would die to see "The Two Towers" and "The Return of the King", I'm very excited... cu -Maria PS: i love it... ;) Sam:"Mr.Frodo? Frodo? (Frodo looks back to Sam) Sam:"I though I'd lost you" Frodo:"What are you talking about?" Sam:"Just something Gandalf said..." Frodo:"What did he say?" Sam:">Do not lose him Samweis Gamgee!< And I don't mean too!"
1.0~Imagine the Mummy with delusions of Grandeur.(spoilers) Anaisnine Sign in Permalink Ok, I admit, I liked The Mummy movies. They are fun, totally unpretentious, have good CGI..are a good way to eat some popcorn...yet not what I call 'high cinema' by any means..but then again, it doesnt set out to be, so I enjoy it for what it is. Sigh...maybe Jackson really meant to make a Mummy movie. If thats true, then its a shame considering the source material he had to work with. Don't get me wrong..the movie was good, worth seeing, very entertaining, and surely better than Phantom Menace- but only just so. While Phantom Menace only had Lucas' feeble literary talents to rely on, FOTR had (supposedly) THE greatest fantasy novel of all time, the template by which other series are based, the creator of 'fantasy' as we know(and love) it today. So why was the film so paltry? The reason is that Jackson like Lucas fell victim to the same faux pas... Faux Pas #1-Assumption of prior familiarity: Lucas relied on the audience's past knowledge(and love) of the SW world to 'carry them' thru the film and supply all the emotion(not good). Similarly, Jackson's movie did the same. I was introduced into alot of characters in this movie and b/c of the frenetic pacing and abysmal screenplay, I only definitively knew the names of say 5 characters-maybe. I had no insight into who they were, what drove them, what their relationships to others were..nothing. Most of the characters, save maybe Gandalph and Frodo were limited to 2D, at best, rendering them mere props and not the grand characters I imagine they are in Tolkein's novels. Thus I had the feeling that had I read the book, alot of what happened would have made more sense and I would have cared what happened to the characters.I would have been involved and 'pulled' into the film. As it was..I was interested in what happened...but not horribly affected either way by what did happen, a few scenes aside. Faux Pas #2-Ok granted...I say Lucas did better in this respect...character interrelationships. Quite frankly, I saw very little of what made the "fellowship' an actual fellowship other than the 'annointing' at Rivenden(another place I didnt know the name of til I went to chat after the movie). It seemed to me the reaction by the fellowship to Gandaph's 'passing' was amusingly exaggerated(eps with the violins in the background)..when you consider that half of them had only met the man (what seemed like) days ago. I saw nothing to hint at any nature of a relationship between most of the characters,excpet for maybe Frodo and Gandalph. The boys meet Strider..they go off with him for no apparent reason. Strider has a lady love..they have a scene for seemingly no reason as I was not given any back info to show me why I should care about them. It seemed to me that Arwen was a horribly contrived characer...her only raison d'entre being to save Frodo's life...Deus ex Machina to the nth degree. Then Gimli(another name I learned after the movie)utters the trite 'the felloship is broken' while the whole time I'm like 'well...its only been a few days..that was a quick dissolvement and besides...its not like they are chums anyway'. It just seemed to me that the movie threw conclusions at you, but gave you no reasonable build up or preparation. I mean..come on...we see them travel on foot on a mountain, but after that all of a sudden they have a horse named Bill that apparently is dear to them?!?Please. Faux Pas #3 Too Many smoke and mirrors at the expense of storytelling-Here Lucas and Jackson both failed miserably. But...at least where Lucas did it, he did it well. I really cant beleive comments that say the visuals were breath taking. Yes some of the scenery was really good, and some of the CGI was grand. But the rendering in some of the scenes was just horrible-I mean..In Ep 1 I know everything was not real, but at least the parts that werent were not GLARINGLY fake..the scene with the cave troll was just laughable. The Balrog...good, but how can I be scared of this 'monster' when 9 character have just outrun 1000 baddies....and no the graphics were not 'groundbreaking' for it either. The cinematography during the CGI scenes too often seemed blurry...I felt sorry for the folks up front during those scenes. So, on the whole I felt the graphics were derivative and in some cases dowright bad. I saw better eye candy in Shrek and FF this year. But, so as not to seem to nitpicky Ill say this...the effects I can live with, as long as I get a good story with good characters..story was good but woefully failed in part 2 for me. Faux Pas #4-this one belongs to Jackson alone...Condensation of an Epic Story. And no, I dont mean condensation in terms of what was or was not in the books b/c I havent read them. I mean in terms how...if this story is so epic, sweping and grand...how come it feels like it took 10 days? We are told how far it is to get to Rivvendale(i think?)..yet, three days later wham! here we are. Gandalph leaves frodo, journeys to a place seemingly 2 blocks away from Mt. Doom and comes back to the shire in what seems like hours. We are told the Fellowship are in for a long perilous journey..yet seemingly 2 days later, there they are in the mines, halfway there. Now granted...time is a concern..but surely they could have done something...some scenes of them 'on the road'(and not of them just arriving at the place they need to be), maybe some change of seasons.the only snow I saw was at the top of a mountain..yet, when they visit Cate Blanchett it seems sunny and warm again like it was when they set out.Or how about even some wear and tear on the characters..something, a voice over saying how many 'moons' had passed, something. Given the pacing of the movie I lost alot of the 'epic scope' Id hoped a film like this would possess. It made it feel horribly rushed like everything in between battles was just the set up to get to another battle....Like another movie I know...like The Mummy.-AN 7 out of 10 stars
10.0~A truly faithful adaptation of Tolkien's work microbert777 Sign in Permalink J. R. R. Tolkien spent over 10 years writing the Lord of the Rings. His attention to detail and history is what makes this particular story so compelling. It has the power of myth and human resonance behind it. But how do you adapt such a monumental epic to the big screen? The story itself comes in three thick books, consisting of hundreds of thousands of words of detailed descriptions of middle earth, its history, its heroes and villains. How is one able to remain faithful to the intent of the author yet make the movie accessible to the widest possible audience? This is truly a conundrum that I believe Peter Jackson has solved. His first piece of good luck was finding a production company like New Line that was willing, nay eager, to do three movies. Although Tolkien himself felt that the story was fit for one continuous book, he wisely followed the advice of his publisher and broke it up into three books. New Line and Peter Jackson followed this sage advice. Peter Jackson, along with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, spent arduous months painstakingly sorting through the wealth of prose to find the essence of the story that could be told in the compressed format required by the big screen. Their dedication shines through in the movie itself. There are even accounts of Peter Jackson spending time before going out on the shoot to re-read the applicable chapter in the books. He did this to set in his mind Tolkien's vision before he ever said "Action!" He did take some license with the story itself, exaggerating some roles while dimming or excluding others. But all of his decisions had to be balanced between being faithful to Tolkien's vision and producing a movie that would be worth watching by the greatest number of people. In this I believe he has kept the course. If you have never had the pleasure of being in Middle Earth, then please, by all means, see this movie. If you are drawn under its spell, a greater wealth and depth of story lies waiting for you in the books themselves.
2.0~Not sure why so many loved this movie. clementine-kruczynski Sign in Permalink This movie was over-hyped, and the only thing about it that I found fabulous were the special effects. However, this did not make up for the lack of emotional depth in the movie and the drawn out attempt at building suspense. Compared to the series of books this movie is based on, the movie seems shallow and lacks cohesiveness and character development. I was bored and just wanted the movie to finish, which is rare for me. Less focus on special effects and more attention to good acting and a story that builds suspense would have made for a better movie. Perhaps a little more background into the character's lives, for example, would have added a lot to the overall presentation.
10.0~Absolutely excellent film. kylemcd77 Sign in Permalink When I heard that Lord of the Ring was going to be made into a film trilogy I had not read the books but had heard from friends that it was an extremely good book so I decided to read the trilogy despite having no great interest in the fantasy genre. I found the story engaging, exciting and very well written. As such I could not wait to see the film. Being a New Zealander much was made here about the fact the the film was made entirely in New Zealand and there was a lot of hype leading up to the premiere. I went to see it on opening night and my expectations were exceeded. The casting was excellent as were the directing and special effects. A fair amount of the book was left out but as the film was already 3 hours long it's understandable why. Sir Ian McKellens performance of Gandalf was outstanding and his Oscar nomination is very well deserved. Overall I very very impressed by the film and think Peter Jackson did an excellent job in pulling everything together on what must have been a project of a huge scale. I cannot wait to see the next in the series and wish they weren't a year apart. I wouldn't say it's the best movie of all time but it's the best film of the year.
10.0~An amazing adaptation! tahja Sign in Permalink I have never seen a novel more faithfully and beautifully brought to the screen. Everything was just as I'd imagined while reading the novel. There are a few sections of the book that were left out of the film and there is information in this first movie that isn't revealed until later in the trilogy of novels. However, the movie is so well done, all is forgiven. Gorgeous cinematography, spot-on casting, lush score, and the right mix of sentiment, suspense, and comic relief. I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in quite a while. Brilliantly done!
6.0~Over Rated Jenimer2000 Sign in Permalink Like Amber-14 from Sydney, Australia. I am so tempted to give this a 1/10 just to restore some balance. 2nd best movie of all time? Please!! Now I would not put the Godfather at No1 and any list is subjective, but this is a good list very eclectic, it contains virtually all Kubrick's films most of what you expect to be there and current favourites that hang around the top for a while. The star wars films appear in the right order and my own Top choice is at 25 this week `12 Angry Men'. That is what lists are about, debate discussion, who put that there etc. No LOTR is not a bad film well made great acting, but it is not complete. I have not read the books so I have to start from that premise. But not since Back to the future 2 has a film ended with such contempt for an audience, we all know that there will be sequels but end the film and explain why the other 3 walked away. The editing was poor I got dizzy with all those fats cut fight edits and boy were there a lot. Even some of the SFX were poor the crumbling steps was horrible, although a lot of the blue screen art was good. What bothers me most was the invincibility of our heroes, it was actually a pleasure to see Sean Been perish. There was no explanation as to the inconsistency that he wouldn't march on Morodor with 10,000 men but would with a wizard , Robin hood Super Sword and 5 pygmies. Not since most of Arnie's adventures have you seen a trained Army struggle to hit the target. I go along with the complaints about length and characterisation, this was a good Saturday night distraction, but for 3 hours loose a couple of battles and put in some Plot! Try and summarise your favourite movie in a sentence? Not even Start Wars can be described in less than a paragraph. Good but no cigar 5/10 Vote 1/10 lets get Shawshank back up a notch.
10.0~Maybe the greatest ever braves_orioles Sign in Permalink This movie is an automatic 10. The characters and places are real and it makes you think you are really there. This was selected as my favorite movie of the year 2001. I can only wait to see what the Two Towers and the Return of the King will bring to us.
10.0~Powerful, Beautiful, and Amazing darehalstead Sign in Permalink One of, if not the, best movie ever. It's easy to make a good action movie, a good drama, or a good comedy. It's almost unbelievable that this movie managed to pull off all three seamlessly. Unlike other contemporaries, it doesn't rely on special effects to tell the story, but instead to enhance it. Every facet of the production, from the acting to the set design to the directing, everything right down to the smallest detail, is of an unsurpassed caliber. It doesn't get better than this- except of course, in the second film.
10.0~The last great epic? whendeicidelives Sign in Permalink Where to begin? This film is a masterpiece from beginning to end. Full credit to Jackson for tackling such a project, and, more importantly, in pulling it off in spectacular style. Having read the books a couple of times throughout my teenage years (i'm now 22) I was dubious as to how a big screen adaptation would fare. Tolkien's rich worlds, mythical visions and superbly 'environmentalised' characters created such a rewarding tale, it was akin to being retold a campfire story about your ancestors! (Being English, and since most of this is widely sourced from pan-European pagan mythology, its no surprise Tolkien touched a chord) So, with expectations that I thought would never be realised I was truly stunned by this film. Jackson, the production team, the actors, everyone involved in making the film nailed it perfectly. My only detraction is that it wasn't long enough. I could've happily sat through 6 hours of this movie such is its charm, scope and masterful storytelling. This film doesn't rely on 'big explosions', it doesn't need a 'pretty boy' hero to carry it, in fact it is devoid of all derogatory Hollywood influences. What remains (on a Hollywood budget however) is a pure vision realised without compromising its integrity. And that is perhaps where the film really excels, Jackson shamelessly allows the characters to indulge in sentimental wisdoms that were long ago discarded by mainstream thought as 'traditional', 'old fashioned' dare I say, no longer relevant to a modern, western society. Each persona in the film feels like they carry a history behind them because they haven't been forced to comply with politically correct standpoints. Which has left it open to being criticised by some nay sayers as racist and right wing. All I can say to these people is that if they are worried by the aspirations of creatures as noble and humble as Hobbits, then perhaps their ideas about those of us who aren't afraid to express our love of tradition, should re-evaluate THEIR ignorant and close minded viewpoint! Anyway, enough of this, back to the film! The plot progression and character development work and intertwine wonderfully, and makes me wonder why other films often lack such subtleties. Perhaps Tolkien's writing and Jackson's accomplished directing skills have made this possible, neither willing to take a shortcut if it means damaging the works overall consistency. The Fellowship Of The Ring is my personal favourite out of the trilogy, the transition from innocence to burdened responsibility is handled so deftly and seamlessly, things never feel they have raced forward too quickly without being explained properly or accounted for. Admittedly Jackson was forced to leave out some key areas of the book, Tom Bombadil notably being an absent character, but with the wealth of material that does makes it to the screen, I think you can say it balances out any omissions. The film really does encompass a vast array of themes. The action sequences, unlike so many films, actually have a sense of immediacy about them. You know these encounters aren't just here for our enjoyment to watch, they are but one of the many challenges faced throughout the film. The relationships that evolve between the characters makes you embrace them even more as identifiable entities, as opposed to just vehicles for the plot and action to progress. The story fully immerses you into its own world and nothing seems childish or fake. Since most fantasy films have derived themselves from Tolkien's original works, it is only fit that this movie, with Tolkien's vision intact, is perhaps the most believable example of the genre we will ever see. Sadly, I think this will be the last set of films to ever achieve 'epic' status in every sense of the word. I cannot see their being such a film like this ever again, its a small miracle it was commissioned at all with the risk involved. But more acutely, its doubtful that someone with Jacksons passion and vision will ever be married to such delightful, original, and enthralling source material. So, to those who haven't seen the film, or who have dismissed it, I would urge you to at least give it one try and appreciate this is not a Hollywood blockbuster, but a story, which takes you on an incredible journey the likes of which, may never be seen again.
10.0~best movie.....ever! life_is_nothing_without_movies Sign in Permalink The most...wonderful, amazing, breath-taking, beautiful, incredible, epic, gorgeous, fantastic, awesome, super, perfect, engaging, spectacular, grand, lovely, emotional...film I have ever seen!! I've never read the books, but I'm sure this is how they'd appear in my mind! Thank you, Peter Jackson for directing the best movie of 2001! Also, hats off to Tolkien...the literary genius who wrote this masterpiece!!!
1.0~Painful warrenmatt Sign in Permalink I can't believe how many people love this movie - I have never been closer to walking out of a movie before. It was slow at the beginning and I kept waiting for it to get exciting, or at least interesting, but left wishing I could have the last 3 hours of my life back. Some of the scenery was breathtaking, but it was obvious that most of it was done using a blue screen. The acting, the special effects and the plot were all awful and I often found myself laughing out loud at how truly dreadful it was. This movie just drags on forever. The entire plot could have been adequately explained in about half the time. My friend who saw the movie with me left for 45 minutes about an hour into the movie. In talking to him afterwards, I realized he hadn't missed anything of importance from being gone that long. Probably the worst thing about the movie was the ending. It's like the director just arbitrarily took a knife to the reel and said, "Okay, that's a wrap for the first movie." I knew going in that this was only the first part of a trilogy, but surely they could have come up with a better ending than they did. I can't even say it was anti-climactic, because there was nothing exciting leading up to it! Maybe I expected too much from the movie after seeing all the positive reviews but it fell well short of my expectations in every conceivable way.
10.0~Brilliant adaptation of the Book- JRR Tolkien would be pleased! countryway_48864 Sign in Permalink I have loved The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and all the writing of Tolkien since the publication of The Lord of the Rings in the '50, when I was in college. Every one in the dorm was reading it and once I got started I could not stop. Since then, I have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to my children many time. Now my oldest son has continued the tradition, reading to his children. When I learned that an attempt was going to be made to use actors and recreate Middle Earth without the use of cartoons, I was both thrilled and nervous. Could Peter Jackson and his talented group of actors, writers and other creative people REALLY bring this superb story to the screen? I am happy to say, they HAVE! Every character looks, sounds and acts exactly as I have pictured them all these years. The ensemble acting is beyond praise. These actors ARE Gandalf, Strider, Frodo, Sam, Legolas, Merry, Pippen, Galadriel and Arwen et al. I urge all to see this wonderful film! I can't WAIT for The Two Towers!!
10.0~AMAZING! Nov181973 Sign in Permalink Truly one of the best films ever made! It was robbed of the best picture Academy award. This movie does not disappoint. Even those who are not fans of the books, love this movie. Set back and hold on to something, you are going to love this from beginning to end. The only thing wrong with this movie, is the waiting for the next one.
10.0~Amazing jezzyjess Sign in Permalink This is a fantastic film. May I say a HUGE thank you to the cast, the crew and the director. Especially to the nine in the fellowship for showing such a strong and meaningful bond, truly showing what love and care they have for each other. Both on-screen and off. To Peter Jackson for creating a mystical, magical and outstanding movie that will be remembered by me and by many for years to come. To the crew for creating the beautiful costumes and scenery and to the computer graphics men who made the magical creatures come to live not only on the screen but in our imaginations and that is a hard and beautiful task to do and they successfully achieved such a goal. As some of you may or may not have heard in Tom Cruise's speech at the Oscars, a movie is a directors way of giving you a little bit of magic, well, I think that Peter Jackson has created this in the movie and made it one of the most incredible movies of all time. Can I also say a special heartfelt congratulations to Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood for doing such an outstanding job on the movie. I'm sure Becci (my best friend who loves Elijah!) and I (who loves Orlando!) will agree that their talents as actors are both moving and magical, perfect for Frodo and Legolas. A great fan of all who were involved in this movie, Jess
10.0~UNBELIEVABLE!!! toddyj1971 Sign in Permalink That is probably the best word to sum up this movie. I can not think of one thing that I did not like about LOTR. The acting was phenomenal(kudos to Elijah Wood, you rock!)and the cinematography was breathtaking. I can not wait until next Christmas for The Two Towers. I will be highly disappointed if the Academy does not give this movie a nomination for best picture.
10.0~Speechless Satine the Hobbit Sign in Permalink Upon first seeing this film, I was astounded. There were no words. And still, no words come at times to describe the beauty and majesty of this great achievement in modern cinema. Whoa. That was just a lot of words. Today must be a good day. Complete with a great cast, a great crew, great visual aspects, and a great script, this film is simply wonderful. When put together with the other two in this trilogy, it should be a greater thing in itself than the Star Wars trilogy ever was. A classic for a new generation.
10.0~Outstanding ericjg623 Sign in Permalink I am not normally much of a fan of the `Sword & Sorcery' genre, but this movie just blew me away. The visuals, the acting, the storytelling, all are simply superb. There's plenty of CGI and special effects, but unlike certain other movies (Terminator 2, for example) they do not dominate the film, but merely enhance the basic plot. This is without doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen, and certainly the best of the past year. If this doesn't dominate the Oscars, then Hollywood is in a state of serious denial. Films like this is what movies are supposed to be all about. 10+ out of 10
3.0~Dishonest Hollywood fluff Clavicle13 Sign in Permalink Due to popular demand, some of the reasons why Lord of the Rings is a poor film : This movie is so stifled by nonsense and Hollywood tricks that it's hard to discern, beneath it, the work of a purportedly intelligent, talented, and celebrated author beneath it. To begin with: there are way too many closeups in this movie. Why couldn't Peter Jackson simply let us stand back and watch the characters behave? Why does the camera have to keep poking into the characters' faces, looking for subtle clues? Maybe Jackson's been spending too much time watching the moronic trash of Spielberg, the most overrated director of all time who still hasn't learned how to let go of the audience's hand. The melodramatic soundtrack, far from sustaining or assisting the story, cheapens it and, as Spielberg is so adept at doing, leads me to believe that the intended audience is probably those people who don't like to think too hard. This film would've been far improved if Jackson had simply left out the lousy soundtrack. The special effects generally do not add anything to the story. And there is plenty of plain illogical nonsense in here. For one example, i think we can all agree that it's physically impossible for a human being to outrun an absolutely normal, healthy horse. If a person is being followed at full gallop by a horse, the horse will always catch up. Also, i always have trouble swallowing scenes wherein one or two people capably defeat an army of assailants counting ten, twenty, or more, unless these one or two heroes or heroines happen to have superhuman traits or at least an extraordinarily exceptional degree of training. I'm not aware of whether or not this sort of occurrence is consistent with the actual text, but as i watch the film, i can't help feeling lost in all of Jackson's nonsense. And so much swooping! Why so much swooping? More Spielberg influence. I admit there's also swooping in Heavenly Creatures, but by now his swooping has become quite distracting. Why can't we just watch the characters? Isn't Jackson supposed to be telling us a story? I like Jackson's earlier films, and Heavenly Creatures is a brilliant and compelling one, and clearly his best. But now he's off remaking King Kong... maybe he's gotten lost in Hollywood. Someone please help him find his way out! Peter Jackson had the potential of making a great film which could've lasted many decades as a classic, but instead he made a sloppy moneymaker. What a loss. But then again, perhaps this movie was made for children. On the plus side, the pretty New Zealand landscapes are nice to look at.
10.0~One of the greatest films of all time. dgallegos Sign in Permalink Star Wars has been dethroned. Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'. Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal. Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously. With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen. This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc. In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for. Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back. There are no slow spots, just one climax after another. From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away. The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the "Titanic" quotient, but it's well done. The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything. The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey. The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness. The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical. The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project. The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting. I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director. I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for. A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom. Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time.
10.0~One of my favorite movies yet rooboy84 Sign in Permalink After it was out for about 2 weeks, I finally decided to go and watch this film, as many people were saying how it wa the greatest film ever. I thought I wouldn't be interested in this type of movie, but boy was I wrong. The special affects took my breath away, the acting was sensational, the plot excellent...well not even words can really describe this film. The lord of the rings made me feel I was there with the characters. Very imaginative and unique as well. You must see this movie before dying! 10/10 Only downside is poor character development.
8.0~It grew on me mjw2305 Sign in Permalink Unlike most people, i wasn't trying to be first in the queue to see this film, I have never read the books and wasn't taken in by the hype. When i finally saw this film, i was impressed with the visuals, but found the story disjointed (clearly 3 hours isn't long enough to build the characters and portray the story in the way the books do) For fans of the books, i appreciate that you've all been waiting a long time for this trilogy, and i can see, without reading the books that they have done a good job at bringing the books to life. My criticism is this, for people who don't know the characters and the story, the film misses out too much content that i'm sure must be in the books. That aside i watched it again and have to admit that it grew on me, i got into the characters a little more and found an enjoyable movie with some masterful visual effects. 8/10
9.0~Best one of the series davispittman Sign in Permalink They always say that the first in a film series is the best, I haven't always found that to be true, but in this case it is. This first lord of the rings movie truly is great and it is every bit as outstanding as when it was first released in 2001. The movie really has everything in the world going for it. It is well written, it has a great talented cast playing well developed characters, the effects and visuals are impeccable, and it's fun and entertaining as hell. I have not read the enormously famous and very popular books, but to be honest it's not necessary to read the first book in order to appreciate this film. I didn't read it and I still loved it. The plot is very interesting and will definitely keep you invested in the story the whole way through. The actors do a wonderful job at making you care about their characters. Ian McKellen gives the best performance by far out of anyone. There couldn't have been a better casting choice for Gandolph, he played him perfectly, my attention was undivided when he came on screen. The other actors do an overall good job, they play the roles well, it's just that McKellen was so captivating and commanded the screen. The action scenes are great fun and the visuals are mesmerizing to look at. The movie is both intelligent and fun, the greatest movies combine both of those things. 9/10 for lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring. See it if you haven't already!
10.0~Mindblowing bjornljunggren Sign in Permalink After 3 hours in the theater watching LOTR I was numb all over. This movie made me forget to even finish my popcorn, I just sat there staring at the silver screen totally blown away. If the two following parts of the trilogy is as good as LOTR then this will be greatest trilogies of movies ever made. My hat goes off to Peter Jackson and his crew and actors for bringing Middle Earth to life in such a convincing way and for staying very true to the story. I can´t wait for the Extended Version of LOTR, the more the merrier :)
10.0~Great Movie EddiesGirl00 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. When you are little and imagine a Fairy tale in a far off place this is it. It really captures your imagination.Everything about this movie was perfect the sound effects, the visual effects, the characters. I was really begining to loose my faith in the movie industry this film has restored it.
10.0~Visually Stunning poorjoegillis Sign in Permalink I was absolutely riveted for the entirety of the film. An amazing feat of directing by Peter Jackson - he should have won an Oscar for Best Director! I'm a die hard Tolkien fan, I've read the books many times over the years and I was NOT disappointed. Jackson did a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life on the screen. I thought the scene of the horsemen trying to overtake Arwen as she was trying to get Frodo to safety was beautiful, perhaps my favorite scene from the movie.
3.0~Silly and Unsubtle bjsteve Sign in Permalink There was not much I liked about this film, outside of the first half-hour or so. I had very little problem with the plot alterations for the sake of converting the book to film, I think they did an admirable job with that. My concerns with the film as compared to the book were more about the feel and atmosphere. Using Merry and Pippin as little more than comic relief? A clumsy, pointless love scene between Strider and Arwen? Saruman as a B-movie bad guy? Countless teary and dreadfully unsubtle cornpone scenes of loyalty and friendship? It felt like they took the outline of the standard Hollywood movie and happened to find bits of The Fellowship of the Ring to shove into the appropriate places (except for having an actual ending of course). You can change the plot to fit it into a film, but when you change the whole feeling until the only recognition is plot bits and character names, you have a loser in my book.
10.0~Perfect fantasy film, forget Star Wars! Go4theGusto Sign in Permalink This is undoubtedly the finest fantasy film ever made. Tolkien's books set the standard for fantasy books everywhere, infact, without them there would be no fantasy genre. This movie, although not perfectly true to the book, captured it's essence beautifully. The scene's were breathtaking, the characters were perfectly cast, and the soundtrack was moving. This is a movie for everyone, fans of the books or not. Seeing it will definatly leave you in awe when you leave. Hail J.R.R Tolkien!!!
10.0~epic filmmaking as it should be! Allan-Houston Sign in Permalink No I won't be silenced about this film! No, it hasn't quite reached obsession! Alright. A quick plot summary, as if you don't already know. Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), having reached his 111th birthday decides to take off on a last adventure, like he used to in the old days. He leaves to his adopted nephew/heir, Frodo (Elijah Wood) his property and a mysterious ring, which Gandalf (Ian McKellen), the wizard bids Frodo to keep "secret and safe". Of course, as oft happens in these cases, the ring turns out to be the One ring, created by the dark lord Sauron, millennia ago, with the power to enslave the whole of middle earth. So it is that Frodo must leave his idyllic existence in the shire, with his friend Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) and later superfluous hobbits Merry and Pippin and trek across middle earth to finally take the ring to be destroyed. Along the way, and after much peril, Frodo is joined by men Aragorn and Boromir, elf Legolas and Dwarf Gimli. So the fellowship of nine, in a nutshell, is formed. What can one say? It's a film that I was waiting for a year and a half for. I was trying to ready myself for disappointment. And so, at 9:50am, Wednesday 26 December, during the first session of LOTR in Brisbane, Australia, I was to finally see this film, for which I had pined, ached to see for so long, and the result was... pure bliss! So much had been riding on this film. And so brave it was to make all three at once, but it has paid off for the first instalment at least, and created such a marvellous cinema experience that I could hardly contain my excitement when I emerged from the cinema three and a half hours later, feeling rewarded for the experience as I noticed the huge line-up for the fourth session. The opening of the film, not just the introduction but the whole Hobbiton sequence, was just perfect. It was so pure, so idyllic, so wonderful, rich. It was best we could hope for for the introduction into this world of hobbits, their tranquil, simple existence, which would be sharply and horribly contrasted with the sudden emergence of the evil bound to the ring. And from then on this sprawling epic took us on a journey rarely experienced by cinema audiences. It is HUGE! It's on such a mammoth scale that you feel breathless watching these beautiful images, these sweeping crane shots, this massive view of a mythic world. Middle Earth is so convincing and not once did I think of it as a fantasy, more of a rich history. Surely we owe this to Tolkien but if it was not for Jackson's vision it could have emerged on-screen in a lesser and inferior form. Such imagination and vision, rich with detail, heart and genuine enthusiasm for the project is rarely found in a big film like this. Imagine what George Lucas would have done for instance. There would have been some annoyingly cute young hobbit characters and Gollum would have been more like Jar Jar Binks than a mysterious, shadow-dwelling enigma. `Mes-a Gollum!'? Shudder at the thought. It shows though that Jackson cares so much about the books, the characters, the story, that he does not sacrifice it for cheap grandiosity or easy commercialism. I actually cared about the characters, what happened to them, the struggles they had to face to achieve their seemingly impossible aim. And the film is not just a fantasy adventure with Jackson pointing here and there saying `look at this, see what I can do??', it works well as a beautifully-conceived, emotionally-rich drama. There are at least two very effecting, very real scenes, both toward the end of the film, in which you truly care and the actors show their craft. In these moments the audience would stop silent. Especially in the first session, there wasn't even a rustle, a crunch of popcorn or a breath to be heard as the struggle was shared by the audience. The performances are exceptional. Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo, evoking both youthful enthusiasm and great strength and resilience mixed with a sad loneliness and weakness. He is in one moment both determined and weary. Also worthy of note (and they all are, but being selective) are Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee and Sean Bean as Boromir. Each brings to their role a painful honesty and true heart. Sam is one of the most admirable and delightful characters I have seen in ages. Sean is a long way removed from Encino Man here. And hopefully he will gain credit for this role, as he is truly excellent. Sean Bean is a man tortured by an underlying will to do good, but a strengthening urge to have power, corrupted by the evil of the ring. He is an excellent Boromir, who despite his transgressions is quite endearing at the same time. It's a given too that Ian McKellen is brilliant, and another Gandalf you could not imagine. Wise, bold, mischievous, caring. And Ian Holm as Bilbo is equally as good. Need I mention the superb art direction, costumes and eye-popping special effects. Particularly good is the way the differences in height from Hobbit, dwarf, man and elf are perceived. And so, this film, so detailed, so beautiful, both subtle and thrilling, with some very tense moments, is instantly a classic and one of my favourite films of all time. From one (potential) filmmaker to another, I can think of no better compliment to pay than to say, I wish I made this film. This is the type of film I would love to make. I wish I had some part, whatever it may be, no matter how tiny, in bringing this marvel to the screen. It pains me that I don't live in New Zealand and am still at university, because I would throw myself at Peter Jackson and say, `Take me, I will make you coffee!!' This is the effect of this film. So wonderful, so beautiful, so full of power and magic and bringing together a brilliant team of professionals who are all geniuses in their craft. A year and a half, so much waiting, so much anticipation and it was rewarded and here we have the first instalment of this trilogy, and we wait now for the other parts. It's hard to imagine a better adaptation or a better person to have brought this to our cinemas. Hardly surprising what score I gave it.
1.0~beware lover of the books steshawy Sign in Permalink it is with the greatest displeasure and disappointment that i find myself sat writing this review. having read all 6 of the rings novels i found myself baffled and confused by what i had assumed was a prequel to the hobbit. plot holes a plenty and a considerably stripped down cast (no gandalf, fro-do, or samwise!!) the scene in the crack of doom has been replaced by a video tape showing a small girl sat down a well. i can only assume this is down to budgeting restraints. the much loved council of riven dell has been replaced by a mental hospital. whilst i applaud the directors attempt to create a modern day lord of the rings i cannot condone anything which would make my 3 year old son cry as much as he did when the horse leaped tragically to his doom from the ship and into the unforgiving waves beneath, and i can neither understand nor forgive why Jackson replaced the final and climatic scene at the crack of doom with a black haired girl (presumably the wraith king) clambering from a television set and into the living room of a man obviously too large to be fro-do. why oh why is it so difficult for Hollywood to stick to the books?
1.0~Over-rated boring movie! Mr Shankly Sign in Permalink This film is sooooo over-rated. I'd never read the books so went into this with an open mind but was massively disappointed. It is without doubt one of the most boring films I have ever seen. At first I quite liked it even though the f/x were truly terrible and the acting a little wooden. But after the first half hour it turns into mindless drivel. The plot is very dull. A group of creatures have to take a ring to a special place to be destroyed. On the way they have to fight various monsters. And that goes on for 3 hours!! It was so mononetus that I almost fell asleep. I have never fallen asleep during any film but this one really had me dozing off. It has a total lack of humor and emotion and the CGI effects are so fake looking that it ruins any sense of drama. Really, how scary is an army of blurry CGI monsters running at you? The action set pieces have no tension and you are left with a feeling of "Okay, hurry up and beat this monster so we can get to the next one!" That's what it's like. It has NO sense of excitment, danger or suspense and that has to be down to the terrible direction of Peter Jackson. The only joy I had watching this was laughing at some of the performances. Does Elijah Wood realise that he has ONE expression in the whole film? Does Cate Blanchette realise how rediculous her lines are? Do Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen realise that they look like rejects from an 80's heavy metal act? And what's with Ian McKellan? He's doing nothing more than a bad impression of Merlin the Wizard. In years to come this film will be regarded along the lines of Titanic and Independance Day. If it's lucky.
10.0~A Masterpiece Theo Robertson Sign in Permalink I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming " This is our film " so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece . Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying " Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby " to which the producers gave a firm and resounding " No " . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good job The other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill . There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain. I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS
10.0~The greatest movie ever made bravojuggernaut Sign in Permalink This movie is far and away the greatest masterpiece ever made. Lord of The Rings actually seems to transport you to the various locations that the Fellowship encounters on their journey. The battle scenes and fights in this movie have so much lifelike power and drama that it constantly blows you away. Peter Jackson has taken the art of creating a movie to a level that has never been achieved or even seen. To be honest, I never really thought Star Wars was "all that". This movie, and its two other sequels are the best 3 films ever made IMHO. I rate them (1, 3, 2). Choosing Fellowship over Return of The King was very difficult though. It's always hard for a movie to beat its original, but Return of The King came very close. Having said that, these movies, especially Fellowship of the Ring, are "all that, and a massive truckload of chips." I never had even heard of the books prior to seeing this series, so these movies likely blew me away much more than those who had read them before. At the conclusion of this movie (3rd time seeing it at the theater), my dad looked at me in disbelief that it was over. I told him there were two more coming out in the future and his jaw dropped. The scale of this series is enormous and the characters are all so likable that Jackson makes it easy to play with your emotions as you watch events unfold throughout the movie. The magnitude of good as well as evil in this movie is extraordinary. If you see no other movie in your lifetime, see Fellowship of The Ring.
10.0~Wonderful movie... desertman65 Sign in Permalink I would never have thought 3 hours could pass so quickly and so entertainingly. Fabulous movie all round. There's a lot to get through in this movie as the first book of Tolkien's trilogy is all about setting the scene for what comes next. In doing just that, this movie covered the action admirably and what modifications to the detail in the book that were made, were made well and did not detract from the essence of the original story. Thoroughly enjoyable. Can't wait for the next installment!
10.0~Peter Jackson...one heck of a director. erinme Sign in Permalink When I read books, I read so I 'see' what's happening in my head, like a mini movie while reading. I read the entire Tolkein series in the eighth grade, a year and a half before this movie came out. I must say, I LOVED the books. When I saw the 'Fellowship" I was quite impressed. Peter Jackson pretty much took the movie out of my head. He brought this movie to life, and only reading the book, for me, could make it as real. Peter Jackson is an amazing director, and he did wonderfully on this, and the other two, movie. I was only disappointed that he had to cut a few key elements/people. Other than that, I think this man is a genius.
10.0~The closest thing you'll ever see to a perfect movie hippiegal Sign in Permalink This is the first time in years I've seen a movie and been amazed from the start to finish. Excellent acting, scenery, special effects, costumes, direction, writing make a wonderfully charming movie. It's so easy to feel that one is apart of unique fantasy world. The characters were perfectly cast. The special effects were wonderful without any cheese. The people who worked on this movie did their homework and it shows. Tolkien being a author people worship or loathe I was unsure of how this movie would do. But even people I know who hate Tolkien seem to be enchanted by this picture. To be honest after seeing a hyped up, over rated picture as Spiderman this movie brought back my faith in big budget epics. ( So I've seen it really, really late. But better late than never.)I could rave for hours, but a paragraph is enough. My new favorite movie A++
1.0~Congratulations on the tech demo, where's the film? Ripe Peach Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson \ C/O WETA Productions \ New Zealand Dear Peter, I write to you care of your special effects studio, as that seems to be where you spent most of your time during the production of this 3 hour technical demonstration. I would like to congratulate you on producing a proof of concept that demonstrates that you now have the technology to make a great adaptation of "The Fellowship of the Ring", and I would be keen to know when you intend to do so. While your proof of concept was nearly technically flawless (not many people will have noticed Legolas drawing CGI arrows straight through - and not out of - his quiver), I am sure that you realise that this is only a necessary prerequisite to actually producing a dramatic and enjoyable film. Clearly, your cast realised that they were just doing a dress rehearsal, as they delivered unengaging and one dimensional performances. Unfortunately, Liv Tyler and Sean Bean seemed to be labouring under the mistaken belief that they were actually filming the real movie; it was rather cruel of you not to let them into the secret. Boromir's line of "And they have a cave troll." contained a full TWO nuances (sardonic, resolute) and sounded as though an actual person had spoken it, which jarred badly with the idiot-board delivery in the rest of the tech demo. It was an interesting choice to show half of most of the plot lines (as opposed to most of half of them), so that the test audiences could get a taste of what to expect in the final version. For example, showing Sam saying goodbye to Bill the pony, without explaining where he came from, or setting up Gimli's antipathy to elves without then allowing him his one piece of character development, his adoration of Galadriel. Of course, no one who has actually read the books will be satisfied with this token coverage of the facets that make the book so enjoyable, and I trust you will resolve this in the release version. When you do film the final version, I would suggest that you obtain both an action choreographer, and a decent sound recordist. It is clear that you had neither for this technical demo, as the action sequences jump cut once or twice a second, usually away from imminent snafu's, and the entire film is drowned out by the yammering and cliched soundtrack (Enya! How capricious!), a clear sign that you had no decent original to edit. Apparently you will have $90 million to spend on the final version, and you will only have to cut perhaps ten seconds of CGI to be able to invest in some actual cinematics (I suggest the pointless Indiana Jones scene that serves the sole purpose of setting up a poor "joke"). On the issue of investment, I notice that your tech demo cameras can only focus at under twelve inches, or over fifty yards. Perhaps buying some cameras that can perform mid range shots might be an idea. Once again, congratulations on showcasing WETA, and good luck when you actually decide to make your long awaited adaptation of "The Fellowship of the Ring". Yours most very sincerely, Ripe Peach
4.0~A Nice Story, But Not the Tolkien Classic kjeroh-1 Sign in Permalink In making the movie, the creator decided he did NOT want to make a movie to please loyal fans of The Lord of the Rings. Rather, he was more concerned about maximizing its commercial appeal. In that regards, the three movies - The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and Return of the King - are successful. It tells a tale loosely based on the Tolkien classic. However, so many of the most basic facts are either eliminated or changed that by the time the Fellowship is formed -- beyond the names of the characters there is little resemblance to the trilogy created by J.R.R. Tolkien. The most egregious distortion is how Sauron was vanquished and The One Ring acquired - yes, the basis of the entire movie. The last alliance of Elves and Men came about after Sauron's forces had finally been driven back from dominion of Middle Earth and back to Mordor. A long and brutal siege of the evil wizard's tower, Barad - Dur ensued. In the end, Sauron himself came out. Perhaps the director had a problem envisioning what kind of battle must have transpired, but the greatest of the alliance battled Sauron up the slopes of Mount Doom, the volcano which forged The One Ring - Elendil, Isildur, Elrond among them. The director belittled the magnitude of the battle by having Isildur make a lucky swipe with a sword that cut off Sauron's fingers, thus separating him from the ring and making victory possible. Of course, if that were the case there would not have been a resurgence of Sauron. As anyone who has read the book knows, Sauron was beaten by force of arms, will, magic the full essence of what made the combatants great. Elendil's sword was broken when he fell upon it. Indeed, had it been shattered as they showed it would never have been reforged. Which is why Aragorn was able to carry it with him -- but that is among the more minor liberties the director took with his perversions. Isildur then cut the finger with The One Ring from Sauron's hand. The nature of the ring was that, in order to gain dominion over very powerful races, Sauron allowed the greater part of his strength flow into the Ring. Without it, he was diminished, but not killed. If being separated from the Ring vanquished him, then how was he able to come back? And wouldn't it have a much greater impact even on such a being as Sauron, to face the heir of the man who actually "slew" him, than the one who got a lucky shot. From that one major and totally unnecessary change, the connection between the movie and book was altered to such an extent that it was no longer the same. The other travesty was the failure to show the passage of time. It seemed that from the opening scenes of the party and Bilbo's farewell, and Frodo learning the secret of the Ring and his flight from the Shire, that perhaps a few months had passed. Quite the contrary, it was about 20 years that passed and Frodo used the Ring frequently. It's difficult to understand why the Ring had such an incredibly powerful hold. The list of unnecessary changes, omissions, senseless additions (Elves at Helm's Deep?) goes on and on. The director wanted to make the movie his own and capitalized on a popular title to do so. In and of itself, I suppose the movies do weave an acceptable yarn. However, for anyone who truly loved The Lord of the Rings, it is an unwatchable obscenity.
10.0~A Brilliant movie! eve_pimlico113 Sign in Permalink This movie is absolutely brilliant! It portrays the magical characters in the books so wonderfully and it is just like I imagined it to be when I read it years ago. Even better! The film is so enchanted and spooky that I keep watching it again and again! Elijah Wood (Frodo) is definitely the best actor of our time, for someone of only 21, he is a marvellous actor and should be praised for all the hard work he has put into this film. He is just like Frodo.
10.0~Friendship Sniper4Christ31 Sign in Permalink When I saw the preview, I didn't think that it would that good. But when I went to watch it with my sister, I thought about it and changed my mind. It made me cry. This movie is like a friend helping another friend and of course that is what friends do right?
10.0~From fear to joy SPQ Sign in Permalink Having read the book 10+ times I was hopeful yet in agony to see the Fellowship. Will Jackson be up to the task, how will the actors perform, what have they done with the Balrog and such... I'm sure many others felt the same way. By the end of the movie I was in tears, as it was as good, or actually far better than I had ever hoped a LOTR movie could be.The story was well composed, the world was artfully yet realistically created and the feelings of die-hard fans well taken into consideration by small sidelines of the screenplay (Magot, Bill etc.) Later to see the full version on DVD made it even better, as has been the case with all parts of the trilogy. If the old half-animation was a brave failure, this was a brave effort that succeeded.
2.0~Top 250?? Criminally over-rated. annienomad Sign in Permalink LOTR suffers from a technically proficient but creatively challenged story-telling team. The meandering plot, the stilted dialog, the lack of pacing and the amateurish tone all lead me to believe that Peter Jackson should stick to horror films where his abilities are far more suited to that genre's expectations. I look forward to the day when wide-eyed tech lovers awaken from their cgi induced hypnosis long enough to pay attention to the plot and the "technical" merits of a well-told story. Perhaps then talented casts and film crews won't have to be wasted on projects with only a studio marketing team and profit-driven consumer tie-ins to recommend it.
4.0~Not a very good movie harryc-1 Sign in Permalink I was really disappointed in this film. Myth is about sophisticated relationships between and among human beings, life and why we are here. Tolkien gets close to this kind of idea but the movie is very one dimensional, focusing on a reduced version of the plot and not even hinting at the sophisticated notions of the book. I would not recommend this film to anyone who had not read the book, and then only as a way of visualizing some of the events in a way they might not if they did not see the book.
10.0~Wow!!!! evenstararwen_27 Sign in Permalink I read the books first and I loved them (even though it took me so long to finish them)! When I heard that they were making movies on the books, at first I didn't want to go see it because I always believed that The Lord of the Rings, because of the style it's written in, and because the story was very complex, could not be made into a movie. But when I saw the trailer for The Fellowship of the Ring, I reconsidered going into the theater with my friend to see it. My god was I impressed or what by this movie!!! Even though the movie makers left some parts out and changed a few things, they really captured the heart of the story and the whole plot was true to the book, the characters were well done and portrayed the same way they were in the book and I liked it that they put in some characters from the Appendices, like Arwen (which are in the back of the third book). They also chose really good actors for this movie, they did a good job, being true to the characters and all. The visual effects were just wonderful, the creatures in the movie hardly looked like fake electronic beings, they looked almost realistic. The set design was almost how exactly how it was described from the book but it also brought out more of the story and the characters of creatures that lived in the pieces, like the Shire or Lothlorien, and it's hard to believe that it's all built on actual pieces of land, instead of man made backgrounds and only some digital equipment (or so I found out from the special features of the movie). And the costumes were just gorgeous and well done; my favorites were the elven costumes! Overall it's better than how they make other movies off books! I absolutely loved it!
10.0~What can I say willpak Sign in Permalink There are faults with TFotR, mainly, the timeframe is way off and some of the CG is less than perfect, but I still gave it, 10 out of 10, as I've seen it 3 times now, and I just can't get over how awe inspiring it is. I cannot understate this when I say - I have never, as an adult, been so caught up in a movie. Post movie drink, after my first viewing, I sat with two friends, mostly in silence. Now and again one of us would comment on the experience we'd just had, or mention the fact that after so much slack-jawed staring, our heads felt numb. A couple of pints in time later, and our, wow conversation, kicked in. later, In excitedly, describing the movie to a couple of women, who had yet to see it, I thought - this must be how "born agains" must feel when they're spreading the "good news". Well, maybe I am slightly overstating it a little, and being an atheist, I am using some pretty flowery language to describe what is after all, only a movie. With that thought in mind, I'll leave it there, as I should try and save some enthusiasm for the Two Towers.
10.0~An almost perfect adventure movie that won't be forgotten. ezmo87 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie close after it came out. I went into the theatre expecting to see something cool and something really awesome. What I got was actually even better. I expected the movie to be good but not spectacular. I was in awe when I saw this movie. The whole movie from beginning to end is nothing but pure excitement with an excellent story and plot with jaw dropping visuals and special effects. The story focuses on a completely different place called middle earth which is full of odd creatures such as orcs, goblins, wizards, etc. The basic people that you get in fairy tales. The movie talks about a ring that was created by a dark lord and used to make middle earth fall to darkness. The ring was taken from him and eventually lost by people of middle earth. It is now in the hands of a creature known as a hobbit who is just like a human only smaller. He must take the ring across middle earth into the dark land of mordor and cast it into the fire of mount doom which is the one and only place it can be destroyed. A fellowship of 9 companions will help him set out and complete his quest as he does this. I think I can safely say that this is the best movie I have ever seen along with the rest of the lord of the rings trilogy. The acting was descent and was actually pretty good by a couple people. The plot and story as I said are excellent and make you want to keep watching. The character development is great and this movie rates to the highest on almost every level. It's just about 3 hours long but if you're a fan of adventure movies like me, you won't even care since the story is so involving. This is the best adventure movie ever made and it deserves to be where it's at as far as it's ratings go. Best movie I've ever seen in my whole life.
9.0~This really is something special Paynebyname Sign in Permalink Let me start by saying that I've never read the books. During my childhood I belonged to the legion that read the works of Tolkien's friend and rival, C S Lewis and the Narnia Chronicles. They got my imaginative juices flowing and I stepped over Tolkien's work. The films came out and I had been aware of Peter Jackson's work but with all the furore and lack of money at the time I held back from seeing it for at least two months. Eventually I watched it, enjoyed it but it didn't set me on fire. My favourite scene, Boromir's last stand, lingered in my mind and over time the desire to see it again grew. The DVD came out and I looked forward to sitting down with my to brother (who had not seen it) to watch again. Wow ! 2nd time around this thing blew my mind. Whether it was because I then knew the story and could enjoy the characters and appreciate everything else I don't know but it just rocked my world. I was like a love sick pup with a constant smile on my face enjoying every scene. I tell you this tale to qualify my praise and make clear that I wasn't a tolkien fan from the start. Peter Jackson has opened my eyes to this world. I don't know how faithful he's been (and I don't really care) but you can tell from the passion involved and the love heaped on this film that he takes it seriously and is not out to make a fast hollywood buck. I purchased the normal DVD and recently got the extended version which is even more fantastic. I don't feel cheated and owning both is worth every penny. The film itself is great. The characters are rich and full, well written and well acted. I can't really say I have a favourite but Gimli definetly comes out better in the extended version and I am looking forward to seeing his developing friendship with the others and his painfully sweet adoration of Galadriel. The relationship between Boromir and Aragorn is very well played, again displaying real depth and makes Boromir's sacrifice and Aragorn's renewed faith in man all the more powerful. In fact the film deals with the whole range of human emotions and knowing that they will be developed even more over the course of the next two films just warms your heart. The action scenes are great and with real time invested in the characters you feel all the more tense and involved. The world Jackson has created is lush and wonderful with special effects serving and enhancing but NOT dominating the story. The musical score is perfection, complimenting the film at every turn. Indeed my favourite scene with Boromir owes much of it's brilliance to the beautiful music that accompanies it. I am wrapped up in this world and although desperate to see the next two am also slowly savouring the whole heady experience. For those that haven't got it I cannot recommend the extended version enough, it takes what you love and just adds more. In summary this film is a joy to watch and Peter Jackson's direction and story telling is assured and confident. For the first time ever I'm preparing myself to enter a theatre and observe two films without any thoughts of whether I could have done it better. I have total confidence in Peter to deliver what I need to see and knowing his cast & crew's passion for the project I know they will deliver. It took me time to appreciate this beauty and elevate it to my favourite all time film but sometimes you have to step back and look again to observe real genius.
1.0~The LoTR splatter-action movie Fizu21 Sign in Permalink Love the book, hate the movie. Why ? 1. The atmosphere. In the book, black riders, the Nazguls, are mostly a distant yet frightening threat, not something to throw on your face at every turn. The athmosphere should have been more waiting, something like Hitchcock movies... 2. The plot. Somebody should give the director a copy of LoTR. And the damn director should read it. Instead of showing us the building of the Isengard and the creation of Uruk-Hai he might have used that time to actually follow the plot of the book. 3. The story ! This is supposed to be an epic tale, not some childs play where one man can beat Nazguls with a torch or two man can kill an army of Uruk-Hai. Sure, they were great fighters but still. Sure, in the book they did kill 40 orcs each in the battle of the Helm, but they had nice little walls to do it from. And how come the last orc is always the hardest to kill ? Killing 39 takes less than a minute but the last one takes 5 minutes alone... Yep. A pity they didn't get that other guy to direct this film.
10.0~A great adaptation and a groundbreaking film in its own right jonasmkl Sign in Permalink After having duly absorbed the extended DVD version of FotR, I would like to take a shot at a comment on this fine piece of work. To better understand my vantage point towards this film, you have to know that I've read 'The Lord of the Rings' many times over for the past twenty-one years, that, at age 14, it was one of the initial causes for my fascination with English language and literature (not my first language) and that I, as an avid cinephile have wondered many a time how this complex epic could ever be made into a movie worthy of its literary source. So, by having mulled over for some years, how the locations could look like on film, who could be cast in the main roles, how the flow of the story could be arranged and which parts would have to be drastically cut for reasons of pacing, I did enter the cinema with a very clear picture, what was absolutely necessary for a decent adaptation, what was the maximum I could hope for, and where potential pitfalls might be lurking. After sitting through the prologue with its epic and action packed vista on the history of the ring giving way to the bucolic garden of the Shire, overwhelming joy was bubbling up inside me. This was exactly what I had hoped for, not only was the story represented in detail, the overall feeling of every scene was right on target, too. Among the highlights I have to mention are the grandiose and meticulously chosen location shots and the seamlessly worked effects representing the magical nature of the mythic world of Middle-Earth without distracting from the story. Nearly every picture in the film shows some sort of 'effect' but only in a precious few the first-time viewer becomes aware of it, and even then it blends in remarkably well. No less there have to be compliments to the astonishing depth of back story worked both into the script - often in an off-handed and almost imperceptible way - and into every prop and piece of decoration. The cultural representation of invented cultures in the film does put to shame every fantasy or sci-fi movie shot until now and many a period piece or historic drama based on real world cultures. Next there are the actors, every one of them cast and played exquisitely to represent the very distinct characters in the story, not always exactly according to the books and obviously not necessarily to everyone's taste, but always fully consistent internally and to its background story. Despite the big differences in experience and word count within the cast there is never any danger for the film to turn into a star vehicle, always putting the real stars, the ring, the fellowship and Tolkien's story, first. A lot of story elements from the book have been cut and even more have undergone changes big and small, but if one accepts Peter Jackson's right to alter peripheral parts of the narrative for dramatic reasons, the reasoning behind nearly every discrepancy has proven sound, prominently featuring both the wish to produce a movie appealing to fans and first-timers alike and the dramatic obligation to turn the often remote and epical characters of Tolkien's books into a full sensory presence of the big screen. And indeed, I do know of a lot of people never before in close contact with Tolkien's books, who came away from the film in awe and with respect for a genre they admitted to have gravely underestimated. Even if this appears to be hardly possible, the extended DVD version still improves on this work of art, adding a lot of scenes giving additional back story and a feel for the world of Middle-Earth and re-cutting action scenes to more streamlined and dramatic versions. So why do some people just don't seem to be able to see anything worthwhile in this movie? Clearly my taste isn't superior to theirs, but I would just venture the opinion that those people confronted the film with expectations it couldn't meet for perfectly good reasons. So let me tell you, this movie is not for you (and probably the second nor the third part of the story is neither), if you: just don't like the notion of Fantasy with its strange creatures, magic, outlandish names and tales of fate and heroics. insist on scripts adapted from a novel to exactly mirror the book, and still more importantly your interpretation of it. can't stand action scenes and staged battles or do like action movies to be nothing but. find it disturbing to have the reality of evil and temptation portrayed intensely and neither cynical nor comical. like to have your characters either one-dimensional or monologueing their thoughts to death in front of the camera. take the point of view, that romance or humour are misplaced within films exhibiting a serious and dark mood. feel betrayed by a story that moves somewhat unpredictably throughout the movie and doesn't tie up nicely at the end of the film either. take offence at being forced to sit through a three hour screening. While I might come across as patronizing (because I have trouble appreciating these lines of thinking), I don't want to belittle the disappointment of anybody who didn't like the film. I just would like to give fair warning to anybody contemplating to view it at long last, to buy the DVD or to queue up for the upcoming parts. To all those able to overcome differing expectations and appreciate the lots of love, creativity and expertise the cast and the crew under Peter Jackson have poured into this adaptation, I just can say: 'Have lots of unadulterated fun and awe.'
10.0~the star wars representative of our generation jaesboxer Sign in Permalink Having never read Lord Of The Rings, I was doubtful, but as with all epics, hopeful for the movie. I went to the theatre the day it was released, and since then have seen it 4 times. It is, without at doubt, the star wars representative of our generation. It is a cultural phenomenon and one of the greatest films of this or any year.
10.0~AWESOME!!! encinoghetto Sign in Permalink What an awesome film! Perfectly cast. The cinematography is brilliant!It was written so well that even someone who is completely unfamiliar with the books will be able to follow the story and understand it. Great acting as well. The next installment in the trilogy is going to be even BIGGER. I can't wait!
10.0~My new favorite movie! robinyj69 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie four times and would have went more if it had continued playing here. The artwork and computer animation was spectacular, the acting was amazing (Elijah did a wonderful job), and the world of Elves, Hobbits, and Dwarves really came alive to me. It stayed as true to Tolkien's work as I think possible, having only three hours to show it all. Every character was portrayed wonderfully and true to Tolkien. It was a fabulous movie and I am eagerly awaiting the next two!
10.0~Oh, how it pains me. Chamby-1 Sign in Permalink This is the second time I have commented on this movie. The first time, I was at a loss of words as I was still awestruck. Now, as I read through other comments, I return with a fire in my belly. Anyone who has anything negative to say about this movie is missing it. I hear about poor action scenes, acting that is lacking something, missing events from the book, the list goes on. They say a movie is great if and only if all the acting is great, the plot has little to no holes, it must flow, it must meet a list of criteria. I say that if you watch this movie, or any other, checking things off a list, you have missed it. To love this movie the way some many Tolkien fans have, is to remember 2 things. 1 - Let go. Don't anticipate every move. (no matter how predictable) Enjoy what you see and hear and feel. Do you ever notice that children enjoy movies more than most adults. It is because they have no expectations or demands. They simply let go.(# 1 is true for any movie) 2 - LOTR is a very long story. Sure there seems to be relationships missing, characters are not round, story lacking. There is a much bigger picture there than the just the 3hour movie we all saw. My take on LOTR. This movie is what epic stories are about. Mr. Lucas could take a few pointers from Mr. Jackson. There is something old and historic about the characters and how they are portrayed. It is a fictional story with fictional people in a fictional time. It only makes sense to leave you guessing to an extent. And most of the time, the actors/actresses say more without speaking. Each character is full of fear, terror, doubt and urgency; and we see it in thier faces. The visuals and effects are so rich and full of flavor, our eyes eat up every scene. This is a great movie, because after I have seen it and am leaving the theatre, I feel like I have just came back from a trip. My mind is still in the movie, reliving the events. It's great because I jumped when I was scared, I laughed, I wept and I felt anger. This movie made me feel. That is what makes a great movie. Thomas Edison failed at many things, but it does not take away the fact that he was a great scientist. "To say a rose is but a rose, is to catalog it before it has had its chance. Look at the rose. So many shades of red and pink we have never before noticed. Feel the soft curves of its peddles. They are firm, yet fragile; tender and warm. And when you smell it, it exudes a fragrance like no other. . . LOOK AT THE ROSE. Simple, and common. . .and so very wonderful."
10.0~LotR: TFotR Review emlit Sign in Permalink A very faithful adaptation of the greatest piece of literary fiction ever made, which should please rabid Tolkien fanatics and curious Middle-Earth newbies alike. A much-appreciated effort from all parties involved that, although intermittently scattered with minute changes, is as good a movie version of the book as could conceivably be.
10.0~One movie to place them all! jojorm Sign in Permalink Being a great Tolkien's fan, i was both excited and worried about this movie: nowadays technology allows to create a fantasy world quite easily, but THIS wasn't just a "world": Jackson had to give life to an entire mythology, a place that millions of readers had loved and created with their imaginations. So the question was: could "technology" equal "imagination"? I can say: Yes! The lines are taken directly from the book, or -at least- from the way we remembered them; the costumes are wonderful as well as the attention in the details. Moreover the use of the lights, that define every locations in a different and peculiar way, is amazing! The cast is perfect: Christopher Lee is supreme "Saruman": although his role is "stressed" compared to the book's one, his talent almost needs more time! There are some "goofs", some "personal reading", but who cares? Each movie is an artwork of a director; but I think that Jackson, who is a Tolkien readers (and that is clear: the movie is full of details - from the runes on Bilbo's sword, to the three stone ogre, almost invisible in the halo of the fire), has done a great job: not only a wonderful movie, enjoyable from everyone, but also a great and respectful version of "The greatest book of XX century".
10.0~how could this happen? zoochdog Sign in Permalink why didn't this win best picture? clearly it kicked ass and was a superior movie worthy of viewing again and again and again. if you've read LOTR, this movie kicks ass. if you haven't it's still a great flick.
10.0~Jackson did it right SirTalyn Sign in Permalink I have long been a follower of Tolkien, and read the books about 20 years ago. This movie did the first book justice. It is more than a good movie, it is a great movie. Jackson stayed as faithful as possible to the main story line, and in the process, injecting the script with his own personal touches which were well done and necessary to make this story work as a film. Of course there were a few things I would have liked to see that had to be left on the cutting room floor, but if they were all included the movie would have been 5 hours long. I particular enjoyed the unexpected humor in the beginning of the movie, and the musical score was nothing short of brilliant. The special effects in the movie are second to none, and simply stunning and utterly mind boggling. Above all though, the scenery in this movie is truly breathtaking, and the acting is top notch. Sir Ian McCellan (sp?) IS Gandalf. It is like he was born for this part. I left this movie thinking it was a great movie, and within the first hour I found myself remembering more of the scenes and acting, and started to like it even more. This movie will go down as a classic and will redefine special effects in the cinema and what we come to expect from a movie. My sincerest gratitude to Director Jackson for getting this movie right, and truly capturing the spirit of, arguably, 3 of the greatest books ever written. If you miss this movie you are truly missing out on a cinematic masterpiece. It is a rare gem and will be remembered as a classic, as well as a movie that raised the bar for those to come. Lucas, and Spielberg, welcome Peter Jackson into your company of greatest film makers of all time.
10.0~Absolutely wonderful! relena_mia Sign in Permalink This movie followed the book very closely and depicted everything just the way it is imagined. Great even for people who haven't read the book, with marvelous special effects and wonderful actors. It left me wanting more and I can't wait for the next one to come out. I think J.R.R Tolkien would be proud.
10.0~Just the beginning of the biggest movie trilogy of fantasy fernandoschiavi Sign in Permalink Adapted by the hands of director Peter Jackson, who had previously directed productions of Bad Taste (1987), and the excellent Braindead (1992), Heavenly Creatures (1994) with Kate Winslet in early career, and The Frighteners (1996) with Michael J. Fox Besides directing, Jackson also wrote the script with his regular partner and wife Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens with his girlfriend, who also was his collaborator commonplace from that work. Released in the U.S. on December 10, 2001, the film was acclaimed by critics and fans alike, especially as many of these judged the film as the most faithful adaptation of the original story of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jackson. It was a huge box office success, grossing over $ 870 million worldwide, and was the second highest grossing film of 2001 in the U.S. and worldwide (behind Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Indeed, along with The Lord of the Rings, the Harry Potter series can be regarded as another phenomenon of fantasy success worldwide. The legion of fans fans for Middle-earth and all the mystique and fanaticism around books written, could easily intimidate any renowned director to take the challenge. However, after having seen the end result of adaptation, the impression is that no one else could take over unless Peter Jackson. The director managed to keep the same characteristics of Tolkien's book, turning the three books in three epic classics of modern cinema. Not only that, but in the subsequent films, it is amazing the power of synthesis contained in adaptations. The screenplay by Jackson, Walsh and Boyens is bold, brave and respectful to the original work, but it is clear that for a few changes are necessary adaptation of the original work, so the removal or assemblage of some passages is natural in the process even more in a work so complex and detailed. Jackson said in interviews that they wanted to leave the story focused on Frodo and the Ring. Almost all the time fidelity to the book is maintained, merely to make changes that would benefit the overall film: Tom Bombadil and the episode of wights certainly work in the book, but would be detrimental to the film, since it would postpone further time- key first chapter: the formation of the Fellowship. Much of the success of the technique is due to the 4 sectors awarded an Oscar: the visual effects, photography, makeup and soundtrack. But the film is much more than a bunch of effects. For this, the performances play a fundamental role. Elijah Wood, Sam Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies show always strong and fearless warriors. Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monagham are as well as the comic relief of the saga, and Liv Tyler is beautiful and angelic. Cate Blanchett is the one that fails to convey the mysterious air of the most powerful and dreaded queen of the elves, but we cannot say that an interpretation is bad or detrimental to the end result of what we see. The Fellowship of the Ring is an intro movie magnificently directed by Peter Jackson. The director uses the first time to introduce the characters and various landscapes of Middle-earth to realize the dream of literature fans and get to know a primary mission: to destroy the ring in the fires of Mordor Mountain where he was cast by your carrier, Frodo. Many major events were to occur in the following movies, but still, this first part we find everything: action, suspense, romance, humor, adventure and even dramas. Jackson directs with incredible safety, and even with so many different times as mentioned, it leaves the narrative flowing and organic, knowing take a deserved epic tone masterfully using slow motion or situations for creating suspense, for example, by delaying the onset 's Balrog and precede the attack of orcs with sounds from a distance. It also has the merit of letting the One Ring has its own personality, able to intimidate anyone who tries to touch it and turn slowly who door. The battle scenes, the march through the mountains of the Company and the other open plans are put on a show. Including several high angles, exploring the vastness of the battlefield and its numerous protagonists, and drives great camera and a sense of rhythm, Jackson is perfect. The Fellowship of the Ring still has lessons of hope, true friendships and honor. One of the best adaptations of something so complex, Peter Jackson has created something amazing that would become the benchmark of epic adventures and now also in the cinema, not only in books. A great masterpiece and that was just the beginning of the biggest movie trilogy of fantasy.
10.0~Really nice movie ! polo_z3 Sign in Permalink I was really happy to see a movie for which I can put a good note as 10 ! Peter Jackson has a really good vision of the book from J.R.R Tolkien and I liked a lot to see that movie again and again... It's a proof we can do a very good film with a book which is difficult to adapt. The location of the scenes are really good chosing by Peter Jackson and we have the impression of being in the movie, to be in a real place on the earth. I advise all the people who never saw this movie to do so quickly : you won't think it's a waste of time ! Good movie and don't forget to be in the cinema for the second which promises to be great.
6.0~What's all the mass hysteria about? philip_vanderveken Sign in Permalink I'm probably one of the few, if not the only one, but I really asked myself what it is that everybody likes so much about this movie. I mean, visually it is OK, but any other movie that would rely so much on nothing else but its special effects would just be crushed by all the critics. Before you want to make me suffer because of my "blasphemy", I want you to listen to what I have to say. After you've read it you can still quarter me and burn my remains as much as you like. Hahahahahaha. I never judge before I've seen a movie with my own eyes. It's too easy to say that you love or hate something, just because everybody else says it is great or awful, without actually seeing it. When I watch a movie I always start with 7/10 as the final score. Is it a very good movie, my rating will go up, is it a bad one, my rating will fall. Very fair I would think, no? Well, I saw The Fellowship of The Ring and it certainly had some great scenes, but overall I wasn't convinced by it. Don't you think that the story line (the battle between good and evil) is a little bit too thin? I know it is very popular since 9/11 and everybody needs his heroes, but this kind of thinking is just too black and white. Look at the battle scenes: the bad guys (I don't remember all their names, but that doesn't matter) attack with hundreds, even thousands, yet our 9 dear friends know to kill them all without suffering too much losses themselves (at the end of the movie only two were killed). Doesn't anybody ask himself questions than? I think they would have been killed by the first attack, end of the movie, now let's go home! Second reason why I didn't really like the movie: Often I was thinking "But what are they actually talking about????" Too often I got to hear so many weird names of places and people, making it impossible to stay focused. I'm not saying they had to be called John and Bill on their way to Washington and New York, but names like 'Idoknowhereiamrightnowbutijustdontwanttotellyouia' certainly don't help. Third reason why I think this wasn't the best movie I've ever seen: the duration of the movie. I don't mind watching a movie for three, four hours, but at least it has to have a good pace. The first 1.5 to 2 hours were so slow, I sometimes had the feeling I would fall asleep. If I were the editor of this movie, I would have cut it in half. Thirty minutes to get to know the different characters and the reason why they start their journey, another hour for the journey itself. There would still be plenty of time to show all the beautiful landscapes, the many battles with the different evil creatures,... And yet, I have some good critics too. I have to admit that, even though the story isn't much too my taste, the movie had some nice features as well. For example: I loved those 9 ghosts on their black horses. I really think they looked cool. Same for the special effects. The demon the magician had to fight just before his death, or the water in the form of horses that flooded the 9 horsemen were absolutely astonishing and great to watch. But as I said at the start of this review, it just isn't enough to save the movie. As a conclusion I want to say that the real heroes in this movie were the magnificent landscapes, the marvelous special effects, but that they can't save the lack of a good story and characters I can identify myself with. But I'm in a generous mood today and I give this movie a 6/10. Now come up with your matches and lighters...
10.0~Richly deserving of its acclaim G'aal Sign in Permalink Reading through the various posts, I see that the overriding theme amongst the movie's few detractors was that it was "overly long" and "boring", even prompting one poster to rename the movie "Bored of the Rings." Well, these people clearly haven't read the books and thus are not Tolkien fans. J.R.R. Tokien's books are VERY long and descriptive, and even the hard core fan has to wade through certain elements. However, the books are thrilling, sweeping epics, microcosms of the age-old struggles between good and evil. In this context, Tolkien has created a complete alternate world, populated by humans and similarly-evolved races such as elves, dwarves and hobbits, and mixes courage, determination, love and magic to create "Middle Earth". Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring accomplishes what no film maker dared attempt in the 47 years. It encapsulates the first book of the trilogy in jaw-dropping fashion onto film. And that bears repeating: the movie is so amazing, so awe-inspiring, so wondrous that through much of the movie, I felt my jaw literally dropping open. It's THAT good. The cast is nearly perfect: Ian McKellan *is* perfect as Gandalf the Grey. The standoff at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum will go down with the alien's tail slowly encircling Lambert in "Alien", the initial emergence of the creature from the black lagoon and other horror/fantasy epic moments as one of the all-time great scenes in cinematic history. Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchett and the rest of the remarkable ensemble cast give the performances of their careers. The special effects, despite some that claim otherwise, leave the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout. And the good news is that since the movie has grossed over $800 million world-wide to date, the second and third installments of the trilogy will benefit with post-production special effects improvements. If you haven't seen this movie, you've missed out, big time, unless you can find it still playing somewhere. The big screen is far and away the best place to view this masterpiece, especially sitting up close. I saw it three times in the theaters and would see it again today if it were playing nearby. And I know where I'll be the day "The Two Towers" is released: in my local theater, sitting close, watching yet another epic bit of storytelling unfold. A gigantic 10 out of 10.
10.0~A Concise Review; You Must Watch This Movie. LaChatteNoire Sign in Permalink There are no words that can describe this movie, except perhaps those of Tolkien's original novel. I might not be successful in telling you exactly how great this movie is, but I will try. After more than a decade since it was released, the movie has not faded away in any respect. Its special effects still thrill its audiences, and it's memorable. Its audience hasn't left it, and people continue talking about the series and novel. The Fellowship of the Ring does not follow Tolkien's novel word-to-word. There are a few small changes, but none that can upset you. In fact, something that I did towards the end was get the book and follow the story using it (of course, for my personal entertainment: it's not necessary to do so in any way). I've realized that the movie goes beyond the book itself, revealing some of The Two Towers. Overall, it's a remarkable experience. It's a movie for all ages, and for both those who have read the book and who haven't: a movie you should watch at least once in your lifetime.
10.0~It's not often that a movie matches or even surpasses the majesty of a book. starsniper13 Sign in Permalink It's not often that a movie matches or even surpasses the majesty of a book. And we're not talking about just any book. We're talking about the modern classic, Lord of the Rings. Complete Kudos to Peter Jackson, the cast and crew for a wonderful movie that's an instant classic in my books. I've never seen a movie that matched the way I imagined places and characters would be like until I saw The Fellowship of the Ring. Though I wished for a clearer ending and a sooner release date for #2 and #3, I'm sure/hoping that all will be revealed in time. If not in box office records, I hope it wins the Best Picture Oscar as it deserves to be in the record books!
9.0~As good as could be expected Mitch-25 Sign in Permalink This is truly a great movie. I read the wonderful J.R.R. Tolkien books when I was kid. This movie took me back to that time. I was amazed by this movie, and even more amazed by how faithful it was to the original book. A word on the ending. I have heard so many say that the ending was bad because it was too abrupt, and didn't "solve" anything. Yes, this is true. However, this movie is only the FIRST in the trilogy. The ending is at the end of the THIRD movie. I think the people saying this are people who have never read the books. READ THE TRILOGY BEFORE SEEING THIS MOVIE!
10.0~Truly masterful work. Vidboy6726@hotmail.com Sign in Permalink This movie is in my top 5 of all time, and Two Towers is almost as good. It's one of those movies you can just keep on all day and still be entertained by seeing bits and pieces of it. Really a great movie. It's no wonder it got mass critical and commercial success.
10.0~Best movie I have seen. bad93ex Sign in Permalink LOTR is the best movie I have seen. The story invites you in, the scenery is breathtaking, and there is plenty of action to boot. I have not read the books but have full intention of doing so. I have viewed the movie several times and you find something new each time. I think that if you read the books before hand it makes the experience a lot better. I was informed that Gandalf and Bilbo had an expedition previous to The fellowship of the ring and you see remnants of it in the film. Great film.
10.0~One of the greatest fantasy films of all-time... bullions27 Sign in Permalink The first installment had its moments and yes, I was wowed and thrilled by seeing one of my favorite novels come to the big screen. However, FotR didn't exactly leave a lasting impression on me unlike, for example, Platoon, where I would always remember the message it brought to me... sort of like a novel. FotR, to me, was more like a spectacular fireworks show. The plot behind the story is simple and Jackson and his group did a very good job transmuting what was in the novel to a screenplay. I don't know why some people complained about the "complexity", or didn't understand the purpose of the characters or the plot. How much clearer can Jackson make it without smacking you all in the face and telling you to wake up? It's about a ring, a very powerful ring, crafted by a evil menace. That evil menace lost his ring, and now he's back to reclaim it, but it's now in the hands of an innocent Hobbit. That Hobbit goes to Place A for advice, meets a myriad of characters all of whom describe how evil and powerful the ring is, and now he must go destroy it. Jesus Christ, this isn't quantum physics here. In any case, the movie does a more than adequate job portraying Tolkien's world in oh, 3 hours. It's a monumental task and I'm sure Jackson has spent many a sleepless nights pondering what he could use and what he had to throw out from the 600 pages of the original novel. The sets were done flawlessly (Khazad-Dum ranks as one of my favorite scenes) with the amount of CGI and excellent directing and lighting, and it provided a real and genuine fantasy feeling unlike the schlockfest from Attack of the Clones. My only gripe would be the characters themselves. All of them, decent acting, but the decision how they were going to be relevant to the story... well... that's my gripe. Examples, Jackson's poor handling of Boromir's death scene, the lack of the Broken Sword story with Aragorn, and Gimli's 180 of character from the novel. Regardless, it didn't detract me from thoroughly enjoying most of the movie. I am eagerly anticipating for the Two Towers based on the second novel, IMO, the best of the trilogy, this winter. 9/10
1.0~A shame... badbit Sign in Permalink I'm from Mexico, sorry about my english. I've been thinking a lot in "The lord of the rings" and still don't understand why it is so praised. I'm a big fan of movies, my all time favorite is "The godfather", fairly in the #1 of IMDB top 250, but LOTR in second? What's the matter? I'm wondering if the people who gave the movie a 10 have ever seen "Casablanca", "The shawshank redemtion", or even "The Godfather, part II". This movie has been the big dissaponting of the year, it is so, that I can only compare it to "The Majestic". Many people say that it has great special effects. If so, which scene did I missed? Because I didn't saw anything new or spectacular, in fact, quite the oppossite. The hobbits changed size every five minutes, the monsters looked like Jurassic Park dinosaurs, just a little better. About the acting, it was clearly below average. To be the second best movie of all times (or maybe the best, according to many reviewers of imbd), the acting is pure trash, I can't immagine why sir Ian Mckellen got an Oscar nomination. But the worst thing of the so called "movie", is the script. Poor character development and dialogue. We've just met Saruman and he has just turned evil? We didn't even had time to memorize his name! An introductory voice over that just drags on forever? Uh-oh. The movie just has scenes that are not justified enough, call it "senseless-love-scene". And my favorite: NO ENDING! Wow! They've just topped everything else. At least, every movie in the top 250 that has a sequel, it also has an ending: Star Wars, The godfather, Silence of the lambs, etc. No it didn't worked for me. Just too simple and boring, not even one inch of depth... For me, the best movie of the year was Amelie, hear of it? Just check for other user comments. It's a shame it didn't won best foreing language film oscar. But as always: Life is not fair...
10.0~A cinematic masterpiece... snoopy-11 Sign in Permalink Having waited a while for all the hype to die down, I entered the cinema not knowing whether the wait was going to be worth it or not. Well, the wait was definitely worth it - a stunning cinematic masterpiece; majestic, sweeping, exhilarating and sometimes moving. Sir Ian McKellen's Gandalf is deserving of a major accolade and the rest of the cast performance was impeccable as were the special effects, cinematography and sound-track ****1/2 out of *****
3.0~Somebody please help me superguapo2000 Sign in Permalink Imagine a distant world in a forgotten era, a world where the good must struggle against the darkest evil. In this legendary world live an assortment of creatures that range from regular-size humans to different varieties of short people, some of whom can perform magic. It is a magical world where everything is completely predictable, and there are barely any women and no sexy people. This world is called Middle Earth. You can learn all about Middle Earth by reading J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of The Rings trilogy, a story that shows Tolkien's desire to spend as much time away from his wife as possible. As a reading experience, it's akin to studying several History text books, only less interesting and you don't learn anything. The movie is fairly loyal to these ideas, and reinforces the attack on the innocent viewer with its expensive special effects and overwhelming, mind-numbing beauty. Lord of the Rings is the story of a ring: the One Ring. You won't be forgetting this, trust me, as you will see many shots of it in the movie, usually in slow motion. There's another seven or eight rings too, but this one's The One. This ring is very, very powerful and hence very, very dangerous, so dangerous that most folk would succumb to it and become deranged freaks with distorted faces. It therefore makes sense that the chosen bearer of this ring should be Frodo, a lobotomized moron who can never quite figure out what the hell is going on, as emphasized by his never-ending dumbfounded facial expression, which we get to see (again in slow motion) approximately 300 times throughout the trilogy. This idiot is who we the viewers are supposed to relate to. Now the main story goes like this: a crew made up of Frodo, his retard sidekick, an unshaven human, a dwarf, an archer who can't act (brilliantly played by Orlando Bloom), and some other people faking Irish accents set out on a journey to do whatever it is that had to be done with the One Ring. This entails fighting a whole lot of orcs time and time again. Even when you thought they were all dead, another 4000 orcs show up, always ready and willing to be killed in large numbers rather than simply commit suicide in the comfort of their homes. There's also Saruman and the similarly named Sauron, who play very important nondescript roles. As an interlude to each battle our friends go through, there's a slow motion scene of Frodo's idiotic expression as he stares at the ring for the fortieth time. In summary: This movie is an ambitious attempt to end all humanity.
10.0~Great Overall Movie Adaptation sean-figuray Sign in Permalink One Book to rule them all, one movie to top them, one publishing to start it all through Tolkien and Jackson they are binded. The reworkings of books to movies are now fashioned, they cannot be compared to this modification that has happened. And to make this great adaptation, they followed the storyline and through that they made an amazing transformation. The Biggest reason this is a great adaptation is they followed the main plot points and key features of this book. "Run you fools!" Gandalf quoted in the book AND movie This was (in my opinion) one of the most important plot points. In the book they (SPOILERS AHEAD) they went into the mines and Gandalf was killed. The way the movie portrayed this whole scene/chapter was almost exactly the same. In each Gandalf quoted "Run You Fools!" And this whole scene was the exact same from the book. In the end It turned out the same way. In the whole picture it was the same and brought the same picture. Therefore adapting it into a good movie. Another good similarity is how the characters were portrayed. "My Precious", says Gollum through missing rotted teeth. His emaciated body is evidence of his life in Middle-earth as a slave to the One Ring." This painted a very vivid picture of Gollum/Smeagol and in the movie as you see, it is SPOT on. The way gollum's craving for the ring was portrayed was exactly like the movie. And also It shows that the director put his time in to make the characters look good and that show it has effort and if there's effort its gotta be good. All in all the director really did an amazing job creating this movie adaptation, and I would recommend this book/movie to ANYONE!
10.0~An epic worthy of it's hype NateW Sign in Permalink The long awaited live action adaption of the classic Tolkein novel Lord of the Rings more than justified the massive hype surrounding it. Simply put, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I have not been so utterly blown away by a film in a long time like I was when I saw this. Every, and I mean every, aspect of this film is executed flawlessly. The ensemble performances are truly fantastic, especially by Wood and McKellan. All I can say is I can't wait for it to be released on DVD and I can't wait for The Two Towers and Return of the King to come to theatrical release. I think we have finally seen the arrival of a trilogy that matches the magnitude of the original Star Wars trilogy. 10/10
7.0~...Is it okay if I say it's slightly overrated? WakenPayne Sign in Permalink Okay, I started to watch what is considered to be the number one quintessential fantasy film series (...or adaptation of the quintessential fantasy book - take your pick). So how is this magnum opus of fantasy storytelling, at least in my opinion? Well it's above average but it does have some slight problems - I repeat - SLIGHT problems. The story - A warrior named Sauron crafts magic rings for the leaders of each kingdom of Middle Earth, which possess great power but he creates one more ring for himself that possesses great power and great evil. He conquers Middle Earth but he gets defeated by a human king who takes the ring instead of destroying it. 300 years later, a Hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) finds out his uncle, Bilbo (Ian Holm) has possession of Sauron's ring and after he leaves for a journey a wizard friend of the family named Gandalf finds out and after people drawn to the ring follow him, Frodo journey's with a few other Hobbit friends to a meeting place because Gandalf consults his other Wizard friend - Saruman (Christopher Lee) they then meet up with a Ranger/King named Aragorn who helps them travel to the Elf-land in which they go on a quest to toss the ring into the volcano in which it came. I really loved looking at the cinematography of this movie. New Zealand looks really good in these shots. It is certainly one of the very best elements in this movie. I can also give that as a nod to whatever effects they used for the scenery because every frame is in some way fun to look at. I can see very clearly why both these elements got an Oscar win. I can also safely say that I enjoyed the acting and that for the most part - I kind of want to see what happens next (well, I started watching these right? might as well finish them) It has that vibe that Harry Potter struck (although this is infinitely better) when it does get me into the world they set up and created. In terms of the acting I liked Ian McKellen as Gandalf especially. I can say everyone does a good job. I wanted to see in some way more of Bilbo's story just simply because of the performance of Ian Holm. So really there are a lot of things in this movie to like and it is very easy to see why it has a fan base that is so large and strong at the same time. Now here are the minor things which I didn't like - Well I didn't really like the 2 comedic relief Hobbits... I just didn't find them funny and I think Frodo got captured or in peril a few too many times and the bad guy Orc of the movie got introduced way too late in the movie to make an impact (although to be fair Christopher Lee did make an impact on me as a villain and I did want to see more of his character). So if anyone is thinking about seeing this movie - I'd say go for it. Most people might point out the slow pace but there is quite a lot of things in this movie that is worth watching. I am not as bid of a fan of this (at least so far) as a lot of other people but there is quite a bit to like in this movie and certainly one I'd recommend to anyone who wants to see a "world lies in the balance, must do quest" (which I admit that is an extreme butchering of the plot) fantasy movie.
1.0~a over-hyped film...one of those popcorn movies khabc Sign in Permalink hey guys I have had enough of these lord of the rings. The movie is ok. But some how the media is hyping it up to the sky. But honestly .,,its just another fantasy adventure. And please.....don't even think of comparing the LOTR trilogy with STAR WARS. STAR WARS is an all time classic. It created an imaginary world for everyone who has seen it. Its just that the media were jealous of STAR WARS's success and so they try to give bad reviews about good movies like "the phantom menace" & "attack of the clones". Actually episode I & II are movies with very exciting storyline. Its awesome. Coming back to LOTR...... all i would say is that "it is just one of those normal popcorn movies."
10.0~A beautiful film that never drags once FilmSchoolWriter Sign in Permalink I have never been a fan of Tolkein's works. Whenever I've tried to read them, I've become bored and have stopped bothering. It's taken me a while to get around to watching The Lord of the Rings, but I am very glad that I have now seen it. In fact, it actually made me read the books and I prefer the movies to the books. One of the things that I enjoyed so much about this movie is the absolutely *stunning* cinematography. Filming in New Zealand was a brilliant move and I am so glad that this was filmed "on location" instead of in the studio. I realize that a good deal of this movie is CGI, but it flows beautifully and there aren't any particular moments where you say, "AHA! Green screen! Right there!" I truly enjoyed the performances given by the lead actors. Especially Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn. His performance is authentic and he obviously strove to not only play, but *become* his character. Orlando Bloom is wonderful as Legolas and this is easily one of my favorite performances from him. Although in all technicality Legolas is a supporting character, he is an individual supporting character. In the fellowship, there are no other elves for him to be supporting, so in that aspect he is a very individual character, even if he is not the lead. Elijah Wood is good as well -- he does a wonderful job of capturing the simplicity of Frodo and his depressed emotional state. And more credit to Mortensen as well as Liv Tyler with their emotion charged love scenes. A rare thing in Hollywood, these scenes are more sensual then sexual -- a welcome relief from the modern Hollywood blockbuster that just screams sex. Many people aren't particularly wowed by Peter Jackson's directing ability. But I have to say that I think he did a wonderful job. Despite the 178 minutes running time, the movie never drags once. Jackson did a good job of getting as much as he possibly could out of his actors and that is easily the film's biggest asset. This is an amazing film and everyone should see it.
4.0~Good Movie, Read the book first Self_Proclaimed Sign in Permalink The entire Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is a complete travesty. I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune. The only reason that the movie deserves a 4 is because of the quality of it.
9.0~So close to the books MuffledVideoVoice Sign in Permalink Being a die-hard Tolkien fan since my single digit years I have held on tight to my personal images of what Middle Earth is, what it looks like and who inhabits it. When Ralph Backshi came up with his misguided attempt at the trilogy my worst fears were realized, no one could make a film of Tolkien's work, at least not a good film. When Peter Jackson got the rights I was skeptical. How could any one artist envision Middle Earth in a way that could satisfy the multitudes of fans? I was stunned when I saw the film. It was a mixture of Tolkien's own drawings, the Hildibrant calendar art and the pictures in my own mind. How did he do it? Even the colors were desaturated just enough to give the world a serious and menacing tone. Had the colors been too bright it may have come off like those many Michael Moorcock/Terry Brooks style Fantasy epics of the 1980s like Willow and Dragon Slayer, (Too wave the magic wand, too fairy dust and D&D for Tolkien). Granted, Peter Jackson choose to make the world a slightly more dismal place than I imagined it, always pointing towards the drama of Sauruman and the foul births of the Uruk Hai, but I understand how he needed to make a gripping film, and how my images of comrades and hearty adventure was not enough to drive the action of such an epic movie. The Elves were the only near misses for me. Just a little too Star Trek-monotone for my taste (magical in an almost sterile way as opposed to being artists, lovers and the passionate livers of a huge life). But it's one small thing. Overall Peter Jackson created a world that was respectful and serious enough for the a vast majority of Tolkien fanatics to accept it as the visualization of their own imaginings.
9.0~Worth the long wait. Phil_H Sign in Permalink I waited a lifetime, literally, for this movie to be made. Ever since the first time I read the novels, I knew that it was only a matter of time until this epic was on the screen. I had no idea that I would have to wait so long. The wait was absolutely worth it. Peter Jackson doesn't skimp at all. The elves look right, the languages feel and sound correct to me, not at all interfering with the "mind's eye" or "mind's ear" that has already shown you the land, the people, and allowed you in some sense to hear the ancient tongues spoken. This is truly a film worthy of the legacy that J.R.R. Tolkien left us. I do not believe that he would be upset in any important fashion. The acting was, well, spot on. The landscapes were breathtaking, and the whole vision that Jackson is bringing to life is so filled that I now know that nobody else would have done such a wonderful job. If you love the books, if you love the characters, then this is a must see for you. If you love fantasy, but simply found "The Lord of the Rings" to be too much to consume, then this is the easiest way for you to digest its majesty. And when you get to the novels you'll see that there is more that awaits you. Nobody is disappointed in this excruciatingly faithful adaptation. Even the details, and plot points, that were left out are gone for reason: they detracted from the root of the plot. If it wasn't in the line of the main story, Jackson cut it out. Cutting out anything from Tolkien is tricky work, but the pruning was left at just the right amount. Amazing. I sincerely felt that this movie was not the length that it was. But the clocks didn't deceive. It simply moves so well that I still can't imagine how it was done. Usually, unless it is a movie of incredible stature, like "Gandhi" or "Shindler's List," the length would become a detraction. But here it is not. This is proof alone that The Fellowship is a movie of great stature. There is little that I can add to the great reviews already here, except to give my vote and to tell you this: go see this movie. But how do I rate it? Will this movie withstand multiple viewings? I believe so. Is it of such quality that it will last as a testament to Peter Jackson and engage Tolkien fans for years to come? I think so. Will all following fantasy movies be measured against this, as the novels are used as the yardstick that fantasy writing is measured with? Probably. Is it cinematic perfection? No, it is not. And that is why I cannot, and will not, give this movie a "10" rating. But that should not dissuade you from seeing how absolutely wonderful this is. As I look at the listing of votes that I have made for various movies, the list is intact and all films are rated to near perfection. Once I leave my vote, I do not change it unless something drastically changes my perception of a film. Anything less is an insult to the film and to anyone who sees the IMDB as a valuable resource. Up until now, there has been only one movie that is at the pinnacle of the chart, only one film worthy of a "9" rating from me. This is the question before me: is The Fellowship worthy of sharing that spot? To say "yes" places this movie at, literally, the top of the craft; making it a film that experts will and must debate forever. It must be as good a movie as I could possibly imagine. There can be no flaws that I myself cannot justify in the name of the craft. It must be, by the very definition, the ultimate in achievement, with little room for any improvement. It must be, to me, a Tour de Force of all things cinematic. To say "no" by no means places this movie in a league of unwelcome company. There are movies that are adored by more than me that I have given an "8". Many movies I have given an "8" to are so good that I could not imagine being without them. Certainly, The Fellowship is in this class, at least. Indeed, once this is available on DVD I will possess it; placing this movie in a class that is by itself valuable: my collection. So now it comes down to it: "8" or "9". <Insert a three day pause> My vote is "9". Such a good job was done that there is little reason to not give it praise. I only wonder what I shall do if "The Two Towers" and "The Return of the King" are better by leaps and bounds.
10.0~Best Film Ever carlos3999 Sign in Permalink I did not read the books. I did not even know a lot about the movie before I went to see it. I had seen the trailers and it looked like a visually stunning film. The Fellowship of the Ring is a great film. It has all the elements one could love in a movie: fantasy, action, drama, suspense, romance (only a bit of romance). It is done to perfection. Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece that will be remembered for generations. It is a huge success on every department: acting, screenplay, visual effects, art direction, music, action, pacing, direction, and everything else. It really could be considered the best film ever made.
1.0~Oh, dear. Could it have been any worse? velocity2002 Sign in Permalink Tolkein was right. He said his story could never have been made into a film. Peter Jackson has proved him right. This movie was terrible. It's like a cross between The Mummy Returns and Xenia: Warrior Princess. But those productions are made with tongue firmly in cheek. LOTR was meant to be taken all so seriously. It's like Monty Python and the Holy Grail but without the jokes. Very pompous and VERY overblown. Jackson is only interested in the battle scenes which are done so appalingly that you actually sit there waiting for them to be over. The score grates and whines. Be thankfull then that you won't remember it when you leave the cinema. Some of the effects are good but others are SO bad. The cast are also wasted. It's a good cast but the script is dismal and it lets them down badly. I don't know why this film turned out as bad as it did. All the ingredients are there for a good movie. There is a great story, a good cast, a compotent if not awe-inspiring director, so why then is the film nothing more than a 3 hour long episode of Xenia: Warrior Princess?
10.0~Great Movie wolfenstorm Sign in Permalink Finally a movie taken from a book that actually follows the story line pretty closely as well as the writers intent. i was impressed with how characters such as Gandalf, Frodo, Elrond and others were portrayed and how well directed this movie was. And so much content from the book was included in this movie. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, as well as its sequels will be a mainstay for many years to come. I was also a big fan of the soundtrack from the movie as well. Overall, it does not get much better than this. THe action scenes and making the hobbit characters look so small, lol. No end to the special effects I bet. Let us hope other book written movies in the future will follow this lead.
10.0~Jon Monsarrat review: Perfect. A Fantasy movie that non-fantasy people will like. johnnymonsarrat Sign in Permalink Like many fans of the book, I walked into LOTR mentally praying "please, if there is a God, don't let them screw this up." They didn't. The movie is flawless; perfect, and pays tribute worthy of the original book. Acting, visuals, directions, perfect. If you normally don't care much for fantasy, but might be persuaded to see one, just one movie with "elves" and such, this is the one. One note, however -- check your watch when the movie starts so you will know when the ending is coming up. That way you won't get caught out in a couple of places where it "feels" like the movie might end at any moment. It is long, so be ready for that.
10.0~An inspiration Holly_Martens Sign in Permalink I really loved this movie. And a word to the many Tolkien fans out there who were "somewhat disappointed" by the film: Remember, movies are always limited, but if this film stirs interest in a few thousand new readers of the original novels, then it's succeeded. I think I've already read where the "Ring books" are selling better than ever lately. A great book and a great film are often different, but both remain great.
10.0~Awesome! Totally edge of your seat stuff! oftenwrong Sign in Permalink When I went to see LOTR/FOTR, I had no idea what I was in for. I hadn't even read The Hobbit, much less the LOTR trilogy. Was I ever in for a treat! Ian McKellan was the perfect Gandalf, as were all the other characters (I have since read all the above). Peter Jackson couldn't have picked a more middle earth-like setting (I have wanted to visit New Zealand long before seeing this movie). To say this movie was filled with the most deliciously unpleasant characters ever would be a gross understatement. How about that Balrog? Or those terrifying orcs? Or that hideous monstrosity that, with a band of orcs, attacked the nine in Moria? Or those chilling, shrieking black riders? I go to the movies mainly to get 2 or 3 hours of pure escape (probably why I prefer fantasy and sci-fi so much) and this movie accomplished that and then some. I am very impatient for The Two Towers to come out. At least I am more prepared for it and the Return of the King.
10.0~What a GREAT movie Hendy Gunawan Sign in Permalink I've seen other comments about this film and I can understand why some people said that they didn't understand the movie. My friends never read the books before. When they came out from the theater, only one comment "What a GREAT movie". They didn't understand the plot as I do (because I've read the books) but they still can enjoy it. That's why Peter Jackson has been nominated for best director. He mixed the plot, the character, the visual effect so anyone can enjoy it. And that's not an easy task for a director, even a Steven Spielberg or George Lucas. So just sit and enjoy it, don't think too much, and soon you'll realize how wonderful this movie is.
10.0~one of the best movies I have ever seen divergenceOfHumanBeings Sign in Permalink 10/10 After bashing those poor sequels of Jaws and Scream movies I really wanted to write a positive review once in a while. This movie is one of those which I rated with the highest grade possible and just let me tell few reasons why I did it. First off, Lord of the Rings is one of the finest books ever written, I have read the books about three or four times, that's once in a year because of my young age (First time I read it when I was ten or so) and always thought that this would be impossible to be changed to the big screen. I use the word 'changed' because even the movie really is a adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece, it isn't exactly the same story, if we are accurate. Lots and lots of things and events have been either replaced or deleted because of the pace and timing of the movie, for example Tom Bombadil, but I really didn't care. When I went to see the movie almost exactly one year ago --- it was also Sunday --- I felt very nervous. Was this movie going to live up the expectations I had with it? What about the actors? The set? Special effects? Boy, was I satisfied. I honestly think that the movie is brilliant. I gave 10 to the theatrical version and if it would be possible I would give 10+ to the Extended Edition which I highly recommend instead of the theatrical version which is also brilliant. The acting was superb, sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Sean Bean as Boromir, Ian Holm as Bilbo and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel were the roles I remember as the most special, although I think all of the characters suited well and all of the actors were really involved into the world of Middle-Earth. I could go on and on praising this movie, but of course, there were also some scenes I particularly missed. One of those scenes would have been the scene when Frodo knows he has to leave the Shire and he walks through the woods and greenfields of the Shire thinking about his destiny. Yes, I know --- it's what Peter Jackson said himself --- that they wanted to get on the road as quick as possible, but those scenes would've been great and in my opinion, they would've emphasised the meaning of the Shire to Frodo. Well, there were added some great scenes in the beginning to the Extended Edition and Ian Holm's narrating was a great way in introducing Hobbits to the audience. These are just some minor thoughts I have with the movie, but I must say that I am a bit excited again --- because of The Two Towers. I am going to see it tonight, almost exactly one year after the first one, but this time I am not nervous, if you know what I mean, because after seeing the first movie, I realised that this story was held in great and strong hands, when it comes to visionary.
4.0~Don't let the hype catch you **spoilers** Serva Sign in Permalink I've just been at a showing of this film today of its premier, and yes I've read the books. I do enjoy them quite a bit, however most of the things that are good with the book are somehow lost in this film. Given you can, and have to I guess, take away stuff from the book to be able to make a film out of it, this one is a good example on how you should not do that. The film starts off with a big battle. Which looks very CG. But oh well, that's how it starts. It wasn't yesterday I read it, but I can't remember the book having any of this stuff in the beginning. Do they include it just to have an excuse for an action sequence or for the exposition? If it is because of the exposition, I think they could've easily let this one and other ones out and instead tried to develop the characters. Remember this movie Star Wars? In the beginning of the first part they talk about the senate, the rebellion, the empire... You haven't got a clue what the hell these are, but the movie still works! I guess this could be because I've read the books, but they just keep on talking about all the things over and over until the seats in the theater knows exactly what it is too. The ring is indestructible. Ok, I get it. Gandalf throws it in the fire but it stays intact. Uh-huh. Gimli hits it with his axe, but its the axe that is destroyed, not the ring. I know it, already! In the film we get to see Saruman and Gandalf and Saruman's place a lot (Mordor?). In the first book Saruman and how he makes the Orcs and everything are hardly even mentioned. I think they should have let it be like that. More for your imagination to make up, you know. The story is about the fellowship of the ring right? I don't care about Saruman, I don't need him until the second book. I sense a bit of Star Wars influence here, this with showing bits of what the empire is doing all the time. In SW it works, this movie would've done fine without it. Another thing is the part where they cut down all the trees, they don't explain to the poor people who haven't read the books what is so important about that... Could be fun for them to know maybe. Or don't care about showing it, please. Also the character development is lacking. Sam, Merry and Pippin are like smaller and less extreme versions of Jar-Jar Binks. Their only purpose seem to be so they can get captured by the Orcs so a few of the fellowship guys have to go after them. They join the mission just because they are stupid and happen to show up in right in time, or something like that. Not like in the book out of friendship with Frodo. Also I think they heavily mess up the place where Gandalf fights the balrog. Again, I could be wrong, but in the book didn't Gandalf practically sacrifice himself for the rest of the fellowship? He chose to stay behind and fight it knowing he would have to go down with it too. In this movie he seems to be able to defeat the balrog and still go on, but right when he's about to go the balrog gets him with his whip and drags him along. Changes Gandalf's personality and heroism very much in my humble opinion. I do like the fight scenes however, especially the fight in the dwarf cave and the one in the end. The shaky camera is nothing but a nuisance, but other than that they are great. Gollum is very well done aswell, almost exactly the way I imagined him. Looking forward to seeing more of him in part two and three. The whole film on the other part could've been done much better. I doubt that without the popularity of the books, people wouldn't have liked it as much as they claim they do now. I was a lot younger when I saw it, but I remember enjoying the animated version from 1978 more than this one which really isn't much more than OK. Oh, and I can also mention its too long. Many of the scenes seem to drag on for very long.
10.0~The best movie you'll ever see!! rafn Sign in Permalink This is the most awe inspiring movie I have ever seen! It has battle scenes of epic proportions. It has a wonderfully humanistic nature about it. The battle between Boromir and the orcs (where Lurtz hits him 3 times with an arrow) is more like visual poetry than than a boxoffice battle scene. Wonderful movie
10.0~Bringing the book to life . . . Queen-Artorious Sign in Permalink I just want to say I love this movie because of the quality of it, the actors and actresses did wonderful, and the book was really brought to life by Peter Jackson. I just love the sense of friendships it gives you.
10.0~Quite simply the best film I have seen amosib Sign in Permalink I was wondering how good this film would be, whether it would follow the book or gloss over important parts, but it was true to the book at least as much as film can be. The characters were colourful and passionate and the story spellbinding. The film shows humour, courage, sadness and joy. The scenery was breathtaking and the action fast and furious. When I left the cinema I felt deperate that I had to wait another year for the second part and a further year after that for the final part.
3.0~Would You Die Already! greatwhite2k1 Sign in Permalink Okay everybody knows that the movie was way to long, it should have been cut to about the time they party made it to the Elven kingdom. The movie could have saved a bit of time by letting the characters die a little more quickly... but Noooo, the characters have to give their final death line... and then another... and then another... and yet again... and then die. And did they really have to show all the scenes of them walking or running or boating for so long with the camera zooming over every hill and rock following them, I liked the country side bit it was a bit much. I am a fan of the books but I have to admit the movie did open my eyes about the series. Its about walking... a lot. And dieing slowly. Well the later of the two was the movie not the book. Personally I want my money back plus interest for making me watch all the extra footage that was not needed.
10.0~An electrifying eye candy feast. mhasheider Sign in Permalink A wonder to behold and not to be taken for granted, the first chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is an electrifying eye candy feast, courtsey of director Peter Jackson and writers. The story itself isn't too hard to understand as a hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) inherits a mysterious ring from a close relative, Bilbo (Ian Holm) and unfortunately finds out who it belonged to before. So Frodo is forced to take the ring back to where it came from and he's helped from a wide (and unlikely assortment) of allies who become known as "the Fellowship". Besides the story, another element of the movie made me enjoy even more is the cast, which has to be one of the best ones ever assembled in several decades. Among the other key characters are Gandalf (Ian McKellan), a wizard: two humans, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) and Boromir (Sean Bean): Legolas (Orlando Bloom), a wise elf with excellent marksmanship: Gimili (John Rhys-Davies), an axe-wielding dwarf with a grudge: and three other hobbits (Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, and Dominic Monhagan) who make up the "Fellowship". There's some other familiar faces that appear here (Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, and Christopher Lee) who each play a key role here. Overall, the movie is bound to be a classic even though it moves at a leisurely pace and gives the viewer time to understand the characters more especially Frodo, Gandalf, and Aragorn - each of whom seem to be bothered by something in their past. One last thing, since I haven't seen "A Beautiful Mind" yet I'm sure this movie truly deserved "Best Picture" and I say it not insult the die hard fans of the series.
10.0~The most spectacular movie I have ever seen! volleyball Sign in Permalink This movie was very good quality, and highly entertaining. The movie brings out J.R.R Tolkien's wild imagination, and brilliance for creating the story of Lord of the Rings. Many interesting characters, and unique creatures are in this story. Also a great plot line, with many ups and downs which gets exciting as it keeps going. There is also some morals and lessons tucked into this movie. Some examples are: having a great and strong friendship, which also comes with sacrifice,Being courageous and strong in everything you do, having faith, care, understanding, Will power to over come obstacles, Resisting temptation, and much much more. It was very intriguing and quite intresting, in the movie itself, but also the special effects. I think it brings you out of this world and takes you on a perilous journey through the make belief world of Middle Earth.
10.0~Excellent, Bad, Mixed Views! screwoff Sign in Permalink Warning: I give some details, but NOT the ending!! I thought that the movie was fantastic. I have seen many movies, and this one was by far the best. The costumes were amazing and the backgrounds were so detailed. I refer to the part of the movie when Frodo was stabbed and Aragorn goes in search of the healing plant. The background behind Frodo shows the trolls which Bilbo told the child-hobbits about at the party. It was genius to have Cate Blanchett do the narration at the beginning of the film. I have seen this film MANY times, so I know a lot of the little details which makes the rest of the story make sense. Like, for example, Elrond was given one of the rings of power. It must have been difficult to cast for this film. It was an excellent cast! I would not have changed it at all. I was disappointed that they left out the songs, Tom Bombaddil, Goldberry, and Gil-Galad. I think that it was better than the book in some ways. For example, the character Arwen Undomiel was "beefed-up". I did not like that in the book, there were very few women. The music was incredible. Once again, it's the little details that make it awesome. For example, when Arwen Undomiel and Aragorn are talking about how much they love each other (in Rivendell), the song goes: O mor henion i dhu: [From darkness I understand the night:] Ely siriar, el sila [Dreams flow, a star shines] Ai! Aniron Undomiel [Ah! I desire Evenstar] Tiro! El eria e mor [Look! A star rises out of the darkness] I lit en el luitha 'uren [The song of the star enchants my heart] Ai! Aniron. . . [Ah! I desire. . .] I loved the film so much, that I have written some short stories, read ALL of J.R.R. Tolkein's (finished) books, and seen the movie over ten times! It might have been better, but I love it anyways! (See, I told you that I wouldn't spoil the end for you!)
10.0~Simply Amazing and Breathtaking xTHEILLUMINATIx Sign in Permalink I remember seeing this when I was only 7 years old. Now 10 years later, I have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time (behind Two Towers). The acting is simply amazing by every actor and almost all of the scenes are breathtaking. Peter Jackson has created a world that I feel is the very definition of the books. Needless to say this film (along with Two Towers) was robbed of the Best Picture award. The music gets to me every time and this is a masterpiece of all time. Elijah Wood did a good job as Frodo but the outstanding actors were Ian McKellan as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Sam, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, and of course, Andy Serkis as Gollum. A movie may never touch me like this again, so thank you Peter Jackson.
10.0~What a thrilling experience ablbodyed Sign in Permalink I just loved this movie. The effects were stunning, the scenery magnificent, and the art direction astonishing. What can one say about the story? It's exciting, SCARY, and emotional. I can hardly wait for the next one. Canny of the producers to make us wait.
10.0~More of a dedication than a review jediduck95 Sign in Permalink This is probably my favorite movie of all time (toss up with The Godfather). I know that these movie get a lot of hype but they deserve it. To start off, I was a huge star wars fan. I saw the Hobbit when I was in 4th grade and I didn't like it. My friends offered to let me read the Lord of the Rings books when I was in middle school but I declined. 2001 came along and i saw some trailers for the movie and it looked interesting. I was blown away. It offered everything: fantasy, action, adventure, horror, romance, good acting, great looking designs on everything. I never knew I liked fantasy until I saw this movie. I was hooked for life. Everything was great about this movie. I'm not sure if I can point out anything bad. The three hours seemed like 2 and I didn't want it to stop when 'Fellowship' ended. One of the big reasons I liked this movie is that they used great actors over 'movie stars' (there is liv tyler but she is hot). There are a few movies that can balance great special effects and great acting in one movie. Peter Jackson should of received best director for this movie (sorry Ron), but that's Hollywood politics. (Note: Coppolla didn't get best director for Godfather which is a bigger crime). I started reading the books after watching Two Towers (I couldn't wait another 12 months). The book 'Lord of the Rings' is a brilliant piece of work itself. There is so much imagination in that book. A lot of die hard book fans hate the movies but I wish they would admire the brilliant filmaking in this movie. This movie would be very boring if it came from directly off the book. I hope one day that more fantasy movies will look like this movie.
9.0~One of the best fantasy films of the new millenium Quinoa1984 Sign in Permalink Co-writer and producer/director Peter Jackson has masterfully transferred J.R.R. Tolkien's first chronical in his infamous trilogy into an absorbing, interesting and above all awesome picture. It is quite long, which is the film's only downside, but then in order to tell Tolkien's tale properly as many details would be necessary, thus it is never boring. This first epic starts off Frodo Biggins (Elijah Wood) on his dangerous yet crucial quest along with others like Gandolf (Ian McKellan) and Strider (Viggo Mortensen) to bring the rings back to which the fire it came from. The plot is important, but that isn't the key thing about the film that will intrigue most non-fans on Tolkien (fans of Tolkien make this a must see by the way). The picture has so much visual splendor matched with constant (yet not too constant) suspense, action and battles that it is hard to complain about the few lulls. Not the best epic fantasy I've, but it could be up there. Big props go to McKellan by the way for giving one of his best performances to date with Gandolf, though the other performances are also noteworthy. A
10.0~Sheer Genius FilmFanatic03 Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy starts off with an amazing, emotional, action packed film. This film has a wholesome feeling about it, you can't help but be affected by this film in a positive way and you can't ignore the effect it has on you. Peter Jackson manages to create a whole different world that the audience can escape into Middle Earth. This film has amazing direction with Philippa Boyens, Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson who manage to bring to life J.R.R Tolkein's epic masterpiece and you can feel that they are passionate about the project and have the utmost respect for the project and that can be evidently seen in this film. "The Lord of the Rings" has amazing moral standards as there is nothing at all offence with this film which is a breath of fresh air. I love the theme of friendship which is strong on this film, the theme of sacrifice, love and the conflict between good and evil is ongoing. Of course there is the mention of the amazing performances especially by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, and i could go on listing the rest of the cast saying they were all brilliant. Overall, a definite MUST see, a wholesome film and a great start to the trilogy.
10.0~" 2001: A Life Oddysey" MatrixG Sign in Permalink With no doubt this outstanding movie in my opinion as a trilogy with the "Two Towers" and "The Return of the King" are representing the top movies of the decade, maybe the best ever. Peter Jackson made with his movie a picture of Life with every detail of it. I haven't read the book because I have to admit I'm not a big book reader :) , but I'm sure Peter Jackson did a master job making a movie with Tolkien's book because the result is on the screen. It was told that the Lord of The Rings book can never be turned into a movie because is to complicated and long. Well... The movie's genre is Fantasy but this movie has so much themes on it that it can be considered universal. We have a superstar cast including Elijah Wood, Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean ,Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and many other great actors to give a bigger value to the movie with their performance. The Fellowship of the Ring starts the biggest adventure faced on screen what will end only in the third movie of the trilogy "The Return of the King". This picture has a loot of philosophical thoughts on it to with many unforgettable quotes ,my favorites are : -Gandalf: "All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you" -Arwen: "I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the Ages of this world alone". In my opinion Frodo's quest to destroy the One Ring is the biggest and the most greatest fight between good and evil in the history of cinema. Howard Shore's soundtrack is excellent ,Enya's May it be is the hope of better times ,exactly what the movie's end is trying to tell us. Sit back and enjoy maybe the biggest movie in history. Thank You Peter Jackson and J.R.R. Tolkien Universal and Timelles
10.0~Truly one of the greatest films ever made and is one of the best movies of all time! Movie Nuttball Sign in Permalink Minor Spoilers I finally got to see the Lord of the Rings a few days ago in the theatre and I must I was very thrilled see a huge movie of this stature. For months I wanted to see this because of several reasons but the biggest one of them was Christopher Lee! I knew he was going to be awesome in this movie which he was.This cast was great and it was a treat seeing Ian Holm in it aswell.I knew LOTR was going to be one of the greatest movies ever and I just love the scenery in this movie and the special effects were flawless and it has great music by Howard Shore. There was so much in the three hour movie that I can`t explain it all but I will say it has great battles and sword fights,and seeing the variety of character is neat like wizards,trolls,dwarfs,hobbits,elvs,and among other creatures and a awesome prolouge.This in MY opinion ranks up in the greatest of films and this is on MY favorites list now just not fantasy movies like Willow and Legend but other of MY favorites like other great films such The Mummy/The Mummy Returns,Planet of the Apes (2001),Jurassic Park trilogy,Star Wars (all four of them),Gladiator,Terminator 2,Predator,and others.I just can`t wait for the sequels to come.Be sure to get all of the LOTR action figures by Toy Biz and they look great! I was very happy to see this film and I hope everyone gets a chance to see this epic!
10.0~Best film of 2001. juliegi Sign in Permalink I think this is the best film of 2001. As an avid fan of the J.R.R. Tolkein novels, I was excited to see these being made into films. I was not disappointed by the movie which followed the books pretty faithfully without getting too long and drawn out. All of the acting was great and the special effects well-done. I cannot wait to see the 2nd and 3rd films.
10.0~One of cinema's greatest triumphs ! The_Princess Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson leaves nothing to chance in his phenomenal interpretation of J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy classic 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'. The film is an all-round feast for the eyes, with Academy Award winning cinematography, magical set design, intricate costume and props, and outstanding performances from some of the world's most talented actors and actresses. Jackson succeeds in bringing the realm of Middle Earth, dreamed up by J.R.R. Tolkien, to life, in the first leg of a greatly anticipated and already highly acclaimed cinematic adaptation. Even audiences that typically steer clear of fantasy films will be enthralled and ensnared by Peter Jackson's epic work. Romance, sword-fighting, perfect scenery, and a gripping plotline (as well as the odd tinge of comedy), ensure that there is something for everybody in what is truly a masterpiece of literature, and now, film. The two wizards J.R.R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson leave audiences eagerly awaiting the next two installments of the trilogy.
10.0~LOTR = Magic art_or_Art Sign in Permalink There is no more powerful of a movie out there than that of the fellowship and then so on with the rest of the trilogy. Peter Jackson and cast are ingenious. It is the Star Wars of our generation as far as film making goes. This movie captures the essence of Tolkien and the spirit of film making. I can't say enough about these films. I hope that you take this advice to heart. If you haven't seen this movie or the others see it at whatever cost. I know that it is long and could be a movie that you haven't seen because of its length. As I stated earlier however it is a film making breakthrough. Another high for this movie is the soundtrack. Unbelievable music that makes you feel the movie as though it were real life. Thank You for your time and i hope this helps a little bit.
10.0~Great Everything Jawa11182 Sign in Permalink In all my years of going to the movies, this movie has to be one of the top ten. The Lord of the Rings works well in so many levels. I like the way that Peter Jackson portrays the movie and the certain camera angles that he uses (For example the Depth of Field). Not only does he show the characters journey, but he also shows the beautiful world of Middle Earth. The actors all played their roles well and deserve only good things to say by the audience. This movie made me feel like I was a part of the journey, of the fellowship and it made me feel like I was living in the world of Middle Earth. Some said it was too long. Well it was supposed to be I mean it was a journey. Besides it was not really that long to a fan. It went pretty fast for me and others I went with said the same thing. Lord of the Rings had great acting, great camera work, great visuals, great music, great directing, great everything. Kudos to Peter Jackson and the rest of the crew of Lord of the Rings. This movie deserves a 10
10.0~Just one thing to say... daughterjudy2002 Sign in Permalink I think a lot of you people that are complaining about the movie need to read the books, over half of you admitted to not reading the books first. If that is the case, go get the book and read it now that you've seen the movie and maybe you'll realize how good of a movie it is. If it wasn't for the movie, I never would have read the book, and once you read the book, you realize that they have a better adaption than oh, let's just say "Jurassic Park" for example. The movie makes a whole lot more sense once you've read the book, trust me.(oh and for those of you that said that they didnt say the origination of the ring WATCH THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE!)
10.0~"The crownless again shall be king..." Prestige_Never_Pride Sign in Permalink I confess to say that I did not see the first two LOTR films in theaters. The fact of the matter was that my sister was 6 years old and scared easily, so my father wouldn't take her. So, my father went on his own to see them. I did, however get to see Return of the King in theaters. I was entranced. I was 12 years old at the time, and I didn't understand the story. But I was captivated. When Pippin sang his song, I was in tears. At the very end, I was sobbing. The sense of beauty it had...I couldn't even describe it. So, I watched the first two movies respectively with my father. And now I was within Middle-Earth. I read the books the same month that I saw all three films. Simultaneously, in fact. That is my admiration story. What can I say about this movie that won't fill a novel? Where do I start? I suppose with Peter Jackson. I was so struck to learn how these beautiful works of art, Tolkien's magnum opus, inspired him to want to take on such a daunting yet gratifying task. He saw more in those books than I had read from them, and I'm glad that a dedicated fan brought these jewels to screen. Thank you, Mr. Jackson! The cast? Absolutely beautiful. Their friendship is so apparent, so close, not faked as you see in many other movies. Not one actor in those three films were bad. Yes, you heard me. So those of you who said that the casting was terrible, let me say to you: "Not all those who wander are lost." Elijah Wood, who is a very gifted and bright young man, has such an incredible beauty (inside and out) to portray such a conflicted and fatalistic character. His own striking idealism, innocence, and understanding was such that you fell in love with Frodo at first sight, but not to the point where he seemed weak. Elijah is Frodo incarnate, and anyone else would have ruined the role. Sean Astin, another very bright young man, shows his warm wisdom as Samwise, as well as a courage the likes of which I have never seen before in any performance. He had such an aura of honesty and kindliness that it shone like a light on screen. His friendship with Frodo (Elijah respectively) is so obvious and true on-screen, and not a sappy, cheesy "Hollywood" special. Friendships that are too sappy (and fake) will kill a movie, but this one was so obviously real and strong that it touched we fans in such a deep way (for those who could appreciate it). I can't say everything I would like to about these movies. The marriage of deep friendship, dedication, and beautiful, realistic special effects creates an entrancing epic that will be hard to rival by any movie. Those who negatively rated these movies, did you actually pay any attention to the screen as you watched the movie? For those who have never seen these movies, please, do. The deep bonds shared by these actors, all of them, are so beautifully shown, and the cast clearly underwent a lot of stress (For those who own the Extended Versions of these movies, you might hear some horror stories from Astin, Wood, Mortensen, Serkis, and more, if you listen to the documentaries/commentaries), but it is clear that they love their roles, and it shines through in their voices, their faces, and especially their acting. I neglected to mention the efforts of the crew. Without them, over 5,000 people strong, these movies would not have been possible. They created Middle Earth in such way that it seemed possible to be a shadow of our past: a past world on Earth that faded away long before our time. Thanks be to them. Yes, there are differences from the books. There always are, in any adaptation. I saw that some people commented about how weak a character they thought Frodo seemed compared to the book, because several moments in which he looks Evil in the face were shortened/changed in the film version. That isn't true. Not at all. True heroism means not only defending others, but accepting aid from others. True heroism means that one accepts that they can't do everything alone, and accepts the aid of those willing to give it. THAT is true heroism. Frodo shows that in every light, even if it isn't always obvious. You can see with much more than your eyes... Overall, if these were the last movies I thought worthwhile enough to watch (I hope cinema doesn't become that bad), it would be fine by me. Thanks to all of the people who brought this to us, the LOTR fans. To my fellow fans, I say: "May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out." 10/10, and then some.
10.0~This movie made me a fan of the books... Raptor in Black Sign in Permalink I've been a fan of sci-fi and fantasy since the first time I ever picked up a book. But years ago, when I honestly tried to read the LOTR books, I just couldn't get into them. The first book was pondorous and slow and I couldn't get a feel for who was who. Thus, I gave up. And so, when this movie came out, I expected a computer-graphics and cinemegraphic feast, but a plot that would only get the true, long, hard-core fans of the books engaged. I was totally wrong. I sat through most of the movie with my mouth open. Literally. The plot is epic, archetypcally epic, and I was astounded by the great sense of scale that the movie conveys. The dialouge, which had once confused and bored me in written form, made much more sense with skilled actors dictating it on screen with emotion and emphasis. And the eye-candy...sweet gods, the eye candy. The landscape was perfectly chosen, and the cinematography literally the best I have ever seen in a movie. Ever. All the flyover shots and battle-scenes were visionary. The CGI was exquisite, in my expert opinion. When the Balrog came on screen, I sat up in my chair with an open, shocked smile on my face the likes of which I haven't done since I saw Jurassic Park in the theater in 3rd grade. The movie had me totally engaged, and I vivdly remember glancing at my watch half-way in and thinking to myself, "Excellent! We still have another good hour or so to go!" Afterwards, over Winter Break, I went to the library and checked out the books again. Now the plot made much more sense, as I had mental images of the characters and places. I am anxiously awaiting the next two movies, and am proud to say that I am a Fan.
10.0~I laughed, I cried, I saw it again and again and again... canadiankewlgrrl Sign in Permalink When I first saw this wondrous movie, I was against it. Then the light exploded, and Middle-earth was brought to me, in a way I had never envisioned, nor even heard of. Ian McKellen (sp?) surpassed my wildest dreams as Gandalf, as did every other member of the cast. Never before have I been so entranced by a movie on the silver screen. I was blown out of my seat by the Power of the sound effects, the beauty of the scenery, and the overall stunning world of Middle-earth which Peter Jackson has created. The music was overpowering, as I had to ask many people for extra tissues. This is an Oscar worthy movie. This is MORE than an Oscar-worthy movie, it's a Legend conceived. This is why I have been to the movies 7 times already, and am going back for more. It was humorous, dramatic, stunning, and spell-binding. An once-in-a-lifetime undertaking. If I could rate this film, I would. But it can rate itself. Kudos to Jackson, and everyone.
10.0~Part One: With Help, Even the Impossible Can Be Achieved mstomaso Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases. The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire. At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled "Fellowship", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse. For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them. Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books. The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power. Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world. Very highly recommended.
10.0~I love this movie rdowney Sign in Permalink I can't remember a time where I have been compelled to see a movie in the cinema twice. The first time I saw it, I was blown away. The second time, I could sit back and enjoy it completely. Some of the highlights (not in order)- 1. The transformation of Frodo from carefree hobbit, to someone with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Elijah Wood was fantastic. You could see the change in his eyes. 2. Gandalf- Sir Ian McKellan, need I say more? 3. Bilbo- I had tears in my eyes in every scene he was in. 4. The fellowship mourning the death of Gandalf- It was understated but extremely moving. 5. Enhancing some of the female characters- Yes, the purists will hate it, but reading the book as a young girl, it was hard not to feel a bit 'left out' of the adventure. 6. Legolas- a magnificent presence (but I felt that more information could have been given about his background and motivation for joining the fellowship) 7. Cinematography, costumes, cgi, script, direction- the attention to detail was amazing(hand-crafting of weaponry, New Zealand scenery), and there was a sense that the director nurtured and appreciated the actors' craft (as opposed to George Lucas, for example). 8. The quality of acting in general- I was so happy that no big Hollywood 'names' were used. It would have detracted from the ensemble nature of the characters. 9. The score- subtle, happily lacking the bombastic 'John Williams' touch. When I first heard that Peter Jackson had taken on the Tolkien trilogy, I was both scared and excited. Scared, because it was such a momentous task, and excited because I truly believe that he is one of the few directors who could accomplish it. I have seen and enjoyed all his films to date, and I believe that he is one of the most talented directors currently working. His achievement sends a strong message to struggling and aspiring directors, that you don't need to be a Hollywood yes-man to succeed. If the Oscars have any integrity left, this film and the people who worked on it, should be strong contenders. I would love to know how he persuaded NewLine to stake their future on these films. It would make a great book, or maybe they could include it on the DVD :-)
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is one of my favorite all-time films. motykaandr Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is one of my favorite all-time films. There are some reasons why. First of all, the casting was great. All the characters were in theme. The filming location was great because it was filmed in New Zealand, and that is a nice country. Bilbo Baggins house looks exactly like the front cover of The Hobbit novel. Everything in the film was as I pictured it. I liked the trick photography in which the hobbits appear to be half the size of wizards and men. However, one thing I disliked about this film was its length. Three hours is way too long. Overall, this film is one you must buy.
5.0~One note witless ceremonial drivel oleh_k Sign in Permalink No life, no cleverness, just one never-ending fight against overwhelming forces of inept evil. Preposterous pontifications delivered by cartoonish characters are middle school deep. Boring and irksome. 5/10 for visuals
9.0~Beginning to a Great Fantasy Epic TheHande Sign in Permalink "The Fellowship of the Ring" is an excellent movie. Very charming and personified. The story at this point in the film seems well organised as opposed to the later "Return of the King" where the characters seem to get lost due to the size of the film. Undoubtedly there were a lot of deviations from the source material, but I think that only helped the movie gain more momentum which I feel is very important in any film-adaption. Jackson has a way of inserting funny little moments that also make the movie all the more memorable and already the action-scenes are very convincing although "The Two Towers" is undoubtedly the real action-packed section of the film-trilogy. If there's anything I don't like about this film is that the opening seemed to glance over many of the events quite quickly. Of course this was used as an excuse to return to these events later in the film and the series, but in comparison I had always liked Bakshi's LotR opening a lot better. Regardless, this is a fantastic film.
10.0~I Don't Know if They Could Do It Much Better Hitchcoc Sign in Permalink I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.
10.0~captures spirit arkiver-1 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has achieved a masterpiece... I think it's a crime this movie was only recognized on the technical front at the Academy awards. This movie's got everything... action, drama, comedy. The effects are amazing, and unlike some other recent big movies, the acting is stellar as well. The casting is outright amazing, don't think I'll ever be able to picture anyone else in any of these roles. The movie, while not a literal interpretation, captures the spirit of the Tolkien books absolutely. Can't wait for the DVD...
10.0~OH-MY-GOD!!!!!! EirikSS Sign in Permalink I have seen Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth. It is beyond everything I ever wanted it to be. And then some. Having read the books several times, I was hoping for this film to be a candidate to my all time favorites. Now it is. I've been following the production of these movies for a long, long time now. On my computer, I have those storyboard-drawings from long back, that was shown on NZTV. You all know; the one with Gimli, an axe and the other with a hobbit looking scared into the camera. I remember when Miramax wanted to make just two movies. I remember the first geeks seeing Sean Connery in Wellington, instantly screaming `Gandalf spotted in Wellington'. I remember a photo of a constructing-worker digging hobbitholes. I remember when Ian McKellen signed, to much relief. My room is covered with the posters for the movie: Frodo holding the Ring, looking anxiously at us, looking down The Pillars of Argonath towers over my desk. I have a wall covered with photos from the film My room is a Geeks' confessing to his love for Middle-Earth. And yesterday I went there. And OH-MY-GOD! This is one of the best films ever! I do not want to spoil anything for those who haven't read the books, but I promise you; this is one movie you will never forget! The casting is superb, almost to perfect to be true. Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Been, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin etc. They are all great!! The effects are stunning and "invicible", the editing-costumes-make up-music-EVERYTHING is put together beyond expectations. Look at the clothes Bilbo is wearing, listen to the music after the Balrog has done its' business, watch the editing in the Nazgul-Bree sequence. But above all, the cinematrography is extraordinary. Andrew Lesnie's camera is everywhere and it makes you wonder: "How the ¤%¤&"#& did they get a camera in that position?" The directing, the script, the rest of the GOD DAMN stuff is so good! I can't wait to get back in the theatre, to get back to Middle-Earth. I love the last scene, I love when Gandalf rides thru the Shire, I love the Hobbits cocking food in the deep mountains, I love the sound the Nazguls make, I love the first vision (Yes, it is a vision) of Arwen, I love the voice of Galadriel AND I LOVE THIS MOVIE! THANK YOU PETER!!!! Eirik
10.0~Fantastic! conger47 Sign in Permalink Growing up you imagine many things..Some of sporty stuff some of big city and the lights..Well, as i grew up i always wanted to live back long ago..To know how it was to experience it first hand. So i played outside thinking i was some mystical place. When i turned 11 (shortly after) The Lord of The Rings came out and i was SO HAPPY! I remember in school reading "The Hobbit" and knowing the book, well it got me excited. Id love to travel the lands of Mordor and have parties with the hobbits in the Shire. And just the bonds they had as they traveled to carry out a mission, well that was just amazing. Great movie all round..If you have never seen it or wasn't to sure if you'd like it..Give it a try. Trust me you will like it!
10.0~This is Fantasy! Sessin Sign in Permalink Allright! This one really gives you a new hope for this genre,I mean there has been a couple of good fantasy movies through the years but now there is something new to beat. I mean after movies like this. Who wants to come up with a fantasy movie about some muscle dude with a sword an a couple of chicks beside him. In This case the movie of course is based on a great book where you can find as much inspiration for new stories as Tolkien was inspired by old nordic mythology. I read the book again afterwards and its funny how you picture all the scenes that Peter Jackson did not want in the movie. I mean You imagine the actors in scenes you never have seen. Thats interesting. Also a debate where you disscuss wich scenes should be in the movie should be interessting.
10.0~Not just for the dedicated fantasy fans! SpiritWolf77 Sign in Permalink Okay, I'm really not a big fan of fantasy. I'm a scifi fanatic at heart and just tend to not get into fantasy films. This movie, however, was excellent. I'd not read the books before seeing it. I'd been terrified by the animated version when I was very little, and therefore avoided anything having to do with LotR until now. I found the preview interesting, and was curious as to what all the hype was about. So I went and saw the movie. I was completely blown away. This film did not just have an excellent plot (which of course is tolkien's doing) but it was a beautiful film. The scenery was astounding, the lighting, the sets....it all kept my eyes glued to the screen. And the music was excellent as well. The characters were very believable. You really forgot for the time that you were sitting in a theater, and got really into the story. I've since started reading the books. Different as they are from my usual choices of Star Trek and Dune, I'm really enjoying them, and glad that this film inspired me to look into something I missed out on when I was younger. I recommend this film for anyone who appreciates a good story, good characters, and a visually pleasing movie...not just the fantasy fans!
10.0~THE BEST FILM EVER MADE!!!! sur4dude03 Sign in Permalink This movie could not have been better!! Peter Jackson smothers you in a world of enchantment and shows you things you never want to forget!! People might say that it was to unreal and the wizard's duel was dumb and to 'magical'! Thats where the term "F-A-N-T-A-S-Y" comes in!! This was an epic adventure with no flaws at all!! This amazing film, although it did not get BEST PICTURE ( WHICH IS BECAUSE THE AWARD PICKERS ARE WAITING UNTIL THE 3RD INSTALLMENT IS MADE), this is truly the greatest movie that has ever been made. It takes you back to Middle Earth and never lets you go, Lord of the Rings is amazing, enchanting, engrossing, incredible, enthralling, thrilling, terrific, and above all, PERFECT!!!!!!
8.0~A short review for a very long film. BA_Harrison Sign in Permalink Although it may not be entirely faithful to the book, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy perfectly captures the essence of J.R.R. Tolkein's fantasy classic: it's magical, imaginative and completely unforgettable, but also extremely long and a little hard going at times. Those who stay the distance, however, seem to agree that a bit of perseverance is well worth it in the end. The Fellowship of the Ring is perhaps the most laborious of the three films, what with the setting up of the plot, the introduction of a multitude of characters, and several talky scenes eating into the 171 minutes running time, but thankfully the film's impressive fantasy fighting action, breath-taking scenery, and amazing performances more than make up for the duller moments. All in all, I found The Fellowship of the Ring to be an admirable start for this ambitious attempt at bringing Tolkein's complex fantasy epic to the screen.
10.0~simply one of the best movies of our times cripler82 Sign in Permalink LOTR: The Fellowship... is a work of art. It´s true, it is a super-high budget production made for all audiences, but it´s also a work of love done by one of the geniuses of modern cinema: of course, i´m talking about mr. Peter Jackson, a director whose versatility has been proved through his work. If you´re a true cinema lover and you want to watch something "different", then watch his other masterpieces: Braindead, Bad Taste, Meet the feebles and the more "popular" Heavenly Creatures. Also, you have to know that the novel is undoubtly better than the movie, because it´s more complete, things are explained in a deeper way and the characters development is also better written. After all, we´re talking about a book that has more than 1.200 pages. Considering this, we should recognize the great work done in the movie, because even though there are complete narrative lines missing, we are still able to see the essence of the novel, and all the important elements are there. This elements were taken seriously by the people who worked in the movie, so we can see a mature ouvre, which is really inspirational and detailed in every sense. Finally, I have to say that this movie is an example of how fantasy movies should be like (watch and learn mr. Columbus and the others that want to go on with a fantasy story). From now on, LOTR will be the model for all the movies in the genre to come, and it also will be THE TRILOGY of the XXIst century. Cheers to you Peter
10.0~Peter Jackson, I salute you.... KGersen Sign in Permalink First things first - I've read LOTR probably 3/4 times. & the Silmarillion and bits of the Unfinished Tales and yadda yadda yadda....I however have grown up enough to know that LOTR (the book) is for many a great novel because it relates to when they first read it...it is great within it's context but not the greatest book ever or any of that tosh...IMHO all lists are bunkum anyway. So having got that off my chest, here is another confession....I was worried, very, very worried about LOTR on the big screen. Would it be a 'Krull', a 'Willow', a 'Beastmaster', a.........urgh,,,Dungeons & Dragons? You know what I mean...fantasy is damn hard to do. The Tolkien imitators that plague the bookshelves prove this as do the whole stackfull of cheesy, hammy fantasy movies with cheesy, hammy names chasing after magical McWidgets to save the nation / planet / galaxy / universe from eternal damnation. I had prepared a crushing hex for Peter Jackson if he inflicted this fate upon LOTR. But there was a sign of hope, like Glamdring's pale fire in the smoke and flames of the Balrog (er, enough of that) - 3 films. Not 1 mish-mashed jampacked farce-fest. No, 3 full-length films giving the book's epic scale a chance to work it's wonder on the filmgoers. Well Peter Jackson pulled it off - by resolutely avoiding the 'big-name' actors, by insisting on New Zealand for filming, by used WETA for effects, by nipping & tucking the story where required (I suspect even Jackson could not have kept Tom Bombadil from looking like total clown), by expanding where needed (another writer is very correct that Arwen's importance is only clear in the book during the Appendix). If you don't like fantasy one little bit...which makes me wonder where exactly your imagination resides....then even with this appalling handicap LOTR 'Fellowship of the Ring' can still enthrall you. If you love the book, the film still does the trick. If you just like being contrary for the sake of it then I guess you won't like this film. But then I doubt you like much else in life either.
10.0~...and a word about the score ntbeeke Sign in Permalink I pick up the books every year, usually in the fall, and keep on reading til spring. It's almost as if PJ has been looking over my shoulder and noting where my bookmarks linger. He managed to include every page and scene I make a point of reading and re-reading. And now I have this magnificent music to go along with it. This score has been like water on parched ground. Oh, the scenes it conjures in the mind! The temporary triumph of A Journey in the Dark, the stunning sadness of the Bridge of Khazad Dum, and the savageness of Amon Hen are almost too much to bear. BRAVO! Howard Shore!
10.0~The best film ever !!! einsamkeit Sign in Permalink Yes, Peter Jackson took some liberties from the book but that doesn't matter when the result is a beautiful and extraordinary film like this one. It's amazing how you find lines from the book in scenes that were created for the film and those lines are sometimes more important in the film that when they're mentioned in the book, for example Boromir in Lothlorien speaking of Gondor that is a description in the ROTK and the words are more beautiful when Boromir speaks them. The different fantastical worlds where the Fellowship passes are amazingly created. The special effects are the best I've seen; the music is incredibly beautiful. Excellent actings, specially Sean Bean and Ian McKellen. Every detail in this film was carefully done, from the weapons, clothes, scenery, sounds, music, special effects. Without any doubt Peter Jackson is the greatest director of these days, so move on overrated Spielberg because a man of real talent has revealed himself with the most extraordinary film ever done.
10.0~The Perfect Movie jiffygallant Sign in Permalink It is the perfect Movie. The story, characters, action, and effects are all unmatched by anything that has ever been produced. It is even a better movie than it is book. What the book did for literature, this movie does for cinema. Any movie fan will enjoy this movie, having read the book or not. If you havent seen The Fellowship of the Ring, see it. It will warm your heart, excite your soul, and take you to place you have never been.
10.0~Start of a journey citical-96 Sign in Permalink I think the Fellowship of the Ring is the best movie of the trilogy. Some people may say that Tom Bombadil's missing is a huge problem but i don't accept this because Peter Jackson could grab the mood of the books. Totally. But why is the movie(s) is/are enthralling? Lets take a look! 1. The music In the Fellowship of the Ring ( and in the other two movies, for sure ) the music is a very important point. They could ruin all the movies with some horrible melody but they didn't destroy anything. Nay! Richard Wagner and Howard Shore did unbelievable job. The music in the movies are not only hiding in the background and smiling to the people. No. The music is fighting, crying and being happy with the players and this is very rare, very rare stuff in film industry. 2. Elves elves elves! Well, this is my own opinion but i love elves! I love they history, they weapons and songs and i love their pointed ears too. So, the casting and the masking were perfect. The elves in the movie like the elves in the books and every single time when i hear the song of the elves i have goose-skin. 3. Oh, the old landscape... Yes, the scenery is wonderful. The mountains, rivers, the sky is living on the screen. You can feel the wind on your skin and smell the grass in The Shire. 4. One Ring rule them all! Sorry everybody, i can't say any bad about this movie (or about the trilogy). I tried figure out something wrong or something sad but i couldn't find anything. This movie is perfect as Gandalf's beard. Watch it and enjoy J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderful and majestic world.
1.0~I heard the hype....watched the thing......and hated it! KD_113 Sign in Permalink Seriously it isn't that good! I can think of much better films that deserve our attention like GoodFellas, The Godfather, Raiders of the Lost Ark or Last of the Mohicans. Yes the book was good but really did it warrant a three hour blinking movie that bored me to death? People collectively just liked it because it used alot of special effects and used the success of the book. What happened people taste?
10.0~This is the sort of movie you can watch a 1.000 times sebastian-wallin-pederse Sign in Permalink I have given this movie the rating of 10 because it is one of the few movies ever made that has a good plot, great acting, great cgi, great music and use of locations. The movie is quite long so if it was not for me actually finding landscapes and places seen in the film interesting i would fall a sleep. Because there is a lot of walking and a lot of time used on showing these landscapes. I think it is hardly possible to make a better start than depicted in this movie. It tells you the most essentiel stories to understand the plot and enjoy the movie. The plot pretty much follows the one from the books. there is some small modifications in which was more realistic than it would be to follow the book. for an example i can't really see how it would be essentiel for the movie to see the Hobits walk in the forrest and meeting a sort of wizard, that would tell them to go to Bree. The movie has the most important scenes from the book and it pays out well. I think all characters showed nothing less than their very best and it made it much easier to follow the story and feel the atmosphere and feelings in the movie. The cgi is superbly used in this movie. There is not to much and what is used is used splendidly. The cgi is well used in the making of Mordor and Moria not to mention the Balrog and the eye. The usage of music is hardly found better in any other movie. The way it lays a tune and sets the mood still surprises me and really no other movies have done that. for an example when our main characters run out of Moria after just having lost their companion Gandalf. The way the music lays the mood in this scene is just superb. Not to mention the music for the ending is quite fitting for the movie. The use of the landscape is extremely well used. The way they show us the landscape of the country New Zealand is extraordinary. We have a lot of landscape motion clips from above to just truly show us what a great place middle earth is. overall i love this movie and give it a 10/10. i have watched this movie about a 100 times and loved it 90 of the times. i have read the books after seeing the movies a lot of times and i must say i prefer what Jackson changed from the book. If you haven't watched it yet, WTF are you then waiting for?
10.0~Don't miss it! davidgor Sign in Permalink Among thousands of movies I watched as an avid cinema-goer, "The Lord of The Rings - Fellowship of The Ring" has a most unique and separate place. The movie is vivid (did not notice how I spent the 3.5 hours), exciting (jumped off the armchair more than a few times), very much impressive (awesome battle sequences and intriguing dialogues) and a real treat to the eye (could any body show me another movie that could photograph so many landscapes at such breathtaking beauty?). I suggest strongly to all those who have read the masterpiece and also to those who have not, to go and be deeply impressed by the wonders this movie has to offer. And to those who watched and rated it with a vote lower than '6', I have but one suggestion; Please, oh please do something about your unrelenting tastelessness and try to eradicate your prejudice about films that deliver so much more than tacky (and suffacatingly boring) action and/or drama scenes...
10.0~awesome!!! Schizophrenic-Penguin Sign in Permalink at first i didn't want to see this movie. you see, i had never read the books, and i thought it looked stupid. but my brother talked me into seeing it the day it came out...and i absolutly loved it! it's now my favorite movie. the animation and all that stuff was awesome, especially the make-up. it outlined the book perfectly, for after i had seen the movie, i read the book. i thought rivendell was so kewl looking and that they couldn't have gotten a better cast. now i'm just THE BIGGEST elijah wood fan. 1 cuz he's hot, 2 cuz he's hot and 3 cuz he's hot. hey i'm 13, whaddya expect from me? well, other than the fact that elijah wood is hot *hint hint at the fact that i put fact and not opinion*, i luved the movie. nobody could have done it better than peter jackson. a standing ovation i say!
10.0~Must see movie. Bewitched Sign in Permalink When I first heard this movie was coming out, I had no interest in seeing it. I finally got around to seeing it in March, so I only had the opportunity to see it twice in theaters. I've been counting down the days until the DVD comes out since the day I saw it! This is a MUST SEE MOVIE. I can't wait until the next two come out!
10.0~The Best Film Of The New Millennium (So Far...) loogenhausen Sign in Permalink Look...Don't listen to the stodgy critics and the disgruntled loser fan boys: this is a great and beautiful work of art. The sheer magnitude and scope of the movie alone is astonishing. A lot of people out there fail to grasp the concept that literature and film are two radically different forms of entertainment (mind you, I emphasize entertainment). Just because the film version of a book does not have certain parts in it or a few characters have been altered for pacing sake, doesn't mean that it's not a worthy adaptation. Comparing a book and a movie is like comparing the Peloponnesian Wars with the War On Drugs. Why would you want to? ...Exactly. The fact of the matter is that I seriously doubt a better film version of Fellowship could ever be made. The very spirit of the book - adventuresome and epic but human and personal at the same time - has been captured excitingly in Peter Jackson's film. I'm not even going to waste my time with explaining the plot or characters because those are by now a foregone conclusion. Every single performance in this film is top notch. I didn't notice a bad line delivery or breaking of character nor "phoning in of lines" at all. 3 hours of epic fun is really what this is. I repeat the word epic because this is the best word to describe the film. Epic. It is the definition of the word. Never before has there EVER been a film that has captured the essence of the fantasy epic like this one; and judging by this first chapter, the entire trilogy will be a towering achievement in the least. Legend? Nope. Willow? Nah. Krull? Please. Dragonslayer? Nice Try. The classic Sinbad films and Clash Of The Titans are the only ones that even come close to touching this baby in the greatness department. But there's no stop motion animation here folks. The effects, the scenery and the actors all blend together to create a fantastic world of grandeur and excitement. Not once while watching did I say "that looks so fake" or "he's not right for the part" or even "this is too long, is it over yet?" A movie like this needs to be AT LEAST 3 hours to tell a coherent story and to get the essence of the book nailed down. That's where Bakshi's animated 2-hour effort from the 70's Tolkien revival failed. Sure, there are a few things that keep Jackson's movie from being 'perfect' - sometimes the pacing seems a little repetitious and there are a few moments that ordinary viewers who are not fans of the book might be confused with. But these are so minor compared to the rest of the film that they're hardly noticeable. BOTTOM LINE: This is simply bliss for any fantasy/action/epic fan or even the casual moviegoer looking for a grand ol' yarn to settle down to. The best movie of the new millennium by far (I know, it's only been a few years, but this film will undoubtedly stand the test of time) and an instant classic. See it. Rent it. Buy it. Watch it. Again. And Again. And Again. It'll never be enough. It has an insanely high re-watch value. And that, my friends, is priceless in the movie world.
10.0~Great introduction into Tolkien's world. therevue8 Sign in Permalink This is a great epic, and this film ` which is the first of the trilogy' makes you feel right at home with heroic characters that you can care for, and great cinematic landscapes that is truly breathtaking. Great acting all around especially from Ian Mckellen and Elijah Wood, and a great score by Howard Shore makes this a great introduction in this great series.
10.0~It was really good! Legolas_13 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson is a genius, in my opinion. He did a superb job on doing this trilogy, and the first movie shows how well the next two might, and probably WILL be! With the exception of excluding Tom Bombadil, and inserting Liv Tyler where she is not welcome, I think that it is well worth seeing, and I advise everyone to buy it, especially the extended DvD version....... ~SindarinElf~
10.0~LOTR:TFOTR has become my favorite movie of all time! Argon52 Sign in Permalink It is impossible to tell how much I loved this movie. I really look forward to seeing the DVD and hope that the characters and two-three sub-plots are added, but I really look forward to seeing the rest. This movie is almost exactly as I remembered it in my mind as I read the books! Now that is the highest compliment I could give for a movie! Great Job!!!!!!!
10.0~Great! KiM328 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings was amazing! Elijah Wood played great Frodo. He had acted greatly as sad, happy, etc. They all looked so real! The way they changed the sizes of the characters was very cool. They looked as if they were 4 or 3 feet tall. The animation was very good in fight scenes, creepy parts, and the strange animals. Climax, to me, was when Frodo(Elijah Woods) held out the rings & "tested" them. He could not trust anyone who would not pass. Keeping the story alive was held up by everyone playing there parts very well. As in being mean or nice when needed. Not much of an ending, but it leaves you hanging. Overall: GREAT!
10.0~Excellent Adventure designed to yank you out of the daily ritual. tecort Sign in Permalink This truly is one of the best movies I have seen with excitement and adventure. Even though the story is evidently known the dramatization of it is superb, well crafted and great effort has been made to the small details. You will enjoy this movie regardless of your prior knowledge of the series. This first installment engulfs you and leaves you with anticipation of the other forthcoming sequels. This will no doubt be the best series even better than the Star Wars!! Bottom line just go see it you will not regret it in any capacity.
5.0~LOTR: The Video Game The_Core Sign in Permalink I really don't understand the hype and attention surrounding this film. It basically plays out like a video game version of the book. Are people so bereft of imagination that they have to see it up on a screen in order to really enjoy it? As an avid reader, I occasionally run across a book that makes me think "gosh, this would really make a great movie." In fact, after reading Stephen King's "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" years before it was made into a film, I thought about that -- and the rest is history. Many have commented that LOTR is one of those stories that just don't translate well to the big screen, so what's the point? And in my opinion, it honestly didn't translate well to the screen. The story feels rushed, the action sequences feel like a video game and unless someone has read the books, it's impossible to care about the fates of any of the characters. No matter what people say, this film is primarily by fans, for fans -- and that isn't a formula that translates into any kind of quality. What has happened to people? How could this passable yet ultimately mediocre screen translation have made it to #1 on the IMDB? I suspect it's because people are really wanting a continuation of the saga of Middle Earth, which I understand... being a big fan of LeGuin's "Earthsea" trilogy, I wanted more books featuring Ged's adventures among the islands too (the fourth book was almost a "sellout"). But I wouldn't want to see the Earthsea trilogy butchered like "FOTR" through translation to a format that's totally unsuitable. LOTR might have made a great, high-budget miniseries, but condensing each book into ~3 hours is just flat-out impossible, it's butchery. Murder by camera lens. I'm sure the video game (coming soon, no doubt) will sell millions of copies, because apparently that's what people want... an escape into imagination and fantasy, and for some reason this particular story is "it" to many people. There's nothing wrong with that, but why aren't the books good enough? You have to have Tolkien's subtlety browbeaten into you with "The Mummy" style CGI and sound effects, too? 10/10 for the book series, 5/10 for the movie (great visuals, poor everything else).
10.0~An Amazing Movie with an Amazing Cast! Accalia Connor Sign in Permalink Quick SYNOPSIS: Bilbo Baggins is eleventy-one, and decides it's time to do what he's "waited far too long" to do. He leaves his home in The Shire for good, and Frodo Baggins, his first and second cousin, inherits all of Bilbo's possessions. There is a mysterious Ring among these... The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of the tale of Frodo Baggins and his quest to destroy the One Ring. As the Ringbearer in the Fellowship of nine, Frodo must do what should have been done many years ago... or risk the possible destruction of life in Middle-earth as he has always known it. My first OPINION: I'm in love with this film! The casting is excellent, and the acting is far, far above-par. The changes are necessary, and for the most part are quite well-done. Also, the music is mind-blowing. The MUSIC: Forget Moulin Rouge! This is what real film music is. It makes you feel everything. There are glimmers of hope in the worst situations and dissonances in the most appropriate spots. Enya also does a great job with both of her songs for the film. The soundtrack is exceptional, reminiscent of all the greatest themes of Hollywood soundtracks. Yet it manages to be unique, and has a real Middle-earthy feel that allows it to be epic in one moment, and folksy the next. The CAST: Sir Ian McKellen is intense, and almost frighteningly inspiring as Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood plays a very convincing, though not absolutely perfect Frodo Baggins. Christopher Lee gives the audience delightful chills as a perfectly evil Saruman. Sean Astin is an adorable Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, Dominic Monaghan is a wonderfully intuitive Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck, and Billy Boyd is hilarious as Peregrin "Pippin" Took. Viggo Mortensen is simply amazing as Aragorn, though not entirely like the book character. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies are almost scene-stealing as Legolas and Gimli, respectively. Liv Tyler gives a surprisingly good performance in this film as Arwen, and Cate Blanchett is a beautiful, if slightly exaggerated, Galadriel. Hugo Weaving is a true delight as Elrond, and Sean Bean's portrayal of Boromir is nothing short of spectacular. Sir Ian Holm was often a little too dramatic for my taste as Bilbo Baggins, but was a treat nonetheless. Have I gone on about the cast enough? They're amazing! Everything ELSE: The scenery is awe-inspiring. It's all just gorgeous (or hideous, in some cases). The costumes are completely appropriate, and very well-made. They really reflect each character's attitude. The makeup is fantastic as well, and deserves and award. The camera work is extremely effective (they deserve an award for the contrast they use in this), and there's more raw emotion than you can shake a stick at. Especially wonderful are the scenes with Saruman, which tend to be jerky and use fast pans and close-ups; scenes in The Shire, which use the natural, beautiful New Zealand light outdoors and great dramatic lighting indoors; and the scenes at Rivendell, which are tinted with a simply magical golden-brown, giving it a nostalgic, aged feel. The special effects are entirely believable (Save one or two shots. SHOTS! Not scenes, shots! Wow!!) and really do add to the experience. My REVIEW: One word? WOW. Recommended stuff: Other movies I'd say you might like? Anything epic, really. Try "Gladiator" perhaps, or "The Mummy Returns". I liked those films. For something that will get you emotionally, like this did for me, try "Schindler's List" on for size. For a lighter fantasy romp, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone". As always, I must recommend anything Star Wars. For music, try something nice by John Williams, especially Schindler's List and Star Wars. Also, there's a very nice thing called "The Lord of the Rings: Symphony No. 1" by Johann De Meij. It's a symphony for wind band, written in five movements, and inspired by the novel. Very nice!! READ the novel, of course! And go see the movie with someone!! It's better with a hand to squeeze in the more frightening bits! And it's best seen in a large-screen theater with stadium seating and surround sound. And whatever you do, DON'T GET A DRINK! No potty breaks during this one, or you'll miss out! :-)
10.0~The excellent Film adaptation of an excellent novel coltonamy Sign in Permalink New Zealander Peter Jackson's film adaptation of Tolkien's mythological masterpiece "The Lord of the Rings; The Fellowship of the Ring" (the first part of Tolkien's story) the epic journey and battle between good and evil retold on film. The story of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) a young hobbit from the Shire, a small place in Western Middle Earth embarks on a dangerous quest to destroy the legendary one ring with the help of a courageous fellowship. The film follows the hobbits journey across middle earth to Rivendell where a council of all the races of middle Earth decide the fate of the one ring; a fellowship is assigned to aid Frodo in his quest to destroy the ring in Mordor. Along this journey they encounter numbers of evil forces sent by Sauron to obtain the ring and rid the world of the goodness. Jackson's daunting task of constructing the screen adaptation of a literacy masterpiece builds an anticipation to fail as some of the audience were aware of Tolkien's depth of creation, having read the book; however Jackson successfully recreated the world of Middle Earth on screen using a variety of techniques. This transition between book and film is often made but rarely is it done with such brilliance, an exceptional success in which Jackson recreated the classic novel. Jackson's film consisted of an enormous cast and crew and was mostly shot on location in New Zealand, took over fifteen months to film in entirety, yet this massive scale film still brought out the fundamental themes of human existence and all the themes Tolkien originally created. Jackson's choice to film the three films out of sequence had no implications to the film. Elijah Wood delivers a knockout performance as Frodo Baggins and really captures the role. The quality of acting is often lost in big blockbusters, however in this film it remains to a very high standard which is a great acclaim considering the large amounts of actors involved. Jackson opens his film using non simultaneous sound; this powerful lyrical voice over with a black screen beautifully sets the tone of the film and we are brought into the film world immediately. The delayed opening of the film creates suspense to speculate on the opening frame. The powerful prologue that follows demonstrates Jackson's film making to its best, the narrative is set and as we are told the history of the ring we are diverged from reality and are brought into an incredible action sequence combining great cinematography and special effects. The kinetic camera is a great metaphor for the intensity of the battle. Jackson demonstrates the narrative effectively with the battle sequences from the past, cleverly signifying the depth of Saurons power and the power of the one ring. A series of dramatic close ups of the one ring circled by fire, coupled with the signature music which is repeated throughout clearly symbolises the narrative. Jackson also employs techniques of extended fades of entire black to demonstrate the evil in the narrative successfully. The spectacular opening to this film undoubtedly sets the standard for the rest. Many powerful cinematic techniques are employed throughout the film to add to the creation of a fantasy world. Difficulties arising in scale issues between the hobbits and human characters are successfully overcome using scale doubles and techniques such as forced perspective with a moving camera. Sound is used most effectively and powerfully engages a distinct sense of mood in important parts of the film. This is most noticeable when Frodo puts on the ring and enters the world of the ring wraiths; the diegetic music and sound we could hear is taken out and instead is replaced with a number of eerie sound effects and lighting techniques, this impressively conveys the evil in the narrative. The Mise en Scene is composed with such a brilliance that it successfully transcends normal concepts of reality and has enabled Peter Jackson to create a totally imaginary convincing world on film. Sets and locations are conceived with incredible care and detail and are loyal to the descriptions of Tolkien. The location choice of New Zealand provides an ideal backdrop to the creation. The remote mountainous locations and woodlands provide the perfect locations to best demonstrate the narrative successfully. Costume and make-up both successfully aid the concept of creating Middle Earth. One of the greatest sequences in "The Fellowship Of the Ring" is the end battle sequence at Amon Hen. Jackson produces an immense battle scene between the remaining members of the fellowship and the Uruk-Hai. The sequence begins with Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) battling with the Uruk-Hai, the kinetic camera and the increasing speed of the editing intensifies the battle; the music changes and the tempo also quickens this effectively brings the audience into the battle. Brilliantly choreographed fights also aid the creation of a believable scene on film. Sound also plays an important part in this powerful emotional climax of the death of Boromir. We see him receive an arrow to his chest and immediately the sound is removed. This hard hitting absence of the nondiegetic sound and the fade of the diegetic sound greatly contributes to the reality of the battle as we are forced into Boromir's position, a great technique in which Jackson captures this highly significant moment beautifully. Jackson establishes an incredibly high standard with the "Fellowship of the Ring" for the sequels, combining a detailed Mise en Scene, amazing cinematography, visual effects music and sound to create one of the best film adaptations of a book.
9.0~Superb! Far better than I thought it would be!!!! thelegendfk84 Sign in Permalink I first saw TFOTR in cinemas and walked out after about 20 mins into the movie because of not getting enough sleep the previous night. A year later, I watched the first sequel and understood nothing. Now, when I went back to viewing the entire trilogy from the beginning, I was touched. It is without doubt, the most engrossing, the most entertaining, the most powerful and the most beautiful trilogy ever made. The characters are awesome, and the battles are breathtaking! Even when there is dialogue, it is captivating and keeps the tension towards the battles...building rapidly. Also brilliant is the score from Howard Shore. All in all, the greatest trilogy ever made! (Yes, even better than Star Wars).
10.0~Superb Movie, a real epic coolspot Sign in Permalink This movie was excellent, a true epic. I found it to one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting was great, the setting extremely well done, and the story, of course being Tolkien, very interesting, imaginative, and captivating. Even if you don't like this type of movie, you really should see it. It is a must see for anyone over 13.
10.0~It was wonderful, and the actors really knew what they were doing on the set...I rate 10 out of 10 PsychicStar Sign in Permalink I thought these movies were the best of these past two years, and I cannot wait to see the next two, Lord of the Rings: Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. My being totally in love with Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom has a little bit to do with the rating, but only a bit. I loved the way the characters seemed totally in style with each other, and, being a 12 year old girl from South Africa, I should know a lot about this! The first movie left me pining for the second, and I cannot wait to see the last. I only hope you lot appreciate this movie as much as I did, and although you are entitled to your own opinion, if you say this movie was too long, you obviously can't appreciate movies then, can you? And I bet 10 out of 12 you would not dare say that about other movies 3 hours long, would you? I, in fact, thought this movie was a little too short for my liking, and I would have loved it to be a bit longer. I hope you give these movies a chance, and I am sure you will pleased with the outcome!
10.0~The best movie ever made (at least until "The Two Towers") POASHBW Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has created his masterpiece. He was a great director with such films as "Bad Taste" and "Meet the Feebles", but "The Fellowship of the Ring" will finally get him the credit he deserves as one of the best directors today. "The Fellowship of the Ring" is a perfect movie. The casting could not have been better. Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood appear on the screen and we don't see actors, we see an ageless wizard and a brave yet simple hobbit. The locations were exactly as they should be according to the book, from the beauty of the Shire, to the majesty of Rivendell and Lothlorien, to the dark wasteland of Mordor. The script was perfectly adapted from the original story. Some changes were made, which is expected, but it is still the story we have known and cherished our entire lives. The score fits the movie just as it should. The music makes the locations come to life, the heroes and villians more powerful, and the deaths of certain characters more heartfelt. The special effects were phenomenal without being overdone. We see sweeping shots of huge armies in battle and larger-than-life villians, but it all seems completely real and believable. But most important of all, the movie had true emotion and feeling. Fans left the theaters as satisfied as a hobbit after his sixth meal. Anyone who has read the books knows that the saga will continue to get better as the story progresses, the War of the Ring deepens, and the peril greatens, eventually leading us to the heart of Mordor and the greatest finale ever conceived. Peter Jackson shot the entire trilogy at one time. They have all been filmed. We can be assured that the movies will continue to be this good. We can also be assured that this trilogy will not meet expectations, it will exceed them, as we have already seen in "Fellowship". The trilogy will end up being a classic for all time, like the original "Star Wars". The world will never grow tired of "The Lord of the Rings". And that is exactly how it should be.
1.0~Dire srhmay Sign in Permalink This film is long. It goes on and on and on, and just when you think it is finished, it goes on a bit more, and then, when it finally does finish, it just stops. Rubbish. Lovely scenery, fight scenes quite good, and that's it. I have never fallen asleep at the cinema before but I did today and it was a blessed relief as, for me, the film was only six hours long as I was asleep for the middle two. Avoid this film. At all costs. Even more, avoid the kind of dullard lunatics who will say this was fantastic and you must read the books. Don't read the books - they are worse. Stay at home, rent a proper movie, watch it twice, make some tea, watch it again and you will still have used up less of your short life than by watching this terrible, terrible movie. God it was bad.
9.0~the film fantastic and is a very good adaptation of the book by Tolkien putopresi88 Sign in Permalink This is my favorite film after the two next parts. I could say that in three long hours Jackson has made a well resume of the book. It has so much fantasy and is a wonderful way to tell the beginning of one of the greatest and magical stories ever told, written or filmed. It is about one hobbit named Frodo who guesses that he has a coursed ring and has to destroy it into the fires of a far volcano. A hobbit is a kind of dwarf. The movie has a charmed soundtrack and the especial effects and the sound effects are just fantastic. I recommend to go and see it now. David Rodríguez Sancho
5.0~3 hours of my life I'll never get back webslinger316 Sign in Permalink I am not saying this film was terrible, just not worthy of the hype. I have never read the books, so thankfully, my expectations were not high. Special effects were okay...except that in group shots, the Hobbits were never the same size compared to the others in the group...sometimes they were munchkins, other times they came about chest high. A poor job was done to inform us non-Tolken fans of each class of characters and where they fit into the story. Then again, I dozed off and might have missed something.
10.0~Breath- taking movie on all levels sweet_sugar_161 Sign in Permalink Warning! Small hints one may not want too hear if they want to be completely surprised This is an excellent, amazing and breath taking movie on all levels. I have to admit, that after the first time I saw it I didn?t like it at all. Probably because I had for a long time held a grudge against fantasy and sci-fi. After seeing it a second time though, I fell completely in love with the whole thing. I read all three books in 2 weeks after that and it is the only time that I found that a movie adapted from a book was just as enjoyable (if not better in some ways) as the book. Peter Jackson was very brave too take on this project but it is evident that he really cared about what he was doing because it is so amazing! I thing however that they?re could have been less violence and perhaps they could of put in a bit more of the beginning of the book, where you really get a feel for the simple and happy life of the hobbits. Even so, these are only small problems and they are all made up for with the exquisite scenery, amazing cast, wonderful music and of course the breath taking special effects. This movie made me cry, laugh and scream and there was never a moment when I wasn?t doing one of these. I don?t think a better cast could have been chosen. All the actors seem as if they actually could be the character they play in real life. Elijah Wood is perfect for Frodo. He may not be the strongest actor but Frodo, especially in the first book, is not a terribly dramatic character. He also looks exactly like all the descriptions of Frodo apart from that he?s not fat, which is a good thing as far as I?m concerned. I would of chosen him just for those eyes. Sean Astin does one of the best jobs portraying his part. As the innocent, common-sensed Sam he shows that although he is deathly afraid of what lies ahead his love for Frodo is stronger and he will not leave his side until the end. Billy Boyd is hilarious as the scatter-brained but courageous Pippin (my favorite character) and Dominic Monaghan is equally good as his brave cousin Merry. Viggo Mortenson is amazing. It is almost impossible for me too believe that he isn?t really Aragorn. He manages too look old and dangerous and at the same time young and noble. Sir Ian McKellen gives another outstanding performance. I don?t see why he wasn?t born a wizard, he suits the part so well. His academy award nomination was well earned but the fact that he didn?t win wasn?t right. Orlando Bloom is excellent as the elf Legolas. He walks so gracefully and lightly (meaning no offense, of course) and his archery looks as though he took years too learn it. He is somewhat of a role model for me, being an aspiring actress because this was his first real role! John Rhys-Davies has real ?dwarf? personality. Indignant and competitive. He manages too show very well what a ?real dwarf? was like and not like the ridiculous dwarves in Snow White and so on. Sean Bean, although his part wasn?t very large, shows very well how Boromir is slowly being taken by the power of the ring. The two women in this movie Liv Tyler as the beautiful elf princess who is in love with Aragorn and Cate Blanchett as the powerful elf queen Galadriel are just as good as all the rest. Although Arwen is not a big character in the book I am glad she is given a bigger part because the story needed more women. Cate Blanchett once again did an outstanding performance. I have to give credit as well too the evil characters. Christopher Lee is very powerful as Saruman the wizard who is taken by the evil will of Sauron and drawn to the power of The Ring. Andy Serkis, who does the voice of Gollum didn?t have many lines I this movie but he becomes an important character later on. The reason I menchain him is because he does an extremely good voice for Gollum that hardly sounds human. I tried doing that voice while reading the book out loud and got a sore throat plus I wasn?t even very good at it. Although they?re is much more to this movie, I have no time too talk about it. They?re aren?t even any suitable words in the English language to describe the exquisiteness of the special effects. All I can say is they are amazing! The sets, costumes and make-up were also extremely good. It is a miracle that they were able too re-create Middle-earth and it?s people almost exactly as it is described by Tokien. All other movies that I would of considered excellent movies now seem worse because I have The Lord Of The Rings to compare them too. This movie is by far the best movie I have ever seen and I can?t imagine that anything could ever outdo it except perhaps the second and third installments of the trilogy! I would give this movie, as well as the book, all the stars there are in the universe out of 10!
5.0~Just think: Starship Troopers... See this wasn't that bad! zerodegreesk Sign in Permalink It's hard for me to comment too badly on this movie. It's a fantasy movie. It's supposed to take you away into another world, away from your real crappy lives and entertain you. If you want literature, read the book. If you want 400+ pages of character development, read the book. There's the movie and the book. They serve the same purpose through different mediums; one's better equipped to grab you around the neck and shake you around for a few hours, while the other will gently caress and nourish your mind over the course of several days. No movie based on a book, especially a book of this stature, will EVER live up to the expectations. "The Exorcist" or "The Godfather" or "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" are examples of near perfection, in my opinion, but I'm sure there are those that disagree. Then, there's "Starship Troopers" Just consider this last example. What a horrible piece of crap that movie was. It barely resembled the book past the title. And the movie was horrible to boot! Just imagine Casper Van Dien as Aragorn and Denise Richards as Arwen. Directed by Paul Verhoven. I'm getting sick just from the thought of it. See how great this movie really was, or at least how bad it COULD have been. I appreciate it more already. I've been exposed to the Lord of the Rings books and stories and cartoon incarnations as long as I can remember. I couldn't find many faults with this version, but after reading others' reviews, I could believe that if you weren't familiar with the stories that you might not have enjoyed it as much as I did. In the near 180 minutes that this movie spanned, there could have been a little less pointless CGI and a little more about the history of those involved, for the sake of those not familiar with the story. In general, though, I'd have to say that the CGI didn't get in the way of the story half as much as it would have in some other director's hands.
5.0~A real pity mairsil Sign in Permalink An excellent cast, with some outstanding performances by Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Ian Holm, Hugo Weaving, and most others of the cast. Also, the setting is beautiful, with impressive landscapes and all. Even the Nazgul look convincing. But... The screenplay is just another average hollywood high-geared action flick. We go from close encounter to even closer encounter to a hundred orcs, a thousand orcs, it's just standard hollywood action. Also, a lot of things make no sense at all because of the changes Jackson made. First, Aragorn tells us how incredibly dangerous these Nazgul are, and then he defeats five of them singlehandedly. And there's much much more of that. It could have been very good. The cast is good, the effects are good, the setting is good, but the screenplay sucks beyond belief. A real pity. 5 out of 10.
10.0~Simply Amazing. JackBauerPowerHour Sign in Permalink What is there to say about this movie.Fantastic,Amazing,and Breathtaking.This is truly a classic in every category there is in movies.Pater Jackson is a genius,I'm surprised he didn't win a Oscar for best director.Everybody does a Brilliant job as there Characters especially Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins and Ian McKellen as Gandalf.This movie has everything you want in a movie like Great acting,Great Special Effects,Great Story and Great Directing.This is the Second Greatest movie behind Shawshank Redemption.A perfect 10/10.Truly a Classic.

Victor Field Sign in Permalink Many people have expressed their fondness for this first part of the trilogy already, so I'll devote this brief review to discussing the flaws of "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." Flaw 1: Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. In amongst an otherwise fine cast, she's the only one of the principals who seems to not believe where she is; her performance suggests she thinks she's in a perfume commercial (you almost expect her to say "Obsession. Calvin Klein"), and the soft-focus of her scenes only underlines that impression. Flaw 2: IT ENDS! Sam supplies the best possible review: "Well, that was an eye-opener." New Line has a great Christmas 2002 present lined up for us...
10.0~As good as hoped for. Primalase Sign in Permalink Unlike Star Wars I: Phantom Menace, this movie definitely lived up to all its pre-release hype. Peter Jackson should have won the Best Director "Oscar" for one reason alone: he DIDN'T screw up the movie, and he DID remain true to the original story.
1.0~You have to be kidding me doctlc Sign in Permalink Wow, this movie was beyond horrible. Mckellan getting nominated for an oscar? A campaign for Ian Holm to be nominated? This film was lucky it didn't sweep the categories for the Razzies! With the budget Jackson had, he could have at least stayed true to Tolkein's vision. Instead he packages eye candy and cheap payoffs with playing up the humans (at the expense of the Hobbits), all the while filling the coffers at New Line. Other then that, yes: it was a terrific film.
10.0~Perfection MattBirk Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has created a modern day masterpiece that will surely stand the test of time and be labeled one of the great fantasy movies of all time. He has created a world that feels very real and in it, he puts some of the most authentic characters who makes the movie flourish. The use of practical effects is what makes the movie shine, the production design in the movie is perfect, everything looks authentic and magical, it's great to see him shy away from CGI when possible. The movie slowly reveals the diversity of Middle Earth and every new scene brings new wonders, it's astonishing to see the world unfold before our eyes. Fellowship is also the most personal and heartfelt of the three, seeing the Fellowship weaken and fall apart as the movie is devastating. Though the battles and storyline are the smallest and least 'epic' when compared to the second and third movies, the emotional impact here is the greatest. This is why the movie is the best of the three, the stakes are high for the group of people we care about, we just get to meet them and already they are falling apart. The character interactions between the original Fellowship is the best aspect of the movie, together there are no more than nine characters, but they are given the greatest task of Middle Earth. Not to mention to great comedy bits that take place between the hobbits and the other members of the group (the later movies move away from the comedic tones). The Lord of The Rings is easy one of the great trilogies of all time, they are all must-see movies! Fellowship>Return of the King>Two Towers.
10.0~Don't care what the Academy says, Best film of 2001 and best of many others. TheLastStop41 Sign in Permalink LOTR is without a doubt, the best movie I've ever seen. I don't care what the Academy says because without a doubt, it was the best film of 2001 (obviously... i said it was the best movie I've ever seen). It deserved the Academy Award 10 times more than A Beautiful Mind did. I mean look at the difference between ratings. LOTR: #3 ABM: #126 See a difference? LOTR will go on to be an unforgotten movie as what Star Wars is. In twenty years ABM won't even be on the top 250 list, while LOTR will still be in the top 50. SO LOTR fans just remember. Academy doesn't mean sh*t. Time says it all.
10.0~An amazing film that manages to live up to the book (well almost!) spb251272 Sign in Permalink I read the trilogy "The Lord Of The Rings" many years ago, and had almost forgotten how good it was. Then when I heard that the films were coming out, and saw the trailers, I was really excited! This for me is the original and best fantasy story ever. When I watched the film I wasn't disappointed, and I am pleased to say that this is now amongst my all time favourite films! I have since re-read the trilogy and now I cannot wait for the next two installments of the film. There is obviously a lot of changes from the book, however I don't think that you could ever tell the full tale in a film (or three!). It is a different way of telling the story, and therefore differences can only be expected. Now that I've finished reading the books again, I really want to watch the film again - can't wait for it to come out on DVD!
10.0~A dynamic, epic, beautiful and sweeping work that knocks the socks of anything in the fantasy genre since Star Wars sdillon-1 Sign in Permalink CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS JRR Tolkien's staggering trilogy The Lord of the Rings is my favourite novel of all time. To call it the literary equivalent of the (original) Star Wars trilogy if anything undersells it, as much of Star Wars is inspired by it. When I heard Peter Jackson was going to make films of my `precious' books I was nervous to say the least. How could he possibly succeed? Then, in December 2001, I breathed an immense sigh of relief combined with an almighty gasp of delighted surprise. The first film in the trilogy not only lived up to expectations, it surpassed them. If anything, the film was better than the book. I say this simply because cinema is my preferred artistic medium. What Peter Jackson did was not merely film the book (as was the case with the first two Harry Potter films) but instead translated it into cinema. Jackson emphasised what was cinematically potent, reinvented a number of sequences and trimmed a few others with the apparent motto `show don't tell', which is of course what great cinema does. The resultant adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is an unmitigated masterpiece. A dynamic, epic, beautiful and sweeping work that knocks the socks of anything in the fantasy genre since Star Wars in 1977. It is nothing less than criminal that it didn't win the Oscar for best picture. The deceptively simple plot can be summed up in one phrase: `evil ring must be destroyed'. For this to happen, representatives of all races in Middle Earth - Humans, Hobbits, Elves, Dwarfs etc - must unite against the forces of evil led by the Dark Lord Sauron who wants to regain the great Ring to rule and cover all the world in darkness. The complicated backstory is brilliantly rendered in a splendid prologue outlining the history of the Ring and how it came to be in the hands of the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo's nephew, Frodo, takes up the quest to destroy the Ring with the help of wizard Gandalf and a fellowship representing the other races in Middle Earth. The ensuing adventure is so full of excitement, adventure, humour, irony, melancholy, terror and tragedy that it really is impossible to describe the emotions of the story in a few words. Although the plot deals specifically with the timeless theme of good versus evil, it also encompasses complex issues such as immortality, temptation, and growing up. There have been several misguided attempts at pinning Tolkien's work down in allegorical terms, most recently to the post September 11th war against terrorism. To do this is to miss the point. Tolkien himself claimed his work was neither allegorical or topical. It was instead intended to be a `fake history' or mythology for England and Europe, rooted deeply in his Christian beliefs. The casting in the film is impeccable. Sir Ian McKellen simply is Gandalf, Elijah Wood excels as Frodo, Viggo Mortensen is superbly rugged as hushed-up-King Aragorn, Ian Holm makes a tragic and moving Bilbo, Sean Bean is wonderful as Boromir - a man gradually seduced by the evil of the Ring, and Christopher Lee is great as turncoat wizard Saruman to name just a few. The cinematography is staggeringly beautiful, making great use of breathtaking New Zealand locations. The special effects and production design are groundbreaking. Editing and sound are both first-rate. Finally, Howard Shore's magnificent music score deserves a special mention, the best I've heard of its type this side of Star Wars. Not only does he manage to create a sweeping work similar to a full-blown opera, but he manages to incorporate Elvish poems and songs that were an frequent feature of the novel unable to be included elsewhere. The extended edition of the film is an interesting alternative edit, with new bits and pieces which are all good (especially for fans of the book), but to be honest it doesn't matter which version you see. The film's staggering attention to detail, its unswerving conviction and its brisk pace (not a duff moment in its entire running time) make this quite simply one third of the greatest fantasy film ever made.
10.0~Another perfect score! carlos-grant Sign in Permalink "Fellowship of the Ring" has absolutely everything a movie needs. First of all the cast and their performances were top notch. I was not disappointed at all. At first I was somewhat skeptical about Elijah Wood playing Frodo Baggins, and I was never too impressed with his acting ability to begin with. Now after seeing this film, I can't see any other actor portraying Frodo, other than young Elijah. I was very pleased by his performance, but very disappointed that he did not get an Oscar nomination. As for Viggo Mortenson playing the heroic Aragorn, I knew he would be great the moment I saw him in the trailer for the film months before it was released. He looked and breathed Aragorn, just as I imagined Aragorn would when I read the books years ago. Sean Bean was terrific as the brave, but weak -willed Boromir. And of course Sir Ian McKellan was perfect as Gandalf the Grey. In fact, he is Gandalf. Every time he was shown on screen, he stole the scene. I'm just upset he didn't win the Oscar. The rest of the cast was great as well. I was very happy with their performances. The scenery and cinematography is indeed flawless. After seeing this movie, I immediately wanted to visit New Zealand. It's as if New Zealand is Middle Earth. The art direction and costume design is extraordinarily detailed. Everything from the celestial buildings of the Elves in Rivendell, to the Celtic designs in the Dwarven armor, to the dark and Satanic vision of Sauron's fortress are truly awesome. The make-up and creature effects are the best I've ever seen. The Orcs aren't just stupid, mindless killing machines. They really are terrifying. The Black Riders were my favorite though. They stole the scene every time they were on. As for the visual and computer generated effects, you couldn't do any better. The demonic Balrog was amazing. It was definitely one of the movie's best parts. And of course, Peter Jackson's direction was top-notch. I was so pleased when I found out he was doing the film, and not some huge, big-time Hollywood filmmaker like Lucas, Spielberg or Cameron. Don't get me wrong, they are brilliant filmmakers, but they all tend to throw in something very cutesy for the little kids so the movie would be more commercial. I knew of course Jackson would never do that. The action sequences and battle scenes are very exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more. I felt it ended very well. Overall a perfect score for a perfect film.
10.0~An Extraordinary Beginning to an Epic Tale.... peacepit Sign in Permalink It was worth the wait. Incredible, Beautiful and Faithful to Tolkien's creation. Personally, watching the movie felt like I had met old friends again, that I had not seen in years. Never in my life have I ever read a book and then enjoyed the film version of it. Normally film adaptations are offensive and disgraceful in my eyes. There were plot changes, that is true. There were deletions, that is true. But all of them were tasteful and true with the spirit of Tolkien. I first read the trilogy of LOTRs over 20 years ago when I was 12 and it wasn't until I wiped the last tear from my eye at the end of FOTR that I realised that it IS possible to see your imagination become a real and tangible force. Peter Jackson bought back all the excitement and wonder of a twelve year old boy, enjoying his first incredible action, adventure, fantasy story. When I think of the story of the LOTRs and the characters in the book, the faces of the actors are now emblazoned in my mind. All the characters are incredible and surreal, for me. I am glad that Gandalf, Frodo, Legolas and Aragorn travelled from middle earth to portray themselves in the movie. The swarming of the Orcs and the Goblins, in Moria and at the beginning of FOTR, LOOKS, how the the book, LOTRs, READS. Rivendell, Lothlorien, Moria, Bree, Isengard, Mt Doom and especially Hobbiton were nothing short of amazing, if you have read and taken note of the discriptions in Tolkiens books, for example Bag End, with the tree roots weaving through Bilbo's house. I am overwhelmed by the way Peter Jackson has portrayed the beginning of this legendary journey. If you wait for the DVD or video you will have missed the movie experience that was last here when Star Wars or Grease was released ( more than 20 years ago, and many people describe those movies as an episode in their lives, FOTR has become the beginning of one in my life now). I have anticipated this movie since I first heard about it, The sets that Alan Howe designed show what pages and pages of Prof T's writing took to describe. The panoramic views of places are amazing - To put it in Sir Ian McKellans words "Middle earth does exist and it is New Zealand", who knew that there was such a place? Here is a movie that immediately has two strikes against it. First, when a novel is adapted into film, the film version usually falls short of the detail of the novel. Look at Jurassic Park, The Firm, and even Harry Potter. The second strike against Lord of the Rings is the amount of hype it has received. When the anticipation builds over 12 months, the actual experience can fall way short of expectations. Remember Star Wars: Episode 1? One way that The Fellowship of the Ring differs from any Star Wars or Harry Potter movie is that this is not a self-contained movie. The full story will be told and concluded over the next two years when the The Two Towers and The Return of the King are released in December of 2002 and 2003 respectively. So the abrupt ending of The Fellowship of the Ring might confuse some movie goers, but Jackson stays true to the novel's form in his decision to end the movie and properly tease the audience to want more Did Prof T's spirit touch PJ and his casting staff or what? I finally felt for Frodo and the conflicts he goes through. Elijah Woods' amazing eyes show expression from laughter to deepest regret. The scene of him flirting with the hobbit maidens while he dances makes his eventual leaving of Middle-Earth all the more poignant. And the look on his face outside Moria after Gandalf has fallen spoke as "It was ultimately my decision as the Ring-Bearer to go into Moria and look what happened." I liked the way that PJ interpreted the Bridge of Khazad-Dum as Gandalf, CHOOSING, through his love of Frodo, to let go of the Bridge and do what he must do to aid the Quest, "Fly you Fools". That was a subtle and vital change, and gives another dimension to the plot that will be discussed for years. Legolas! The Elves! Where does one find such beautiful people? Showing actual, realistic bow and knife combat (including stabbing one Uruk-Hai with an arrow, taking it out and firing it - who'd have thunk it?) and expanding the character of Legolas including his fighting capabilities was a refreshing plot-line. The walking on top of snow that is really not explained on-screen is another subtlety, like the devotion of the younger hobbits to Frodo, that PJ is able to bring to the film. Now onto some details that I think translated well onto the screen: Elrond's anger towards men and his disappointment with them is so well explained in the scene with Isildur, and makes the love between Arwen and Aragorn all the more (again) poignant. He will lose his beloved daughter to a Man. I loved the expanded dialogue between Gandalf and Elrond - again, it gives an additional dimension to the Council and the final decision. And the fierceness on Elrond's face was not an expression that I expected. Yes has been depicted as kindly but he was, after all, a warrior as well. Glad to know what a Standard-Bearer does in battle - very realistic. I think that the friendship between Gandalf and Bilbo was well shown in blowing smoke-rings. The training of young hobbits to sword-fighting. Of course you would train them when your party stops for a rest! Brilliant scene. The test of Galadriel, well thats how I always imagined it in the books so I don't know why some of the movie critics are slamming that scene. She isn't some goody fairy queen, shes a powerful 4000 year old elf queen. Who strikes fear amongst anyone who has ever heard about her. Now to answer some of the critics: Lothlorien - Yes it is dark - it shines by starlight, the most beloved light of the Eldar. Ever been outside of your doors on a moonless night? Gimli the Dwarf was only blindfolded while they traveled into Lothlorien until the message came from Galadriel - if you give Haldir the message immediately when the Fellowship enters Lothlorien and take out two days of travel, you have no need to blindfold a dwarf. ARWEN: Why NOT have a sword-wielding elf, and a second sword-wielding maiden? Having a second sword-wielding woman makes Eowyn's character less of an anomaly. In a land where the Shadow is becoming stronger, why not teach your daughter to defend herself? Elrond was the Standard-Bearer of Gil-Galad, and Celebrian had been taken by the Orcs. It is therefore a logical step that he would teach his beloved daughter what his wife may or may not have known - we don't know if, when Celebrian was taken, whether she even knew how to fight back. PJ's portrayal of Arwen as a Warrior shows that Elrond loves Arwen enough to give her the fighting advantages that Elrond as a male takes for granted. The lack of number of women characters and certainly their lack of development (with the exception of Eowyn) is a criticism of Prof T's work that may or may not be justified, given his deep Catholic beliefs, his friendship with C.S. Lewis (who viewed birth control as abhorrent), and shows how women were looked at 50-60 years ago. Second, how on Middle-Earth or above it can a Ranger who is himself a trained warrior, form a life-time partnership with a beautiful lady who sits next to Daddy (re-read the part!) and sews a banner as her life's work? Those are Arwen's only parts in the books, before the appendix. Peter Jackson is showing in his characterization of Arwen, his expansion of her character, his making her a REAL charcter, that real love evolves between equals, not between he-men and helpless maidens! I was glad to see that Arwen loves Aragorn, not just that he desires her, and to see the love story develop. Also glad to see that PJ didn't rely on heaving bosoms and other Hollywood stereotypes to show sex, but instead had an understanding of the support and depth that a lifetime's love has. When the credits finally rolled after 3 hours, I found myself back in the theatre, But what I really wanted to do was go back to Middle Earth and continue my journey! If you've read the books, go see the movie and you won't be disappointed. If you haven't read the novels, go see the movie and you'll want to stop by a bookstore on your way home, to fully appreciate the world that J.R.R. Tolkien has created. This film's three-hour running time will not allow it to break the opening weekend record recently set by our young wizard friend, Harry Potter, but in the long run, this may turn out to be one of the top grossing movies of all time. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is easily one of the best and most entertaining movies of 2001 and will be a classic for years to come. The Fellowship of the Ring is not only a film for die-hard Tolkien fanatics. I believe it is a genuinely brilliant piece of cinema. The drama is touching, the comedy is hilarious, the evil of the Ring is more chilling than I could ever have imagined it. I doubt I could be much more happy with this film at all. Peter Jackson is now official Lord of the Moviemakers I spent so much of the movie lost in the joy of it, that I forgot to be a fan. I walked out of that theater in a state of blissful ecstasy that I had not experienced in a long, long time. Thanks to all of the set-designers, artists, dialogue coaches, PJ, and especially the actors/actresses who have made a dream come true. What this epic leaves me with is a sense of gratitude to all those who worked on the movie, not because it is a fantastic story bought to the big screen and filmed in my home country New Zealand, but because it has been done so well, and in my lifetime, and I get to enjoy it for years to come. Mr. Jackson transported me to Middle Earth and I didn't ever want leave. The sad thing is, a lot of people are probably going to sit down and just pick it apart, comparing it to the book instead of just enjoying it for the wonderful movie it is. For Tolkien Purists who will pick FOTR the movie to pieces and force themselves not enjoy it purely as a cinematic masterpiece. I bet ANYTHING that even though they will moan and complain and gripe about the changes. It WON"T stop them seeing the NEXT TWO movies, multiple times. Watch it as a movie and not as a book, and you'll do fine. Go in with an open mind and you'll come out with an open and full heart.
9.0~J.R.R Tolkien would have been so proud. ibrarsiddiqi Sign in Permalink If you never had the opportunity to read the book of the same title then this film will seduce you enough to read the great works of Tolkien himself. The book was written by Tolkien after having grown up in Birmingham after emigrating with his mother and younger brother. Tolkien was the master of fantasy literature, his mind brought alive a world in which good and evil, dark and light could easily exist within our times. Peter Jackson took the book and assembled a high calibre cast, he took the story apart, supported it with a dramatic music score that heightened your senses whilst sat in your seat. The adaptation was magnificent, it drove many of us film fans to the cinemas in droves globally, we demanded more and Jackson delivered Tolkien's Middle Earth alive. The casting of Elijiah Wood as 'Frodo' and Ian McKellen as 'Gandalf' galvanised the desire to see good triumph, against all the odds, over evil. As you watch, the characteristics of all the main characters are brought alive as you'd have imagined Tolkien would have done himself. The length of many films now falls shy of two hours but the Lord of the Rings trilogy held the most impatient of film lovers lusting for more. My home town, Birmingham, inspired Tolkien as a young boy and his creativity by the wonders of it's natural beauty. Many tourists came to my home town feeling the magic that brought us together to love Tolkien himself. This film (and its sequels) brought a greater appreciation of literature to us all, in fact inspiring so many of us to read and imagine so much more.
10.0~Watched over and over again... zapryanov-angel Sign in Permalink ....and every time is like a first ! There is no adventure movie like The Lord of the rings, and I don't think that will ever have
10.0~A new modern classic Fellowship Films Sign in Permalink I thought it would have been too ambitious to make the trilogy of this classic novel back to back, it was either going to be fantastically good, or extremely poor. I am happy to say that this is a winner and i don't think that any one could have done this better than Peter Jackson. Every aspect of the film works; the screenplay, the cast, the cinematography, the backdrop, the special effects and the costumes. The magic and adventure of the book has been captured perfectly within the space of three hours. It is one of those films that going to the cinema is all about, if you haven't seen it I suggest you get up and see it now, if you have already seen it then I suggest you go and see it again. The cast is so perfect, especially, Sir Ian Mckellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Sir Ian Holm and Christopher Lee. The Fellowship of the Rings is a must see and I cannot wait for the next one.
5.0~Over-Rated By Kids -- Beware Adult Viewers! donbays Sign in Permalink I suspect that most of the glowing reviews for this film come from younger people. My wife and I were about 50 when we saw it, and tried to walk out to see something else. We ended up sticking it out and I actually appreciated some elements. I rated this a 5 (average). Obviously I certainly do not think this is one of the best films of all time! To place this in the same category with Citizen Kane, On The Waterfront, Casablanca, Rear Window, The Godfather and etc. cheapens the list in my estimation. But I guess the kids love it.
10.0~Wonderful Movie!!! IAlwaysWin5 Sign in Permalink This, most definitely, is one of my most favorite movies I've seen. Good acting, great special effects, all made from an awesome book. I love it! The story line goes brilliantly from one another; you never realize the time; and when it ends, you're left waiting for more! Elijah Wood totally enchants me with his eyes and cherub face. Good selection of actors, Ian McKellen does excellently as Gandalf! Without a doubt, I give this exceptional movie 10/10. Can't wait until The Two Towers!
1.0~Big and boring jojofla Sign in Permalink This first installment in Peter Jackson's trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy novels follows the adventures of the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits a ring coveted by an evil being who hunts Frodo and his friends down as they team with a variety of protectors to journey to the only location that can destroy the ring. Whatever, something like that. I can't deny that this expensive film (all three together cost nearly $300 million) is dazzling on the eyes--sweeping photography, incredible sets, eye-popping visual effects--but it's all been directed with so much awe and self-reverence that it never engaged me on an emotional level (well, not until the last scene, which is a bit late). It comes across as nothing but a repetitious display of our heroes walking and running, mumbling gobbledygook I couldn't understand, and fighting ceaseless armies of rejects from Friday the 13th casting calls. And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. With all the swirling helicopter shots of moutaintops, I was hoping Julie Andrews would turn up for a much needed production number. No such luck; instead, we get Cate Blanchett inducing giggles as some kind of omniscient fairy (the only laughs in this dour, humorless film). The cast tries hard--it's commendable that they kept a straight face with some of the unintelligible dialogue. Also with Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Sean Astin, Ian Holm, and (the film's best performances) Sean Bean and Christopher Lee.
9.0~Greatness of this movie can not be described in words michaela-brunanska Sign in Permalink I love this movie and I think I saw it a hundred times but never got bored. I always found something new what was hidden but had to tell me something. Movies like this are very interesting for me. The storyline is good too. The characters are unique but simple. Everyone can find himself in one of them. This film shows us that everyone means something in this world and has his place there. If we are brave enough we can get in touch with the darkest forces and fight against them. Not all of the fighters may survive but it's worth it. It's also shown there that even a small man who you think means nothing has got his price and is in this world for a reason. It's really worth watching it.
10.0~Wonderful Movie Jennie Parker Sign in Permalink WARNING: SPOILERS I loved this adopation of the movie. I thought that the casting was good, (so many hot guys, so little time to see them!) and Elijah Wood was perfect as Frodo. Sean Astin was amazing as Sam Gamgee, the loyal and clumsy servant of Frodo. Dominc Monohag and Billy Boyd pulled off Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took wonderfully. Even though they changed Arwen's part a little bit, and they cut out one of my favorite charecters, the movie mostly followed the book. My favorite part was when Gandalf fell into the abyss in Moria ("Fly, you fools!") and I eagerly await The Two Towers, coming in December of 2002
1.0~It's simply not that good Bilstein Sign in Permalink Sorry, but it really ISN'T as good a film as it's been made out to be. After seeing it shoot straight to the top of the IMDB charts, my immediate thought was that fans of Tolkien (or should that be zealots of Tolkien?) had already made up their minds to vote 10 out of 10 before they'd even seen the film. I was challenged by many people on this point, and having seen the film myself, I now know that I was right. I can't say it enough, it simply isn't that good. At three hours, I found myself dozing off a number of times, and having to bring myself back to watching the film. The characters themselves were a mixed bag. Aside from some of the earliest scenes involving Frodo, Gandalf and Bilbo, those three did very well. Some of the comments on here seem to make them out to be gods, which isn't right, but they were definitely well above average. The other characters, aside from Samwise, were really not as good. They were so underdeveloped that I came out of the film not knowing the names of the majority of characters that had been in it. The action itself was again above average, but still nothing spectacular. A lot of the computer generated stuff looked like large blobs of play-do, and some of the make-up etc. on the monsters was truly terrible. Some of it was absolutely ludicrous (the wizard's fight takes the cake there). And what was with the ring? Did the book state that we had to have a close-up of it every two minutes? As most (zealots) may have guessed by now, I haven't read the book, and many claim that's why I didn't like it. My answer was, since when do you need to read a book before seeing the film? Do you normally need to read a film's script before watching it? Even so, much of it was predictable. Basically, after the opening, it was fight/hide from the baddies before moving onto the next part, then fight/hide again before moving on, then fighting and hiding again. And it goes on. And on.... for three hours. It's all very straightforward. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there isn't a lot more depth than that. The one double-cross can be seen straight-away, because the double-crosser looks very evil from the first time you meet him. There've also been a couple of jokes added in..... at least, that's what I read on here, I actually missed them during the film. I've often read comments that state 'scenery and costumes were nice' and frankly, I totally disagree. Costumes aren't that good because they basically consist of rags for the most part, and the scenery once again, while nice enough, just isn't anything special. I know of course that someone is going to read this comment and disagree with everything I've just said because 'Lord of the Rings is the greatest film ever.' I agree that it certainly is an above-average one (from a critical point of view anyway), just nowhere near the top 3 status of IMDB. As for the ending, yeah it was expected, but with any trilogy, each part of it has to tell its own story, rather than just be a part. Sadly, that wasn't the case in this film. 5.5/10 Frankly, the fact that it is so over-hyped and that whenever someone tries to say something bad against it, all the zealots rise up together and immediately rubbish that person's point of view, have made me hate it deeply, and it was difficult not to put a much lower score.
10.0~A perfect capture of the book's zeitgeist and of the collective consciousness within Tolkien's fan base. davdwd Sign in Permalink It is no accident that the British film charts often rank The Fellowship of the Ring higher than the Return of the King. Peter Jackson's first Tolkien movie is his most lyrical, capturing the whimsy of rural Britain in the precise way Tolkien intended via his hobbits of the Shire. The tension builds in smooth, well-paced stages that not only seduces the non-Tolkien reader but also satisfies the fan base with a visual authenticity incorporating, for instance, the art of Alan Lee and John Howe, long known for their depictions of Middle-Earth. Jackson therefore harnesses the zeitgeist and the pre-existent love of Tolkien devotees across the world. The end product, in addition to being a finely balanced movie, means that viewers slip into a world strangely familiar or even preferable to the one in which they actually live. This is film alchemy of the highest order. The love invested in the project means that movie fans return again and again to this melange of comforting images and heroic archetypes that earmark all the great movies in history.
10.0~Superb in all aspects, acting, scenery, plot development... photojack53 Sign in Permalink This film is captivating, with exemplary acting throughout, costumes that are appropriate without being garish, scenery that goes far beyond anything I would have anticipated and that Music!! The score flows through scene changes with a smoothness like strawberries being dipped in chocolate. Without calling undo attention to itself, the music made the film soar. The scenery reminds me of the romantic nature paintings of Albert Bierstadt, cinematography at its finest. The sequels are coming and I'll be there!
10.0~Simply Delightful TheSudhanva Sign in Permalink When J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this trilogy almost fifty years back, it became a milestone in the history of Fantasy Literature. Most of the later fantasy writers that emerged were inspired by this masterpiece which critics consider as one of the greatest adventures of all time. And when Peter Jackson announced the making of three live-action movies based on this trilogy, much talk followed. And thank goodness that the audience was not in the least disappointed when The Fellowship Of The Ring was released by New Line Cinema, for this movie, though some consider to be too long (nearly 3 hours), marked the beginning of a completely new trend of film-making. Jackson has beautifully illustrated peril,thrill and action, alongside with emotion, friendship and love - a combination absent in many adventure movies that only figure thrill and action. Though those who love extreme action may not be satisfied with this movie, it is, overall, a masterpiece - a great movie of a great book.
10.0~Greatest movie since Indiana Jones and Star Wars cookiesap Sign in Permalink I have not enjoyed any movie as much as Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, since the 3 original Star Wars movies and Indiana Jones:Raiders of the Lost Ark. It has all the elements of a good movie: Adventure, an epic story, romance, super special effects, awesome acting, and an unforgettable manuscript with excellent dialogues. Although the book is much longer, and we never see the jolly good fellow Tom Bobadil, Peter Jackson still did the best possible job without making it into a 10 hour-long movie. I can't wait for The Two Towers
10.0~Not Perfect, But Dang Close... sidirezegh Sign in Permalink Fellowship is indeed phenomenal. Ian McKellan deserves all the praise he's received, but in many ways I feel Viggo Mortensen as Strider/Aragorn is the true anchor of this film. Sean Bean also gives a fine performance as Boromir. There is an overuse of slow-motion (particularly with the Dark Riders), the chorale music gets old after awhile, and I generally want to line Frodo's Hobbit buddies up and slap them all at once for being so annoying. But the power of this film in undeniable, from the incredible scenery of New Zealand to the awesome CG scenery and effects. The themes of friendship and the significance of the individual, no matter how insignificant they may be, are timeless. 9 out of 10.
10.0~An Epic of the Middle Earth alphantrion Sign in Permalink It was a big talk back in 2001 when it was told that J.R.R Tolkien's masterpiece, Lord of the Rings trilogy will be made into a live action movie. Most people considered this to be impossible except one ambitious filmmaker named Peter Jackson. I was amazed at the spectacle in the theater when I went to the first screening of this film and was awed until the end of it. Okay it was long but I wasn't bored a bit by the grand locales, the action and the characters of the story. It was after watching this movie that I went to a local bookstore and bought J.R.R Tolkien's trilogy on hardcover to read for the first time. I was amazed at director Peter Jackson's ability to capture Tolkiens exact image of the Middle Earth. It was standing there on the silver screen with its mountains, statues, monsters and different species. Although I have seen the other two movies as well, I found this one to be the best among them. It Should have taken more Oscars than it originally took. This was Peter Jacksons entrance into the middle earth and the beginning of an epic journey made possible by the extremely realistic visual effects and New Zealands impressive landscape.
10.0~Best Picture of 2001...Why didn't the Academy see? cldstrif2 Sign in Permalink 13 Academy Award Nominations. 4 wins. A breathtaking film that has it all. The feeling of Braveheart with an epic adventure with struggle and heart. Peter Jackson deserved the Best Director Oscar. Sir Ian Mckellen deserved the best supporting actor oscar. The academy should have looked harder. :( 10/10
10.0~really really great. not as good as the book, but what is? bob_277 Sign in Permalink i cannot stress the goodness of this movie. you should see it again and again and again. it's not as good as the book and leaves out a lot, but then again, what is as good as the book? i would say to read the book first, and then go see the movie. it's generally the best way to do things
10.0~An Instant Classic! g-bodyl Sign in Permalink When I first saw this movie, I knew that this is going to be a classic and a box-office hit(which it was). This film is so amazing, I hardly have any words and this is the worst of the three LOTR movies. The movie starts with Frodo Baggins inheriting a doomed ring from his second cousin, Bilbo Baggins. Along with Frodo, 3 more hobbits, 2 men, a wizard, an elf, and a dwarf must venture to the Mordor where the evil Sauron reigns to destroy the cursed ring. The actors were cast perfectly. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, and Viggo Mortensen were great as their respective roles. The music is amazing. Howard Shore lives up to my score expectations. This soundtrack is one of the better ones with the Celtic-like themes. The special effects are great especially during the battle scenes. There are some sad moments in this film. I was sad to see Boromir die. He meant no harm to Frodo and he made it up by sacrificing his life for Merry and Pippin. I was sad to see Gandalf "die." But, I'm sure that he will be back. This movie deserves more than 4 Academy Awards. I rate this movie 10/10.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring quinimdb Sign in Permalink This film is beautiful not only because of its fantastic action scenes and special effects, but the three dimensional characters that present us with this deeply human story. The film is about how the people that persevere are not the ones with power, or even physical ability, but the ones who have the will power not to conform. This doesn't mean the heroes of this story are perfect by any means, they all have their flaws. The characters all have a sense of vulnerability, which is important for the tension in the action scenes, but it also shows that they're not perfect and not invincible. We see Frodo taking long periods of time by himself. We see how he is tortured and tempted just like the rest of them, and everyday for him is a struggle. Aragon can't escape the horrible shadow left by his father, who could've destroyed the ring when he had the chance, but decided not to. Gandalf seems wise and powerful at first, but the truth is, he doesn't know everything, and there are other evil ones that have more power than him. Sam is worried and timid. Boromir is also tempted by the ring, and it drives him to nearly kill Frodo. Alright, I could go on and on about all of the characters in the movie and what makes them unique and what drives us to care about them, but the point is, what drives them is their care for one another. It's what gives them the courage to go on and, in many scenes, it's what saves their lives. They're not invincible with each other, but without each other they wouldn't get anywhere. This is reflected in the incredibly tense action scenes, such as the one with the big orc, and the one on the staircase. This is something all of the characters learn by the end of the movie. Sam puts Frodos life above his, and gains courage from their relationship, and Frodo finally realizes that he needs Sam. Alone he would be tortured, but with Sam, it gives him hope. There is obviously much more that happens in this 3 hour long movie, but every single scene either contributes to plot or character, and the pacing is so good that the film feels like 2 hours. I wish I could get into every reason why this movie is so fantastic but that would take way too much time and too many words, so just watch the movie.
10.0~A load of...It's no use! paolo_davies Sign in Permalink I thought the load of rings (or whatever) was the biggest load of rubbish i've ever seen, I could have pulled a better film out of any number of orifices. It's so boring, and long, and... It's useless. The Lord of the Rings is fantastic. As a fan of the books, I couldn't help but be gobsmacked at every turn by how much Jackson's vision had turned out so much like the images of middle-earth in my head. I know everyone's already said nearly everything that can be said about the imagery of the film, but it was the music in particular, which I thought was outstanding. A definite oscar contender. From the perfectly-judged rustic tootlings in the shire, to the glorious, stirring fanfare that greets the fellowship during, you know, that fantastic bit where they do that slow-motion shot with them walking up to the camera. (Which, in any other film would be deplorably self-congratulatory, but through Jackson's sheer directional skill, seems perfectly justified here.) To the genuinely heart-rending single, beautiful voice that mourns the fall of Gandalf. (I tell you, I really had to console myself .... I mean my sister, who was in floods of tears). It would have been so easy for Howard Shore to go the way of John Williams, (something I am profoundly thankful he DIDN'T do!) and seriously serious kudos have to go to the New Zealand orchestra, who did a great job of all those musical bits. Having seen the film more times than I feel comfortable talking about socially, I cannot say 'best film ever', but after all, who can? It's stupid to try and bring order to things like this. Let's all just sit back and enjoy the power of a brilliantly made film, and as fantastic a book adaption as anyone could hope for. 9.5/10
10.0~One of the best movie I have ever seen. king-ranaz Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Ring: The Fellowship of the Ring(2001)was the one of the Future best movie,and the best once of my life. The year was remarkable and the timing also was. Watching this movie was the Excellent moment of my life. All the characters were so good. they acted so well. Elijah Wood acted so well. the story line of this movie was awesome. All the Cast like.... Alan Howard ... The Ring (voice) Elijah Wood ... Frodo Baggins Noel Appleby Noel Appleby ... Everard Proudfoot Sean Astin ... Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee Sala Baker ... Sauron Sean Bean ... Boromir Cate Blanchett ... Galadriel Orlando Bloom ... Legolas Greenleaf Billy Boyd ... Peregrin 'Pippin' Took Marton Csokas ... Celeborn Megan Edwards Megan Edwards ... Mrs. Proudfoot Michael Elsworth Michael Elsworth ... Gondorian Archivist Mark Ferguson ... Gil-Galad Ian Holm ... Bilbo Baggins Christopher Lee work greatly.
9.0~We've only just begun Rogue12 Sign in Permalink This, the first of the three films has suffered in some eyes by not having a conclusion, but unlike such venerated trilogies before as 'Star Wars' or 'The Matrix'. These films are not collections of adventures in the lives of our heroes, these three are in fact one. They really cannot be judged individually as it would be like choosing The Booker Prize based on a random selection of chapters. This film would really take place in the first 30-40 minutes of a normal film. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' opens the tale with the setting of the story, and the introduction of the main protagonists. The central ones here are not the mighty heroes Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf et all, but the tiny little everyman-heroes Frodo and Sam. For it is only these Hobbits, who desire nothing more than to be left in the shire with full tankards, full pipes and most importantly full bellies, who have any hope of resisting the One Ring. For it is this lack of ambition to achieve great things and do great deeds that leaves the ring with little to latch on to in an attempt to control it's wielder and return to it's master. Its more profound effects on Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel and most especially Boromir prove this well. The action scenes and effects do not, as in may other cases, drive the film but enhance a well told story and there are plenty of elements for fans of the books to note. Deviations form the book do occur, as in all films it is impossible to fit the detail of many books into film although a better effort is made here than with films like Starship Troopers and most Bond Films. The deviations here can at least be justified for the most part, such as giving Glorfindel's role to Arwen in order to introduce the love story between the Evenstar and the Ranger/King Strider, and the skipping past of the whole Tom Bambadill section of the story (although there is no indication that it did not happen, we just don't need to see 100 pages where the book grinds to a halt for very little reason). The most impressive however is the subtle changes to the Mines of Moria sequence. Far more action takes place here than in the book but the visuals and the coming together of the members of the Fellowship as they are sorely tested for the first time gives birth tot the basis of other parts of the two instalments to follow. I also like here the decision to show the noble end of Boromir rather than just letting the remainder of the fellowship discover his corpse surrounded by fallen Uruk's but allowing him to redeem his honour in defence of Merry and Pippin after succumbing to the Ring's grasp so fiercely at Amon Hen. Peter Jackson has been quoted as saying that he could quite happily have made the full stories but this film in its self would have been over twelve hours long. I loved the books and also the films with equal measure. The cast fit emotionally and spiritually (if not, in reality, physically) their roles, the score was damn near perfect and the direction almost flawless. The only things missing are parts Two and Three.
10.0~Peter Jackson, Lord of the Trilogies nekkosduredro Sign in Permalink I went to see this film back in Norway last week, and was told that the showing was sold out. After more than seven month on release. Then I left for holiday in Greece, and luckily it was going on the local cinema. So now I have seen it for the 30th time, and I'm not sure it will be the last time, either. Peter Jackson has really made one of the greatest films of all time, and unlike other franchises, he has already filmed the other two installments. Matrix, for instance, was big three years ago, but they never get the next film ready. Jackson and New Line has taken a gamble and succeeded enormously. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for this wonderful film, and good luck with the next two films!
10.0~Cinema was invented for this INTENSE kind of experience!!!! Starbuck-13 Sign in Permalink Breathtaking! Pete Jackson did it! This movie is so extraordinary that it is hard to describe with words alone. It is thrilling, frightening, spine-chilling and exciting from the first moment on. This was the most intense movie experience since I went to see "Return of the Jedi" in 1983, then being a 11-year old boy. "The fellowship" simply blew me away, drove me to the edge of my seat more than once. My girl-friend was totally exhausted, saying that she felt like she herself would have walked with the fellowship over the mountains and through the mines - and the last half hour, she only wanted to say "stop, I cannot walk any further, I'm totally worn out!!!". For me, knowing the book, the film still was physically strenuous, but I just could not stop adoring the wonderful pictures and the sensational cinematography. Everybody will have his favorite moments in this movie. Mine were the escape from the black riders in the first part and Boromirs fate in the second. No spoilers here, but Sean Bean was fantastic! And I had to calm down my girl-friend during the Troll sequences at Moria - and many more times during the spectacular end... I am very glad that the movie, unlike many others, more than lived up to the hype. Those hours were among the most exciting movie hours I ever had, and I can't wait to see the next two parts. Hard to wait til Christmas 2002!!!
10.0~The Biggest, Most Enjoyable Film since, well, NEVER Squirelly Joe Sign in Permalink As I walked into the theatre for the 7:00 screening of Lord of the Rings, my hear leaped with excitment but also worry. What I worried about was that Lord of the Rings would turn out to be one of those films with big hype, big anticipation, big comercialization, and awesome trailers, yet would turn out to suck and get it's way to the bottom 50 films of the past 10 years. Damn was I wrong. When this movie rolled along I had only read half of Fellowship of the Ring, and had no idea what happened next, so it came to some surprise when (SPOILER RIGHT HERE AND NOW) Frodo got stabbed by the cave troll and looked like he was dead.(SPOILER END) This has big hype, big anticipation, big comercialization, and awesome trailers AND doesn't steer too far away from the books, aside from leaving out Crickhollow, Tom Bombadil, and a much longer part with Farmer Maggot, but were only side adventures. The dramatics, action sequences, story, and acting are what makes the movie shine. Some people complain that they left out the songs and poems from the book. WHAT DO YOU WANT! A DISNEY MOVIE!? What the film differs greatly from the books is the drama. Such as (ONCE AGAIN, SPOILERS DEAD AHEAD) When Gandalf falls from the Bridge of Kazah-Dum, he falls alright in both book and movie, but everything goes slow motion in the movie and you can hear the sorrowful cries of Frodo. The book, from what I remember, it's fall and run. Boromirs death is not fully explained in the book, but the movie shows him fighting off the Orcs, trying to save Merry and Pippin. There is once character in the omvie that isn't in the book. That is the Uruk-Hai called Lurtz who kills Boromir. (Spoilers END HERE) But all in all this is the best movie of the century. Gandalf could whip Haryr Potter and day. Sauron, with one hand tied behind his back, could overthrow Voldemort whenever. End Verdict: 12/10
10.0~THE best fantasy film of the new millenium TigerlilyBramble_of_WillowBottom Sign in Permalink The Academy ought to be ashamed of themselves. Only four Oscars? This film deserved almost every one of the thirteen it was nominated for! Let's go through that list, first the winners: Makeup-Spectacular! The hobbits, elves, dwarves, wizards--every character was perfectly made up, especially the hobbit feet. Musical Score-Awesome! I agree with every single person who believes that it had the best score ever. Cinematography-Brilliant! I've never seen such great camera work in any film. Visual Effects-Breathtaking...need I say more? Now for what it should have won: Song-I'm listening to the Enya song right now as I write this. "May It Be" is a wonderful song. It also should have won adapted screenplay, art direction (I haven't read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but I did read "The Hobbit", and Bag End is exactly as I imagined it), sound, I can't decide if Jim Broadbent or Ian McKellen deserved the supporting actor award, and frankly, best picture. This is a great film. Now, keep in mind that I'm a teenage girl. I might be a bit biased because, well, Elijah Wood is hot. But, unlike other big budget films like "Pearl Harbor" and "Titanic," they've cast a hot guy who can actually act! Come to think of it, the entire film was beautifully casted, from Elijah, Ian McKellen, Ian Holm, and Viggo Morenstein (if that's how you spell it) to Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett. Also, Sam, Pippin, and whatever the other hobbit that went with them and Frodo was named were great. I can't wait for the sequel. The Fellowship of the Ring gets a 10!
10.0~One of the best movies I've ever seen! spikerqueen Sign in Permalink I went to Lord of the Rings in the theatre last holiday season and was blown away by everything. I was even considering buying the set of books to read and I hate to read! I waited in anticipation for the release of the dvd and ended up being one of the first to buy it. I would suggest this movie to anyone. It was a bonus seeing Orlando Bloom... believe me you'll get hooked.
10.0~whow Ashen Shugar Sign in Permalink Man, When I started reading the book for the first time, I never thought any director could put the story into a movie. Peter Jackson did it and he didn't change too much, so LotR-fans will still be happy with the marvelous SFX, the outstanding cast and heaven-like locations... great movie, no! better than that! enjoy watching it... ***It's oursss, our own, our preciousssssss***
10.0~Outstanding!! Luepoke-969-80889 Sign in Permalink This... this must be my favorite movie franchise to this date. I have seen the movies so many times, and almost ever time I watch it anew, I see something new. And that is something that makes me love these movies even more. It's like The Matrix. You can't possibly see everything the first time you see it. This is just... argh... it's so amazing. I don't think I will ever see a better fantasy movie. And God, the music... Howard Shore could not make the soundtrack even slightly better. So a tips for you if you're going to watch this... Watch it in blu-ray. Full 1080p, and turn the volume up so you can experience the movie the best way. Thank you.
10.0~Defining movie of defining book delaberi Sign in Permalink LOTR is a literary artefact that defines the century, and LOTR, the movie, is the film that sums it up. Sometimes spectacular, sometimes simple-minded, frightened and brave, it encapsulates what happened to us in the twentieth century. It is about what film does best - magnificent panorama (ah, my beloved New Zealand!), stonking special effects, terrible battles, lingering close-ups of great actors having the time of their lives. When I was a kid, I lived on Middle Earth. Now I am an adult, I rejoice that Peter has let me visit.
10.0~2nd time around still a very good film kismit Sign in Permalink I saw this one in the theatre for the second time which I have not done since the advent of VHS. As a fan of the book my one complaint is there were some very good things left out which I regret will not be seen until the film is remade again in 20 years. There is simply too much material and for those who haven't read the book this is a shame. I don't doubt Jackson could have made the film quite a bit better if he had had the desire and license to take a hatchet to the source material and fashion it into a more conventional screenplay. This really would have involved working some level of closure into FOTR that was was not in the book. Has there ever been another movie made that was so clearly only a third of the whole story? I am really surprised at how many non readers of the book enjoyed the film. This is one movie where people where people who saw the film first will be blown away by the book.
10.0~Great adaptation of epic! LBytes Sign in Permalink I gave this movie a 9 on the IMDB survey. That's excellent, since hardly any movies are rated by me that high and 10s are a scant few. I first saw this movie in a theater and was ready for the Two Towers right then! I was entranced. Also I hadn't read the trilogy in about 25 years. I read the Fellowship right before watching the DVD this time and of course saw the compromises made to get the movie down to about 3 hours. Personally I'd be happy to see a 6 hour Fellowship movie since it would've certainly been more intelligent. How can you 2nd guess which parts to cut/edit/shorten? For me the whole story was more than just parts. Gandalf was always going to go with Frodo when he left the Shire and sure as hell would not have rode off to get advice, leaving him on the road with just Sam. The fact that the journey started out 17 years after the party, and not a few days later, when Frodo was about 50 gives the impression that the Hobbits are just big kids. The Tom Bombadill episode wasn't essential, but it is the first instance of getting help along the way, a running thread throughout the trilogy. It also showed that not all things were swayed by the power of the Ring. I suppose it is nice to have Arwen rescue Frodo from the Nazgul (it was great on camera) but Glorfindel did just fine in the book, and Frodo was alone on the horse at the river which I think makes him a stronger character. As movies can only do, you notice that the fellowship was on foot and I just don't get why Tolkien didn't give them horses to ride once the Fellowship set off from Rivendell. Who the heck would want to walk? Things unseen and unspoken go on in the Lothlorien that would've added to the magical nature of the quest. Mostly though, it is the shortening of the story that grates, because what is shown is a work of art and an act of love. Starting at Bilbo's party and right down to the breaking of the fellowship I felt taken in and in awe that the movie could capture the spirit of the book so well, if not the letter. The Balrog is a great DVD replay item! I'm no Tolkien fanboy with bookmarks on every page but this is the grandaddy of all modern fantasy stories and a great movie was finally made to do it justice.
10.0~Great Beginning! manherz Sign in Permalink It is incredibly difficult to really adapt most books into movies and still stay very true to the soul of the book. This movie does that in a very big way and really sets the mode for the following two movies. It is the hook and bait that is irresistible and even those that don't care for fantasy movies find themselves reeled into one of the greatest epic fantasy's ever told. Entering a world filled with new discoveries and incredible adventures is something that every child hopes for and thats exactly what sparked the creation of this epic. Watching this movie really brought me back to a time when life was magical and my imagination was all I needed to enjoy each day. Very few movies are able to immerse a person and make them feel very much apart of the story that is being told like this movie does.
10.0~Breathtaking Alex H Sign in Permalink Looking at all the criticism levelled at this film by so-called 'Tolkienites' it would seem that Peter Jackson did the equivalant of filming the New Testament with Ozzy Osbourne playing Jesus. What these criticisms fail to see is that the film couldn't be completely faithful to the film for one simple reason. The book is not that good. There I said it. I wont be surprised if I'm lynched by an angry mob within two days of this review going online but I don't care. The book has a clunky dialogue and no humour and had it been translated into a film directly it would not currently be sitting at the #2 spot in IMDb's top 250. What has happened here is that the creators have taken all the bits from the book which made you say "Wow, I wonder what that would look like with all of todays fancy special effects?" and distilled the plot into easy to manage bitesize chunks. In doing this, the film is given mass appeal rather than simply giving the "Dungeons and Dragons" players of this world something to talk to their imaginary girlfriends about. Let's talk about the cast for a second now shall we? Heading it up we have Elijah Wood. Forget all the talk about the Josh Hartnetts and and Sean William Scotts of this world, Wood is the 'next big thing' as far as Hollywood goes. At first I thought the Hobbits, especially Merry and Pippin, a little more angelic looking than I had first imagined them but it didn't take long to be impressed by their very hobbit like manor of speaking and,comendably I might add, the British accents of all the characters. Kudos to the dialect coach whomever they are! As anybody whos ever been within 20ft of a copy of Lord Of The Rings knows, wizards form the backbone of both good and evil in Middle Earth. In the dark corner we have Saruman, played by the consistently amazing Christopher Lee. If there is any one who can play the bad guy better than this man then...oh no wait hold on...no there isn't any body who can play the bad guy better than this man. And on the side of good we have Gandalf. If you've ever read the Hobitt, cast your mind back to when Gandalf is first described. Now, look at the way Ian McKellen moves, the way he looks, the way he acts. Look famillar? If you answered no to this question then, quite frankly, you're deranged. As for the rest of the Fellowship, we have Aragorn played solidly, if unspectacularly by relative unknown Viggo Mortensen. Orlando Bloom plays (my favorite character from the book) Legolas Greenleaf extremely well and John Rhys-Davies is wonderfully charming as Gimli the dwarf. By far the most outstanding non-hobbit, non-wizard figure in the film is Boromir, played by the utterly fantastic Sean Bean. Bean will be most well known to American audiences as 006 Alec Trevelyan from Bond movie Goldeneye or possible as Harrison Ford's nemsis in 'Patriot Games' but here he gives a career-best performance as the noble but flawed human hero of Gondor. That reminds me. There was exactly one moment where I was unimpressed by LOTR. If you are planning to read the book look away now. Boromir does not get killed in The Fellowship of the Ring as it was written by Tolkien and yet he does here. Yes the film did need some drama to end on but in my opinion it was a little much to kill one of the most important characters in the Two Towers to regrab audience attention. A quick word also to all those who complained that Peter Jackson expanded the female roles too much. Huh? Arwen in in this film for approximately fifteen minutes (despite how much Liv Tyler was used to promote the film) and in the book she's in it for about ten pages. So what? And Galadriel performs her role almost to the letter of the novel. Honestly there's just no pleasing some people. I really hope this film does well at the Oscars this year, it's the one film on the roster that really deserves it.
10.0~Absolutely fantastic. Rob_Taylor Sign in Permalink Most of what needs to be said about LOTR has already been said. It's a fine movie that pleased and delighted even the many nay-sayers who thought that Peter Jackson would produce another movie like Braindead. Having now watched the extended version I have to say that it adds a few extra scenes without going too far and just rounds out the story a little more. There are still a couple of scenes I would have liked to have seen in the film, namely the Barrow-Wights and also the scene after they leave Moria where they look into the lake, but very little of any consequence is left out of the story. The cast are all excellent and very much as I imagined them when reading the books many years ago. It's also refreshing to see a movie where the film isn't carried by one or two main actors. All the cast get significant screen time, and the various sub-stories (Gimli and Moria or Boromir, for example) are well presented and not skimpy add-ons to the main plot. There are some liberties with the script and characterization. For example, Merry and Pippin are now much more along for comic-relief than the serious young hobbits they were in the book. But even this works, as it provides a source of light humour to an otherwise quite dark storyline. And to those that say it's nothing like the books, well..... just be thankful it didn't turn into Dungeons and Dragons, or you'd really have something to cry about.
10.0~Epic reincarnation of Tolkien's classic freesexfortheblind Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson has done the unthinkable and given the public a true, honest and mindbending look into J.R.R Tolkien's marvel. Having read the book 3 months prior to the film's opening, I was astounded by the magnitude of the novel. The characters, plot and surroundings were so realistically set-out it made you belive you were there. I was therefore skeptical and a bit nervous when I heard that they were adapting it onto the silver screen. What deepened my fears was that Peter "Bad Taste" Jackson was at the helm and that they were going to film the entire trilogy at the same time. But, after being astounded throughout the 3 hour epic, my fears have been laid to rest. The casting was spot on and the settings were astonishing. Everything about The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, is epically proportioned and brilliantly carried out. How could anyone give it lower than 10 out of 10. I certainly couldn't and hope none of you will either.
1.0~The movie is terrible. duanecroft Sign in Permalink I'm a die-hard Lord of the Rings fan. I read the books for the first time over 30 years ago. I've read it over 50 times - including once out loud to my daughter when she was a little girl. I was very, very excited about seeing the movie. However, it turned out to be a major disappointment. Actually, it's much worse than that - I'm heartbroken. They cut an incredible amount of stuff, added a bunch of garbage that Tolkien never wrote and significantly changed many of the parts that they did see fit to leave in. At least I don't have to worry about seeing the next two - this one is so bad that there is no way I would ever go to see the next ones. I'd pay money to avoid seeing the next two and double to get out of the theater if I entered by mistake!
10.0~Everything's just right eledhwen_laurefin Sign in Permalink Just about everything about this film was done in a way that could not be bettered. The sets, the cast, the cinematography, the effects, the sound, the music, the costumes and the makeup were perfect. The plot line could not be improved upon, given the time limit, and the script also. The only thing that I didn't really like was the way Galadriel appeared scary and a bit unable to control her desire for power. I don't think that's accurate. She possessed the wisdom of the ages and was even kinder than Elrond; in the book she didn't say the things that she said in that power-hungry, maniacal sort of way that she did in the movie. Other than that, perfect.
10.0~Quick Comment daredevil_81 Sign in Permalink After seeing LOR, I was completely amazed by how Peter Jackson did absolutely amazing adaptation of the first novel. The acting was top notch, the special effects where used as a tool for the film, not the film was the tool for the special effects. It goes to show that good filmmakers are still around. Lucas should of watch LOR before he made Episode 2 (or before making Episode 3) and take notes on what real film making is all about, what if Peter Jackson directing Star Wars Episode 3? If he did it would have save the Star Wars Saga, and rescue it from the unbearable cheese of first 2 pre-quels. Besides the best Star Wars episode i.e. Empire Strikes back', wasn't made by Lucas but studio master Irvin Kershner. It goes to show that the Star Wars medium is brilliant, but with wrong directing it can be pure crap. And the LOR medium is equally awesome to Star Wars, but thank heavens that LOR had a good director. even though LOR books was one of the influences for Lucas to create the Star Wars saga anyway. Besides I shouldn't have compared LOR and Star Wars, but it was a natural Instinct to do so of the two Epic tales of good against evil. Peter Jackson doesn't care about world class box office sells, he cares about world class film making and that feeling is present within the film, thus making LOR refreshing to see. P.S. I know I will get criticised for what I said, I dont care.
1.0~Blown Out Of Proportion!!! imdbgenoxy Sign in Permalink Apart from the special effects, which are nothing more than OK, this film is simply BAD! Obviously, if you liked it, you're not a Tolkien fan, and if you haven't seen it, then save yourself from three hours of boredom and simply avoid it. The storyline is all over the place, and as a result, has no credibility whatsoever. On top of that, I found myself completely indifferent to the characters, which, if you read and loved the books, like I have, simply says it all. As a viewer, you don't get the feeling that the heroes travel for long periods of time between places, and you don't understand where they are now, or why there are there. Unless you know the storyline of the books inside-out, you will simply get lost in it - and if you do know it, you will simply get annoyed with what they've done with it. Also, in quite a few of the action scenes, there are moments where you'll be finding yourself thinking: 'yeah right - whatever'. If anything, it should've been made into a TV series. Certainly doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the top 250 films of all times!
1.0~Not nearly as good ... Bendrago Sign in Permalink Right, the problem here is that while it is an allright movie, it's nothing more than an action adventure movie. The "magic" of Tolkien has been lost and replaced by hollywood cliff hangers & lot's of action. The movie changes a lot (and I do mean a LOT) from the book and that in my opinion is so totally wrong. Reading the other reviews here I cant help but to laugh, I mean other people call this the best movie ever, not even close, not in the same galaxy even, I agree with someone that stated in his review that if this movie was called something else it wouldn't get half this good reviews. 90% of commenteers here look at this movie through pink glassess, they are too afraid to admit that there could be something wrong or something missing because this is after all "the" movie they have been waiting for. In all honesty it's a good movie, rates between 7 - 8 / 10 but it does trample the legacy of Tolkien by making the rather slow paced book to an action flick with little consern to the characters and their motives. This movie just doesn't "live" like book does. Do watch it and enjoy it, but rate it with open eyes.
10.0~Breathtaking! Darth-5972 Sign in Permalink As a keen fan of the book, I was anxious that the film 'did not let me down' as so many films of the book often do. The "Fellowship of the Ring" was... TRULY AMAZING! The scenery, photography, characters were so "breathtaking"... Thank you!
10.0~Amazing nankipoo Sign in Permalink I came to this film expecting to be bored, but now that I've watched it about 7 or 8 times all the way through, I'm amazed at how fantastic a movie it is. The cast is absolutely perfect...that's the only word for it. The story is totally entrancing, the locations and the sets are jaw-droppingly beautiful and mystical, and the screenplay is practically flawless. There is so much screen presence at work here: decades of great acting experience and faces that could only have played these parts. If the creators of this film can repeat the magic they captured here, then we may have a real milestone on our hands as movie fans. Don't let ANYONE tell you this movie wasted their time; that sounds more like a comment from a person who's lost their heart. "Lord of the Rings" is exquisite.
10.0~This is the best all time movie ever spongeboblovr19 Sign in Permalink I love this movie, i could watch it over and over again! If you haven't seen it already then you have been missing out! I first saw the movie just because my family was seeing it, and i wasn't really interested. But once i saw it i loved it. I saw it 5 times in the theater and own the dvd now. I plan on seeing the second one and the third, opening day of course! You better do the same! 8D
10.0~Brilliant jmaycock Sign in Permalink This is my favorite film of all time. The 4.5% of people who gave this a rating of 1 just to lower it's overall rating are idiots of the highest order. If you're not going to vote properly, don't vote at all. Nobody can honestly, hand on heart, say that this movie is a 1. My vote is 10 out of 10. I can't wait for the next one.....
1.0~Totally agree. Lacks Substance projectorlover Sign in Permalink Sure it may look great.But the story lacks substance. It feels to me like they go from adventure to adventure with no story ark. Elijah Wood is not Frodo. You had no sympathy for him. Legolas completely wasted. They turned Gimli into a fool. Which is totally against what was portrayed in the book. All in all I thought the acting was Ok at best. Very stiff dialogue.I normally love Christopher Lee.But not in this.Too monatone. Samwise Gamgee was the LOTR equivalant of Jar Jar Binks. All in all very disapointed. People have overlooked what made the book great in the first place. Count me out of Two Towers. Peter Jackson is very talented. This is not his best work.
10.0~Thank you Mr Jackson adamscastlevania2 Sign in Permalink (95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.
10.0~This movie has completely ruined me. lm6122124 Sign in Permalink Ok, I'm sorry to all those who already read my first comment, but I'm writing another one. I've seen LOTR four times, and a couple of days ago I was blankly staring at the TV, trying to think of something to watch. I cannot see another movie without comparing it to The Fellowship. The only thing I think about when I have some time to myself is "I want to see LOTR again!" I'm addicted to this movie. I pity all of you who have not yet seen it. Today I was wandering around on the web and I met RingMessenger. This guy is a computer program. All you have to do is put it on your buddy list, then send him a message. He'll help you out from there. But basically, he's a source of everything you ever wanted to know about The Lord of the Rings: the actors, the language, everything. I recommend it to any LOTR fan. I really loved this movie. Elijah Wood is so cute! But then again, so is Orlando Bloom.... Hehehe. The Lord of the Rings will probably be the trilogy of our generation, like Star Wars was for the last one. know the scenes and most of the script by heart. Am I obsessed or what? (my other message is more about my comments, right now I just wanted to rant and rave about the movie some more!)
1.0~A film that stopped. mikevotto Sign in Permalink I love the books, I hate the movie. This film was uninspired garbage, tied up in a gory bow of violent scenes every 15 minutes, and topped off with terrible acting by all major characters. This film has recently been called "the best of the year" and grossly "the best film ever. Anyone person of sane mind,who has the ability to look past the sweeping landscapes and the horrific makeup, can clearly see that this movie has little to offer. The movie opens up with a basic epic voice-over like in many films before it, giving you an overview so the audience doesn't get confused, as most people in the audience would not have the brain power to figure it out for themselves. Then the ametuer director, Peter Jackson, feels the need to rub New Zealand's flowing landscapes in the face of every person viewing the film. This was the major weapon from this director and it was selfish use of film. Then the character casting was horrible, you have the kid from Radio Flyer, the one pretty boy from 28 Days, and lets not forget Rudy. Ian McKellen gave a below average performance, which is suprising from a man who has such film history. This would prove to be small potatoes by the time the movie ended. It is hard to explain how much the end of the movie made me mad. Or should I say the anti-ending. This may look unique in the eyes of cinematic idiots, but it was just unnerving. The ending was not an ending, it was an extended pause until next year. If you gave me the production value that they got, I could have gotten all three books in three hours and still be true to the story. The ending was not there. Most films have endings. This was just a film that stopped. I have proven my case and now you take it or leave it, but I know that this is probably the most hyped movie of the year, and most likely the worst. Star Wars Episode I was better than this garbage. Peter Jackson should just quit here because he has nothing else left in him.
1.0~Read this review if you haven't read the book badbit Sign in Permalink After watching LOTR and cursing it as the worst movie of the year, I decided to take a look at the books to see what the fuzz is all about. Well, the reading of "The fellowship of the ring" made me reconsider my opinion. The movie it's A LOT WORSE after reading it. I liked the book, but it will not be in my favorite list. I can't stand the great deal of people who are claiming that "Peter Jackson did a wonderful job adapting the book to the screen" and that "it couldn't be better" without even reading the book! Many people say, "it's impossible to adapt a book to the screen". Well, guess what, it's not. If you watch and read "The godfather" you'll know what I mean. I consider the movie even superior than the book, it's pecfect in every way. Another good example it's "2001: A space oddisey", while in this case the book is superior, the movie it's a very good work. The list goes on: Gone with the wind, Lawrence of arabia, A clockwork orange, The wizard of Oz, The grapes of wrath, blah, blah. I guess that LOTR it's not even one of the 100 greatest adapted screenplays of all-time. First of all, the events in the book are slowly revealed, a little bit at a time, it makes the whole thing much more interesting. In the movie we start with a voice-over spoiling us all the emotion and trying to make us think "wow, this movie is gonna be great, look at that big monster". Second, everything in the book happens for good reason. A lot of scenes from the book appear in the film, but their reason it's very different. For example the parting of Frodo from the shire has a lot more of preparation, planning and help from his hobbit-friends, why? If you want to know, read the book, it's explained there with a lot of detail. In the movie it's off-and-go, for no reason at all. I have to say this also about Merry and Pippin, in the movie they're pointless. Another bad scene, this one involving snow, comes to my mind. Third, middle-earth it's portrayed in the book with great detail, it's very real. I can imagine every square-inch of it, the vegetation, animals, climate, soil, etc. In the book we see it mostly as a CGI generated background and it looks fake. Fourth, acting. This is the worst part of the movie. The dialog it's just stupid, it makes the characters look like cardboard. They take themselves too seriously, and they speak as if they were reading some ancient sacred text. The book has this feeling also, but the book pretends to feel like an ancient sacred text. Also, everyone has the same facial expression trough the whole movie (specialy Frodo). Fifth, in the book, the pacing it's very slow. It gives us the impression that middle-earth it's a slow place. That the news take months to travel from town to town. There's no technology, but there's history, culture, myth, art and traditions. Frodo is scared to death when he hears that black riders were seen in this town, or in that place. Every time closer. In the movie, we only see Frodo being chased by scary-looking men in black, who made us say: "Look, the bad guys". Also, in the movie we see people killing bad guys at an incredible fast rate, then, after they managed to escape in an unconvincing way with help from someone you didn't expect, they kill more bad guys. AND ABOVE ALL, THE ENDING. Please!!!! This is the result of making the three movies at the same time. It just fades to black in the middle of the story. Altough the book ending it's very similar, it leaves you satisfied, and wanting to know that will happen next. The movie just stops. I guess the next movie will begin from the next frame this one finished. Amazing that the ending didn't catched up Frodo in the middle of a word. In my opinion, this movie it's bad, and it drags on forever. Ask yourself this questions, I give you my answers: 1. Is it innovative? No, there are a lot of movies which use the techniques used here. 2. Is it original? No, adapting a book to the screen it's done by Hollywood in a regular basis. If you say that the story it's original, then you're really saying that the book it's original. 3. Does it have great fx? I don't think so. This movie uses almost the same fx techniques than "Star Wars: The phantom menace". If the effects were somewhat different, they weren't real enough. Even "Jurassic Park" fx are better 4. Does it have memorable scenes? No, even the death of Gandalf was laughable. Overall, I have given my opinion before and after reading the book. And my conclusion it's this: This is the second most over-rated movie of all times (the first one it's Titanic). It's nothing new, original or great. Too bad that the other two movies are already finished, because they're gonna be just like this one.
10.0~A Breathtaking Epic of huge scale and beauty Psychotic41 Sign in Permalink The first installment of this long awaited trilogy is a huge success. The movie's 3 hour runtime is very long but dosen't seem as long as it is. Unlike Harry Potter this film takes itself a little bit more seriously but is as good. The story drifts away from the little bit better book but is still good. The actors such as Elijah Wood, Ian Mckellen, Liv Tyler and all of them are truly talented actors who give us oscar worthy performances. The beautiful New Zealand locations are truly stunning. Its sequels are long awaited and will be just as good. I give this film a ten and so should you.
10.0~I LOVE THE MOVIE!!! HopeLStan89 Sign in Permalink This movie is the most wonderful movie made! I don't know how Peter Jackson did it but he did and it turned out great! This movie is going to go down in history. Elijah Wood did great at his part. He is an amazing actor along with the rest of the crew! I've already bought the movie and expecting to buy the next two which are going to be awesome!!! I absutley love the movie!!
10.0~A Beautiful start for the trilogy abhishekkr2-1 Sign in Permalink This is a movie you wanna watch before you die. This movie is a real beauty, if you watch it once you will watch it again and again. I think this movie has the best startup commentary among all the Hollywood movies and the voice of Galadriel here is ethereal. The depiction of Gollum's character in a shadowy manner is quite terrific. Also some of the scenes at the beginning of the movie of the battle is ecstatic in spite of the fact that this movie has mainly concentrated on fights not battles. Here the adaptation is thorough though 3.5 hrs is not enough to capture all the intricate details like, Tom Bombadil and the escape of Bilbo Baggins from the Gollum's cave etc. The whole movie seems majestic and it is very difficult not to like it. Let it be the Bridge of Khaza-dum,the Bree, the gates of Rivendell, the mines of Moria, etc every bit of it is terrific. Also, one cannot forget the depiction of the Shire which looks so innocent a place and the stress on the color green is absolutely stunning. If you ever going to plan to see this movie see it now and I know you'll like it and I mean every second of it.
10.0~My opinion dula01 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie. However, I can totally understand why some people wouldn't like it - no movie or any work of art is ever universally liked. What I do find objectionable are those who express nothing less than outrage and disbelief that this movie should be loved by so many. You can say you don't like something, but to say that those who do like it are mistaken is incredibly arrogant - and makes the clearly erroneous assumption that their opinion is somehow more valid than others. Personally I find it deeply puzzling that many people seem to rate The Shawshank Redemption so highly. I thought it was pretty good but would never place it anywhere near the top of an all-time best movie list. I also would never dream of telling anyone who did think it was the best movie ever made that they were wrong. I would accept their right to have an opinion different from mine and move on. I suggest those apparently struggling with the huge popularity of LOTR:FOTR do the same.
10.0~One of the best film of all time franckynoelma Sign in Permalink I think this film is one of the best film of all time along withe God Father. If you haven't seen you gotta go see it now. Believe me you'll love it. I became a Filmmaker today because of this film. The cinematography is great. I've such a great deal of filmmaking by this film. I remember the time I saw this, I was in Middle school at that time. Tis film is great for fans of fantasy, action, triller, and horror. What amaze me the most was the set decorating, everything was life like. The make for the creature were amazingly done. Bringing this fantasy to life was a monumental task for the filmmaker. One of my favorite character of this was Smeagal. the way he acts and move was well done and matches his character.
10.0~FAVOURITE SET OF MOVIES EVERRRRR! elizabeth-12994 Sign in Permalink Lord of the rings (as in the trilogy) are my favourite set of movies or movie of all time. The cast couldn't have been better, the story line was epic and the way they made it from JRR Tolkien's book into a film was superb. It's such an advanced world that seems real. It is so advanced it doesn't feel like a fantasy film. You really need to watch the whole trilogy because it's the BEST MOST AWESOME EPIC WONDERFUL AMAZING TRILOGY OR MOVIES EVER!!!! Ian Mckellen, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin were brilliant! The whole plot of this film seems real. It is so well planned and I thought Peter Jackson is the best director for these movies!
10.0~Cinematic history in the making gheremond Sign in Permalink The very idea that the same guy who directed Braindead would one day become Cecil B. DeMille's and David Lean's heir must have been the source of much of joy and laughter. But the first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy proves that you need pure, fresh, unadulterated talent if you are to tackle a challenge such as bringing a dense, 1200+ pages, beloved, impossible to adapt literary masterpiece to life. Peter Jackson and his renegade team of mostly unknowns (up to that point) pulled off the biggest gamble in film history that could have easily sent New Line to its grave a few years earlier than it did. It sets the trilogy to a great start, staying true to the original and communicating all the grandeur and darkness of Tolkien's Middle Earth. The movie was robbed at the Oscars.
10.0~Peter Jackson neils999 Sign in Permalink Wow - after reading the books have i just realised what a brave man Peter Jackson is. Well, he pulled it off brilliantly, hey - how bout - from now on, we elect Peter Jackson to sit on George Lucas's throne? Star Wars was good, but Tolkiens masterpiece has finally been done justice - and Mr Jackson brought it to us - well done mate! Neil
10.0~Exceeded my expectations dezlambert Sign in Permalink Minor Spoilers I had doubts about this film before I saw it. I wasn't a really big fan of the book and I'm not a great fan of the director, Peter Jackson. I didn't believe the hype and so when I got round to seeing the film I was in for a big surprise! I really can't praise this film enough. The actors were superb, my favourites being Sean Bean as Boromir and Ian Mckellan (sp?) as Gandalf. The sets and landscapes are breathtaking and the special effects, for the most part, were first rate. My only gripes were the battle scenes near the start of the film which were a little hard to follow and seemed a little too CGI, and some of the performances for the minor parts (Galadriel and Elrond) were a bit wooden compared with the rest of the cast - or is that how Elves are supposed to be? However, even these small quibbles couldn't stop me giving this film 10/10. The next two installments have a lot to live up to!
10.0~My Second Review MySilentReverie Sign in Permalink I know that I have already posted a review on the site but I just can't get enough of this movie. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my 18 years of being alive. What I noticed watching this movie the second time around is that the movie just keeps on getting better and better. Some of the best acting in this film is from the facial expressions made by the actors. Elijah Wood is one of the very few actors who can convey what he is feeling through his facial expressions and this movie shows how much of a good actor he is. I also really enjoyed Viggo Mortensen and Ian McKellen. I think that this movie should have won all the oscars that it was nominated for. I can't wait until The Two Towers comes out so I can go enjoy another great movie by Peter Jackson. It's very rare you get a movie like this and all the acting be great but all the actors in this film were amazing and this has become one of my favorite movies ever.
10.0~Great First Installment dandare4479 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson taking on The Lord of the Rings books and creating a live action trilogy of films was a gigantic undertaking. One which paid off in creating one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. If all three films were one continuous film it would easily be the greatest film of all time. It all started with this first chapter being a commercial and critical success. I enjoy Fellowship of the ring the most out of all three films, its world is created with total love of the source material. Including great Sfx and model work, along with stunning vistas of New Zealand. Peter Jackson however never forgets that it his is characters that keep his world small and intimate. Great works especially from Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Vigo Mortensen whom anchor the entire film series. I find it hard to find anyone in the entire cast whom is not well suited to their roles. The story contains epic battles, friendships, death, love, hope, freedom. Try and watch the excellent extended edition. The film is recommended to anyone old enough watch it, it is a truly outstanding piece of cinema that will be remembered for a long time to come.
10.0~Memorable Movie Experience dragonfire_777 Sign in Permalink I was never a fan of the Lord of the Ring books. Just couldn't get into them. My thanks to Peter Jackson et al for producing one of the great film experiences I've ever had. From the incredible detail of costumes and sets, the great makeup, the characters I'll never forget, the wonderful score to the overwhelming beauty of New Zealand this movie had everything and it was made with a great sense of care and devotion to the material. Since the release of the DVD (especially the extended version) I have not tired of seeing this film again and again. A memorable movie experience.
1.0~:-P santi_f Sign in Permalink Thank God there are a whole lot of other people who think exactly like me! I was beginning to feel like an ET wondering why was everyone so absolutely hyped by this movie! Just because I could make a (long) list here with real masterpieces, I can imagine the serious displeasure of so many great directors and writers when they see this bunch of people getting crazy over a movie like this! And not only 'the lord...' isn't even a comparison for actual good FILMS, it's not good at all! I think the book might have so many characters (and monsters) that peter jackson made whatever he could to fit them all in this 3 hour movie. The result: I just didn't laughed when ANOTHER weird named monster appeared, cause I wanted to cry for the money I had spent on the ticket! It's stupid, a big waste of time, and a sad proof of how low-cultured the whole world is lately. As I said: it's sad.
10.0~A Matter of Visions happiscotsman Sign in Permalink Roger Ebert only gave this film three stars because he felt it did not meet his personal criteria for what the movie should be like. But that is what Peter Jackson has been embellishing ever since he started on this nearly eight-year odyssey. It is Jackson's view of how HE would want the movie to be made. On that note, this film has been worth the three years I have spent salivating over any and every web site designed to proclaim the greatest film series ever ("Star Wars" has lost its edge, and "The Matrix" has too narrow an appeal). The only reason I found out these movies were being made was because I was curious what Sean Bean had been up to. This was in 1998, and the wait was well worth it. New Zealand was the PERFECT place for filming Middle Earth, and Jackson does a fine job in making sense of the epic novel. The actors were all fine in their roles, although I still long for Sean Connery as Gandalf, even though Sir Ian McKellen did get an Academy Award nomination. Personally, I though the best performances were by Sean Astin and Sean Bean (Have I already shown my bias for the only man who could play Richard Sharpe?) And while the action scenes are quite engaging, the Rivendell scene stands out as my favorite. The first shots capture the mystery and splendor of Middle Earth's most enchanting and enigmatic characters, the Eldar (Elves to you non-readers of the novels). Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score is no better the here, with the ghostly chorus holding their notes as the Hobbits stroll mesmerized through this strange and beautiful land. The imagery is so engaging that the audience cannot help but be swept away as well. This is what movie-making is all about folks, and if you miss this, you've missed a lot.
10.0~Magical liammurphy1 Sign in Permalink I haven't read the books so I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie & having heard it was over three hours long I was a bit sceptical about watching it. But I have to say I was amazed - The acting by all concerned is good to excellent especially from Elliah Wood as Frodo & Ian Mckellen as gandalf, The action was well handled & very exciting, The special effects were great but thankfully they didn't distract from the plot (as in MEN IN BLACK 2) The beautiful New Zealand scenery was a joy to watch, and the 3 hours fly by as long as you are prepared to give it a go as it is quite slow to begin with, With the strong characterization of the first 40 minutes. You may be disapointed to see the film end so suddenly as the story follows through 2 more movies, but you'll be thankful you sat down and watched. A future holiday classic a must for all adventure/sci-fi fans 10/10 just great from start to finish
10.0~Excellent adventure moviesleuth2 Sign in Permalink Personally, I'm not a big fan of fantasy. I find it rather pretentious and for most entries into the genre, silly and/or melodramatic. But Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" is an exception. It's a grand adventure filled with limitless energy and likable characters. The series is at the top of the IMDb "Top 250" list, and rightly so. The first installment is extraordinary. I'm going to skip over the plot because by now everyone knows it. The acting is pitch-perfect across the board. Elijah Wood has clearly grown out of his kid roles, and is terrific as Frodo. His co-star Ian McKellen may have gotten the Oscar nod for his role, but Wood equals him. Likewise, McKellen finds the right note for Gandalf. Everyone else is perfectly suited for their roles as well. Special note goes to Sean Bean, who made a career out of playing creeps and villains, is successful as Boromir, and shows that he has more range than people may give him credit for. The stakes were incredibly high for this film series, and obviously it paid off. Peter Jackson deserves much of the credit. His work here is the fantasy answer to George Lucas' "Star Wars" saga. Unlike much of today's CGI, it wasn't done cheaply, and everything looks authentic, and the result is breathtaking. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not. But Jackson's skill goes beyond the effects. Much of the acclaim of Tolkien's series is the fact that he created a whole new world. Jackson does the same thing; it doesn't feel like a bunch of effects were added to sets or everything was in front of a blue screen. Jackson has created a whole new world, just like Tolkien did. Of course, this would not be worth anything if Jackson and his co-writers hadn't written a screen adaptation that was worthy of the book (which I have not read). Everything moves smoothly and nothing feels left out or short-changed. Many films have been destroyed by too much hype. But "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is so grand that nothing could diminish its spectacle. And what a film to deserve it!
10.0~I would have followed you... my King! DreadfulA Sign in Permalink That's the best line in the movie. Beautiful. Let's say this straight away: FotR is the best movie of the trilogy, hands down. What makes it stand out as masterpiece is its variety. We can witness a majority of Middle Earth in this one movie. We will take part in a celebration in the beautiful Hobbiton along with some hobbits, look in the eye of darkness in the form of Nazgul and feel danger on the Weathertop, see the serenity of Rivendell, gaze the ruggedness of Misty Mountains, sense the eeriness of Moria, listen to the elves sing in Lothlorien, enter the realm of men through the majestic Argonath and finally see a glimpse of distant Mordor over Emyn Muil. I mean, if that's not one hell of an adventure, I'm not sure what is. And still the movie doesn't feel like it has too much things going on. It's the adventurous nature of the book, that is perfectly implemented into a movie. Obviously the long duration helps. It's more like a necessity to include the majority of things. Still, even the extended edition doesn't contain everything from the book. For example the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil was left out, which was a disappointment when I first saw the movie 14 years ago. But afterwards I understand, that the whole scenario would have affected the flow of the film dramatically, and that the character Tom Bombadil wasn't really suitable for a big screen audience. He was more of a Tolkien's stream of consciousness than an important character for the plot and works better within the more poetic and slower approach of the book. Although, in TTT the Fangorn Forest is connected with the Old Forest, which is also mentioned in that movie. One thing that was changed big time was the expanded role of Arwen when she comes to rescue from Rivendell. It doesn't happen that way in the book but works fine here. During the movie I never felt bored, and still today I feel the same tension and awe of the first screening in every take. What a wonderful and careful directing from Mr. Jackson. When the actors and director care for their work, it really comes out lifelike. Of course it helps when we know the story and characters beforehand, but they are cast and acted so well that it amazes me. Every one looks the part. My favourites being Boromir, Legolas, Galadriel and Gandalf. And I thought Sir McKellen was great as Magneto in X-Men, but he really is Gandalf in real life, I believe so. Whereas TTT and RotK are more epic in staging and effects, FotR is more accurate and subtle. TTT has its moments like Gollum, RotK has the most beautiful ending and an epic battle in Minas Tirith, the FotR is a nonstop roller-coaster ride with beauty, despair, companionship and sense of growing danger that lurks everywhere. The characters feel more vulnerable, like the fact that the hobbits require protection from the bigger characters. On the other hand Gandalf seems to possess more magic powers than later in the saga as Gandalf the White. All in all FotR takes less liberties than the next two movies and stays true to the book. In fact, it must be the best book adaptation ever filmed.
10.0~one of the best movies ever!! montoya_luisa Sign in Permalink I was pretty nervous when they announce that they were going to make this movie. I'm a Tolkien FANATIC and I'm extremely picky when it comes to books made into movies. Then I even got more nervous when I saw the previews and Liv Tylor was on it... I was scared I kept telling myself they are going to destroy my favorite book of all time. There were no women in the fellowship!! After all I had to be loyal to my loved book and I went to the movies on opening night and I was AMAZED. Peter Jackson did a GREAT job almost perfect (I still hated Tylor on it, I also did not like that they made her part longer Arwen was only in the book for a page at most). It took me a long time to write a review I re-read the lord of the rings, in order to make a fair comparison. My conclusion is that this movie is an AMAZING accomplishment. The director's cut (sorry peter I know that you don't like it being call this) is even better I was extremely excited when I bought it. This will be a masterpiece and it has become my favorite movie. People who do not enjoy this movie for any reason, should at least acknowledge the work and detail that went into this project. Peter Jackson has surprised me and return my love into movies. Congratulations to all the people who participated in this project, you all did a great job. This is the movie that made me bought a DVD and a surround sound system
10.0~This Film was very good considering the limited length. Makoshark11 Sign in Permalink The Film itself was very well done, but, in my own opinion, had they done six films (as there are actually six books, not just three) all two to three hours long, then they would not have had too cut so much out. Why they cut out the Hobbits' journey through the Old Forest, their meeting of Tom Bombadil, Being caught at the Barrow-Downs, Gandalf's explanation of Gollum etc. (That's only the first half-hour of the first movie-who knows what they cut out of The Two Towers and Return of the King). And I simply don't like the way they did Frodo's rescue from the Ring Wraiths after he was wounded on Weather-Top-they should not have tried to make Arwen such a heroin. They should have had more respect for Tolkien's work than to change it so, cutting out bits and pieces is one thing completely changing a very good scene is another. Those who have read the book know what I'm talking about-it should have been longer, to show how far they had to travel with Frodo in this condition, and they should have had parts of it sort of-from Frodo's point of view, so that you could see just how bad his condition was. I think that I would have like this movie much better, had I never read the books.
10.0~Oh My God eligem Sign in Permalink This is an amazing film. I thought that it would be yet another magical movie but it took my by surprise. Having such unique actors and the range in skills really made this film great. I couldn't get enough of it and I didn't. I loved the film so much that I got it on DVD, VIDEO and the extended DVD. Looking back at Wood's first movies. He was a hit from the start. So much skill that would grow for him and help him star in a great film like LOTR (Lord of the Rings). It was great to be introduced to many new actors that have not been in many films like Billy Boyd, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and many others like Orlando Bloom. They all did well in the film and all deserve to share the credit. Even the cast behind the scenes were great. The amazing cinematic parts of the film took me by suprise and seeing the computer created troll interacting around the actors was amazing. This films deserved all the cheers it got. !!!!BEST FILM EVER!!!!
10.0~Flawless jesusofchicago Sign in Permalink After viewing this movie many times (both theatrical release and dvd) I have no complaints and only praise. This is a flawless movie as far as movies go. This will be the 'Star Wars' of this generation. My rating - 10/10
5.0~Valiant attempt to film the unfilmable. No spoilers. alembic Sign in Permalink It takes a brave person to attempt to direct such an epic as Lord of the rings , since many who cherish the book will point to any omission or alteration to Tolkiens masterwork as bordering on blasphemy. I have mixed feelings after seeing the movie, having read the book many times. I went to the screening with an open mind and of course realising that it is starkly impossible to accommodate all the detail and sequences from the book even spread over 3 separate films. I guess the problem is that with such an imaginative and descriptive book, each reader will visualise their own image of middle-earth and the sound,look and feel of the characters. This presents an immensely difficult job for any director to realise a version which will please all - simply not possible. I can say that many people at the screening were indeed "wowed" and "blown away" by the film. So perhaps , familiarity with the book is in this case a disadvantage. Ok so why mixed feelings ? On many levels the film is spectacularly successful - the sets ( in particular Bag End and Rivendell ) are superb. The computer graphics are top rate ( Sarumans tower Orthanc and the mines of Moria stand out ). The overall look of the film is terrific. It was also nice to have passages of dialogue lifted almost verbatim from the book. Generally the cast did a fine job. Christopher Lee is outstanding as Saruman and for my money stole the show. I think I would have preffered to have Sean Bean in the role of Aragorn/Strider since Aragorn is at first very menacing when initially encountered , and Sean is also capable of non-menacing acting as well. As Boromir he is still great. Viggo Mortnsen is great as Aragorn but to me the dynamic Sean Bean stole the screen. One thing I found wearisome was the seemingly never ending close ups on Elijah Wood ( not his fault ). Wood does a commendable job in a difficult role where he is expected to change from innocent carefree Frodo into world weary ring-bearer. For those familiar with the book the Icons such as Bilbo's Mithril coat he gives to Frodo , or the sword Narsil or the seeing stones etc will be easily recognisable but for those seeing only the film for the first time I suspect in places it may seem bewildering or these items may lose their significance. Again this is perhaps the problem .. how to do justice to it all. What to cut, what to leave in ? I cringed at the story alterations ( ommissions ok - alterations not ok ). A score out of 10 for having the guts to even attempt to film the book in the first place should be 10/10 so thanks Peter Jackson. So how does it rate ? Perhaps like this : For those who have not read the book 8 out of 10. For those who have read the book 5 out of 10. Remembering that the book is split into 3 films ( I assume they follow basically the three books which comprise Lord of the Rings ) will explain the way the first film ended ( which seemed to puzzle some people ). Should you see it ? Yes ! One area where the film definately did score was broad appeal - enough drama and visuals for the buffs and plenty of action to keep the kids happy ( note: it is rather violent in places ). Go see it soon !
10.0~The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air." Blazs91 Sign in Permalink The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air." This is the memorable quote by Galadriel introducing the movie. Honestly, I was in the age of 9 when I could have convinced my parents with the help of my cousins to take us to the theater to experience this marvelous creation of the mighty director bearing the name Peter Jackson. Above all, I need to clarify that this movie is not perfect. I've never (and nobody has ever) met a movie, which can be considered faultless. Everybody has to admit the fact, that even if we're biased toward our favorite movies, they also have more or less mistakes. But we tend to just simply pass over them. In the case of this movie they have made some mistakes in the adaptation process, sometimes it could became painfully sluggish and depressed, it's runtime is so, that the movie is independently able to create the concept of never-ending". BUT! Despite of these small errors", declaring, that the magnificent and spectacular moments, the deeply philosophical quotes, the inimitable acting performance, the immersive and mind- blowing music composing, the stunning and dazzling visual effects are inappropriate, that is an epic mistake! Peter Jackson completed his quest, and thus could have set a standard by which future movies should be judged and rated. The story takes place in the magical realm of Middle-Earth created by J. R. R. Tolkien. We can witness how a meek hobbit of The Shire sets out on a perilous journey in the company of his gardener and two of his friends, and how he accepts his fate about facing a world destroyer evil, Sauron, The Deceiver. I can't describe how fantastic the story is. Tolkien could professionally narrate you a true and touching tale about friendship, cohesion, loyalty, honor, treachery, forgiveness, malice and goodness. All of these attributes and feelings can recognized in different scenes of the movie. They are illustrated by deed of the actors, the soundtracks, the locations and quotes or simple words. This movie represents that if you are small and tiny, you still can become stronger, but in order to that you have to survive many physical and mental trials without fatigue and abdication of your responsibilities. You can find every precious sentimental human values when you watch over the trilogy, and they perfectly spread among the different fictional races. And the way of how Tolkien stirred and mixed these values in his fairy tale, that was the thing, which enabled him to successfully accomplish the creation of one of the worlds greatest and most epic drama story. But besides philosophy and theories, there are many other intrinsic values that can be perceptible by everyone! 1) The visuals. The quality of the image through the whole movie in mind-blowing! They put so many CGI in the film, but they do in a perfect way, so that I haven't grabbed me out of the movie. I could have totally take the 3,5 hours seriously, because the effects were not over-hyped and over-saturated by preposterous and unnatural colors. They were smooth and soft, but well-designed down to the tiniest details. They filmed most of the motion picture in real, existing locations of New Zealand, and they only filled the empty spaced with some monument or ruins of old destroyed castles. The overall visual design of Middle-Earth was so realistic and lifelike. 2) The performance. All the actors made a remarkable job during the filming. They killed their characters from the beginning till the end. In my opinion, choosing an adequate actor for the role of Aragorn was one of the most critical point of the organization of the whole crew. This character is a major icon of the history of Middle- Earth. But Viggo Mortensen has made the best out of himself, so no worries! Ian McKellen visualized Gandalf in a legendary way. Every time I saw his character, ha reminds me Gandalf and Dumbledore at all. So he made Gandalf not just A Wizzard, but THE Wizzard. Elijah Wood's performance was also surprisingly great. I didn't have too much expectations about that, so I was pleasantly surprised. He could totally integrate Frodo's mental and physical development into his character. 10 points for the Hobbits. 3) The sound & music. All hail to Howard Shore. Since the old, original Star Wars trilogy it has never even crossed my mind, that I would ever experience the I was chilled to my bones" effect on myself. But the soundtrack is simply magnificent in this movie. Every time I can hear the pure melody, I feel myself being taken to Middle-Earth on the wings the epic music. All the original score is almost beyond epic totally fits the actual occasion happening on the screen. The other sounds are also flawlessly edited. The screeching of the nazguls is still can terrify me even today. 4) The adaptation. I admit that some essential elements and characters were left out of movie, and the story was altered somewhere, but despite of that you can't judge the movie, because it still perfectly bring Middle-Earth to life before our eyes, which is totally the same what you can build up in your mind out of the raw material gained from Tolkien's book. Peter Jackson had to visualize a whole universe, and he managed to succeed. You can find many tiny details in the movie that you can also find in the thick book while seeking through the lines. And this is the key thing, that makes the movie so charming for the true fans, so that it would give your hearth a warm hug. This is the movie of my life! When it came out, it just simply hit the screen with true vengeance. Thanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!
10.0~Let's wait for March amandacf Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson did what lots of people wanted to do. He directed an amazing movie about a book that changed the life of many people in the whole world, including me. He created the middle-earth that we 'see' reading the book. He didn't win the Academy Award as best director and the movie didn't win it too. That's unfair but next March, I hope justice will be done.
10.0~Be a part of the fellowship! ADOZER200 Sign in Permalink I have to say when i first saw this movie i liked it but i didnt love it, or at least not yet. I read more about this story and learned about the facts and characters and i have to say i want to see this movie everyday now. It is a classic for our time. This is what working so hard on a film is worth. This can be put amongst the greatest movie of all time and not just in my opinion. I would have to say it is better than Harry Potter or any of the new Star Wars movies. Thats hard for me to say being such a big fan of Star Wars. Ofcourse there are some classics it could never beat like the original Star Wars for example. This definitely is a hard earned film. Props to Peter Jackson for his directing. Ian Mckellan as Gandolf was awesome. I could not think of anyone better for the job. I thought about Christopher Lee but he played well enough as Saramon. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have been two of my favorite actors for years and to see both of them together in one film was good enough for me. When i found out John Rhys Davies played Gimli i flipped out. He is always doing a great job like in Indiana Jones and King Solomons Mines. Im gla to see he is still doing well and actually better than ever. Now Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean im not too familiar with. Bean plays Borimir who is courageous and some what good hearted but coneyving at the same time. I couldnt think of anyone better for that part. Mortensen plays Aragorn(Strider). I think he was an awesome actor in this. Aragorn's performance grows more on me every time i see the movie. My favorite of the whole film was Bloom playing the character Legoles. The old myth of the elf comes to life through this character. I have always studied the myth of the elves and they got it pretty accurate. Featherweight, great senses, ears of a dolphin, nose of a hound, eye of a hawk, eats like a bird, strategic moves, skill with a bow, very feirce and crafty with the blade when they have to be. Above all this movie is amongst my favorites and i cant wait until the whole trilogy comes out.
10.0~A magnificent vision LG72387 Sign in Permalink Many years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a series of novels that swept the literary world off its feet. They were stories of magical worlds littered with creatures we can only see in our imaginations. Tolkien created an epic adventure such as the world has never known and he called them The Lord of the Rings. Years later, Peter Jackson took the first part of that epic saga and made it into a film such as the world has never seen. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an adventure story about a dark lord named Sauron who creates a ring so that he can control all of Middle Earth. Sauron loses the ring and it eventually winds up in the hands of one Frodo Baggins, a hobbit who has lived in peace for all of his life. Like his uncle before him (Bilbo Baggins), Frodo wants the sense of adventure in his life and wants to explore more than what his eyes can see. That is exactly what happens to him in the worst of ways when Bilbo bequeaths to him a Ring of mysterious power and origin. Eventually, we discover that the Ring is indeed the Ring of Power crafted by Sauron himself. Gandalf, Frodo's old wizard friend, tells him that the Ring must be destroyed or all of Middle Earth will fall under the might of Sauron. Henceforth, Frodo sets out to destroy the Ring with his hobbit friends (Merry, Pippen, and Sam) and winds up in many sorts of adventures which lead to massive sorrow and pain. There is much more to the story than what I am telling you and I won't tell you because much of it is surprise and littered with all sorts of action and adventure. Elijah Wood (who plays Frodo in the film) gives an honest performance and could have received a Best Actor nomination. The writers intend to make the audience believe that Frodo is us, as a human being, and the way that he looks at this is the way that we would look at it. The Fellowship of the Ring is a vivid and magnificent adaptation to Tolkiens's own masterpiece and Peter Jackson has created a world that we will never forget in our minds. He has taken a novel one could only picture in their imaginations and made it into a film that stretches the boundaries of cinema. He has used the computer to create creatures from another world and has done it with great success. He has made a picture that will be considered one of the best epic motion pictures of all time that goes along with such classics as Ben Hur and Gone with the Wind. If Mr. Tolkien were alive today, he would be astounded by the amazing vision of Peter Jackson for his novel and would be proud to have written such a wonderful classic. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is indeed a film which should not be missed by any die hard movie fan across America. Lenny's Grade: ****
10.0~A truly exceptional film Mr_PCM Sign in Permalink There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making. Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions. The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award. The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars. Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies. A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling, and essential viewing.
1.0~Pretty but boring kalinsomphane Sign in Permalink As I started seeing the commercials for this movie I was convinced that this would be a typical fairy tale movie, not worthy of being seen. Until today I was definitely not going, but as circumstances went I wound up at the theater at 2pm, almost late, but in time for the start. The movie started nice - black stuff all over and bad guys who look like they need a lot of facial hair to cover their ugliness were all over the place. The middle was "interesting" - a lot of run and other stuff, comparable to run. Scenery was outstanding. The end was, uh, gone. Where did the end go? Someone quickly think of another hour for the ending. The end left things pretty unfinished, since the good guys neither died nor won. I think another 3 long hours for the finish would be added as a sequel or something. At the end I would say that the only thing good about this was the scenery and the cast. Nothing else is worth spending $8 and sitting in a chair for 3 hours. The plot seems full, long - 3 hours long, the story seems involving, but not to me. Overall I heard a lot of people say "why did I come here", or saw people leave a good hour before the thing was officially over. I've heard a lot of people who've already read the book say it's good and at the same time a lot of people that haven't say it's awful. If you really need to find out if it's good or not you should go see it, but if you trust me - rent it a month later for a lot less.
10.0~A timeless Epic about Good v.s. Evil. wuser08816 Sign in Permalink This is an epic that everyone should see. The visual effects and story line are incredible. Although you don't need to read the book to enjoy it, if you do you will fully appreciate the genius in the adaptation of the characters and the beauty of Middle-Earth. Peter Jackson took the biggest risk in movie history and achieves a George Lucas-like reputation in a fantasy trilogy. Rating: 10
9.0~An instant classic. Boba_Fett1138 Sign in Permalink Beautiful environments with lovely costumes combined with superb characters and and an intense story...the result: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Don't let the 3 hour + running time scare you of, like so many long movies it's very well worth seeing. Never has a fantasy world looked so realistic as in Lord of the Rings. All the sets are very detailed and have a realistic feeling as well as the characters and the different races of Middle Earth. The greatest strength of this movie is not the story itself. The story itself is actually pretty simple, basically it's just about the Ring and the quest to destroy it. No, the greatest strength are the characters, the look of Middle Earth and the action sequences. Rarely has an adventure movie looked so good and has been so tense and enjoyable to watch. But let's not over praise it, the movie has it flaws and weak spots. There are some unnecessary and boring scene's (especially in the Extended Edition) but for an 3 hour + movie that's maybe just unavoidable. And no matter how awesome everything looks, the special effects aren't always top-class, I'm a firm believer that the movie would have been better if ILM provided the special effects. But let's not judge the movie for what it could have been but let's judge it for what it is. Also, sometimes the Hobbits (Sam, Pippin and Merry) are border line irritating. Another thing that disturbed me was the editing, in my opinion it was extremely bad done in some of the scene's (For instance in the wizards battle between Gandalf and Saruman) but having some editing experience myself I might pay extra attention to this things... But in this case all those flaws and weak spots are forgiven, for The Fellowship of the Ring truly is a wonderful movie that you simply must have seen at least once in your life. Already a classic! 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
10.0~The best movie of all time, no question ILoveLOTR Sign in Permalink This is absolutely the best movie of all time. With unbelievable directing, score, acting, and great special effects, this movie has the total package. It starts off with great material to work with, by a good book by Tolkien. And Peter Jackson just takes that material and with the help of a great adapted screenplay, creates a terrific adventure movie that is often scary and funny at the same time.
1.0~Jackson Blew It!! thol_sabirs Sign in Permalink First of all, to all the people who claim that this movie was a risk to make - WRONG. This film was always going to make it's money back due to the fans of the book. Even the ones who were appalled by the thought of their so called "masterpiece" being turned into a movie would have still paid to see it. The LOTR fan base ensured that this was never going to be a box office failure. And it's that same fan base who have propelled FOTR to the top of the IMDB. I have friends who are LOTR fans and they gave it 10 out of 10 before they had even seen it! That type of fanatasism means that this film can only really be fairly judged by people who haven't read the books. And as one of those people I have to say that Peter Jackson blew his chance and LOTR is a glorious failure. For a movie to truly be considered "great" or a "classic" it has to trandscend it's genre. It has to appeal to all kinds of audiences. The way Star Wars is loved not just by sci-fi fans but fans of every genre from westerns to romantic movies. The way that The Wizard Of Oz is loved by fans of musicals and fans of fairytales. The Fellowship Of The Ring apeals to one group of people and that is the die-hard fan of the book. To the rest of us it's boring, cliched, idiotic, and pointless. It's pointless because there is nothing in this movie that we haven't seen before. It's been done before and better by everyone from Tim Burton to Steven Spielberg. In fact some of the scenes in this movie remined me so much of Burtons Sleepy Hollow that you expect Jonny Depp to appear any second. Jackson rips off everyone and fails to stamp his own style on this story. It's like watching a selection of your favourite scenes from other movies being copied by an amature. There are two real problems with the movie (three if you count Jacksons direction), the first is the plot. We are told within the first half hour what the story is. A group of characters have to take a magic ring to a special place to be destroyed. On the way they will face much danger. THAT'S IT!! You can leave after that because you already know what happens. There are NO twists, there is NO tension, and the character developement in non-existent. Once you are told the plot you have to sit through 2 and a half hours of dodgy effects and poorly directed action sequences until the end. That's if you stay awake. The second major problem is that we don't really care what happens to the characters. The heros aren't likable and the villains aren't scary. None of the characters have any kind of charisma or appeal and there seems to be no point in some of them being there. There are a few jokes thrown in (which aren't funny and make you cringe) and a little hint of romance between some of the characters. But even that feels like it's been thrown in at the last minute by the studio. A perfect example of how boring the characters are is in the way Jackson gives us a big close-up of the ring every 5 minute. Why? Is it to remind us why the character are there? Is it to stop us falling asleep? It doesn't work and neither does the film. 2 out of 10
10.0~Lord of the DVDs ansymo1 Sign in Permalink I was lucky enough to see LOTR at the theater. LOTR is by far the best movie I've ever seen. I have the Collector's DVD Gift Set, with the Polystone Argonath Bookends. This is a must buy! If you loved LOTR than do yourself a favor and buy it, you won't be sorry! The movie had great acting, graphics, and really great story line. I was really impressed by Elijah Woods, and Viggo Mortensen. Can't wait for "The Two Towers".
1.0~Don't waste your time. agentpez Sign in Permalink I do not understand the greatness of this movie. I thought it was utterly AWFUL. First off, it was 3 hours long. No character development and it was extremely hard to follow the sequence of events. I thought maybe I was missing something because I had never read the books and am not too into the fanatasy/fairy/gnome genre... but my brother read the books as a child and still agreed with me it was a bad flick. Neat sets and special effects though. I guess for folks who know nothing about the movie, don't go and sit through this painfully long movie, rent it and have an official intermission and rewind to scenes that dont make a bit of sense.
10.0~Any vote less than 10 on this film is a mockery! 7rym Sign in Permalink OK, it doesn't matter if Tom Bombadil was cut out of the theater version and probably a lot else too... This movie is an brilliant movie from start to finish! It's a perfect cast (except for the baby-face E. Wood) and the acting is extremely good (even Wood's :-) !!! During the movie you really experience all the different moods and feelings from the story. The computer graphics is blended in naturally just like it should be. I mean, you shouldn't sit and think "Oh what cool CG!" but see the movie as a whole with no hard transitions between "fake" and "real" scenes. Hail Peter Jackson! He has made a brilliant movie from a classic story! Think if George Lucas could do the same with his own stories... ;-)
10.0~the best movie ever sside2075 Sign in Permalink The Fellowship of the Ring is the greatest movie i have ever seen. The story is really enthralling and the characters are enchanting. The movie is exquisitely directed and the cinematography is beautiful. The acting is superb. This movie delivers it all - drama, laughs, action, suspense, terror, fantasy. Hands down the best movie ever. Everyone in the universe should see this movie. bye.
2.0~Did Peter Jackson READ the books?!? mentor397 Sign in Permalink I realize some people will argue that there is no way to accurately translate a book into a movie exactly. There just isn't. Well, they might be right. I suppose I could agree with that. But not with this movie. He got nothing right at all! Arwen - I realize Liv Tyler likes the character. I realize women are a bit under represented in the movies. So she took some other parts. AND MESSED THEM UP TOO! Since when does Glorfindel (or anyone for that matter) get into a fight with the ringwraiths in the first book? You know why? Morgul-knives. Black breath. It sucks when you fight a wraith, yet she came out okay. Gandalf/Saruman - The whole reason they didn't fight in the books was because they weren't supposed to! That made the fight in the Two Towers that much more believable! In addition, if I was a wizard, and I wanted to fight someone, I think that I could scare him a little more by doing something other than spinning him around. If Gandalf had been to more amusement parks this wouldn't have 'hurt' him at all. Goblins - Since when can they climb walls? Are they little spider-men? The Balrog - Picture this. The entire Fellowship surrounded by goblins. They're gonna die. No way out. Right, left, front, back, and on top there are goblins. Then the Balrog comes. And they escape. THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO EVEN BE NEAR THE GOBLINS!! The council of Elrond - Since when did everyone get up and fight? Galadriel - I realize he filmed this but cut it out. The gifts scene was important. Especially for Samwise. Elvish boats look a lot like Craftsman boats. Merry and Pippin - they were good characters. Right up to the point they waved bye to Frodo and Sam and got captured by the orcs ON PURPOSE! The whole point of that encounter was that NO ONE was sure where they went for some time. That's how Merry and Pippin got captured - they ran off looking for Frodo. The Watcher by the Water - since when did Frodo guess the "riddle" of the doors? Anyways, the whole point of this is to show that Jackson needlessly changed events and sequences around to fit his weird idea of how Middle-earth SHOULD work rather than how it already has. I'm sure Tolkien is rolling over in his grave as we speak. I'm not saying it's a bad movie on its own, it simply shouldn't be called LORD OF THE RINGS
10.0~Three hours wasn't enough. Chrissie Sign in Permalink I'm a naturally contrary creature, so I didn't want to go see LOTR simply because everybody else seemed to be seeing it. My daughter persuaded me, telling me she'd buy my ticket and promising me "lots of eye candy." Well, blessings on my daughter's head. LOTR was a breathtaking delight (and not just when Aragorn threw his hood back and my hormones gave me a jolt that drew an "Oh, my!" from my lips). When the end credits started to roll, I whimpered, "What? No more?" I'm just hoping they'll do a theatrical re-release before TTT opens in December. There are friends who missed this in the theater and I'd love to share it with them in all its majestic scope.
10.0~Roll on Two Towers OtakuFreak Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring is so amazing a film that I went to see it three times at the cinema (I have never done that before). It manages to be comical, adventurous, thrilling and moving in one action packed sweep of brilliant script, beautiful cinematography and special effects. The acting is also very good, Elijah Wood simply IS Frodo Baggins and I think Ian Mckellen was robbed of an Oscar. Yes its almost three hours long, but it is so fast paced that you don't feel the time pass. To summarise.whether you are a Fan of Tolkien or not (Why Not?), I highly recommended this film. Roll on Two Towers.
10.0~Wow gemma15 Sign in Permalink I'm not sure that there are words to describe what I thought of this film, but I'll have a go. Everything about it was amazing - the landscapes, the script, the effects (and they don't normally concern me too much), the music (can you wear out a CD?!). But what really got to me was the emotion emanating from this film - whereas most films get into your head, this one got into my heart (corny, I know, but true). The reason for this? The acting. A film may have all of the above listed things, but if the actors aren't right then you'll never accept the film. Every single character was perfectly portrayed, including Arwen and Galadriel (who a lot of people didn't seem to like). In fact, I think extending Arwen's role was a change for the better - at least in FOTR (I'm reserving judgement on her role in the next two installments). I must make special mention of four actors though. Firstly, Elijah Wood. A perfect combination of vulnerability and determination, and those eyes - I could just drown in them! Secondly, Sean Bean. Boromir was always one of my favourite characters, but I truly sympathised with the character in the film. Thirdly, Ian McKellan - he is Gandalf, what more can I say? And finally, Viggo Mortensen. His performance just blew me away. Apart from being gorgeous (!) I loved the way he portrayed Aragorn's fear that he wouldn't be good enough to be King. And boy, can he swing a sword! In summary, go and see this film. I've seen it five times, and I'm not stopping there. Simply the best film of all time.
1.0~Dammit! Demand more from film people! gtmac1 Sign in Permalink I've been a Tolkien fan for many years and a lover of film for more years than that. Here's what I have to say about it. Stop accepting another's interpretation of a literary work and start demanding originality and quality in all media. Things shouldn't have to be wrapped up in a nice neat 'film-book-music-fast food promo-fan mag-toy' package to be enjoyed. Adaptations should be spurned, not praised. Enjoy a good film, enjoy a good book, but don't require or allow them to be homogenized. Stop accepting eye-candy as cinematic genius. Stop identifying special effects as good film on it's own. Demand character and plot development. Demand intelligent dialogue and exposition instead of silly taglines and "here's what's happening" lines. Demand acting above just smiling, crying, and scowling. How about some complex emotions? I'm not saying there is not room for a cheesy movie now and then, but don't champion them as pinnacles of the medium. Remember or imagine what a film could be. Don't pay $9 to go sit in front of the television for 2-3 hours. Demand to be challenged even a little bit. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! For those of us who care! If you keep paying to go see mediocrity, they'll keep making it!
2.0~Oops, Sorry Mr. Tolkien ktrooster-1 Sign in Permalink I'd first like to state that I've been a fan of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy since 1978 when I first read the series. I've since re-read it an estimated 30 times because of the story's essence and the uniqueness and relationship of its characters. Unfortunately, this was lost with the making of this movie. Somehow, the writer(s) and director(s) missed the boat entirely. Where the movie went wrong: 1) Frodo keeps offering/showing the ring to everyone he meets, 2) Merry and Pippin are immature idiots, 3) Arwen saves Frodo?? 4) lame "stair-collapsing" scene that eats time, 5) lame "Wringwraith chasing Arwen on horses" scene also eats time, 6) lame orcs (climbing down from the ceiling??), 7) lame Elrond, Gimli, and elves, to name just a few. Good points of the movie: Digital movie graphics, excellent Balrog (unfortunately scene too short), and Legolas character. I have littel doubt the Tolkien clan would agree that the true nature of the characters and their quest has been poorly portrayed. Granted, the movie can't be exactly like the book, however, the story is what makes "Lord of the Rings" a classic and, again, they completed missed it in this movie. I hope the second and third movies improve, but I wouldn't be surprised if Arwen ends up slaying all the fowl beasts that Frodo encounters. Perhaps I'll live long enough to see the remaking of the movie(s) that show the characters experiencing their quest(s) as J.R.R. Tolkien presented them in his books. P.S. Recommendation for the Director: At the battle of Minas Tirith when the Riders of Rohan enter the scene, show it in slow motion while playing Led Zepplin's "Battle of Evermore." If so, I might have a more positive comment about this effort.
10.0~Lord Of Adventure devilsangel Sign in Permalink Lord of the rings promised adventure beyond our wildest beliefs and in my opinion the film kept to that promise. With state of the art special effects and costume designs that look exceptionally real brings the middle earth epic alive. How can any one not like this film is beyond me. I love everything about it from hobbit to elf, from the ring to the ring raiths, and bad hair cuts to great acting cast. For me my favourite character was Pippin. He was, what i felt to be, the funniest hobbit I will ever see. Frodo was also among my faves along with Legolas. I hope the next two installments of this film is as good as the first. Any way I am glad to give this fantastic adventure fantasy film a 10 out of 10.
1.0~Don't tell me to read the book. I shouldn't have to... tingue Sign in Permalink I feel compelled to offer some dissent for this mistakenly lauded, and often drooled over catastrophe of a film. Let me preface this by saying that I have not read the book. While this may offend those of you who keep a copy under your mattress, you must understand that by releasing this as a motion picture, it must be able to stand on its own as one. My largest complaint is just that, the writers did absolutely nothing to prepare this story for the screen, other than relying on a gifted cinematographer and production designer to carry the weight. I felt every minute of this story as if it were being read from the pages of Tolkien's umpteenth printing by a four-year-old. The dialogue is slow, awkward, and unjustly sentimental. To someone who has not read the book and doesn't have the pretext of the characters and their motivations, the lines are just as mystical as the glowing ring that every one scampers around in fear of. Other than the spooky horsemen that chase around Frodo the cowardly protagonist, I simply could not find any reason for these middle earth misfits to do what they did. And if you don't find the scene where they all get together under "Agent" Hugo Weaving's direction and decide who's the bravest pussy in middle earth absolutely corny and remedial, then you just weren't listening. I'm still not sure what was less convincing: the ridiculous lines or the misdirected attempts to act them. After three hours, and having lost complete sensation in my ass, they have the audacity to end the movie when things are finally starting to happen. At least Star Wars was sufficiently independent in each of its chapters. I didn't have to wait three years and pay $24 to get a coherent story. On a positive note, I have to give credit to the DP and his aesthetic capture of New Zealand. Well done. Seeing your photography was the only aspect that made me feel value for my money. That applies to the inhabitants of New Zealand as well. Thanks for letting us expose your country to the world. I only hope that the leagues of trench coat-wearing D&D players flocking to your ports will spare you from the middle earth references they're dying to make.
9.0~A Glorious Vision of Middle Earth dxia Sign in Permalink The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and "epic" battle sequences, which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book, which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hack-n-slash action movie. I don't find much entertainment in watching people mutilate each other, but I love it when a movie engages me in a world, and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' does just that. Certainly the most breathtaking scenes in the movie are the moments of patient observation, when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. I must give Jackson credit. He did hire some very extraordinary artists that have envisioned one of the grandest interpretations of Tolkien's world. There are about five particular moments that stick out in my mind and gave me that tingle of goosebumps down my spine when I saw them for the first time. The first is the introduction to Hobbiton. After the somewhat awkward prologue, I was beginning to have my doubts to whether the movie would live up to the book. But the movie surprised me. Hobbiton is perfect. The houses have flower patches and old fences, the roads look worn and made through decades of travel, and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. Every color is vibrant and every moment looks as through it was taken out of a picture book. Although I still don't agree with the particular look of the Hobbits, I believe everything else in Hobbiton is worthy of Tolkien's words. The second moment comes after Frodo's awakening in Rivendell, and the third, during the exploration of the Halls of Moria. In both moments, the camera pans away from the characters and outward into a static shot of their surroundings. The moments make us feel like we're turning our heads and gazing at the world around us just as the characters do. The golden waterfalls of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark halls of the dwarfish mines, but each are inspiring in their own ways and add to feeling of being engaged in a living world. My other favorite moments come during the exploration of Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. And while I won't go into detail about the scenes, since they really should be experienced without any prior expectations, they are monuments in imaginative cinema. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is one of those rare movies that I always wish I could reexperience for the first time. Unfortunately, Jackson turned away from exploring Middle Earth in his next two movies, and instead, turned to fighting and warfare. He seems to take a lot of pride in the love story and battle sequences he created in 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King,' but it is was in his first movie when he really got it right. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' it's okay if the characters are uninteresting and have silly dialogue. Middle Earth is the star, and the characters are the ones seeing it for the first time.
10.0~Perhaps the greatest story ever told becomes one of the greatest films ever made. russiangators Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring may in fact be one of the greatest feats in modern film. Not only is this film remarkable for its story telling and amazing (Oscar winning) special effects, but the acting and directing take the reader into middle earth to become part of an epic journey for 9 unlikely heros. If you have not seen this movie, go see it; if you do not own it, go buy it. This film may never be topped, that is until the next chapter, The Two Towers, proves us all wrong. Sorry Ron Howard, but this was the best picture of 2001.
10.0~Wonderful! LittleDrummerGirl Sign in Permalink In my humble opinion, this is an example of a classic novel brought to life and actually makes a wonderful movie!!!!!!!!!!! The cast portrayed the characters very well. Viggo Mortenson brought Aragorn to life, Sean Bean brought Boromir's character to life, and the very good-looking Orlando Bloom made Legolas real. The flavor (if not the details) of the book was captured for me. BTW, is there any fan club for Orlando Bloom online??? Please let me know!
10.0~A brilliant epic - Peter Jackson brings Middle-Earth to life. general-melchett Sign in Permalink I have watched this film 80 times (no lie) - I have enjoyed it every time. Peter Jackson has brought Middle-Earth to the screen brilliantly and with glory - New Zealand's beautiful scenery and huge mountains recapture Tolkien's world in a way that would make him proud. On top of that, every actor owns his/her role 100% (especially Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalf) and delivers very powerful, meaningful performances that ensure that every character has their own story to tell (and their own movie to act). Though some of the battle scenes aren't great - there is obvious ragdoll usage in the troll fight scene - this film is a stunning start to the most successful trilogy of the millennium and a chance to experience Tolkien's world on screen for yourself as it always should have been - flawless. A must-see. 10/10
3.0~Average at best, not worthy of a spot in top 250 films thora Sign in Permalink Are special effects all that is required by movie audiences? Is a quality story unimportant? Is character development unimportant? Is spectacular imagery all it takes to impress? Apparently so. This movie bears little resemblance to the works of Tolkien that I read 20 years ago at age 15 and, truth be told, I doubted that these novels could be effectively depicted on screen. Fellowship was too long by a third, (long movies I can handle; two hour plus films consisting of nothing but childish, repetitive chase scenes I refuse to tolerate) marred by a brilliant director whose past works were nothing short of genius but who has obviously sold out to the almighty dollar. The characters barely made an impression. Tolkien's rich characters should produce more excitement than a funeral dirge. A movie featuring these characters should be enthralling, enchanting. It was none of that. I actually fell asleep during the showing--an afternoon matineé. Does that tell You something? It tells me something, that Fellowship of the Ring is not worthy of such ridiculously high acclaim. I want to know how many critics were paid off. I don't blame the actors, who are all top notch. I blame the director, the screenwriter, and the unwise decision to make into a movie a complex novel which had zero chance of being successfully adapted without sacrificing characterization.
10.0~NO MORE WAITING. IT´S HERE!!! mario-rad Sign in Permalink Let´s face it. This is something that a lot of us waited our whole life to finally see on a big screen. Jackson carried a real heavy burden of bringing Tolkien´s magnificent world to life. And, by God, he did. I mean, there are a few minor mistakes here, like: Liv Tyler should not, by all means, be with Frodo and the Nazguls in the river scene. She completely ruined the importance and the symbolism of gathering that took place there (it is what the whole movie is about: inner conflict of dualised forces). Sometimes it seems that Ralph Bakshi with his animated The Lord of the Rings understood better the abstract, mythological and philosophical aspects of the book. But, at the end, it doesn´t matter, ´cause Jackson blinded us more than effectively, with his brave and powerful vision. We can even forgive him Aragorn-Arwen romance plot. What else to say than: congratulations mr. Jackson! You brought us the most beautiful and the strongest imagination ever to be seen. By far, the best fantasy (and much more) in the history of moving pictures. You just can´t beat this one.

9.0~A good movie nhjoy7232 Sign in Permalink A very nice movie. Actually I liked the movie very much. Its a unique creation of director and writer.Sometimes its magical sometime its action. It also show us massages. It has three series all of them are amazing. And Its other parts Hobbit also a good movie. I will advise all to watch this movie once. Many of us may not like the beginning. Be patient. wait and watch full movie. Watch all the series then only you can understand the whole story. Its dialogs and script both are great. Graphics is also a nice. Story is strong and unique. Actor have performed their best. Some time you will find funny and sometime you will find sorrow. But I am sure you will enjoy this movie.
10.0~'Fellowship' is an excellent beginning to an excellent trilogy arussell23 Sign in Permalink In the 1990s, a director had a vision. A vision to adapt one of the most celebrated fantasy series of all time, and turn it into a film. Originally it was to be one film, then two, and finally was settled at three. Slowly, the film became reality, with real-life sets being built and still standing, a filming that took over a year, and the trilogy going on to make billions of dollars at the box office. This film trilogy is entitled The Lord of the Rings. Now that I have reviewed it's prequel, The Hobbit, it is now time to review the next series (in chronological order). Let us begin with... ...The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The Fellowship of the Ring follows a hobbit named Frodo Baggins as he comes into the possession of the One Ring, which has the power to control all of Middle-Earth. With the help of a dwarf, an elf, a wizard, a prince and several of his hobbit friends, Frodo is ready to embark on a journey that will take him to the home of Sauron at Mount Doom, where everybody's fates are tied. This is a tough film to review, mainly because some of the visual effects do begin to look dated, especially fourteen years later and with the advances in technology we have made since then. However, I suppose I'll do my best. The best thing about the film, perhaps, is the music. Howard Shore creates a musical score that is both haunting and memorable. Listening to the soundtrack, I tend to hum most of the tunes throughout the day (especially the theme song of the Fellowship). That's not to say everything else isn't good either. The plot works well, and manages to end on a note where we feel satisfied with the ending, but we're also wondering what will happen next. It's very well done and written, considering the book's original ending. The actors and actresses in the film do a phenomenal job. I think there's too many for me to rattle off names, but my personal favorites are Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond. Not to say that everybody else did a bad job, but these are the people I enjoyed the most. The cinematography in the film is beautiful. Whenever there's sweeping landscape shots, the film manages to make it look as amazing as it possibly can. I sadly have not seen the film in HD Blu-Ray, but even on the DVDs I've watched the film on, it still looks, quite frankly, amazing. In the darker scenes (basically the Mines of Moria), the cinematography makes it feel unsettling and cold, as does the music. That is when you know you've crafted something great. The special effects, though slightly dated now (especially in the opening prologue), are still a marvel to look at. Back in 2001, I can't imagine how I might have felt back then, if I sat in the theater, looking at all of these things that seemed impossible to create, at first. I mean, who really thought that a 3-part movie filmed all at once and released over three years was going to be great? I'm sure lots of people were surprised by the film. The film has a lot of character development, which is great, especially for the characters who leave at the end of the film. I won't spoil who, but someone dies in the final battle of the film, and it made their death that much more heartbreaking when it occurred. Frodo gets a lot of development, as his struggles with the Ring begin to show, and a conversation between him and Gandalf in the Mines of Moria is probably my favorite scene in the film. Overall, Fellowship fits the shoes it was required to fill, and manages to create a smart fantasy that hits all the right notes: great music, cinematography, characters, acting and special effects. I'm sure that after this, everybody was excited for The Two Towers. And so am I.
10.0~A great beginning! wingfoot2388 Sign in Permalink How could you not love this movie? It was a great beginning to one of the best stories ever told on screen (and in writing!). Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's "trilogy", the 3 films that make up "Lord of the Rings" are incredible. However, the other two films would be NOTHING if it hadn't been for Peter Jackson's work in "The Fellowship". If it hadn't attracted as many people as it did, the other movies wouldn't have been hits! The film follows the story of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit who has to embark on a dangerous quest to destroy the Ring of Power, which was forged by the evil Sauron. The ring is powerful, and if it falls into the wrong hands, doom will come. Frodo must destroy it in Mount Doom (a volcanic mountain), where it was made. It's a journey he cannot make alone, so he has the help of Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf (the wizard), Merry and Pippin (two hobbits that offer comic-relief), Aragorn (who plays a larger role in "The Return of the King", as does Sam), Boromir of Gondor, Legolas (who makes all the girls in the audience go "whoo") and Gimli (the humorously rough dwarf). The movie is full of action, and certain points where interesting dialogue is made (especially between Gandalf and Frodo, in the ruins of Moria). I recommend that you watch this film, because not only has won Academy Awards, but the whole project itself is something that no one has ever done before.
10.0~So good, I had to see it several times DarkCrimson Sign in Permalink When I first saw this movie, I was completely amazed at how good they made this film. I am what you call a "Hobbit Maniac" I read and saw The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I absolutely loved them all, especially the non-animated movies just now coming out. I am deeply looking forward to The Two Towers this Christmas and The Return of the King in 2003. Can't wait. If you haven't already seen The Fellowship of the Ring, then what the heck are you waiting for? Go see it! You will not be displeased, I promise. I also recommend seeing The Two Towers when it hits the "Big Screen". ARAF/Crimson Guard
10.0~Landmark filmmaking: the beginning of a new era. majesty Sign in Permalink This is a seminal work, a landmark film, transcendant of genre, medium, and the technology. It is a pure product of love. Peter Jackson and his cast and crew have lifted the evlotionary bar of humanity to utterly new heights. This film and it's subsequent mates embody what is worth saving in the spec
10.0~loved the whole d*mn thing! dragonfly83 Sign in Permalink Now, living in rural Georgia, most people around here, when asked if they had seen this movie, they'd say, "Lord of the what?" and tell you to go away. But being the rebel that I am, I'm not like most of those people. And not having the luxuries of those "big cities" we read about in People magazine, there's not much to do around here. So I watch a lot of movies (and I mean a LOT), and if I haven't seen it 10 times, I've at least seen in 3 times. So, when I saw the preview for this movie, I knew I had to see it. I'm a sucker for special effects, cool movie make up, and bloody fight scenes. But I also like movies that stretch one's imagination. I'm also the type of person who'll watch the movie instead of reading the book, so I thought I'd get a glimpse of what everybody was fussin' about. I won't go into detail of why I liked the movie, but I will tell you I liked it! I loved everything about this movie and I wouldn't change a thing. It's hard trying to turn a book into a movie and Peter Jackson did a hell of a job. Great cast who played great characters, with great special effects, great music, etc. Most people have already said what I wanted to say, but I definitely recommend it for those who haven't seen it already. And I'm not a reader of J.R.R. Tolkien books, but after seeing this movie, I wanna read everything this man has ever written. So, I was little overwhelmed when I searched his name on bn.com, (or was it amazon...who cares?) and there were over 250 titles under his name. I'll continue to find the best copies I can for his books, but I have definitely become a fan of this movie. And I'm pretty sure I'll be a fan of the ones to follow.
1.0~A pooch of the highest (lowest?) order. wtheld Sign in Permalink Personally I found this movie to be a major disappointment. Having read the book(s) several times since the mid-sixties, I have a thorough knowledge of the plot and a profound fondness for the texture of the story. I resisted unreasonable expectations going in, and was prepared for what I thought would be, at worst, a visual treat and some interpretative entertainment. What I saw, however, was dour, over-pensive characters with little or no inherent charm, Pippin and Merry tossed in merely for bumbling comic relief, unconnected and confusing plot development (had I not been so familiar with the story I would have been completely unaware of what was going on in the story), and alterations to the storyline that were insipid and done merely to provide larger roles for the actors (the Arwen/Liv Tyler synthetic heroics pop immediately to mind). As if the baffling plot development isn't bad enough, the role of Saruman in the story is greatly misrepresented, texture building subplot roles such as Bombadill and Butterbur were simply removed, and what were the Sacksville Bagginses (so critical to the book plot in the end) doing in this movie if they only got one (rather bewildering) reference. I could go on for hours about missing characterizations but suffice to say the difference between book and movie in this arena is horrific, and in point of fact, fatal. Certainly the 'graphics' were nice, but so what. Amazing graphic hacking and hewing of monsters in a mountainous setting is a dime a dozen these days. Big deal. And, Hugo Weaving as Elrond was ridiculous. All due respects to Mr. Weaving, but all I could hear Elrond saying in any of his scenes was 'Well, Mr. Anderson, one of these lives has a future and the other does not.' Respects to his powerful portrayal as agent Smith. The charm and depth of Tolkien's story is completely missing in this film. Frodo, for example, whines and whimpers through every scene, acting continually pained, as if he had a thorn in his foot the entire time. He has no real inner character or strength, except in a few unfounded grandiose speeches during which he seemingly pulls some nerve out of thin air and proclaims himself equal to whatever task is currently at hand, after first whimpering in the background for a good deal of time with sad puppy-dog eyes and furrowed brow. I would guess that the direction of this film was based on the assumption that members of the audience had read the book(s) and were familiar with the story line (how else could anyone follow the jerky plot presentation). If that is indeed the case, why were there so many drastic deviations from the original story line? Did screenwriter Frances Walsh or director Peter Jackson actually believes themselves better at telling this tale than Tolkien? The difference in medium is simply not a good enough explanation for me, and I rank this convoluted, expensive quagmire of one-dimensional characters and uninspired storytelling right up there with other titanic screen dogs, like Armageddon and Independence Day. Painfully, there are 2 more Lord of the Rings episodes to come.
9.0~Film is worth the book it is based on indraya Sign in Permalink That's not the best film I've seen. (The best is 'Stalker' by A. Tarkovsky). I'd give FOTR 9 or 8, if Tolkien meant nothing to me. But being amazed by his books can't suffice to rate this film 10. There are more reasons. I've always believed the books could only be made into slow, subtle films with accent on acting, not effects, preferentially by Russians. So I was afraid to see some sort of 'Xena', knowing that FOTR was an effect-packed action film. But the only wish after the first viewing was to have a ten-minute break and to watch the 2nd part ... and then the 3rd one (cliff-hanger ending fulfilled its purpose). Amazing cinematography, music, quite natural-looking special effects, good acting, and that's not all. There's extraordinary attention to accurate detail everywhere, from costumes to Elvish. That makes possible multiple viewing with new discoveries. Treatment of the story is really good. Alterations help to visualize some points. Excluding something shows knowledge of the limits of action film (or we might have had Jar Jar Tom). Expanding the role of Arwen isn't just an attempt to attract more audience with a love story or to please women (I'd be pleased only by a film not worse than 'The Matrix', where a woman would be the main hero). Arwen's storyline is very important in respect to the symmetry of symbolical layer of the plot, although not as explicatively told as Frodo's. A battle 3000 years ago and episode in Mt Doom aren't just a pretext to show special effects - they are crucial to the plot. The structure of books itself is based on mythology. A novel should have an unpredictable ending. The end of a myth might be clear from the beginning. LOTR tricks reader into thinking it's a novel, although it is more like a myth from that point of view. (SPOILER?) Simple algorithm applied to those old events would show one the culmination of the story (END). Hence FOTR is really worth the book it is based on. However, the book is subtler, more poetic, conveys more ideas. It's nice lines in the film are taken from the book or written in the same style. By the way, the language in the books is amazing. It was the first thing I fell in love with after reading them. Never thought English could be so interesting, rich, expressive, and able to convey so subtle shades of emotion! But sure there was an advertising mistake. FOTR should be marked as 'Part 1' demonstrably, because not everybody knows that's not all. The 2nd part might be even better, and the 3rd one should rock the world!
10.0~Accolades sharon31673 Sign in Permalink The printed word seems to be dying. I know very few people besides me, who like to read books. But I believe it is movies like this that keep the printed word alive. After this movie came out, everywhere I looked I saw someone reading the novel it's based on. I think Fellowship of the Ring was done with excellence. It's true that it doesn't hold complete loyalty to the novel. That cannot be done anyway. A movie maker cannot replace the imagination of the individual. This movie does, however, remain completely true to the essence of the story Tolkien wrote so masterfully. It ensnares, both book and movie, the idiosyncrasies of today's society - corruption, loyalty and love, true friendship, greed and powerlust. I think this movie was wonderful - the battles were exciting; the grief displayed after they exit the mines of Moria were truly heartwrenching. There could not have been better casting choices than those that were chosen. The special effects were fabulous - I've been waiting for this movie for 20 years, for technology to advance far enough to make it real. Judging by the first movie, I'm sure that what Tolkien's books were trying to say will be captured, and be understandable, by the release of the last one (The Return of the King).
4.0~Overlong epic salomeuk Sign in Permalink I can see why people love this movie. Perhaps I'd feel the same if it came in under 2 hours. As it is, it was far too long. I had trouble staying awake, and one of my party left halfway through as she was so uncomfortable sitting so long in the cinema. That's something I've never know happen before or since! I can't really comment on the movie itself too much, as I'm not sure I've actually seen it all....sat through it, yes. But much of it didn't register after the first half hour. It's well filmed, well cast, great story, awesome effects...but that doesn't count for much when you can't stay with it long enough to see the end, IMHO.
10.0~Special Edition DVD blankwave Sign in Permalink I absolutely LOVED FOTR in the theatrical release, but seeing the Special Extended DVD version is like seeing an entirely new movie at points. Do not miss out on this version. Much deeper plot/character development, many new and extended chapters. Only downside... Tom Bombadillo!!!!!!!!!
10.0~One film to rule them all (except Star Wars) palpatine89 Sign in Permalink I'm currently reading the third instalment to Tolkien's epic trilogy, which is quite good. The film adaptation was definetly not what I expected, but what I expected wouldn't have been as good. It's knocked alot because people think it's boring. Sorry, but you guys must have the attention spands of a wall-nut. I'll admit it's long if you've gotta p*** and you don't wanna miss anything. The film starts the epic trilogy of the war of the ring in which Frodo Bagins (Eligha Wood) must journy to Mt. Doom to destroy the Ring of power before the evil Sauron gets it. He inlists eight others to help him: The wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), the wanderer Aragorn or Strider (Viggo Mortesen), Frodo's best friend Samwise Gamegee (Sean Astin), two other friends Meridoc Brandybuck (Billy Boyd) and Pippen Took (Dmenc Mohnangy), the elf Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davis). THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING has the second best ensamble cast ever (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the best), and an excelent performance by Wood. The directing is great and so are the costumes, visual f/x, ect. This is the second best film ever (second to STAR WARS: EPISODE IV A NEW HOPE). The only problems I had was that there was always a certain darkness in this that wasn't in the books, and there was so much left out. I can't wait for the four-hour long director's cut (I know it's pathetic, you don't have to tell me). I give THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING 9.9/10 THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is PG-13 for lots of medievil violence (most of the gore is that of orcs and monsters) and some very scary moments
10.0~10/10 for people who haven't read the books, 9,5/10 for people who have read them! Eelco_1977 Sign in Permalink Well, this was the movie I was waiting for this year and, it's fantastic. I do have to say that if you've read the books (I read them twice) like I did, you will discover a couple of minor flaws in the movie: 1) The journey from The Shire to Rivendel went on too fast. They got to Bree too quickly, I missed Tom Bombadill and "his" forrest, not even a short explanation was given to the three cave trolls that were turned to stone in one short scene in the film, Arwen's introduction and rescue of Frodo. The movie would have been like three hours and fifteen minutes if they would have included these things, maybe the DvD will solve this problem. 2) Some special effect shots weren't very well done. A couple of times you could see clearly that some members of the fellowship were computeranimated. The highpoint was when the fellowship got out of the mines of Moria, it seemed as if the members of the fellowship were walking above the rocky ground. 3) The "hostile" relationship between Gimli and Legolas wasn't really explained. Gimli just said some hatefull things about elves and at the end of the movie he suddenly is befriended with Legolas. I hope the second movie will show some answers to this. 4) The Lothorien scene was a little too short. 5) I know the books tell about great wars and there are a couple of heavy battles between the fellowship and the crazy Orcs. But, I had the feeling that some of the fights were a bit over the top and that they were a bit more important than the actual story. All in all, these minor points can't make me dislike the movie. It was excellent. The three hours were over before I knew it. I can't wait for the next installment!
10.0~Jackson out Lucas'd Lucas flydecoder Sign in Permalink Masterful movie making. Who'd have thought... Stick to the original novel. Hire Actor's not movie stars. Make all your movies at once so your actor's become greedy, gain or lose weight, or... die??? Make a movie the length it needs to be to tell the story, instead of the length it needs to be to sell more tickets and popcorn. Look at the Grosses, and that is at one prime time showing per night. Think about the great books you've read and how disappointed you were when you saw the movie, because the movie didn't follow the book (Star egos) and they cut too much out because they didn't make the movie the length it was meant to be... Jackson, you are a master.
10.0~Superb christiansmovies Sign in Permalink All the way to the top of my list! Probably the best movie ever made. Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is everything Harry Potter was not. Yes this is not a children's movie, all the better for someone like me though. This movie is Star Wars of my generation. I will buy this on DVD and hang a poster so everyone can see it who comes to visit me. This movie simply has it all. Magic, excitement and yes, lots of suspense. There is not one negative thing I can speak of. Absolutely no flaws. I will see it again and again! So should you, if you haven't already. I will try to purchase a print of this one down the line, if I can find one that is!
10.0~Wonderful masterpiece Antonio_G Sign in Permalink The only film I´ve ever seen that actually gets better the second time. Saw it on the opening night and was in awe of the grandeour of it all. My first thoughts were: This could possibly be the most magnificent film ever made, do I dare to think so? Went to se it again the second night and my thoughts were: Thats it! This is the most powerful, best piece of film ever created. It actually grew the second time. And I´ve heard others say the same.
1.0~*yawn* reeh Sign in Permalink This movie was seriously overhyped. A year after its theatrical release, I was finally forced to watch this travesty. I think the only reason it managed to muster such acclaim is from fans of the book being so giddy and filled with glee, that seeing their favorite characters from the book come to life on the big screen just made them cream themselves. From the costume design to the cinematography, LOTR screams made-for-television; it was like sitting through a 3 hour episode of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. Much like Star Wars, another secretly mediocre "trilogy", Lord Of The Rings is just another example of how all Hollywood cares about is that big pay-off. And with the right marketing, anyone and everyone will fall for it. I didn't. If it's possible you haven't seen this film, by all means, continue to avoid it. You're better off watching Xena.
10.0~Greatest `Fantasy' Book become greatest `Fantasy' film Yrneh Sign in Permalink I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'" as he himself put it. After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: "Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?". In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with. In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema. The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three). I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals. It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating. It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story. He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed. Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman), and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo. I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode. Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't. It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold. In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging. Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading? All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character. And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc. He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character. Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood. Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary. He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar. And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too. Enough. See this film! Greatest film ever made? How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written. Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it. One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film. 10/10
10.0~Journey begins senturyNICK Sign in Permalink This film is unique amongst the Lord of the rings trilogy in introducing the characters opposed to the battle scenes. My favorite of the trilogy. Excellent film. You will enjoy the adventure if you have not viewed yet. I have yet to see the Hobbit trilogy. I did start the first film and never made it passed the first 45 minutes and have now chosen to wait for the extended final film to release this November. From mu experience I would enjoy it improving on the LotR trilogy but I have a bad feeling from what I've seen. I doubt Peter Jackson will revisit the series now and I probably shouldn't hope for the Similiarion to get adapted. We will see I guess. It's end of 2015, if anything can or does happen it won't be until 2019 at the earliest. With a new director on board too.
10.0~A film that will come to be appreciated in time ripper721 Sign in Permalink This movie is terrific as is, easily the best film of last year. Unfortunately, once something becomes popular(Harry Potter, Titanic,etc), it seems to bring out all the idiots who love to put down everything popular. Peter Jackson's vision of Middle Earth is amazing and I'm sure it will become even more fleshed out with the release of the extended version of the film. One of my only gripes with the film was that Lothlorien was totally butchered and Galadriel comes off as more of a wicked witch than a kinder Queen of the Elves. Fortunately that will be fixed with the extended version also. The problems that some people have with the movie are warranted except that this is essentially just 1/3 of a movie. Star Wars suffered from the same problem initially-no character depth, a boring beginning, then non-stop fighting late in the movie. Then the characters and story became more fleshed out with the release of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. In time, I'm predicting The Lord of the Rings trilogy will stand side-by-side with the Original Star Wars trilogy. 9.5/10
10.0~Imagery-great, special effects-great, the film itself-awesome perhapsitwasutah Sign in Permalink (mild spoilers) I don't know why everybody complains about this film being a number 3 on the top 250. I mean, its not as though the top 250 films only include straight-out dramas. Why shouldn't the best Action/Adventure/Fantasy film be in the top 5? Because that's exactly what it is. It is probably the best Action/Adventure film I've seen...probably because it holds so much emotion. It has everything: Humor- action- adventure- beautiful visuals and visual effects- It evokes emotions like Fear, excitement, joy, sadness-it has all kinds of themes of betrayal, loyalty, corruption, brotherhood, SACRIFICE. The acting ensemble of the fellowship is exceptional! All players turn in stellar performances. All in all, its the best the Action/Adventure/scifi/fantasy genre has to offer. It out-does all competitors, even the "coveted" Star Wars, in my opinion.
10.0~You'll either like it or love it currykidd Sign in Permalink I've never read Tolkien's books, but I did see The Hobbit cartoon movie. When The Fellowship of the Ring came out, I figured I'd see it since everyone was talking about how "impossible" it was. When I saw it in the theaters I hated it. I thought it was too long and the parts between the action scenes were too boring. But when my brother got it on DVD he made me watch it again and I slowly fell in love with it more and more each time I saw it. People who have read and enjoyed the books will definitely enjoy the movie. It was a great achievement for Peter Jackson. Everything was so real. The scenery, costumes, and acting were very well. For those who are not into the books, you will most likely love this movie. But if you don't like adventure movies, it may not be for you. I still would recommend everyone see this movie at least 2 times before saying whether you love/hate it.
10.0~Amazing movie that followed the book hobbit_potter1865 Sign in Permalink POSSIBLE SPOILERS I couldn't believe this movie when i saw it. Not only did it follow the book extremely well, but it also had great casting. Elijah Wood as Frodo was the perfect choice...Elijah, if you are reading this i think you are incredibly hot!!! Although they did cut out Glorfindel, one of the best Elfves in the book in my opinion, and changed how Frodo and Sam meets up with Pippin and Merry and skipped the Old Forest and Tom Bombadill, and they also changed Arewen's part, it still followed the book and there were places where i could almost imagine J.R.R Tolkien reading aloud. All in all a great movie and i eagerly await Lotr: TTT and LOTR: ROTK, Movies one and 2 respectfully for you non-Tolkienists
10.0~Quite simply the best movie I've ever seen! bill_garrett Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's interpretation of the classic "The Fellowship of the Rings" is, quite simply, the best movie I have ever seen. It hits the high water mark in every respect: Lifelike characters act out the full range of human emotions in an engrossing epic storyline set against a sweeping and beautifully filmed landscape. With the storyline and characters coming from a true classic, it should be little surprise they are as good as they are. But let's give credit where credit is due. Unlike too many modern directors who treat classic sources as mere "rough drafts" that need extensive reworking to have any appeal, Jackson thankfully stays true to Tolkien's material. He and his cast show their skill in being able to transfer a full length novel to a 3 hour movie without giving up any of the flavor or power of the original. I've watched it twice and both times I've been completely absorbed, my emotions soaring and diving with the characters and the plot. I know it seems cheap and easy to dub a movie the best of all time (attention-hungry film critics seem to do it every other week) but, believe me, it's not a statement I make lightly. There is only a short list of other films I would consider 10 stars out of 10 -- mostly films which defined a genre, like "Casablanca", "The Godfather", "E.T.", "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark", and (more recently) "Pulp Fiction" and "The Matrix". But "Fellowship of the Rings" is the one movie of these I would gladly give 11 stars.
10.0~Great Film Kellyann-1 Sign in Permalink This is a great film. Everything about it is wonderful. I like what Peter Jackson has done. I like the differences between the book and the movie. They are both equally great and I would not change a thing about either. I like that Peter Jackson didn't do the movie exactly like the book. I like the direction he took for all the characters: Arwen, Frodo, Aragorn,etc. The movie is very enjoyable. Wood,Astin, Mckellan, Mortasen,Tyler,Bloom and Lee are all perfectly cast in this epic tale.
9.0~One of my favorites. johnlehmann Sign in Permalink Absolutely incredible film, front to back. Characters very true to the book, sprawling cinematic landscapes, a story that hooks you in. I love all three films - this starts the trilogy off on the right note!
10.0~Review of "The Lord of the Rings" lbrinton Sign in Permalink Written by J. R. R. Tolkien and directed by Peter Jackson, The Lord of the Rings is a trilogy that carries its audience to a different time and place, starting in the Shire. A young hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is given a tremendous gift by his uncle, Bilbo Baggins, only to find out that it is a dark weapon forged by the darkest of souls, the Dark Lord Sauron, who, when creating this dreadful ring, "he poured all his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life." Given guidance by an elderly and wise friend, Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo seeks to rid himself of his enormous burden by returning the ring to the "fiery depths from which it came," and thence beginning the Fellowship. Frodo sets off with his closest of friends, Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) and joins with two more along the way, Merry and Pippin. They begin the journey at a running pace, barely escaping the evils that are sent to dissuade their progress, and retrieve the ring. Encountering many dangerous foes, such as the Nazgul, Gollum, and the greatest evil of all, Sauron, Frodo must overcome the dark temptations of the ring before he is apt to destroy it. Nearly losing their lives, the hobbits must rely on new friendships and allies in order to aid Frodo in his journey to destroy the "one ring to rule them all." After overcoming many horrendous obstacles, including death, Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom, where the ring was forged, and after a final battle are able to return it to where it belongs; out of the reach of all men.
10.0~Just see this movie soupie_01 Sign in Permalink Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said. This movie is just simply, sublime. The sets are lavish and beautiful, the special effects are magical, the acting is great. It just screams class. How it was overlooked at the oscars for some of the awards, I don't know. Just get out and see this movie now, so that you can look forward to the next installment in December.
10.0~Amazing! a_f_a Sign in Permalink I honeslty didn't expect to like this movie so much. I knew it was a fantasy movie involving magic, but little else (I hadn't read the books until after). But I was amazed. It was an excellent movie, definitely the best of the year and, for my money, one of the best of all-time. Absolutely brilliant!
10.0~A great modern classic ADOZER200 Sign in Permalink This move definitely is a classic of today. The directing was pure excellence and the special effects are outstanding. I havent seen a movie made this well since the late eighties sometime. I was always thinking that it was about time for them to come out with a fantasy movie. Im not a big fan of the lord of the rings but after seeing this i have to get into it more. The characters were awesome. Whenever every single one of the characters do good then youve got a classic and thats in any movie. They couldnt have chosen a better actor than Elijah Wood to play Frodo. He has the sadness in his eyes and the humble like features that i felt Frodo should have. Ian McKellan did great as Magneto in XMEN but he excelled that part as Gandolf. His true colors came out at the end as showed his true courage against the shadowy fire beast. Sean Astin of course did a good job as always. John Rhyeis Davies did wonderful as the Dwarf. I didnt even recognize him at first. Strider was a very well liked character, id like to see more of him in the sequels and Orlando Bloom played an unforgettable role as an elf. It proves to all of us the cool and determination(and great skill)elves have in battle. Even when the goblins attacked at close range you could see the concentration in his eyes to destroy the creatures. I just have to say this movie was a 10 all the way because of everyones effort they put into it. This is definitely the new trilogy of the century for all of us to enjoy!!!!!!!!!
10.0~LOTR is a good film, note to ppl who don't think it is M_R_BLONDE Sign in Permalink Okay, first off, I'd just like to state that Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is in my opinion my favorite movie and one of the best movies ever made. Now what are you pessimistic reviewers gonna do about it? Why you ask? Well, do you want a list? There are plenty of great things about this movie: the acting, story, etc. but most of all the heart and work put in it. I hate it when a reviewer just goes all out on this movie telling how bad it is like "It sucks! Don't watch it it sucks!" or " I don't get it, you shouldn't too!" I mean, c'mon, could you guys do any better? How dare you just criticize people who put their best efforts into making a great film of art. Yeah, it's very easy for you, you didn't have to make it, you can just simply state "it sucked." You have to realize that it's not easy just putting one of the greatest pieces of literature on screen. A book that basically EVERYBODY knows about. I think they pulled it off beautifully. Even if you can state whatever you think is wrong about it I just laugh back and think "Like you could have done better." Please. My rating would go off the chart here.
10.0~I will bring this experience with me for the rest of my life. Koola Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Today is my birthday. Honestly, it is. It has been a beautiful week. Actually, it has been more than beautiful. The first snow has slowly covered our trees, the cool winterair has boldly taken over the days and nights in Norway. Beautiful. Well, actually, it has been more than beautiful. But what is `more than beautiful'? Today it was the point where a touch of evil was added to the beautiful. And with the evil and the beautiful comes. well, you know where I am getting at. A thrilling adventure, ancientic tale-greatness, monstrous experiences and totally - with no doubts whatsoever - the one film to rule them all. And in MY MIND, bind me. to this film, this book, forever. From heart of someone who has not read the book, nor have any interest in Tolkien, but loves cinema more than anything in the world. this is one of my, if not THE, all-time cinematic moments. Norway is a small country. And for the small country - only one press screening of FOTR. A small bit about me. I love film, and work as a filmjournalist here in Oslo. Therefore I attended this press-screening. My relation to LOTR is quite simple. Have not read the book, but have been covering the developments of the films. And by that, I have grown a huge interest for the project. Enough now. I HAD AN URGE TO REVIEW THIS MOVIE. Because it is beyond anything I could expect, want, crave, imagine, desire, feel, anticipate. This is unimaginable. And when you see it. I found myself crying of nothing but admiration 2 minutes into the prologue (shiveringly spoken by Blanchett). It shows this dark lord, Sauron, and tells a the fascinating story of The One Ring. Now, excuse me for not being OBSESSIVELY AWARE of everything about this movie (or these books) before seeing or writing this. The prologue is nothing but a amazing sequence. Instead of going into each and every picture (frame) of this film (because I could, and there would be a lot to gaze at and analyse in every single one of them), I will say this: THERE IS SO MUCH. I was completely paralysed. I love every detail I could observe, from the complex battlescenes to the single face of mister Frodo Baggins bedazzling every single audience member. It was a fantastic experience. This review, as I can see, will turn into a not-cronologic piece, but forgive me - my thoughts are a bit hard to recollect. My mind is occupied with images that have burned hard to my iris, performances that I already love and quote. I walked out of the theater 7 hours ago. I have not read the books, as you can see. Now I have seen the first film, and a big bouldering voice tells me that I might have had this very experience many years earlier, by way of the book. But people, and I feel this is important to say, I've just read the book. I think. A 3 hour movie - it felt like reading a book. Because the film felt so massive, it has layers upon layers - in character, in dialogue, in scenery (oh, my lord, the set pieces. I have fallen in love with Lothlorien, the Shire. Can I go to these places for vacation? Will I ever have enough money to go to New Zealand? This is so bloody fantastic in this film. It is so fantastic! I run out of words (especially in my English :-). We must go on! There has been a few hours as I said to dwell on this movie now, buit it's coming to me. It's coming to me as a grandiose wave of river-water lifted by the spellbinding of Arwen (Liv Tyler looks so stylish, such a timeless beauty. Eventhough (some stupid, boneheaded) people are going to scream ARMAGEDDON when they see her the first time, they will be silent when this elf is riding away from the black riders - bravely coming the halfling to rescue.) to eliminate ringwraiths(?). IT IS SO VERY, VERY GOOD. (Oh, I love this film. I have to see it again. I need my mother to see this film, I need to pick up a total stranger on the street, offer her a ticket just to see her face when she's leaving the theatre. I may have given her a lifetime of. well, an experience for a lifetime. Do you hear that Peter Jackson? You may very well, with this masterpiece (I have been dying to call it that), been responsible for thousands of people suffering through this year.) I NEED TO SEE TWO TOWERS NOW!!!! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO!!?? READ THE BOOK? I have to know whats happens. That thing happening to Gandalf. I can't believe it. He must return. Tell me he returns. Ian McKellen is superior. He is great. He acts like if. well, I couldn't see him act. There is Gandalf in him. For sure. Well, anyway, I am off track. FOTR is very big. A big tale. But very small. I mean, big it is, but small is he - Frodo. Oh my gracious lord of modern cinema, the very man who gave Mr. And Mrs. The liberty to create the god given actor named Elijah. Nothing crazy about these sentences, but it is a holy great performance. He is feeling. He is a feeling. My back was cold throughout the entire movie. Feeling Frodo, being Frodo, hurting Frodo, bearing with Frodo. A class-act, truly enchanting, spectacular, it-is-no-good-words-to-compliment-enough Frodo. I am, as you just read, trying to verbalize my experience of Frodo Baggins. But this turns away from reviewing. You want to read about the content of the film. What I saw. Because most of you probably know the whole story, and all the characters. Well, let's go to what there is to see. I saw the Shrine. It is a very richly realistic built, sunny, green place. I loved it. But no surprises. The home of Bilbo, cornfields. and then the city of Bir? Bie? Forgot the name. All the way, amazing scenery. The fact that there is a big difference in height among the characters, but not among the actors, well that is, how do I put it, flawless. Don't know how they could pull it off, but I am impressed. As I said before, this is so throughoutly worked on and polished - every picture and frame has something more than what you see, and every character blows my mind. What can I say? I'm never this singlemindledly positive about a film, but this may very well be THAT ONE where everything seems to strike my mind and in, again, the cinematic darkness bind me. Every generation has a movie. Every saga has a. hehe, enough filmrelated quotings. Don't have to say much about this, but so that you know it: Howard Shore's score is in my cd-player, and this music is. next to my heart. Bilbo. Just what did I actually know about this Bilbo. Oh, yes he was that hobbit-guy that picked up the Ring from the creature Gollum. I have read the forewords of LOTR. But oh my god. Complexity lies hidden, it seems, in each and every character. Bilbo freaked my out. Scared me more than Gollum (`my precious' shivers still in my bones). What exactly did that ring do to him? One scene has given me the most disturbance (and if someone does not want to know, please do not read further). When Frodo reaches Lothlorien, and re-meets with Bilbo, there is screen magic. As they talk (and he looks so much older already), he gives Frodo the sword. He tells about it's magic, how it glows blue when orcs are near. Ian Holm is absolutely heartbreaking as Bilbo. Then comes a moment. It hit my spine. He wants to give Frodo the armor (what was it called again?), and Frodo begins to remove his shirt. Then Bilbo sees the ring. Oh s**t, he sees the ring. Ian Holm is magic. "Oh, can I hold it... just for one last time..." "No, Bilbo, stay away". "IT's MINE! MY RING! MY PRECIOUS!" It is at that point. Bilbo freaks out. Make-up is brilliant, and the scare of that moment, that scene... still won't leave my body. Not even my damn mind. And the same thing happens with Galadriel. Don't want to spoil anything but the scene with Galadriel and Frodo by the mirror (she pours water in it, and he sees "what is to come"). THIS IS MAGIC!!!! Aaahhh. Again, and I can't say this enough, I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN. Believe me, it is THAT GOOD. The film hadn't played for long, but I began to realise. what's next for Frodo. He is now the ringebearer. Look at Bilbo. Again it strikes me.. I HAVE TO SEE THE NEXT TO FILMS NOW!!! Because there is no end to this film. Actually I couldn't believe it ended when it did. I needed more. It felt like one hour tops, but I had been nailed to my seat for 3 hours already. Amazing experience. The film have no ending, and there's evil there, that does not sleep . Now you get the picture; I love this film! I love LORD OF THE RINGS. This is just remarkable. My imagination. oh, I have no imagination. I did not, could not, imagine this. Imagine there's no people. Imagine if this film had not been made. I may have lived my life without knowing this story. All of you who read the book and hate them for turning this into a movie. Think of all of us who now have been rescued from living our lives without it. Thank you, everyone behind this film, for making it. Koola from Norway A small PS: The fellowship. It was beautifully casted. Flawless. Gimli - unforgettable John Rhys-Davies. The hobbits - just charming to their hairy feet, and they touched me deep. Aragorn and Boromir - more than anything, believable. They are men, they have no effects or make-up to characterize them. But they are massive. They suffer, and it hurts. Viggo Mortensen is my hero. (And did you all know he is related to Denmark, my neighbourcountry?). Legolas though.. He was my favourite. Feels weird to write the least about the character I loved the most, but it's just. not much to say. Could not stand seeing Legolas leave the screen, he had an remarkable impact on me with his. elvish magic. Oh, and one last thing. This is a chaos. My mind is a chaos. FOTR is so much, much more. I haven't said a thing about Galladriel, and a lot more. But there has to be a limit. If I were you now, I would look forward to every second of this film, so then. it does not matter. I will bring this experience with me for the rest of my life. It is that good.
10.0~It's a film that, I feel, would be very hard or impossible to remake in the future! kaustavsinha10 Sign in Permalink First of all, I really loved the characters... Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Haldir, Legolas, Boromir, Gollum... to name a few! All were well connected! I particularly loved the bond that was depicted between Frodo & Sam; very emotional and touching! Haldir, played by Craig Parker, was a character which looked Godly and drop-dead-gorgeous, as beautiful as it can be! The action scenes were immortal; very real! The character of Gollum was very sweet; the CGI and VFX were top-notch! A character like the Gollum can be a creation of a century for me! I loved the Amon Hen Battle; engaging action scene, in which the death scene of Boromir (Sean Bean) was very sad to witness! Finally, the direction by Sir Peter Jackson was outstanding! I've no complaint to make as a viewer for this film; it will stand tall in front of me forever! The Lord of all films! 10 out of 10!
1.0~melodramatic rubbish sdahri Sign in Permalink I was so disappointed with the screen adaptation of one of the greatest stories ever written. I was eager when I went into the cinema and dejected as I left the film was almost painful to watch with cheesy acting from Sean Bean and Elijah Wood at times. If you want to see a good film about fantasy and a good book adaptation then you'll do well to avoid this tripe.
9.0~Breathtaking BTKrz Sign in Permalink As I am rather young, I had just finished the books a couple of weeks when I went to see the movie, so Tolkien's work was still pretty much alive in my head as I saw the picture and I have to say that PJ has done an outstanding job to the point where you can say the movie is even better than the book.Personally I considered the first book to be the most boring.I didn't quite liked Tom Bombadil, neither the barrow-wights so I thought it was superb that these were left out of the movie.The decision to cast some unknown actors was excellent; Hollywood stars would have caught attention by the name and not by the characters they would have played.Orlando Bloom was spot on and so was Liv Tyler(she can give me a sponge bath any time), even though I am sad to see that Arwen's enhanced role was not appreciated(in the trilogy there is a constant lack of female characters, which is a drawback).What else is there to say?Howard Shore has done a great job, congratulations for him for his Oscar, which was well deserved.The visual effects were stunning, the acting was great(Sir Ian McKellen deserved that Oscar) and so was everything else. Brilliant!
10.0~See it... Buy it... NOW!!! SatyrKitty Sign in Permalink Okay... I haven't read the other comments.. but.... I love this movie... I know I will love the other two, and I hope the same people make The Hobbit into a movie. The acting is wonderful (even the fake accents of the two main characters). Ian as Gandalf is absolutely the best choice, perfect in every way... The direction and all the visuals are marvelous to behold. The score is magnificent and moving, and compliments the picture perfectly. Now, having read the book, I did note notable plot-differences, but they work within the context of the movie-version of the story, so it's still all good ;) Also, there are some plot-points that become important in the Two Towers left out of the Theatrical Release, so I advise everyone to buy or at least watch the newly released Extended Version, in which those points are restored to the film. All in all... just buy it and watch it over and over :)
9.0~First timer and WOW! jebyvyson Sign in Permalink I wanted to checked out TLOTR trilogy to see what's so special about it that made it an Academy-award winning trilogy. The music, the tone, the cinematography, the visuals, the characters, just...WOW. This was kinda breathtaking to me. I seen some fantasies movies before, but this was something new to me. I been avoiding these movies before and now...now I'm glad I got a chance. The first movie is such a surprising for me, I was already hook on to seeing the second movie.
10.0~Fresh and original/ highly recommend the extended version leakretschmar Sign in Permalink I really don't understand some people who read the books and when they watch the movie they say that they were disgusted. You got to understand the fact that Jackson had to miss parts and mixed parts up because in the book it jumps into several different time lines and places. Besides, movies are typically different than the book origins. If anyone of you get the chance, buy the extended version of the trilogy because that will clear up some spots that were choppy and misleading. It is expensive but worth buying. For people that haven't read the book, I highly recommend it. Before I read the Lord of the Rings(LOTR), I wasn't as a big book fan as I am now. You learn lot of morals in LOTR especially around Gandalf. The best part of the Fellowship is when Gandalf defeats death by fighting the Borg fire cave demon. Gandalf really kicks some butt and I love it every time he tells that demon, "You shall not pass" and then breaks the bridge. It gives me the creeps every time I hear that from him and the fact it had some deeper meaning. I really didn't think the movie felt like 3 hours the first time I watched the movies. After the first time, it still doesn't feel like 3 hours even when I watch the extended version. The extended version, hopefully, will make the readers a little more happy. It still have mixed parts but it is better than the theatrical.
7.0~Lord of the Disappointment asda-man Sign in Permalink OK, so I'm 18 years old in a weeks time and am unashamed to admit that I've never read any of Tolkien's books nor even had the desire to. The truth is that I'm not particularly into all that magic Harry Potter stuff and would take the stark intensity of Chirstopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy over the Lord of the Rings any day. But after hearing such hype, especially from my favourite critic who often loves what I love, I thought the time had come to record them when they came on the TV. My plans were ceased from an orange man called Dale Winton, a program that my family would rather record than Lord of the Rings (they wouldn't even give it the time of day!) But fast-forward about 7 months later and there they are again on Channel 4, Christmas day, and so I stick the record on. I didn't really know what to expect, but after hearing all the unbelievable hype I was excited to take a trip to Middle Earth and see what was so amazing about it all! But unfortunately I came out watching a fun, if not occasionally dragging, swords and sorcery epic that did lose me on more than a couple of occasions. I enjoyed it enough to go and watch the other two, but was simply not blown away like everyone else. I enjoyed the opening narration about the origins of the ring and its wearer etc. I thought that it effectively transported the audience into another world which also had some rather breath-taking imagery. I also enjoyed the time at the shire where there was some very likable characters and surprising humour that did not go a miss! It was just once the hooded horsemen were introduced that things began to drag, and unsurprisingly in a three hour film. It began to lose me with its unnecessary complexity such as the encounter with Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee, that scene confused me and some of the dialogue also had me puzzled thanks to their wizardy speak such as, "We must retire to Mount Maduro" etc. I also felt that some characters and plot lines were unnecessary and detracted from the story, such as the elf woman who wasn't in it for long and didn't really have a lot to do, other than send a tidal wave to the hooded horsemen. The plot also went off on a tangent such as when they "enterted the realm of the witch". I didn't feel that there was any need for it and it just slowed down the pace that was beginning to pick up. It also takes quite a long time for the fellowship to actually be created, as it's from there that the adventure really begins and its at least mid-way through, if not over. However, there were a lot of good points about the film. The characters were very strong and I found myself forming attachments to them (not a euphemism). When one of them bit the dust, I did actually care! There are relationships which we can all relate to and it does help to drive the story along and make you care about their quest. There was also some breath-taking cinematography and scenery which really showed off the epic scope of the film. Some of the directing was also very impressive and memorable such as the sweeping shot over Christopher Lee's place. However, in a film with a three hour running time I did expect a little more action than I got! I also didn't think the action was that well handled, with shots being taken too close and too many quick cuts which make it hard to see what's going on. I'd say that there's more thrills and fun to be had in King Kong and that the action sequences in that are better handled. Hopefully we can see Peter Jackson mature as a director as the series goes on like Christopher Nolan did. In the end, it's down to personal preference. I'm not entirely into magic and fantasy, but the characters and underlying simple narrative makes the film relatable and very watchable. I expect more from the following two, as Fellowship did leave me feeling disappointed. I didn't find it as amazingly mind-blowing as everyone else, but maybe that's because I haven't read the book/s. I may enjoy them more if I set my expectations at a lower level, but nevertheless the spectacular imagery and set pieces do make this film memorable.
10.0~The greatest movie adaption of all time? solandriel Sign in Permalink Well, according to AMPAS, no. But then, we all knew that LOTR:TFOTR would lose out at the Oscars when it came to the major awards. The awards it did receive were more than justified; the visual effects were stunning (was I the only one with my jaw dropping? I think not!); the music score, one of my favourites from last year, was full blooded and dark, much like the story itself - Howard Shore did himself proud. Although the film had to remove some story elements despite it's 3 and a half hour duration, if you had not read the LOTR trilogy, you would immediately grasp what the story was about from the opening montage. It set the scene perfectly. For me, the star of the movie was Elijah Wood as Frodo, with Viggo Mortensen running a very close second as Aragorn. The acting all round was top notch, and Ian McKellen was another favourite as Gandalf. He gave the old wizard a twinkle to the eye that offset the intensity of his character well. This film has been called a 'fantasy epic' and it deserves that accolade, and more. For anyone who is not into sword and sorcery, or swashbuckling, I highly recommend this introduction into the world of Tolkein. It may be long, but it sure doesn't feel like it. The movie runs at quite a pace, even during it's quieter moments. This movie is a must-see. I've seen it twice, and hope to catch it again here in England before it disappears entirely. 10/10.
10.0~A wonderfully contagious film(WARNING!SPOILERS!) EljLv Sign in Permalink Cinematic perfection, in my mind, comes with the Lord Of The Rings. The effects are magnificent, and the soundtrack is the final touch. I felt, not as if I was sitting in a Century Theatre, munching on popcorn and drinking a Coke, but as if I was traveling with the hobbits. I was there when Merry and Pippin were gathering carrots, helping them get mushrooms. I was there, comforting Frodo after he was stabbed with the Morgul blade. I was with the Fellowship, traveling in Moria. Of course, my concious mind knew I was sitting, watching a movie, but my subconcious mind was wrapped in this story. A good film for anyone. Action, Adventure, Romance, Comedy, Horror, anything you could think of!(Though maybe not musical. Not yet at least.)
10.0~Great movie even if you are like me and know nothing about wizards, elves or spells. maccaveili Sign in Permalink First of all, let me just say that I know nothing about hobbits, elves, wizards or spells. I never read any of the Lord of the Rings books, nor have I ever got much into games like Dungeons and Dragons. Most of my knowledge about these sorts of things comes from when I went to see Harry Potter a couple of months ago, if that tells you anything about how little I know. While I wasn't very impressed with Harry Potter, ironically with Lord of the Rings I was. If someone like me could be captured by this film, then just about anyone could be. It quickly gets you involved in the plot by summarizing how "the ring" got to where it is in the present time, therefore doing without the long drawn out boring beginning that so many movies have. The acting in it is superb, and there are so many different characters with their own personal trials and tribulations to deal with. I'd venture to say that there is a different character for just about every type of viewer out there to relate to. It is this quality which makes the movie so deep and is what makes it possible to keep your attention for the full 3 hours that it lasts. Three hours never went by so fast in a movie theater, I swear. The only gripe I have with the movie, is that it doesn't provide any closure when it is over. As we all know, it is just the first installment of a series of 3 movies. Therefore of course the end of the movie isn't really the end of the whole story. However, in other trilogies, such as Star Wars (now more than a trilogy), each movie had it's own struggles which led up to a big catharsis in the end to provide the movie with some closure until the next one. However in Lord of the Rings, it just ends as if still in the middle of something. It feels like you're just going to a commercial break when it ends. So naturally now, you have to go see the second movie if for no other reason, because you left the first still waiting for the climax to take place. All in all though, I gave this movie a 10. It's original and well done. Perhaps if movies in general weren't so lame in the past decade, this movie wouldn't be rated a 10, but rather an 8 or a 9. However considering what I am used to seeing, it's a 10.
10.0~Hauntingly Beautiful zeno-14 Sign in Permalink It is beyond me to describe the astonishing and wondrous vision of Peter Jackson's hauntingly beautiful adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's novel in a mere paragraph, yet I will try all the same. What has been achieved here is probably the prime example of a marriage between true art and box office, a film that creates it's world not only through the usage of cinema's most advanced technologies, but through the nature of the story told and the creation of unforgettable characters where many other directors would have relied only on the former. If you have not seen the films, I suggest you watch the three extended editions back to back (if you have the time) and get lost in this world completely for 13 hours. I have said all I meant to say, so there is only one more thing: Thank you New Line Cinema, for taking the risk of your lives in making these movies possible. Thank you Peter Jackson, for sharing your vision with us. And darn you, for making me feel regret at the thought of probably never being able to see anything like this again in the future!
10.0~The best I have ever seen!!!! Queen Greenleaf Sign in Permalink The movie was wonderfuly cast and the plot as well as the action is well worth the time to watch it. Not to mention all the cute guys as well as the lovely women. This movie is not only the best movie I have seen and will ever see but is amazing. How they pull-off the fact that all the men who play the hobbits are not that size and make it appear so. This movie is the best and hopelessly awaiting the other two has been hard.
10.0~The best movie ever made and there's going to be more of it! Streetwolf Sign in Permalink When this hit the cinemas a bunch of my friends went to see it, but I didn't go and the reviews I got from them made me think it was either a bad movie or an average movie. So I finally decided to see it, I rented the extended dvd version and now I own it! Summary: I'll keep it short. In a distant time several rings were made and given to elves, dwarfs and mortal kings, but another powerful ring was made in the land of Mordor by the evil Sauron so he could rule Middle-Earth and control all other rings, but by accident his hand was cut off by Isildur, king of Gondor, who took ownership of the ring, not knowing that the ring had a mind of its own and it ended up betraying him. The ring, lost and forgotten was found first by... a thingie called Gollum, who the ring betrayed after keeping him alive for 500 years, and then it was found by Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, a small person. There it remained in his pocket for some 60 years, but Bilbo didn't age a day, until one day he wanted to leave. In that moment his old friend Gandalf came to see him. Gandalf realised that there was something about the ring, since Bilbo had made himself disappear in front of a crowd. Bilbo left the ring, but Gandalf could not touch it, so it ended up in the hands of Bilbo's cousin Frodo. Gandalf discovered that there would be people who would come after Frodo and take the ring, so he sent Frodo and his friend Samwise on a journey to make sure the ring did not fall into the wrong hands. But the ring has started to long for the hand of its master... On their journey their are aided by Strider, a mysterious ranger, who they don't know if they can trust. When two of Frodo's friends Merry and Pippin join in on the quest and with black horsemen riding after Frodo, they put their lives in Strider's hands hoping he can help them, unaware who Strider really is. When they reach Elrond he isn't able to help them, but comes with the solution of taking the ring to where it can be destroyed. Someone has to go to Mordor to destroy the ring, and when Frodo volunteers, in total 8 others join him and become the fellowship of the ring. At first I thought the movie was far too long and it had too many things that we really didn't need to know, but after seeing it so many times, I keep questioning why they couldn't make it just a little more longer? My favourite character is Strider/Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, he is perfectly casted for the charming mysterious stranger no one can seem to quite place in the whole movie until the middle. In fact I like the entire cast, they were brilliant!! My rating for this movie is 10/10 and I don't believe another movie can top this one.
10.0~True movie magic. Plain and simple. FalloutX Sign in Permalink I'm a big fan of movies. I'll watch the good ones, the bad ones, and the other ones, just so I can give my thoughts on them intelligently and without bias. In 2001, I got to experience Peter Jackson's film interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I was then, and still am, in awe. This first part of a trilogy proved to give me a filmgoing experience I never, ever thought was possible. Even as a fan of Star Wars - an excellent movie trilogy in it's own right - nothing I have ever seen was quite like this film. Peter Jackson took an incredible book and, given a few neccessary liberties, transformed Tolkien's works into perhaps the single most brilliant book-to-film translation I have ever been privilaged to witness. The acting, as provided by such talents as Elijah Wood, Ian McKellum, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortenson, and others also made this a true classic. Years from now, people will remember Lord of the Rings for the truely fantastic movie it has proved to be. This classic tale has been given life the way any Tolkien fan could be happy with. Unlimited credit goes to Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew that made this film and the other two, which I'm sure will be fantastic, possible. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie on DVD or video, however you can. Make this part of your library, today.
10.0~Could not have hoped for more. jlfitz-2 Sign in Permalink Agreed with almost every single visualization. Every compromise with the text was made to make a better movie. Arwen's expanded role grows on you. Just plain wonderful.
10.0~Best Fantasy Movie EVER strider24 Sign in Permalink It should not be too surprising that a movie based on a book highly regarded as one of the greatest fiction stories ever is a huge success. The only question was how close to J.R.R. Tolkien's amazing Lord of the Rings a movie could get and what would be the changes? After years of waiting and anticipation, Peter Jackson and company have given the film industry a new standard by which all fantasy movies should be judged. This being the first part of the Trilogy, FotR followed the book very well. There were things that were left out, however, there was no way to include all of the book's characters and scenes. Nearly every acting job in the movie is stellar. The music has to be one of the greatest scores ever written for a movie. The special effects are among the best ever seen on the big screen. Some of the shots (all in New Zealand) are breathtaking. A must see for all fantasy lovers, and those who enjoyed Tolkien's books. The best three hours I've ever spent in the theater.
10.0~And to think I nearly saw A BEAUTIFUL MIND instead Bon_Jovi_chick Sign in Permalink I didnt see it until Easter. It was a choice between ET, A BEAUTIFUL MIND or LORD OF THE RINGS. Me and my mum decided "what the heck lets see LOTR" and afterwards I was like WOW!!! The effects were so cool, the story was easier to follow than the book was and Christopher Lee was soooooooo cool! Id give it 10/10 and bring LOTR 2!!!!
10.0~An awesome film - and a superb adaptation of the book. duane.galle Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's mammoth task of recreating JRR Tolkein's classic epic "Lord of the Rings" has been done masterfully. I have read the books over 50 times, and I have always found in the past that movies rarely satisfy my imagination when based on books that I have read. This is different. The characters, locations, scenery and music is all portrayed just as I had pictured them in my mind (with the exception of Boromir - I always thought of him as more Viking-like). On top of this the special effects are spectacular, but they serve only to enhance, rather than overpower, the story. There were sections of the story that were glossed over or removed, but thankfully little was changed. By my recollection, there were only two scenes that were dramatically different to the book - Frodo escaping the Ring Wraiths over the river, and Frodo farewelling Aragon. However, the reason behind these changes was clear, and really I can't see any other way to keep the movie as short as possible. Although LOTR is a long movie (almost 3 hours), it is never boring and keeps the viewer enthralled. As well, the narrative at the beginning of the movie does an excellent job of bringing any non-readers of the book up to speed. In case you hadn't guessed - I loved the movie, and I can't wait until the next 2 are released. One word of warning - this is no kid's movie - it is not Harry Potter or Star Wars, and parents that expect their pre-teens to be able to watch this without nightmares should expect to be proven wrong.
10.0~Stunning achievement newton7 Sign in Permalink When I first learned that a live-action movie version of Tolkien's trilogy was to be made, my heart sank, fearing a typical distorted, glitzy Hollywood treatment. Imagine my surprise when I saw the film and found that Peter Jackson and his team had been scrupulously faithful to Tolkien's original (saving the alterations always necessary for translating a novel to the screen). The casting was just perfect and the special effects leave one lost for words. The Shire was exactly as Tolkien described, Rivendell and Lothlorien wonderfully atmospheric and Moria was more spine-chilling and thrilling than I could ever imagine (what a fabulous Balrog!). This film has got to be one of the most stunning achievements in the entire history of the cinema.
10.0~See This Movie!!! LilacQueen Sign in Permalink This movie follows the book fairly closely as far as plot and story line. When it deviates it does so to explain things the book makes obvious as you read. Whether you like the Fantasy Genre or Tolkein this is a movie not to be missed. The photography, costumes, scenery, effect and props PUT YOU in Middle-Earth. The camera allows you to tag along on an incredible journey as several races fight for the Freedom of All. Adversity brings out the best and worst in its usual way in the most varied people. Not everybody is what they seem. See this movie for its beauty. Treasure it for a lifetime. This is a movie destined to become a classic! And will be watched for generations to come. In my humble opinion it far surpasses Star Wars and should a defining movie for this decade/century/millenium.
10.0~One of the Best Films ever. Ryan N Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite movies, it is loaded with action, an in-depth plot, and great adaption from the J.R.R. Tolkien novel. I had never read the book before the movie and since I saw it, it has intrigued to read the whole series as fast as I could. Me, being a child expected this to not be as good as Harry Potter, it turned out to be better. It starts out with the infamous (at least to the Hobbits) Gandalf (Ian McKellan) coming to Hobbiton. They're holding a banquet in honor of Bilbo's (Ian Holm) 111 birthday and Frodo's (Elijah Wood) 33 birthday. It's just like in the book except that you meet Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) early. The plot starts off early, and the characters' characters are unfurled. Gandalf shows his determination and intelligence and Bilbo shows us even the most pure hearts can be corrupt by the ring. Anyways, the ring is past to Frodo, everybody's fine for 17 more years before Gandalf tells Frodo that he must leave with the ring immediately. So Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin) embark on a quest to Bree to reunite with Gandalf and make plans for destroying the ring. They meet Merry and Pippin along the way and encounter the Ringwraiths for the first time. After great struggle, the four Hobbits arrive at the Prancing Pony in Bree. There they meet Strider (Viggo Mortensen), they then go on a quest to reach Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and his protection. The ringwraiths find the Hobbits and end up stabbing Frodo, but Strider comes in and in a heroic swordfight saves Frodo, they eventually reach the home of Lord Elrond with the help of Arwen Everstar (Liv Tyler), whom Strider has a relationship with. At Elrond's they meet with Gandalf, and have a council meeting where you meet the impatient, but loyal dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), the keen wood elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and the unethic, but brave Borimir (Sean Bean), and you reunite with all previous met characters, including Bilbo. It is decided that Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Strider, Gandalf, Borimir, Gimli, and Legolas (a.k.a. "The Fellowship") will go on a quest to destroy the ring. They brave trolls, and fiercesome warriors, and even Saruman's (Christopher Lee) treason to do their non-desireable quest. This movie has well done performance by all the cast (especially Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Sean Bean, and Christopher Lee), and combines the great heroism and bravery by all the characters to make this one of the best movies seen
10.0~Peter Jackson Conjures Up the Most Potent Motion Picture Magic in Years! sandnair87 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a spectacle with the emotional charge of a thunderbolt on a canvas brushed with master strokes. With authority and disarming creative propensity, director Peter Jackson creates mystic illusions borne from J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novel. The result is a marvelous journey, where gentle hobbits, powerful wizards and humans meld with trolls, misshapen orcs, black-cloaked ring-wraiths and Uruk-Hai. In the first chapter The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the magical land of Middle-earth is the fictional setting, but it's no backdrop; it's a living, breathing universe, in which mild-mannered hobbit Frodo Baggins (a brilliant Elijah Wood) is forced to turn hero when he inherits the ring of absolute power - the one that grants long life, invisibility and carries with it the inevitable seduction of evil. Assisted by powerful wizard Gandalf (a perfectly cast Ian McKellen) and a motley fellowship of warriors, he must journey across Middle Earth to return the talisman to its source. Frodo's entourage includes the brooding but valiant ranger Aragorn (a mesmerizing Viggo Mortensen), the scheming but brave Boromir (Sean Bean) and the dashing elfin archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Also along for the adventure are three of Frodo's mischief-making hobbit chums from the Shire. Frodo sets out with this coterie on an epic quest to carry the ring into the core of the vanquished dark lord Sauron's lair, who has been hot on the hunt, to destroy it in the searing fires of Mount Doom. Their journey is fraught with adventure, as the fellowship does extensive battle with all sorts of rogues along the way. Orchestrating all the evil-doing is the fallen wizard Saruman (a marvelously malevolent Christopher Lee), who has gone over to the dark side and battles wits with the cagey old Gandalf. All along the way, there's plenty of soul-searching as Frodo questions his fate and his comrades must fight off the sinister allure of the magical gold ring. And it's in this aspect that Jackson elevates the film beyond mere adventure escapism. He treats the story's metaphorical properties with due gravity, but without falling into turgid sermonizing. He strikes a nice balance of deeper meaning and sheer entertainment. Weighty with Middle-earth lore and eye-dazzling vistas of the storybook Shire, the Elvish town of Rivendell and ravaged land of Mordor; alive with the personalities of jaunty hobbits, toiling gnomes, enchanting elves and dashing warriors, the film is a fine wonder of technical achievement and masterly acting in service of a rich, rousing and meaningful story. The computer-generated images transform the New Zealand locations into views that will take your breath away and only someone with a pathological aversion to fantasy could fail to be absorbed and transported by this stunning, sincere and frequently terrifying adaptation. Cinematically inspiring, the costume, production design, prosthetic body parts and make up are extraordinary in their detail, complete in every way. Peter Jackson does not only attempt the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he pulls it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, conjuring the most potent major-motion-picture magic in years.
10.0~incredible acheivement... drag0nhart Sign in Permalink I consider this film to be one of the best ever. Peter Jackson has made an incredible effort to bring the story to the big screen, and accomplished the near-impossible by doing it extremely well! I'm looking forward to the "Extended" DVD version to be released in November, which will bring us 30 more minutes of character development and the Gift-Giving scenes, one of the few points that I felt were missing in the theatrical cut. ::smiles:: It will be another long year to wait, at the end of The Two Towers, I am sure, but well worth it. Light n Laughter, Hart
10.0~Magnificent thomasgulch Sign in Permalink To be brief, this is the best movie I have seen in the last 50 years. Absolutely nothing on film, (with the exception of Citizen Kane), even comes close to this masterpiece. There are scenes of such incredible, awesome beauty, that at times I was almost emotionally overwrought. It is VERY rare that you realize while you are watching a movie that you are seeing a cultural classic that will be with us for generations. If you have not seen this movie, leave the keyboard, get in your car and go see it.
10.0~One ring to rule them all... LegolasTheArcher Sign in Permalink Fool of a Took- n. Anybody who considers Lord of the Rings to be a disappointing, or "bad" movie. Reasons to go see LOTR: 1. Unlike movies where you've only been waiting for the doomed character to just die already, such as Titanic, or Autumn in New York, you'll find yourself with tears in your eyes as Boromir gallantly keeps fighting until the third arrow finally strikes him. You'll share the tear that Aragorn shamelessly allows to fall down his face. Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen perform with real emotion, just like the rest of the characters in the duration of the entire film. 2. Terror that will leave your adrenalin pumping more than in any horror movie you've ever seen. The chilling ring wraiths conjure up fear in every deadly whisper, ominous footstep, and terrifying shriek. My face still tingles everytime I watch the ring wraiths' chases and fight sequences, even though I already know the outcome. 3. Breathtaking visual effects and graphics that would've made Tolkien proud. Rivendell is a flawless, perfect paradise of flowing waterfalls and awe inspiring mountain views. The battle of the orcs and the meeting of the Balrog will fool your senses, making everything seem real as the person sitting beside you in the theater. 4. Brilliantly adapted screenplay, based on the masterpiece of J.R.R. Tolkien, who outclasses and definitely is a far better writer than J.K. Rowling anyday. Diehard Tolkien fans will definitely be pleased with the movie, as well as others who haven't been associated with Middle Earth. 5. Talented acting from every character. Gandalf's performance is definitely Oscar worthy, as Sir Ian McKellen disappears as he performs on the big screen and comes out as Gandalf the Grey. (Gandalf can kick Dumbledore's ass anyday) Viggo Mortensen gives a powerful interpretation of Aragorn or Stryder, a sword fighting true Lord of Gondor. Sean Bean plays a true hero to cheer for. Elijah Woods as Frodo (the better alternative to Harry Potter), Ian Holms as Bilbo, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Sean Astin as Samwise, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Billy Boyd as Saruman, and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, all deserve standing ovations for their heartfelt, noteworthy performances. Orlando Bloom especially, does a terrific portrayal of my favorite character, Legolas Greenleaf, and is a talented actor that will make his impact on Hollywood. 6. Edge-of-the-seat plot and action, the three hours seems far too short as movie takes you straight into Tolkien's world. This movie will never get boring, no matter how many times you watch it. 7. Howard Shore's score delivers fullness, richness, sorrow, and excitement on top of an already outstanding movie. You'll be buying the soundtrack before you know it. 8. The feeling it leaves you when you walk out of the theater, is undescribable. I left the theater the first time I saw LOTR with the best feeling I've ever experienced from only a movie. Ultimate satisfaction, anxious anticipation for the next installment in the trilogy (The Two Towers), and a warm, soaring feeling are things I experienced from LOTR, and obviously feelings the other people in the theater felt, as they clapped at the end of the movie. I pity those who decide not to watch LOTR, for you are missing out on the greatest movie, in my opinion, I have seen in a long time. (And trust me, the workers at the Cinemark movie theater practically know me by name now.) Those of you who disliked the movie, and didn't appreciate the awesome action scences, intense emotion, thrilling terror, shocking visual effects, fantastic directing, wonderful score, magnificent cinematography, and actors at their best, cannot recognize a true GREAT cinematic achievement when it's right in front of their faces. GO SEE LORD OF THE RINGS! One ring to rule them all, One ring to bind them, One ring to bring them all And in the darkness bind them...
10.0~Even a little Tolkien goes a long way Dbioneer Sign in Permalink As a die-hard aficionado of the trilogy, I subconsciously geared myself for some disappointments on my way to see this film. Some reviewers evidently feel they're breaking new critical ground in saying that the film was compromised, here, there and everywhere, finally excusing and extolling the film on the ground that what's left is so good, the flaws don't really matter much. Well, I can't help but agree, and even at nearly three hours, Jackson and his crew couldn't help but nip and tuck, and so the fact that much was missing, in terms of plot, character development, etc., is not especially mystifying. No, what I wondered--while I stood in line and bought a ticket for three shows hence--was not, "Gee, did they cut something out?" but, "Hmmm. Almost three hours. I wonder how they managed, with so little time." And they managed just fine, offering concessions and reconciliations equally satisfying, for those who have read the works as well as those who haven't. I do agree that more attention should have been paid to narrative regarding the Council of Elrond--here the plot point reaches a real pitch that was much missed in the film. I don't agree, however, that modern audiences are too cynical to swallow Bombadil. (That's like saying that imagination always needs a reality check.) And I did enjoy the expanded role of Arwen--it fit like a glove, and Tyler's performance, in my opinion, was superb (I had heard rumors that there were some misgivings when she was cast). But in the long run, the source work is so good that there's a heck of lot of choose from. Not only was serious thought given to the adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece, the team's keen eye was clearly focused on the sensibilities (and intelligence) of the audience. Thus this is among the best three hours in film thus far.
9.0~A good start to the revolutionary event of the early 2000s Spike-Washington Sign in Permalink A year before this came out I was reading the Lord of the Rings books one summer. It felt a little vague but I was interested by all the fantasy themes and the origins of most contemporary fantasy sagas, especially those under the Dungeons and Dragons brand. Elves, dwarves, hobbits, trolls, spirits, wizards, warriors, and rogues are all in here. I'd hoped there would be more good fantasy films after the 1980s' Willow and this was what we got. As the first film it really sets up the story for an epic series. Lots of good visuals and breathtaking vistas from New Zealand, whose landscapes are untouched by modern technology. Plus, there's a cast of likable stars. John Rhys-Davies, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, and Ian Holm all contributed to this major event. The dwarves and the hobbits were just as good as the others and brought some comic relief to the story. If you're in the mood for a trilogy that could rival even Star Wars, this should be it!
10.0~Great, and something about the top 250 baseballfanjm Sign in Permalink I'd like to say something about the top 250. People always mistake it as a best films of all time list. Honestly, if asked which is the greater film, the Lord of the Rings or Gone With the Wind, I'd say Gone with the Wind, hands down. But I like to watch Lord of the Rings more. That's part of the reason it rates so high while GWTW isn't even in the top 100. This list is really the top 250 most popular films right now than the top 250 films ever. Anyway, this movie is fantastic. While it isn't perfect, there are no major flaws either. Everything is top notch and it's 13 Oscar nods were well deserved (I haven't seen A Beautiful Mind, In the Bedroom, or Gosford Park so I can't say whether it should have won though). It totally captures the essence of the books and their epic scale. I thought it would be tough to make the Fellowship of the Ring into a good movie, it's the least, how do I say it, fun, of the trio, and Peter Jackson has totally succeeded. I can't wait for the next two.
10.0~An excellent adaptation of the book. ChelseaWS Sign in Permalink What can I say? This movie has to be the best I've seen so far. It had everything a good movie should have - action, adventure, romance, a well-defined plot, excellent actors. Even though there was a lot of editing in the first part of the movie, it didn't hurt the quality and flow of the movie. I liked Arwen's character, too. In the book, she hardly has any character development at all, but in the movie she plays a much more defined role, though not a major one. I can hardly wait for The Two Towers and The Return Of The King.
1.0~over rated nothingness alim-haider Sign in Permalink what a film .... if i said this film was over rated and over hyped would it matter. well it is and it does not matter. this film is so about nothing. the efects are not even that good. whats the point of this film??? its so boring to watch. get a life people this is no ground braking film.
10.0~too cool for words jbbarrett Sign in Permalink I do not remember the last time i saw a movie this good. I am thinking maybe braveheart, only this is way better than braveheart. Superbly acted, awesome visual effects. The way cinematography is used to make elijah wood appear small and make gandalf the towering sorcerer is beyond cool. Superbly written, three hours long and not one wasted shot, not one wasted word, not one wasted movement. This movie will sadly not win the oscar's it deserves. They will more than likely go to the middle of the road "A Beautiful Mind" simply because LOTR is too good and too popular. If they have any brains, they will give this movie all thirteen oscars it has been nominated for.
1.0~Overrated perfectisolation Sign in Permalink The movie isnt that good folks. It isn't. The STORY (over the three volumes as purists want to say, it is all one story just published as three volumes]) is good, and the movie looks fantastic and looks what one imagines in the mind as the reader reads, but it doesnt make a good movie. The movie stinks. Just like Episode 1 stinks. But "everybody" loved it when it came out except 1000 people in the world. I was one. Believe me, in a few years, you wont think this is such a great movie. only if one watches all 3 LOTR movies does one think it s good. by themselves, they stink.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings - An epic tale you will remember! graham36-872-435014 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a fantasy adventure based on the first volume of J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece The Lord of the Rings. Following the book, the film picks up the adventure with the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holmes) celebrating his birthday in the peaceful town of Hobbiton. Bilbo bequeaths his prized magical ring to his nephew Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, while he himself leaves his home for one last adventure. Adventure finds Frodo, however, when the wizard Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellan) discovers that Frodo's new ring is really "the one ring of power" (Jackson, 2001) sought by the Dark Lord Sauron. Frodo must set out to destroy the ring by returning it to the fires of Mt. Doom where it was forged. He is guided by Gandalf, and aided by his gardener Sam (Sean Astin) and protected by a Fellowship that includes, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Pippin (Billy Boyd), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), Gimli (John Rhys-Davis), and Boromir (Sean Bean). Christopher Lee plays a role as the wizard Saruman while Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, and Huggo Weaving make appearances as Elves. The Lord of the Rings is a classic tale of Good vs. Evil and the struggle to overcome temptation in the face of corrupting power. Frodo must resist the power of the ring if he is going to return it to Mt. Doom, thereby destroying it. Frodo is set upon by beasts and ghouls throughout his journey and must even escape his own companions to achieve his goal. This archetypal theme of good vs. evil is also seen in Star Wars where Luke Skywalker must defeat the evil Empire while resisting the temptation to turn to the Dark Side. Both films show the triumph of unlikely heroes over incredibly powerful enemies. The music in The Lord of the Rings was composed by Howard Shore, and is a thematic element that enhances the overall feeling delivered by the film. There are many journeys within the film, and the music helps to establish the transitions from one journey to the next, such as when the fellowship was leaving Rivendell to begin their trip to Mordor. The music also enhances the dramatic element during scenes that involve the temptation of the ring, or scenes that show the components of evil. Another element that contributes to the theme is the use of lighting. The scenes involving the dark lord and the ringwraiths are dark and gloomy. During the meeting at Rivendell, Gandalf spoke in the tongue of Mordor and the lighting quickly darkened and changed the mood of the scene. However, when Frodo first awoke at Rivendell, everything was very bright and colorful. Through lighting techniques, and sound effects, the director has created a film that helps control the intensity and mood of each scene throughout an epic tale that deals with good vs evil.
1.0~Vastly over-rated mpr3t Sign in Permalink When did the American moviegoing public get hypnotized? Why is an over-hyped visual effects vehicle with a mediocre story (book is better, but also over-rated) and TERRIBLE acting such a blockbuster? Wood is simply awful, always staring at the screen with the meek demeanor of someone about to receive a colonoscopy; his buddy Sean Astin is laughably bad, as are most of the supporting cast. I was insulted by the contrived and predictable pace of this film, and only the visual effects could keep my interest, at least for the first hour or so. Dialogue-journey-battle, lather-rinse-repeat. Yawn.
7.0~Great story development fluturoj Sign in Permalink Real-life link: Surprisingly, I can't think of anything that during the movie made me think 'Hmm would be good to remember this if I get into similar situations'. So no real life links from this one that I can take away. Plausibility: a bit low on this category as well. I find it a bit implausible that a young and inexperienced hobbit would volunteer to go to one of the most frightening places when even the most braves leaders of all middle earth refuse to go. I also find it a bit implausible Froddos friends would volunteer to go with him to these dangerous places given that the movie does not provide any reason for us to believe that their friendship is that strong. Storytelling: this is the strength of the movie. You won't get bored watching this. The story moves fast and progresses so gratefully. One event leads to the other in a great manner. Character development: Characters are also another strength of the movie. They all embark a development joinery. We are given enough background of the main ones so that it makes us curious to see how they will develop and act when they are confronted with difficult decisions and events. Overall, great development of story and an interesting movie.
10.0~The beginning of one of the greatest sagas of contemporary cinema. filipemanuelneto Sign in Permalink Based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien and directed by Peter Jackson, this is the first film in the trilogy "The Lord of the Rings," one of the most striking and most profitable in recent cinema. The film is set in an imaginary world, Middle Earth, where humans coexist with fantastic creatures such as elves, dwarfs, orcs's hobbit's etc. In this film, the balance of this illusory world is at stake because of the war against the evil lord Sauron, who eagerly wants to dominate, corrupt and submit all forms of life. In the midst of these events, two hobbit's living in the Shire, a little-known part of Middle Earth, have the difficult task of hiding the weapon that can decide the course of the war: a ring that gives power to Sauron and he desperately seeks to recover. Everything in this film, a contemporary epic, is perfect: the stunning scenery in New Zealand are breathtaking, the costumes were meticulously designed, the characterization is the top current range in film and computerized animations have been widely used to obtain scenes truly spectacular. The cast, in turn, is luxurious: in this film we have Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd (respectively, in the roles of the four hobbit's Frodo, Sam, Merrin and Pippin), Christopher Lee (as Saruman the magician), Sir Ian McKellen (as the Galdalf wizard the Grey), Cate Blanchett (as Lady Galadriel), Viggo Mortensen (as the walker Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (as the elven archer Legolas) and John Rhys-Davies ( as the dwarf warrior Gimli) and other very talented actors who gave the best of themselves to honor the audience with a movie luxuriously well done. It's not by chance that this movie, as well as the rest of the trilogy, had the impact it had. This is one of the most popular and profitable films of the century, maybe one of the best movies ever, marking the opening of the public to a new generation of epic films. There is only one mandatory film for any movie buff but one of the movies that few people could not see.
7.0~Good being the first movie israel_cb Sign in Permalink I watched first The Hobbit trilogy and for me was really good, i enjoyed a lot that movies, i saw the fellowship of the ring for first time a few hours ago and i really enjoyed the references about the past of Blibo, i think this movie don't has a lot of action and that's why for me is 7/10
10.0~Phenomenal: one of the best movies ever vardhank1 Sign in Permalink I haven't seen "Citizen Kane", IMDb's #1 movie, but I hardly believe it could be better than "Lord of the Rings." This movie was, well.... look in the dictionary: I couldn't find a suitable adjective - it's far too good for that. The first thing that strikes you is Peter Jackson's (the director) aesthetic sense... there isn't a single object in the movie, however small, that doesnt look absolutely perfect, from the stunning New Zealand locations to the weapons the Hobbits carry. Beautifully done. Then there's the cast: well chosen (although I was a bit skeptical of Wood at first), especially McKellen as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, who give great performances and look absolutely right. Liv Tyler seems to have been wasted in her little role, but I think she plays a bigger part in the subsequent movies, so all is well. Sean Bean, too, is impressive, as well as the actor who plays Legolas. Gimli, though.... I'd read the book a while before I saw the movie, and frankly, wasn't terribly impressed by it: it was just too tedious. The movie, however, manages to telescope the story perfectly, and makes it far more interesting, faster paced. The only complaint here may be that it is just a little too fast at times, with too many hideous creatures around every corner to be fully believable. But nevertheless, the movie is gripping, which, I guess is what a film should be. I hope the screenplay will be published - it would make far more interesting reading than the actual Tolkien novel. This movie, overall, is brilliantly made, expertly finished, with an eye for detail VERY few directors have ever shown (check out the statues at the gate to Gondor). Top class. My rating: 10/10
1.0~Boring Beyond belief stephenfusi Sign in Permalink I had been meaning to see this one for a while, but never got round to it, eventually managed to see it on the saturday after episode II opened, (the screens not showing star wars all being eerily quiet) All i can say is how very very boring! I really wanted to like this film, my friends said they enjoyed it, but really, where was it going, it was just the worst three hours spent of my life, it is worse than Episode I and i HATE that film. I found myself totally uninterested in the characters, when the Gandolf died, i was not in the slightest bit bothered, i had no immotional connection to the characters and really did not care for them. The film is overlong in the extreme, and nothing happens! there are a few measly little battle scenes and that is it. I can't help but feel that if this wasn't part of the LOTR franchise it would have sunk without trace, if it had not been LOTR no-one would have put up with this three hour treck. In three words BORING BORING BORING (and i usually like these sort of films)
8.0~A Terrific adaptation of perhaps the greatest fantasy of the twentieth century yousufsmehmood Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings narrates the story of the inevitable battle between good and evil and how 'even the smallest person can change the course of the future'. It is the essential story needed to fuel the fire of hope in the hearts of the people who have given in to despair and death in this age. It is masterfully brought to the screen through the direction and artistry of Peter Jackson. Beautiful and haunting are the imagery and the atmosphere set by Jackson for Middle Earth. The music is also very commendable and mixed with the impeccable direction of each and every scene delivers a masterpiece again and again. The landscape of New Zealand is perfect and might as well be called Middle Earth instead. The Shire, Rivendell, the falls of Rauros, the forest of Lothlorien and the Mines of Moria, how did they all wind up inside New Zealand?! I must say that many scenes had me holding on to the edge of my seat and the scene with the Nazgul was especially evocative. Seeing the hooded figures pierce the darkness, cloaked and shrouded in shadow while the spine chilling music roared on left me in a state of fear and ecstasy. Another scene that was especially poignant was the confrontation between the Balrog and Gandalf. The fiery demon could not have been shown more perfectly than it was here. Its fell sword and whip of many throngs wreathed in shadow and flame were intimidating to say the least. Gandalf's monologue and his selfless sacrifice was heart melting to watch. Yet another instance at which I was very impressed was when Frodo is told by Gandalf that "All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us." It is perhaps the most powerful line the whole book series; although placed differently than it was in the book, it still packs a powerful punch. Finally Boromir's fall at the hands of the Uruk Hai was tearful to watch and the inevitability of his death coupled with his salvation and repentance was wonderful. In the end I would only like to further praise Peter Jackson for bringing together some highly underused actors of this generation and some of the forgotten actors of the last generation as well as for giving new faces a chance. I hardly think any of the entire cast will get to work on a project so massive, so magical or so important in their entire lives and that includes the Indiana Jones franchise that John-Rhys Davies was a part of.
10.0~Well Done Salleyye Sign in Permalink This movie was well done, but it strayed quite a bit from the actual book. Middle Earth was portrayed well in Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I would prefer it, however, if each movie had a seperate book in it (ie. Books 1-6) and they went into greater detail. Overall, however, I would give this movie a 10/10.
10.0~Everything I expected and more Liam Mullan Sign in Permalink Since I had known of the production of 'The Lord Of The Rings' back in around 1998, I had made a promise to myself that I would read the book before seeing the films. In mid-2001, I finally went around to reading 'The Hobbit' and the trilogy that has taken the world by storm for nearly fifty years. I was sent on a rollercoaster of over a thousand pages of wild beasts and mystical places. It truly was an amazing experience, and I doubted that anything the film could do could equal this amazing book. I was delighted to see that it did not leave me disappointed and hollow. Leaving the cinema I felt I had experienced an historic moment in film history, and cinema would not be the same again. This is a film that has amazing special effects without them being all the film has to offer, like in Independence Day or Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. It was faithful to the book without leaving the feeling that the director had little to do with the film itself, like in Chris Columbus' Harry Potter And The Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone', and most importantly it was a blockbuster that lived up to its expectations, unlike Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I would recommend everyone see this film at the cinema, because it must be viewed on a big screen. You don't need to like fantasy, or have back-knowledge on Middle Earth, you just need to enter the cinema without preconceptions of what you will see, like many critics had. I promise you, you will not be disappointed when you see this film, and the sequels just promise more thrills and spills as we see Gollum properly for the first time and many wild battles. 10 out of 10 and the best film of 2001.
10.0~A film that works on so many levels sentience104 Sign in Permalink I hope you like this film, because if you don't, there is not a lot of understanding I can offer you. I amazed that some people didn't like it; but I suppose with any work of art this is to be expected. Let me categorise those that didn't like it as being people that simply didn't 'get it' or get drawn into the mood of the film. Emotional, moving, powerful, and completely respectful of the original works of JRR Tolkien, this film is a masterpiece of adaption. No finer version could realistically be made. And we have two more installments to look forward to. The directing, acting and cinematography are excellent, as are all the production values. This film works on many levels - it is the sort of movie in which something new can be found every time you see it. In every scene there are new things to notice, from detail injected into a particular prop or the exact meaning of character's expression. You don't need to have read the book; but knowledge of the book gives the movie additional longevity. The number of insider references is vast, and even where you don't notice them to subtle feeling of a real, live world with a real history is inescapable. For the people who didn't like the movie (there are what, 10 of you?) I can offer no understanding like I said. It sometimes seems that these people get offended by the presence of a plot, or of a story bigger than a single movie. I can't wave a wand and make you like this movie, but I can tell you this- If you don't like this movie, take a good hard look at your own criteria. Is it yours or Hollywood's? This film makes you realise how good a fresh, well made film can be. Don't waste it.
10.0~Good rolark2048 Sign in Permalink This was an excellent movie. A few scenes left out from the book, but you can't have a movie be too long. It was long, but being this long was needed to let the plot unfold. The movie may ruin the book if you've not already read it, and however good the movie is, the book is still much better. But, a very good movie and worth seeing.
10.0~One Small Step For All Movies CyberCritic929 Sign in Permalink This movie totally blew me away. The acting was fa nominal. To even turn JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings book into a movie was extremely surprising. This movie beats Harry Potter by a total long shot. Chris Columbus should have been bowing to Peter Jackson (while on a golden throne) It had impeccable details, great scenery and acting, just totally brilliant. I'm speechless...buy the movie!Now!
10.0~This is no Lord of the Mings: The Fellowship of the Ming Savage_Arachnid Sign in Permalink Yep, and I stay true to it. This is NO Lord of the Mings. It starts with a magnificent prologue telling the previous history of the ring; brilliant effects, very understandable and a pretty good version of young Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm)! It tells the tale of a young hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) in an other-worldly place called Middle Earth. He inherits the ring from Bilbo and finding that it is, in fact, the One Ring, forged by the dark lord Sauron from Mordor, a place built of pure evil. He decides to leave his home in The Shire and set out on a journey to destroy. Along the way, he finds the help of nine companions (Which so explains the title 'The Fellowship of the Ring'); three other hobbit friends, Pippin Took (Billy Boyd), Merry Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin); a wizard, one of the council and of the Maiar, Gandalf the Grey (Ian Mckellen); Strider (Viggo Mortenson), a ranger and an heir to the throne of Gondor and Boromir (Sean Bean), another man who strives to save his failing race and Gondor; lastly, an elven prince of Mirkwood, Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom), son of King Thranduil and an excellent bowman and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), a stubborn dwarf who loves his people. NOTE: This is, in fact, the first in THREE films, not one. Just be warned, because a lot of people thought that a three-books-in-one-movie film was the case. An excellent, EXCELLENT effects, a brilliant soundtrack and fabulously directed by Peter Jackson, this movie does not go wrong! And the cast; led by young actor Elijah Wood, who has yet again proved his immense acting ability for such a young age, and he suits his character brilliantly. And how can we leave out oscar-nominated Ian McKellen out of the top spot? That is; along with Sean Astin (Wonderful accent and skill), Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan (You might say they were the comic-relief), Viggo Mortenson (Absolutely flawless), Orlando Bloom (Astounding debut as the elf Legolas), Sean Bean (Excellent) and John Rhys-Davies (Pulled off the role of Gimli easily)! Also, lets not forget appearances by horror legend Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler and Ian Holm (who apparently, never had to do a scene more than once)! So, we come to our conclusion; excellent WETA team, cast, effects, music, directing, script... this first installment is destined to be one of the best of our time.
10.0~Amazingly it manages to stay perfectly faithful to the book and still keep you entertained for the full three hours. jan-74 Sign in Permalink Even though Peter Jackson's movie is very much a Tolkien fan's dream, it still has a life of its own as this three hour epic unfolds its universe with amazing details and a superb cast. The story follows the book closely with only a few omissions and a little editing to make the narrative flow. In fact some scenes follow the book so closely that one is left with a strong sense of deja vu. There is much to marvel at as the computer generated images blend perfectly with the action in a way that is far superior to George Lucas' efforts in The Phantom Menace. The only problem is that the movie ends rather inconclusively as does the book. 12 months is a long time to wait.
10.0~A dream movie dictus Sign in Permalink The movie is so big and so great. So many places and characters displayed. It looks like one huge dream, of the kind you'll never feel in your real life. I liked everyone from the cast, and the scenery was awesome. It isn't a mad rush movie, and it isn't a bad representation of Tolkien's book. Some changes just had to be done, and they should seem ok after seeing all three parts. I was shivering during all 3 hours. This is just one of the best pictures ever made.
10.0~A beautifully filmed epic that starts one of the greatest trilogies ever fred-kolb Sign in Permalink --This review includes some minor spoilers-- Many so-called film experts said the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien could never be made into a movie, because of the complex story and all the characters involved. People grew even more skeptic when Peter Jackson, who had only made a bunch of low-budget Horror movies, decided to give it a try. Therefore my expectations were quite low, when I went to the movies, especially since I wasn't a very big fan of the books. OK, they are quite well-written, but at some points they are just boring and too complicated to understand. Now when the movie ended and the credits started to role, I had tears in my eyes. It was one of those moments I was so glad to have been proved wrong. This movie is a masterpiece of fantasy, and back then I didn't know that the sequels would be even better. The dark lord Sauron created a powerful ring, that contained all his evil and with it he managed to conquer all of MiddleEarth. Isildur, king of Gondor, cut it off during a battle and even though he could have destroyed Sauron's evil forever, he decided to keep it and use it against his enemies. The ring betrayed Isildur and led to his death, disappearing in a river, lying there for 2500 years. Then it was found by the creature Gollum, who took it into the mountains, where he was consumed by it, eventually splitting his personality and driving him completely insane. The ring, which can prolong life, left Gollum after 500 years and was then found by the hobbit Bilbo. Hobbits, small creatures who prefer life when its comfortable, usually don't get involved in adventures. Usually. Because at Bilbo's 111th birthday, the wizard Gandalf shows up and after Bilbo demonstrates the rings power at his birthday party realizes that he is in possession of Sauron's ring. Realizing that Sauron already send the Nazgul, dark riders, who can feel the ring's presence after Frodo, he urges him to leave his hometown. Frodo, who is accompanied his friend Sam, and the troublemakers Merry and Pippin, finally makes it to Bruchtal, a city of Elves, where the council decides that the ring has to be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, which requires a long and dangerous journey. There Frodo decides to take to journey and Sam, Merry, Pippin come with him once again. Gandalf, the strider Aragorn, the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, and the man Boromir, also pledge to aid Frodo and they all become the Fellowship of the Ring. That is pretty much the first half of the film, the second half depicting the Fellowship's journey over the mountains, the mines of Moria and the Elven Forrest. The first film in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy brilliantly introduces us to the main characters who are all greatly cast. Especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf (Oscar Nominated), Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn (very emotional), John Rhys-Davies as Gimli (very funny), Sean Bean as Boromir and of course Elijah Wood as Frodo. The film was filmed in New Zealand, and the spectacular Cinematography makes me look forward to the Blu-Ray release of the film. Also the music, by Howard Shore is one of the greatest ever composed for a movie. The Visual Effects are also brilliant, and you will have a hard time telling what is GCI and what not. All in all, there is really nothing negative you can say about this movie. As I stated before you don't have to like the books to become a fan of the movies and if you buy Fellowship of the Rings on DVD, I really recommend the Extended Version. It really adds a lot to the story and the backgrounds of several characters.
10.0~A dream come true and a cinematic masterpiece Earendur Sign in Permalink Pure genius. Haunting. Magical. Anything that I might say about this film will not suffice. It's an achievement of epic proportions and the best tribute to Tolkien one can think of. It is, in everything, a perfect film, if such a thing does exist (and I always thought it did not). An unsurpassable ensemble performance from a group of actors (each one becoming the character to a level of total identification), like an orchestra performing the most complex baroque musical architecture, under the guidance of a maestro which accomplishes the sublime. Peter Jackson realizes the impossible. He brings Middle Earth to the cinema, with a huge respect for Tolkien and each of his creations, doing it while creating a unique, personalized and ingenious cinematic piece. The best praise one can make to the film is that it has a soul. The essential of the book is there. And by the essential I mean that which is not palpable, because, if on one hand the film conveys in an admirable fashion Tolkien's universe and concepts, what truly distinguishes the film is the ability to convey that which is not palpable and immediate, that which one keeps from the reading of the book and cannot be rationally described, because it escapes between the fingers, like sand. What I mean is the grandeur and complexity of Middle Earth (in mythological and physical terms), the heroic feeling, the enchanting beauty and the profound melancholy given the perception that the times are changing and the ancient times coming to an end (this is most beautifully conveyed in Galadriel's opening speech during the prologue: 'the world is changing. I can feel it.'). Peter Jackson creates a beautiful, grand, epic, intimate, emotional and exciting cinematic monument. The special and visual effects are only at the service of the whole, nothing more. Galadriel's temptation for the ring, and Bilbo's last coveting of it are truly cinematic masterpieces on its own. The disorientation and confusion which takes hold of the Fellowship after Gandalf's disappearance in Mória is one the most heartfelt and touching scenes I have ever witnessed in my life. Furthermore, Peter Jackson's sense of evil is astonishing and a gift, only at the grasp of a predestined man. Isengard's decadence and Mordor's shots are, to say the least, haunting and mesmerizing. It is a masterpiece and the best reading and tribute one could possibly make to Tolkien. Because, and this should be clear, it's not the transfer or the conversion of the book to film. It's Peter Jackson's version. His reading. His tribute. And tears flowed down from my eyes while realizing, during the film, that his version, was, in so many ways, mine. 10 out of 10. Carlos Miguel da Silva
10.0~The best fantasy movie ever Sentinel-15 Sign in Permalink You can tell this was made by people who cared, by people who know and love the books by J.R.R. Tolkien. Everything about this movie radiates excellence. The awesome production design & SFX, the star cast, the noble & heroic themes as heard in the soundtrack... Even if you do not care about the books, this is grand cinema. A bigger-than-life story featuring great characters, all this taking place in a beautiful pseudo-medieval earth that never existed... As far as I am concerned, this is the best fantasy movie ever made. Well, until part two is released, that is. :-)
10.0~thirteen years on, still one of the greatest fantasy films ever made Tyson14 Sign in Permalink Sixty years ago, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins came into possession of a magic ring. When he decides to leave his home in the Shire and retire, he finds it curiously difficult to leave the ring behind. Disturbed, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that Bilbo's trinket is actually the One Ring of legend, which the Dark Lord Sauron needs to complete his return to power. Bilbo's cousin Frodo has to take the Ring on a long and arduous journey across Middle-earth to the volcano known as Mount Doom, deep within Sauron's land of Mordor, the only place where it can be destroyed. Back in 1999, when Peter Jackson began filming The Lord of the Rings, there was an expectation of failure. A thousand-page-long book adapted into three three-hour movies by a director whose biggest previous movie had been a minor ghost comedy starring Michael J. Fox? And on a budget of only $90 million apiece at a time when $200 million+ budgets for such epic films were becoming more commonplace? It seemed like a recipe for disaster. Against the odds, Jackson pulled it off. The trilogy as a whole is a remarkable work, translating Tolkien's vision onto the screen with - for the most part - respect and integrity. There are missteps, mistakes and some ill-conceived changes, but these are mostly restricted to the second and third films in the sequence. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, is moved from page to screen with enviable skill. The main key to the film's success is the casting. Elijah Wood may be a lot younger than Frodo in the novel, but he sells Frodo's mix of book- learned wisdom with a lack of practical experience with wide-eyed enthusiasm. Representing the old guard, veteran actors Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Christopher Lee bring their roles of Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman to life with presence and gravitas. The actors are pretty much all excellent, even Cate Blanchett as she struggles with a curiously-written interpretation of Galadriel. Marton Csokas is probably the film's weakest acting link as Celeborn, but given he has about twenty seconds of screen time, this is not a major issue. I must also admit to not being altogether convinced by Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn the King, but as Strider the Ranger in this first film he is superb. In terms of scripting and changes from the books, some key sequences are missing. Tom Bombadil is gone (which is a wise move), as are the barrow- wights (which is more regrettable) and other elements are compressed (the journey from the Shire to Bree, which covers dozens of pages in the book, happens instantly on-screen) or eliminated altogether (Fatty Bolger, the 'Fifth Hobbit', is exorcised from events). Other events that happened in the book off-page or only in flashback occur here in their correct chronological order, such as Saruman's confrontation with Gandalf at Isengard. For the most past these changes are well-judged, even if some fan- favourite moments are left out. For a three-hour movie the pacing is generally excellent, with a good mix of exposition, character-building moments and action set pieces. The movie's effects are impressive, with CGI being held back and used only when absolutely necessary, with miniatures often employed to give physical locations a sense of presence and weight. Whilst clearly resulting from budgetary restrictions, this prevents the film getting buried under fake-looking CGI and means it still has more convincing effects than the recent first Hobbit movie, which feels a little silly. It's difficult to pick a stand-out moment from the film. The Black Riders pursuing the Hobbits is an evocative moment, as is the confrontation on Weathertop and the flooding at the Fords of Bruinen. The outstanding sequence is probably the descent through Moria, which features both excellent character moments (such as Gandalf's conversation with Frodo when they discover that Gollum is pursuing them), humour (Pippin's encounter with a skeleton on a well), action (the battle with the cave troll in the chamber of Mazarbul) and tragic horror (Gandalf's last stand on the bridge of Khazad-dumb). The whole sequence is a joy to watch. The film missteps a little near the end: the trip to Lorien, where the Fellowship regroups after Moria, made sense in the book but in the film it dangerously comes close to killing the pace of the movie altogether. This is not helped by the somewhat bizarre characterisation of Galadriel. Jackson is to be commended for trying to make the longueur work, but ultimately it feels like it's delaying the film's climax too much at the moment it should be ramping up towards it. Fortunately, in the cinematic edition it's a fairly brief sequence. Events culminate in the epic battle on Amon Hen, with Sean Bean delivering a stand-out performance during Boromir's last stand and Sean Astin's Sam getting his first notable moments in the film's cliffhanger ending. The movie's success is furthered by some truly remarkable production design and the quite astonishing soundtrack by Howard Shore, which must rank as one of the finest movie soundtracks of all time. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring remains, thirteen years on, one the finest fantasy movies ever made. The writing, acting and effects work all combine and work in tandem with one another to produce something very special, something that Peter Jackson has struggled to replicate ever since.
10.0~The fellowships beat godfather bobbymyers Sign in Permalink The fellowship beat godfather in every category accept the sleeping one. I got the best sleep during godfather. Where as during fellowship I was on the edge of my seat. Fellowship will probably not get it just reward because of thick headed stick in the mud people who are love with movies that you sleep during!
10.0~A Masterpiece in Storytelling(Spoilers included) Elessar07 Sign in Permalink I first read LOTR when I was freshman in college. I was studying for finals when I needed a break so I picked up a copy of The Hobbit (a Christmas present from my mother years beforehand). I needed something to take my mind off of biology so I thought I would give this little book a chance. Within a week of opening that book, I not only finished it but I also finished the entire LOTR series. Ever since I have been a loyal fan and an ardent defender of what I would classify as possibly the greatest book of the twentieth century. When first hearing of the plans to bring the book to the big screen I was highly skeptical, however since seeing this first installment all of my fears have been laid to rest. FOTR was everything it was built up to be and more(a feat highly unusual in movies these days). Peter Jackson has set a new standard in storytelling for all others to follow. What has made this movie so much better than other adaptations from classic novels is the director's willingness to present the audience with his own interpretation of the books rather than simply following the plot of the book scene by scene. While this will of course lead to criticisms from some, I find it refreshing that PJ was willing to take such a risk. I have lost count of how many times I have watched this movie but I never get tired of it and the effect it has upon me is never less than when I saw it for the first time. I am so thrilled that these movies have introduced Tolkien to an entirely new generation, one that probably would never have heard of LOTR if a movie hadn't been made. My hope is that these movies will inspire people to return to the books because there is still a certain magic within them that can never be fully captured on screen (although PJ has come pretty close). If the two sequels live up to this first intsallment, then The Godfather movies will have a serious rival for the greatest trilogy of all time!
10.0~Incredible! susan7 Sign in Permalink Wonderful. Marvelous. As fans of the trilogy, we can find fault all day long. That's because it's easy to criticize, but let us remember that the movie medium has limitations that an author of a book does not have to deal with. Before being too harsh, we should ask ourselves if the deficiencies are of any consequence? Is the movie a good representation of the author's intent? Certainly character development is limited in this medium. But to do more than was done would result in the film being criticized for being too long, or for moving too slow. We expect a certain amount of this from a good book, but a movie can not be done that way. It is my view that, as measured against what has been achieved, that which was left out of the movie pales into insignificance. This is the best film adaptation of a complex story that I have ever seen. If the 2nd and 3rd installments are as well done as the first, this will be a great addition to anyone's DVD collection. Something to be treasured. A 10 all the way.
10.0~I'm so impressed I'm using it for a film studies essay lizzie-anne Sign in Permalink Oh wow what can I say?!! I don't have a criticism of this movie at all. It needs praised to the high heavens!!! I first saw it in September 2002 on video and was spell bound. The location was beautiful and the story had me hooked from beginning to end. (Orlando Bloom is gorgeous and enhances the film greatly!!) Ten out of ten and I'm so impressed I'm using this movie for a film studies course work essay at school. If you haven't seen it- go watch it!!!
10.0~The perfect beginning... ad_upclose Sign in Permalink I must admit, I had never heard of the books when I first saw the trailer of this movie. The trailer just captured me, and i made a note to see this movie! I actually ended up walking in freezing temperatures to catch this flick when it was released on the big screen. I left the theater in awe of what I had witnessed, I was inspired! This was a fantastic beginning to the trilogy. The characters were given enough screen time to understand and support them through the rest of the trilogy. The visuals and effects were really nice, and the score was just perfect. The Mines of Moria was perhaps the best part of the film. Its environment was well captured, as it effectively created an eerie feeling. The movie passed like a breeze, despite its long running time, which was essential to capture the aura of the movie. The ending made everyone want more and set things up nicely for the other two sequels.
10.0~Best Movie Ever!!!:) TimsGorgeousLittleKitten Sign in Permalink I absolutely love the enchantment of this story!:)It is so beautiful and wonderful!!!!:)The actors are perfect for the roles in which they play, and the scenery is breathtaking!:)Rivendell... is there room for me and my loved ones?:)
10.0~The Best Film I Have Ever Seen kruztydaklown Sign in Permalink My Dear God! On the weeks leading up to the release of Fellowship, I was mildly pesemistic about how the film would turn out. Nonetheless, I was very excited about seeing it (I booked my tickets weeks in advance) as I am a Tolkien fan and had been dreaming about this for a long time. What can I say! I'll tell you what i can say, I can say *god sakes, this is flaming excellent!* It blew my mind! It really did! First good bit was the Last Alliance; that blew my mind! Second good bit was the Wizards Duel! Third good bit was the Prancing Pony; That was class! Fourth good bit was the Flight to the Ford; that blew my mind! I could go on and on and on! And I will! The Balrog! What anticipation! And Amon Hen! Amazing! Surely there must be bad points you say. Not really. The only bad points were already present in the book, and not even real problems, so the only thing that a fan could complain about is......... It's to Short!!! What! To short! I hear you say. Well yes actually. Add another hour and a half on and replace all of the missing bits! But for the time he was allowed, Peter Jackson did the best job possible.
9.0~the perfect beginning to a perfect franchise margaridavagos13 Sign in Permalink The lord of the rings- the fellowship of the ring is one of my favorite movies of all time. The special effects are amazing and the scenarios absolutely magical. The movie it's not very truthful to the book, and don't mention a lot of important characters, but still it really captures the universe of Tolkien. It has action, comedy and romance all perfectly together. I couldn't ask for a better director for this movie, Peter Jackson as a sci-fi geek as he is did his best to make a perfect adaptation of the book. the movie is long but it's worth it, and real fans will ask for more. The actors were very well chosen, specially Elijah Wood who did an amazing job playing Frodo Baggins. I recommend it to real sci-fi fans or to people who love good movies.
9.0~A nice start of a trilogy... Thanos_Karagioras Sign in Permalink "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is the start of a really good trilogy. It is based to the homonym novel of J.R.R. Tolkien who has invent many things such as the language of elves and its alphabet. If I could characterize this movie with only one word that would had been: "spectacular". It's a movie that combines a really nice music with the action that characterize this movie, the war with the love and the faith with arrogance. This movie had many resonance to public because it was something different for that time and something that public saw for first time. That was something that Peter Jackson predicted and made a great success. That's why Peter Jackson nominated for Oscar as Best Director and in my opinion he had to win this. As a conclusion I can say that "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is a movie which was something new for the data of cinema and that was something that people loved and showed it. We can see that Academy Awards agreed with public's love of this movie and this has resulted of four Oscar wins and another nine nominations for Oscar.
7.0~The Fellowship of hard work (DVD) leplatypus Sign in Permalink Visiting Middle Erath is an huge journey: it took 13 years to Tolkien to write it, almost 6 years to Jackson to shoot it. For me, LOTR knocks at my door every decade: I read the first book upon recommendation by a friend in high school in 1991 (without finishing the two others books). Then, i went to see this first adaptation in 2001 but it's only now, in 2010 that i have watched the entire trilogy, taking a day of vacation to do so: first between 7.00 and 10.00, the second between 11.00 to 14.00 and the third between 15.00 and 18.00 just in time to catch my holidays train at 19.40. I really have a like/dislike with this work: As it's fantasy, it's fascinating but Tolkien wrote it like history and it's as boring as school books. Consequently, i don't feel the same intensity of other fiction heroes (Harry Potter, Spiderman, ...). In other words, the story is too much about facts and lacks some passion, especially romances. Nevertheless, this first movie was a good moment and with the first Harry Potter, it made the year 2001, the second best Christmas movies ever, behind 1984 (Ghosbusters + Gremlins). The opening at the Shire really set the tone for the trilogy because it's the warmest and liveliest place in middle earth. After, all the locations goes grimier and grimier up until the dreadful Mordor. The appeal of this first movie, in addition to be the one that exposes the characters and places, is that it's the only one that reunites the fellowship. Thus, we don't find the separate stories that plagues the sequels and it's a harmonious flow. Another strong point of this movie is that we really appreciate the beauty of natural landscapes. Sure, the shoots are digitally enhanced later but at least, at the beginning, it's nature and not blue screen!
10.0~Greatest adapted screenplay ever. phildo_lotr Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings is one of the finest pieces of modern literature. The movie falls nothing short of this standard. It is well adapted from the books to the movie. It captures you from the first moment. The fighting sequences in the movie are terrific. The action makes the story come to life. Peter Jackson and crew have made good use of modern technology. Making wonderful CGI characters. Everything is original and done very well. From the costumes to the weapons and armour it is all handmade and fits perfectly into the mood of Middle Earth.
10.0~Gorgeous movie, but not my favorite Aeris4ever Sign in Permalink I found my disappointment with LOTR kind of shocking since I enjoy fantasy and science fiction, to a degree. This movie is definitely the prettiest movie ever made. The scenery is beautiful and most of it's REAL, with real grass and trees. I like CG effects, but it's great to see a film that doesn't rely on them for every background. I was in awe of all the visuals, everything from costuming to the props. My only problem was the movie's length. I really think a good half hour or more could been trimmed off the final cut. The extra footage is a treat for Tolkien fans, but for the newbies, like myself, it was too much. After a particular encounter in the cave with the steep stairway, I started estimating how much time was left to go. The action sequences were great and captivating, but the downtime made the movie hard to sit through. For me, LOTR is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen, but it was also the loudest movie I've ever heard. Maybe it was just the theater, but the sound effects were way too loud. I spent the last half of the movie with my left ear pressed into my hand to block out some of the noise. This probably contributed to my impatience towards the end. Still a nice film, though, and should've won the Oscar over "A Beautiful Mind". Its loss further proves that entertaining movies never win Best Picture, only the artistic crap.
8.0~Tolkien would be proud... kdladage Sign in Permalink It has been tossed around in Hollywood for a long time. The very idea of making a big-budget feature film of the timeless novels is intoxicating. But how do you create a film that is true to the stories (and thus not going to upset the legions of rabid fans that can practically quote the books from start to finish) and still make a film that will attract the non-rabid fan who has vaguely heard of the existence of these books by some author from World War I? Well, I do not claim to be a rabid fan (I read the books, I liked the books, and have felt for a long time that they could make a good movie). I also do not claim to be some sort of insider that can give someone the secret tot he process that lead to this masterpiece. But i can say that not since _The Godfather_ have I been this impressed with the overall production values of a movie. The cast, crew, writers, producers, and very talented director managed to tell a very good version of the first book's tale... ...and as an adaptation, I give the movie a "9/10" (perhaps even as high as "9.5/10") -- but as a stand-alone film, it has to drop to "8/10" because the film leaves you hanging (much as the books did) at the end with no resolution to *anything* what-so-ever. Additionally, there is no telling at all the story of "why" the various people met in the Elfin lands to discuss this powerful ring; and the tale of Boromir (an important one, indeed) is not explained so that his betrayal and fate can be understood. It is one of those points that, without it, cause one to not really understand the actions this poor man takes in the film. Still, despite these shortcomings, the film is a fantastic piece of work that I highly recommend to anyone and everyone. But: I recommend that you watch the extended cut DVD version, and that you plan to sit down for all three films -- because this is not (technically) a stand-alone film. It is just Act 1 of a 3 Act screenplay.
10.0~More, more. I want more. Rogue-32 Sign in Permalink I've seen the film three times now and it gets better with each viewing. Peter Jackson told Charlie Rose (on tv) the other night that he wanted to make a film which transported him to another place, like the films he saw as a child did; he said films didn't really do that very much these days. I could not agree with him more. This was one of the things that impressed me the most on my first viewing (that and the towering - no put intended - performance by Ian McKellan) - I DID get the feeling I was in a different world, a different time, and I TOO have been missing that in films. Thank you, Peter. I am hungrily awaiting the next two.
8.0~Frodo Row Your Boat Ashore wes-connors Sign in Permalink "With the help of a courageous fellowship of friends and allies, Frodo embarks on a perilous mission to destroy the legendary 'One Ring'. Hunting Frodo are servants of the Dark Lord Sauron, the Ring's evil creator. If Sauron reclaims the Ring, Middle-earth is doomed," according to the DVD sleeve description, "Winner of four 'Academy Awards', this epic tale of good versus evil, friendship and sacrifice will transport you to a world beyond imagination." Reading the original J.R.R. Tolkien novels was an intellectual rite of passage; whilst young, you read and enjoyed "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy willingly - prepping with "The Hobbit", of course. "It's a job that's never started that takes the longest to finish," someone said. Writer/director Peter Jackson's "The Fellowship of the Ring" is the first of an extremely well-produced trilogy. Understandably, it's made into a special effects extravaganza, without taking many breaths for thoughtfulness. "The Bridge of Khazad-Dûm" (#30 on your DVD menu) sequence is a highlight; it climaxes with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the demonic Balrog (CGI) falling into an abyss, from which return seemed impossible This was one of my most memorable "Lord of the Rings" reading experiences - a future without Gandalf was unimaginable. Mr. Jackson and company recreate some emotional scenes extraordinarily well. At one time, it seemed impossible to think that such literature could be brought to cinematic form. ******** The Fellowship of the Ring (12/10/01) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom
10.0~Extended Version Works Better! Especially in DTS Sound! jbirtel Sign in Permalink Whatever rating anyone gives to 'Fellowship...', will have to give the same rating to the next two installments (notice I didn't say sequels). To do differently is the same as picking ANY other movie ever done; dividing it in three equal sections, then rating each section differently. Can anyone imagine taking a film like 'Jaws' and reviewing the 1st 40 minutes, then have a 2nd rating for the next 40 minutes, then doing the same for the last 40 minutes? 'Lord of the Rings' is ONE story! Filmed simultaneously, out of order (like 95% of all other films), many scenes from 'Two Towers' & 'Return of the King' were completed before 'Fellowship...'; but who is gonna sit in a theater for 10 1/2 hours straight? (yes, the extended versions will total 10 1/2 hours plus). The beauty is that because of the length, Jackson has the privilege of doing pick-up shots and re-shoots for the rest of the film. No other studio in history ever had the guts to commit that kind of money and time. Three years prep; $300 million. And no one can stop the juggernaut of popularity and staple in movie history that this film has created. The theatrical version's Shire intro, thru Frodo and Gandalf's perception, was exceptional. The extended version Shire sequence is a welcome 'alternate universe'. Now anyone can debate to their heart's content which is better. The rest of the added scenes makes the film less episodic and improves the dramatic pacing. So much care and quality attention to detail has gone into this mammoth undertaking. Every one involved deserves the highest praise for their labor of love. Which is a lesson that history keeps repeating: some of the best movies made, are those that are furthest away from Hollywood...and Hollywood interference. True films are not made by fancy suits sitting around the board room. Nor is a film polished thru 1 or 2 negative review cards from sneak previews. New Line deserves credit for entrusting the film makers to work their cinema magic and allowing the film makers to be...film makers! 'Two Towers'??? Hell; that will only whet my appetite for X-mas 2003. Better still...November 2003! Because by then, the film (notice I didn't say "films") will be available in its extended 10 1/2 hour form. For now, so far...10+ out of...10+. I'm certain to apply the same rating for the next 2. The quality is already there. And that DTS sound! Also, there's an easter egg containing the 'Two Towers' preview & an MTV parody but I'll be damned if I can find it. Help!!!
10.0~I never thought I would see this actually happen Dr.Tuba Sign in Permalink There have been countless fantasy movies over the years and they have generally fallen into one of two categories; those for children and low budget monstrosities. Never did I think I would see one that broke so cleanly and completely from the mold. Others have come close, to be sure, but fantasy has always been the red-headed stepchild of Hollywood. Lord of the Rings changes all that, hopefully raising the bar for fantasy movies to come hereafter. This movie was brilliant. The visuals were stunning. The soundtrack superb. The acting was dead-on. I found myself glued to my seat and taken on a ride through another world. It was almost a disappointment that it had to end. Everything from the tiniest details of set design, to the magnificent effects that were suprisingly not the centerpiece of the film, was calculated and refined and wonderfully done. I have not seen a better movie, especially in the realm of fantasy. This is definitely one for the ages.
10.0~The Best Fantasy Movie To Date darkmax Sign in Permalink LOTR:FOTR is perhaps the best fantasy movie to date. Most, if not all, that had preceded this movie had been.... poor made at best. It has a good smooth flowing plot (good adaptation from the books) with very believable graphics and make-ups. All the actors portray their characters very realistically, especially Sir Ian McKellen. He brought Gandalf to life. In fact, all of those whom watched it with me, expressed disappointments when he "died" halfway through the movie. Just can't wait to see the second installment of LOTR. For those who have not read the books, a word of advise: forget the book. This is one of those few shows that many will prefer the movie to the book.
10.0~About a masterpiece behdady Sign in Permalink How to watch the lord of the rings All about the Middle Earth There are couple of things to be aware about before jumping into the journey of the fellowships of the ring First you gotta be a ring well versed and also a middle earth aficionado, second you must be a nerd in researching about the characters and places mentioned in the movie or In an more extended version mentioned in the Tolkien books Third you have to have ring by your side for the purpose of getting more feeling and connection with the ring of power but be careful to not be drawn so much into its power or else there'll be left no way to get out because the ring of power has a will by its own. All the characters have their own history and background and in order to feel them deeply you have to read about them Hobbits orcs wizards balrogs and...

10.0~Faithful and Satisfying Dairhenien Sign in Permalink I have been a fan of the trilogy for years, and FotR has always been my favorite volume of the series. I was initially skeptic that this movie could bring to life on screen the images in my mind. I was completely wrong. From the smallest detail to the grandest epic sweep of the camera, Peter Jackson's movie translates Tolkien to the big screen magnificently. Be warned: this is a translation, and not an exact one. Jackson has excised the non-cinematic material, tightened the time frame of the story, and made innumerable other alternations. These changes do not distract from enjoyment of the movie, however, at least not in my case. This film is a great introduction for newbies to the world of Tolkien, and a fun and exciting ride for the experienced. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind leaving our world for three hours and experiencing the magic of Middle-Earth.
10.0~Welcome to New Zealand - we are Middle Earth kiwihobbit Sign in Permalink Fun fact: New Zealand, as a whole, doesn't have much of a national identity. New Zealanders (Kiwis) don't have much of a history, at least, not one that we're overly proud of. Our high school students have to be practically forced into learning about the Maori land wars and other events that shaped our nation. As a country we're in pretty good shape, but our national identity and culture has long been shaky. THANK YOU PETER JACKSON! And everyone else involved with making "The Lord of the Rings." For the first time in a long time, I've been signing onto message boards and guestbooks answering location with NEW ZEALAND!! with a newfound pride. I have long loved my country, it is so beautiful, but few others around the world have appreciated it. I recently noticed a surge in popularity of American flags and symbols (particularly after Sept 11) but recently, finally, people have really started to be proud of our country again. We have proved that we are capable to playing with the big boys in Hollywood. We have a future in our film industry. And it's all thanks to this incredible movie. I do have some review information that is relevant :) I've seen Fellowship 5 times. I'm dying for the Two Towers trailer to be released so I can see that. I can't wait for the next film, or the stars to come back to Wellington NZ for reshoots in May/June. I'm so excited. I loved this movie more than any film I've loved before. I give it 10/10. Because although I found some faults with the film, my overbearing national pride has filled up any blanks. Bear with me. It's the first time in my life I've experienced such national pride. The first time that other people have appreciated my country. New Zealand is a small country, but we are a good people, with beautiful landscapes - and if you are considering visiting New Zealand, I extend the warmest of welcomes. (And yes, it is true that everyone in NZ knows someone who was involved in the film ... it's a small world down here in Middle Earth).
10.0~A modern Masterpiece caseyt-48511 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings trilogy are the greatest films of this generation. All three films deliver on nearly every level. The Fellowship of the Ring was almost perfect and still holds up even after nearly 20 years. The action is fantastic and never goes to over the top. The performances are impeccable especially McKellen, Lee and Wood. The amazing visuals are a great combination of practical effects and cgi effects. The locations are breathtaking and are amazing behold. Peter Jackson's direction is superb as usual. You could argue that this is actually the best of the three movies. While I personally think Return of the King is the best of the three, the first part is a close second. The one complaint that I have is that Merry and Pippin could get on my nerves. But they get better as the series goes on. These are movies that are not to be missed. Even if you have never read one of Tolkien's books they need to be seen to be believed.
10.0~The Fellowship of the Ring: Not just a Movie, but the Door to another Dimension bonnie91 Sign in Permalink The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous. I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the "good" characters, but also with the "evil" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him. Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime. But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself. It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else. The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!
7.0~Good movie but not the masterpiece it's being hailed as---7/10 Sfpsycho415 Sign in Permalink While Fellowship of the Ring is a good adventure movie, i also think it is very overrated. It doesn't hold a candle to A New Hope. The first part of the trilogy gets off to a slow start as we meet the characters who will soon become the fellowship. It picks up speed when the faceless, hood-wearing, horsemen come looking for the ring. There are some great action scenes that follow and an exciting cliffhanger at the end. I own this, the Two Towers, and will own Return of the King because they are good movies. But masterpieces they are not. They get slow at times, become cheesy at other times, and the acting is not top of the line. I'd give the whole trilogy a 7 out of 10. No more, no less. 7/10
10.0~The best movie of all time! fleetwoodmacrocks Sign in Permalink Well I was never a big fan of Tolkien's books growing up. I never even saw the old Bashki version of the movie. I was never forced to read them, but maybe they were just too wordy for a 10-yr old. I re-read them a few years back, and then read them again before the movie was released. I was blown away...it's simply one of, if not the best story of all time. Tolkien has a wonderful knack for over describing everything. At first glance, this might irritate some who find the lengthy descriptives boring. But with that in mind, his style of writing allows the reader to have a VIVID picture of Middle Earth. During watching this film, I was blown away at how everything was just as I had imagined it. It's perfect...the only thing in the film that did bother me was that Arwen was introduced too early, and the movie is very long. It's tough to have to sit through without going to the bathroom, but good enough that you won't want to leave your seat. As far as the cast...it was nigh-perfect. Ian McKellen's GANDALF was impeccable. Viggo Mortensen as STRIDER was also a wise choice...and Christopher Lee as SARUMAN was the most perfectly cast character. Saruman, in fact, was my favorite character of the whole story. So I can't wait for THE TWO TOWERS, since Saruman plays a major role (& also sees his own downfall) in the 2nd chapter of the trilogy. This movie is AWESOME. It's without a doubt the best movie of the last 10 years. Maybe not the best of all time...but only time will tell! GO SEE IT!
1.0~Kicked in the kidneys by my true love Ripe Peach Sign in Permalink I went in to this movie with cynicism suspended - my faith in the magic of movies having been restored by "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" - and with my arms held open and a song in my heart. I emerged feeling like I'd been mugged by my beloved grandma. Peter Jackson is, quite simply, a coward and a scoundrel. He has cheated his masters at AOL-Time Warner, and he has cheated us, the paying customer. Here is why: He spent his producers' money filming most of the book, then allowed *half * of each sub-plot or piece of character development to be cut. Cowardice. If you're not going to show where Bill the pony came from, don't waste our time saying goodbye to him. OR, don't present Gimli's antipathy to elves, and then cut the reversal of it. CHOOSE ONE STORY AND SHOW IT! I'm sure that all this will be restored and forgiven in the director's cut (wait until 2004), but that's a devious and underhand way to build an enduring legacy. The action scenes however, cannot be rescued. They were set up largely to showcase the talents of Peter's friends at WETA. CGI and brutal jump cuts were used *instead* of any kind of choreography or placement or motion. Compare with "Starship Troopers", which had as much showcasing, but supporting and not dictating the action. The acting... oh, the acting. Good old Sean Bean stuck out like a sore thumb by actually expressing two or more nuances at once. That's at least one more than everyone else, sometimes two. There was enough over-emoting here to make Olivier blush. Fortunately, the heavy handed and woefully generic score overbore more of the monologues, and so we can pretend we didn't hear the more embarrasing pronouncements. Camerwork? You used to know how to do that, Peter. There were so many extreme close ups that I wonder if this film was sponsored by a makeup company. Either that, or the camera leapt out to pan around a piece of empty landscape with a blurry piece of CGI architecture perched precariously (and erratically) on top of it. The quality of the CGI in these scenes was no better than the painted backdrops on old Star Trek sets. And the pacing. It made me weep. Days of dreary dawdling in the Shire, then RUSH to the next scene, then linger longingly over a piece of WETA CGI, then RUSH again, dawdle, linger, RUSH, linger, RUSH, dawdle, RUSH, linger, cue Enya, roll end credits. Cut some more scenes, coward! Peter might as well have not filmed Lothlorien at all, for all the spectacle or drama or the development that it provided, and have had Frodo pick up the Phial at Rivendel from Arwen. That's no bigger a heresy than cutting Bombadil and the Barrow, and having the hobbits receive their swords from Aragorn - who happens to be carrying exactly FOUR hobbit sized swords. Lucky guess, eh? Nothing sums this film up better than the Indiana Jones scene in Moria. It's about 3 minutes long, utterly pointless, and is resolved through providence rather than action. It exists for two reasons only: to showcase WETA (yet again) and to crowbar in two "jokes" aimed at the sort of viewer who finds "Jackass" amusing. Consider that those three minutes could have gone on character development. Split that between Gimli and Legolas, and that would have given them, oh, ninety-FIVE seconds each. John Rhys-Davies had the skin burned off his face by an allergic reaction to his makeup (five hours to put on!), and THIS is his payback? Six lines, and being the butt of goofball "humour"? For shame. So, we have a movie with no characterisation, poor camerawork, shoddy action scenes, awful score, pace that is both dawdling AND rushed, and scenes cut from the book to make way for unnecessary CGI. It's telling that the highlight (for me) was Sean Bean commenting that Narsil is "Still sharp". I heard that as "Still Sharpe," Sharpe being the character that Sean is most famous for portraying. It might *not* have been a sly reference, but I choose (dear god, I choose) to believe that it *is*, because I so want to like anything Peter Jackson produces. And nothing else in this big old dull mess comes anywhere near to the standard that I expect of him. Raving fanboys, explain to me what's left to love, because I'm at a loss. As a movie, this is simply awful. If you think otherwise, you're judging it as something else entirely. I propose that Peter Jackson would have better served everyone involved - himself, his cast, us, and AOL Time-Warner - by just replacing Gimli with Arwen and having her do a lot of bathing under waterfalls and such. This is both a token and mediocre adaptation AND a poor film: a strong nudge either way could have rescued it, but Peter chose to took the coward's middle ground and left us with movie popcorn - loud, tasty on the outside, superficially satisfying, but eventually leaving you feeling empty and craving something more substantial.
10.0~A dream come true puckclaes Sign in Permalink This movie is really a dream come true. But you need to see the extended edition, which becomes a complete different film. Although the dvd is indispencable, everyone should see the movie at least once in a movietheather. GREAT
10.0~Amazing movie nikola-petrovic-belgrade Sign in Permalink This film is one of the most iconic movies ever. It will shape and reshape film industry for years to come. People should never forget the magic of shooting on film vs. digital. This is a true example of that. The Hobbit series, for example, are shot on digital (RED Epic cameras), and that movie in particular lacks that sense of feeling like the audience is the part of that fictional world. The Lord of the Rings, on the other hand, has that feeling to it. Like we, the audience, are a part of that magnificent world full of wonderful creatures and beasts. Full of magic, stories, love and battle. This truly is one of the best film ever made.
10.0~Details! BoordAppel Sign in Permalink I think I can watch this film a billion times and not get bored. Today I saw LOTR for the third time and I noticed a few details. When Frodo is stabbed with the blade from the dark rider and the hobbits and Aragorn are in the forrest u can see 3 huge stone trolls in the background. To understand who they are you have to read The hobbit. - When the fellowship is traveling over the mountains everyone is walking IN the snow, except for Legolas who is walking ON the snow. The is because Elves are so light. Well when I saw these details I realised that Peter Jackson was even a greater director then I thought. And for the people who think that there are too much 'ring-shots' (sounds like a word from a porn movie) in the movie: THE MOVIE IS CALLED THE LORD OF THE RINGS GODDAMMIT, THE RING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE! Some say that the movie is too long. It may be long but I never ever get bored watching. This movie is just brilliant, mayB just as brilliant as the book.
10.0~This is one of the best films you will ever see! WiccaBabe Sign in Permalink Ok so at first I was skeptical...the book was brilliant and i figured that the film would be no where near as good. Just like Harry Potter! But i went to see it anyway and OH MY GOD it rocked. Most of the scenery was exactly as i had imagined! And the actors! Orlando Bloom is Legolas...how can any film with an actor as gorgeous as him be bad?? Plus the added bonuses of Viggo Mortesen (can't spell) Sean Bean and Elijah Wood...not only are the good looking but boy can they act! Sorry Im going all girlie but if you havent seen this film already then go see it. Peter Jackson has turned one of the best books of all time into the best film of all time!
10.0~To refute its importance is foolhardy! SLionsCricketreviews Sign in Permalink Released to immense critical success, "The Lord of the Rings" was for a long time considered a novel that could never been adapted into a motion picture. Such a perception was virtually rendered idiotic when "The Fellowship of the Ring was released to cinemas in 2001, garnering the respect of both critics and fans alike. To this day, it seems the near perfect adaptation of a novel to a film. Frodo Baggins is tasked with setting out to destroy The One Ring, a weapon forged by Sauron during the Second Age of Middle Earth. He is accompanied by eight other companions, into a company known as The Fellowship of the Ring, to go to Mt. Doom to destroy this all powerful weapon. Jackson's abilities as a filmmaker were not too well tested prior to this near impossible project, so for New Line Cinemas to give Peter Jackson the rights to Tolkien Estate can be considered foolish. How can a director, with only two noteworthy credits in "Heavenly Creatures" and "The Frighteners" exceed such a reputation to bring forth J.R.R Tolkien's vision to life? Yet, what Peter Jackson managed to do with cast and crew, is now an inspiration. For "The Lord of the Rings" to work as an adaptation, the casting must be near perfect. The world is foreign to many viewers, the characters often are not human characters (though they obviously possess human traits) so the cast must be able to evoke a sense of humanity into them. Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo, conveying a sense of naivety but also a sense of extreme courage and determination. Sir Ian McKellen is phenomenal as Gandalf, calm and reassuring at all times, but also very kind and caring towards Frodo especially. Viggo Mortensen captures Aragorn seamlessly, his struggles with dealing with a failed bloodline and his desires to escape his duty to his people. Then there is Sean Bean, whose portrayal of Boromir is stunning. The only member of the Fellowship to be killed (and not resurrected), Boromir's presence is ever lasting during the trilogy. Virtually a broken warrior, mostly due to his father's extreme demands and the declining of Gondor as a kingdom. Sean Bean, in many scenes, perfectly captures the moral complexities the character faces. We see in his conversations with Aragorn that he desires to do good for his people, but brings himself to do it in an immoral manner. We see during the course of the film that he is further broken down in spirit, culminating in a moment where he attempts to seize the Ring by force from Frodo. Almost immediately realizing his mistake, he gives life for Merry and Pippin. He is forgiven for his wrongdoings by Aragorn, who then promises the longevity of their people. The redemption of Boromir also enforces into Aragorn a necessary responsibility he must begin to accept: he is heir to the throne of Gondor. When reading through the first two volumes of J.R.R Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" novel, there are moments throughout that feel utterly unnecessary. The major event being the hobbits meeting Tom Bombadil as the Nazgul chase the hobbits. This event constitutes an entire chapter, and in the process, diminishes from the suspense and momentum that had been established. Peter Jackson, realizing the event has little significance on the overall plot, omitted this, to the indignation of most fans of the novel. Peter Jackson, alongside Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens, wrote a near perfect script that wonderfully represents the nature of the book. One of the fine little touches, that fans have enjoyed, is the quick set of events that occur after the hobbits leave town, such as "concerning hobbits" or "a shortcut to mushrooms" - chapters from Tolkien's novel are tightly condensed and converted into a cinematic medium through which they can be accessed. The cinematography to this series of films can be described as swooping, breathtaking and majestic. And it certainly is. But it also provides a means to an experience. Why many fans of the series find it an experience is due to the cinematography, as the camera is rarely static but always in motion. Contrasting this with the prequels to Lucas' "Star Wars", the camera is fixed and the actors are given limited space through which to act. Those films feel like a mental prison, the viewer is stuck under the confines the characters are stuck and cannot escape. Of course, this notion applies very differently when considering films like "The Shawshank Redemption" but for fantasy/sci-fi adventures such as "Star Wars" and "The Lord of the Rings", the cinematography must be enriching. It provides an experience, rather than just a mere film. Starting with "The Fellowship of the Ring", this series of films is certainly an experience. "The Fellowship of the Ring" remains a defining achievement in modern cinema, it re-invented and redefined the meaning of a blockbuster and has paved the way for countless fantasy films. Arguably the greatest of its genre, "The Fellowship of the Ring" deserves every ounce of respect it gets. It is one of a rare kind of films that is so perfect in every aspect, from music to acting, from direction to cinematography, from editing to sound design, that to refute its importance to cinema is foolish. Peter Jackson did the seemingly impossible task of adapting one of the great pieces of literature into one of the great pieces of cinema.
10.0~The next best movie of all time!! arnor_89 Sign in Permalink This is great movie about Frodo and the ring, the ring bilbo baggins give to him, and the mission the Frodo get is destroy the ring there he was made, just see the movie and you get it i give the movie 10 for directors job(peter jackson) and play of all the actors.
10.0~Stunning transition from literature to the big screen. daerve Sign in Permalink I expected great things from this movie and was not disappointed. After reading the book I almost felt short changed by the film as it could have easily gone on for another hour. The scenes are incredible and so absorbing it makes your head spin. The casting was superb and virtually all of the characters could have sprung straight out from Tolkien's imagination. The script was virtually lifted from the book which so often fails but the whole thing was enhanced so much by sticking to Tolkien's words. I would whole heartedly recommend reading the book first because it's such a pleasure seeing all that you imagined come to life before your eyes. There isn't much more I can say except that this is without a doubt one of the greatest films of all time.
10.0~It's About Time! -Cinemaster- Sign in Permalink This first installment of 'Lord of the Rings' blows all of the current and recent Hollywood crap out of the water. After being subjected to endless Michael Bay-esque rubbish for so many years this movie comes as a real breath of fresh air. This interpretation of classic literature is nothing short of astounding. The casting, especially Elijah Woods as Frodo and Ian McKellen as Gandalf, is 'spot on' not to mention the breathtaking New Zealand scenery which after years of Xena/Hercules abuse has finally had it's true potential realized. It's a shame such a clever example of the film-making craft can only be realized once the Hollywood big-wigs invest their money in a foreign director and crew. One can only hope this movie will encourage other studios to stop treating audiences as if we have an I.Q. of 3. Rubbish such as 'Pearl Harbor' and 'The Fast and the Furious' are an embarrassment to America. I only hope the more cultured nations out there don't judge us by the crap we export to cinemas around the world. Ten out of ten to Peter Jackson and team for such a brilliant interpretation of a brilliant story. I can't wait to see the next two installments. Hollywood: stop treating Americans like we're uncultured ill-mannered idiots (please).
1.0~The mighty Frying Pan (SPOILERS) paulo20 Sign in Permalink I've discovered that's it not easy (at least for me) to comment on this movie in its entirety in one review and to cover all the aspects that bothered me without getting impossibly long-winded, so I've decided instead to comment on certain things as (or if) they occur to me. OK, I thought the movie did a good job in conveying a sense of urgency and terror that I don't think I'd felt as strongly in the book (it's been nigh 14 years so I may not remember too well); I figured the next time I read the book I could recall the urgency of these sequences from the movie for a greater reading experience. But on closer inspection you wonder if there's anything to be worried about. None of the characters, except Frodo, (stabbed by a Ringwraith), Gandalf (fell to his apparent death) and Boromir (killed in an overlong death sequence) show so much as a scratch. Samwise, a humble gardener, dispatches orcs with a frying pan. Frodo is again attacked and wounded, but is luckily wearing some impregnable armor. Orc-arrows seem to be shot at the Fellowship's feet or otherwise wide of their targets. Now, I don't remember if any of the characters got nicks and scratches in the book but I do remember the Moria sequence occurring much more swiftly and none of the instances describe were milked for cheesy drama. I remember it being more described as a frenzied flight for freedom. It wasn't a staged battle where enemies are slain, apparently to the last orc; when the battle is over, the Fellowship has time to dote over Frodo and his "near-death" experience before the orcs, with big booming sounds, remind the company that they are again in danger. So it's another dash for freedom, but now the gang is surrounded by orcs that can climb down vertical surfaces like roaches and snarl and hiss at our heroes. You wonder how orcs this skilled and threatening can be defeated with cooking utensils. But then, that's all they do, snarl and hiss, conveniently, until (again, conveniently) they sense the coming of a nastier presence and then scatter like, surprise, roaches. I may be wrong, but I don't remember this happening in the book. The orcs did hang back when the Balrog appeared but they didn't just go back to their hidey-holes. Now, about that much bally-hooed Balrog: yeah, sure it looked all big and impressive and stuff, but was it really all that threatening? When I envisioned a Balrog I thought of something faster (and certainly smaller) and more vicious; something that moved with alarming speed. The movie Balrog sure does roar a lot and rear up menacingly but it moves about as fast as a sedated tortoise. Gandalf has plenty of time to block its downward swings and the other guys have plenty of time to split. Then there's Boromir's death scene. I don't really mind them moving this bit from Part II to Part I. I suppose it gives the film a sense of closure. Boromir is killed, supplying tragedy, then avenged, signalling triumph. But did it have to be so overdrawn? Think about it: Boromir is shot with an arrow. Shocked he falls to the floor and ponders this. But then, he musters strength and fights some more until another arrow impales him. And then again. But each time Boromir sits there after each fresh arrow, the orcs he's fighting LET HIM SIT THERE. They don't take advantage of the situation and stab him but gamely wait for him to get back to his feet and kill them. Meanwhile, the two hobbits that Boromir is defending stand idly by with blank looks while Boromir is making like a pin-cushion. But the thing is, they're standing well off to the side and don't seem to be close to Boromir at all. Meaning that the orcs could just swarm in and take the two hobbits (their intended goal) without even bothering to fight Boromir. The point is this scene was at least twice as long as it should have been (and not very well staged, at that), taking time that could have been used for all the stuff that others have been clamoring for (myself included), like character and plot development. Also, it goes back to the point about how nigh invulnerable these heroes seem; even when they are beaten it seems to take a few shots to the heart and lungs to put them down. Some points have been made that the Fellowship escaped largely unscathed and dispatched tons of orcs because they are the "best of the best." OK, but then, why should we be worried? If these heroes can cut swathes through orcs and walk through a flurry of arrows without getting wet, why should we care? Anyway, this has gone one too long and ended up being a long-winded mess after all. The point is, though what I've described above (as well as other aspects) may be inconsequential or regarded as minor flaws by many, for me they are gaping holes and undermine the movie entirely.
1.0~Overrated Film of the Century (already!) mulhollandfan Sign in Permalink First of all, most people who praise this film did NOT read the books. The books are amazing but cannot work as film. Maybe that is why no one has undertaken this epic until now. What I can't understand was how people can praise all the different aspects of it. The costuming and sets were the only thing decent. My complaints? Too many liberties were taken with the book. Now, I'm not referring to the plot elements (which were more or less intact except for Tom Bombadil. If you don't know who that is, read the book!) but the style that Tolkien worked so hard to preserve in all of his books. The first item that was ruined in the first 5 minutes was the mystery of Sauron. Sauron is such an amazing character because you never get more than very small glimses of him. Tolkien keeps this throughout all the books. Jackson ruined that in 5 minutes. Next, the action always follows the hobbits. This put you in the place of the hobbits. What characters would be better for an audience to identify with? They were as much outsiders to this strange world as we are. Unfortunately, Jackson ruined that also. The directing was nothing spectacular. It was unobtrusive, but there was no style really, so it did not add any more depth to the movie. The acting was pretty good, but it could not save the movie from the unforgivable sins that the movie committed to the book. The special effects, though praised, were not good at all. You'd think since they have to do 3 films with hobbits that they would come up with a good way to do them and stick to it. Not the case! The hobbits change size drastically throughout the film depending on the technique that is being used to reduce them. Sometimes they are children, but the worst is when they just put them further from the camera. How is that supposed to work? Although we do not have depth perception in the theater, the audience can still tell when the size difference is only created by the perspective. The CG effects were not outstanding, but after seeing Star Wars: Episode 1, it was nice to know costumes can still be used well. Now, if I had not read the book, would I have a better view of this film? You bet, but too many things from the book were ruined to make it more of a conventional movie. Even still, I definitely would not think it is worthy of being ranked so high on IMDB.com.
4.0~Waste of time marcosmarino Sign in Permalink This is a typical product of a Hollywood system that has completely exhausted its creative energies, and only survives by badly copying books, classic movies and foreign movies. Don't spend your time watching this movie. Just read the book it is based on.
1.0~ten pounds of ---- in a five pound bag michaelescher Sign in Permalink I didn't hate this film, but I expected more. At worse I found it overblown, hard to follow and felt like I never had a moment to catch my breath. After watching it I was left with a vague feeling similar to what you get from eating too much junk food, full but unsatisfied. Too many sweeping vistas, overkill on the Frank Frazetta-esque beasts and baddies, and very little characterization. Were it not for the very credible performances by the cast of top notch actors, there would have been none at all. One feels that the director Peter Jackson felt that he needed to cover so much ground (literally and figuratively) that he needed to jettison the quieter moments that make up so much of the great story. One of the best aspects of the Tolkien books was the reader feeling a sense of sweep and getting caught up in the quest, along with smaller moments of detail and quiet characterization. The latter was sorely missing from this film. All rush, rush, rush, with out any moments humor. These two elements were what made "STAR WARS" and "THE WIZARD OF OZ", so great. These two quest films, albeit in completely different milieus, were so much fun to watch, and ultimately so resonant for so many viewers because of moments of humor that allowed the audience a chance to reflect and also gave insight into the characters. This film , with the exception of a couple of cutesy moments with Sam, Pippen and Merry and one line from Gimli, was largely humorless. I have a great deal of respect for Peter Jackson and his work. "MEET THE FEEBLES" and "DEAD ALIVE" were a couple of the funniest, most inventive bits of work to come out in a very long time and turned their genres (Muppet films and Horror) on their ear with a great eye to the absurd. Likewise, he did a wonderful job with "THE FRIGHTENERS" and "HEAVENLY CREATURES". I was hoping for the same here and was unfortunately disappointed. I hope, now that he feels that he has set the stage with "Fellowship" that he will offer more depth and humor in the next two outings. One other thing, the film's design seemed to be just more of the same old Sword and Sorcery stuff. "CONAN" mixed with "NEVERENDING STORY." Blech!!! There was even a small film that I saw recently from Spain called "EL CORAZON DEL GUERRERO (THE HEART OF THE WARRIOR) that had far more interesting design for this genre. I have a feeling this ain't going to be the cash cow that New Line wanted. Michael Escher
5.0~The film excludes far too much from the book, and adds to many things.= not in the book. red-12214 Sign in Permalink This film as a standalone on its own was very well done, as it give a very interesting aspect on a world of fantasy. However when you read the book you see many important things wrong in the transition. The first irritation that can be observed is the blending of not only personalities, but also appearances of Merry and Pippin. At times in the film it is very difficult to know which of the two is doing what. Then the exclusion of Tom Bombadil, yes I know no LOTR film has him, and his importance of showing a guiding figure, and being an adviser. Also the way he symbolizes good itself, and how the ring doesn't hold power over everything. The exclusion of Gandalf's letter is also annoying as it portrays how prepared Gandalf was if he never made it to the inn. Lastly, the changing of Arwen's role is horrid. Yes, I know that there is a love story in the book, however Arwen is given such a huge part whereas in the book she is almost non-existent. Then, there is the fact of adding things that don't happen in either this book or any of the books, and excluding things from the first one. One such example is the mention of Rohan giving Mordor horses in the book however in the film it is barely mentioned.
10.0~movie magic bdimondi Sign in Permalink Since I'm not normally a fantasy or sci-fi fan and I did think Godfather was a great movie, I can say with some certain objectivity, that I thought that Lord of the Rings was a vastly entertaining movie. For those who compare it to Harry Potter...Stop! These two movies do not belong in the same category. Harry Potter's audience is children, LOTR was obviously made for adults. Watching the extended version, I'm more than curious as to how the movie was rated a PG-13. It was violent--limbs were constantly being truncated and at least twice, Orcs were beheaded. I was inspired to read the first installment after the movie and considering books are rarely outmatched by their adaptive screenplays, I will be watching both of the next two films before I read the other two books. There's no point in setting myself up for disappointment. The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book though and I was awed by Tolkien's creation of a new language, Elvish. Amazing! In fact, this entire new world he imagined is incredible. But if you're not willing to suspend what we know as reality for a few hours, don't watch LOTR. I was taken back by the passion in a majority of these commentaries. Either, it was effusive superlatives in rating it as the best movie ever, or it was the most boring of movies. I don't give much credence to the overly negative reviews. The movie was surprisingly faithful to the original story whenever possible and the attention to detail, as chronicled in the making of the movie, was awesome. This movie is a testament to what truly is movie magic and to not appreciate the work in such a respect would be unjust.
10.0~WHAT AN AMAZING STORY MovieGirl01 Sign in Permalink This is an incredible adventure film that feeds the imagination. It's filled with hobbits, elves, dwarves, wizards, and yes, even humans. It tells the story of the Fellowship of the Ring: the hobbits: Frodo, Mery, Pippin, & Sam; the elf Legolas; the dwarf Gimli; and the humans Aragorn and Bormoir. The fellowship comes across many obstacles during their journey that test the courage and strength of all the members in the exciting tale based on Tolkiens' novels. It was a great film that kept me at the edge of my seat. I can't wait for the sequels!
10.0~The Greatest Motion Picture Of Cinema History rob_hyland49 Sign in Permalink I love this film. I simply love it. This is Tolkiens novel, and the world of Middle-Earth, the characters of Middle-Earth and the events of Middle-Earth! I love this film. This is the kind of film that will be passed down from generation to generation to generation. It is THAT good. There are three wizards: Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Peter Jackson, the director. The breathtaking detail Jackson has put into this is incredible. Lets start with the acting. This is a star studded cast, with Elijah Wood in the main role as Frodo, McKellen as mentioned, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Liv Tyler . .. the list goes on and on and on. Each has put 101% into this masterpiece, and it really shows. The sets are incredible. One can believe they are in Khazad-Dum, or in Bree, or in Hobbiton, or Rivendell particuarly. It will take your breath away, some of the incredible locations. We know each is not real, but there is a hint of realism in there. This is a special effects bananza, used only when needed. In Khazad-Dum and Isengard particuarly you can almost feel the power given off by the magic in this film. The costumes are perfect. The score (designed by Howard Shore) is breathtakingly beautiful. And throughout this, Jackson maintains a sense of calm and reality in the film, and it is this inner flare and outer cool that makes him and the entire cast and crew the magicians that they are. Probably the greatest motion picture of cinema history. 10+ out of 10.
10.0~MAGICAL and FABULOUS. A great film!! Kirasjeri Sign in Permalink I just want to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this great film. It is clearly the best movie of the year, and if "A Beautiful Mind" wins the Oscar it will be due to internal Hollywood politics - how Miramax's "Shakespeare in Love" beat out the superior "Saving Private Ryan". In all aspects of movie-making, "Lord of the Rings" stands out: direction, special effects, sets, acting, and even the script. Parts of the Tolkien classic have been very nicely compressed, or expanded - such as the fight with the cave troll (barely in the book). As for FX, it doesn't get better than the jaw-dropping fight against ther Balrog on the bridge at Khazad-Dum. There was no performance that was not at least good, and the dialogue between Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee I thought especially effective. Cate Blanchett was luminous as Galadriel. The musical score deserves special note. It added extremely well to the drama and mood of the film, along with taking us into a magical realm. The entire film was magical. And I can't wait for the sequels!
10.0~Awesome Movie! pbrownpwb Sign in Permalink Just love this movie and all of them for that matter!
10.0~Very good entertainment 47konst Sign in Permalink Although hopes were high for Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the ring it absolutely was not a disappointment. Ian McKellen was great as Gandalf and I don't think that anyone else could have done better. What was astounding were the special effects, they are simply amazing. The computer graphics and the music are astounding. The feature length is 2 hours 47 minutes which is about half an hour to much, for my taste, but for hardcore fans it's probably not enough.
10.0~The greatest fantasy adventure ever. Baaadmojo Sign in Permalink This comment goes to the extended version of the movie which is like 3½ hours long. This version is a solid 10 because many people like myself who hasn´t read the books, will understand everything in this version. Even the relationships between the characters will deepen and their personalities be seen more than in the previous badly-cut version. Another thing that makes my day is that the battle scenes are more extensive and less confusing(maybe because the aren´t CUT like they were before). So, the final score is a given 10. Great actors, superb music, wonderful atmosphere and a deep and beautiful story to be told.
1.0~Uninteresting mrp-10 Sign in Permalink This was one of the most anticipated movies, ever, and this is also the first movie I have ever seen that had required 3 sittings to go through, because I feel asleep twice. The point of a movie is not to set up the scene for subsequent movies, rather, to move along the story and not dwell on the same themes over and over again. Yes, we knew the wraiths can find the ring, yes, we knew Aragorn was the king and he didnt really want to be king but he needs to be king. Yes, we know gandalf kicks ass, yes, we know that the lure of the ring is great and it can corrupt easily and blah blah. How many times can the SAME themes be repeated over and over without being boring?
10.0~Praise for LOTR soccer1818 Sign in Permalink I personally love The Fellowship of the Ring. I think that it is a fabulous movie and a wonderful adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece. For all of you that were bored by LOTR or thought that the movie was too slow, you missed half the movie. The story is not just about the journey from the Shire to Mordor. The characters, their relationships, the battle of good vs. evil - these things are the heart of the work and fill those supposedly "slow" times. If you read LOTR before you saw the movie then you understood all of these things. If not, then you have missed out. The relationship between Frodo and Sam, Aragorn and the whole fellowship, Legolas and Gimli - they are part of why I love the book and movie. The strength of their friendships are more powerful than anything else in the novel/movie. Do JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson justice (and yourself a favor), read The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers before you see Two Towers in December. PJ made the movie for those of us who love LOTR not for those who love movies. If you read Two Towers before you see the movie, not only will you understand the story better b/c there are going to be a lot of new characters, but you will appreciate the movie more. You will love the characters and better appreciate their individual struggles if you read the book first. I have one more thing to say, I love every single one of the actors and actresses in Fellowship of the Ring. They seem to step perfectly into the characters that Tolkien created. Hats off to Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, all the other actors/actresses, and to all those who worked behind the scenes to make Tolkien's books come alive for us.
10.0~Just the way I liked it. Cthulhu-22 Sign in Permalink The best way to describe this masterpiece, is that it was better than my own imaginations! Having read Lord of the Rings 3 times, I feel I know these lovable personalities better than most - and seeing them alive, was a great experience.
10.0~A Fantastic Movie sjoerd1987 Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings is the best movie I've ever seen! I like this kind of movies! It is a great story, and the acteurs are very good. They won just 4 oscars, that's poor. But it is and it stays a good movie, and I can't believe that people gave a 1. I give this movie a 10!! GRTZ Sjoerd
10.0~The Best Movie of the Year! Alcyryal Sign in Permalink Simply put. This film is nothing short of mind-blowing. Peter Jackson is a genius for being able to give life to the greatest epic in modern literature. Perfect scenery, camera angles, the right dialogue, everything in this movie is perfect. When I first saw the previews, I thought this would be another one those hyped-up-movies-that-turns-out-to-garbage movies. Then, I saw the movie. OH MY GOD. It was told in great detail. Everything I imagined from the book turned out to be exactly on target. The excitement, the suspense, the emotion, and of course, J.R.R. Tolkien's unforgettable and amazing story. It all came together to create The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring. I am dying for the next movie, and from what I see, No. 2 will NOT be another one of those hyped-up-movies-that-turns-out-to-be-garbage movies.
1.0~Book adaptation commentary gtmac1 Sign in Permalink This is not a commentary on the quality of the movie as a movie. I've had my say as well as anyone else on that score. Instead, I'd like to touch on the quality of the adaptation from book to film. I've seen many, MANY comments from people who thought it was so true to Tolkien's novels. Too those, I would make this challenge: Buy a cheap or used copy and read the book again and highlight everything that was changed (although you may find it easier to mark the things that are the same). If a line of dialogue was different, mark it. If there was a significant passing of time and the film doesn't represent it legitimately, mark it. If characters were changed (i.e. expanded, contracted, created roles), mark it. If something was told as a flashback, but was rearranged in the telling of the story, mark it. If something was described in detail and it didn't appear that way in the movie, mark it. If a character was said to have an emotion other than was clearly expressed on the screen, mark it. If a character turns into a bright blue cartoon character when there's no such supernatural transformation described, mark it. If things were mentioned subtly in the book that were just laid out in the movie, mark it. Make sure and pick a highlighter color that you can live with in case you want to re-read this copy as you'll be seeing it a lot. I understand that film is a different medium with a different vocabulary, but there were many changes made that were not required for the transition. In addition I'd like to take this chance to point out that it is indeed a different medium and we should be demanding screenplays original to the screen and not watered down versions of Book, Comics, TV Shows, Cartoons, Video Games, etc.
5.0~Too long! puffin11-1 Sign in Permalink The special effects are excellent, but I felt it is an hour too long. There is too much repetition of the "bad guys" chasing the "good guys". The acting is very good, and I will probably go to see the sequels.
10.0~The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring - Saturday Night Review prashanthology Sign in Permalink Simply Stunning. Mind blowing. Breath-taking. The movie is all of that and more. And since it is the first movie of one of the finest trilogies, a tiny outline to the story would be aptly fitting. The story goes around a young Hobbit named Frodo, from the Shire, who embarks on an epic journey having been entrusted with a powerful and ancient ring that he must destroy by taking it deep into the cracks of Mount Doom, in Mordor, the enemy's lair itself. It is not a versatile story, but a quest. An Almighty quest that is filled with determination, friendship, brotherhood, hope, and trust. Giving his utmost respect to the late Mr. Tolkein, Peter Jackson has undertaken and completed a wonder of a movie that never fails to leave you with your mouth gape open, the marvel of the land that is Middle-earth, with the wide variety of characters ranging from the little Hobbitses to the giant Wizard Gandalf. It is a quest beyond anyone's imagination and capability and the legendarium of J.R.R. Tolkein is executed to perfection on to the big screen. The Shire has been depicted beautifully, with its people (the Hobbits). Every step of the journey has breathtaking scenic shots and sequences that leaves the audience craving for more. The magnificence of Lothlurien should not be missed, too. Coming to the cast, the roles played by almost everyone is near-perfect. Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Sean Astin (Sam) represent the perfect hobbits with supporting roles of the Fellowship representing Legolas, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Boromir, Merry and Pippin have been wonderful. The dialogues are a no-miss, some of them are truly excellent and add to the effect to the movie. Gandalf's "You shall not Pass" statement to the Balrog is of such power and magnitude, it will send a chill down your spine. The screenplay, the display, the music is all magnificent and adds to the beauty of the Lord of the Rings. All in all, The Fellowship of The Ring is a masterpiece. Those unfamiliar with the Middle-Earth and its characters will find it a "little" difficult to cope up with, but no worries. The mere beauty of this film will leave them happy come end. This is a terrific movie, and it will be one of the best movies I have ever seen, along with the other 2 movies of the LOTR franchise. A full 10 / 10. Do not miss it.
10.0~Good affect and extremely strong plot. rastaban3 Sign in Permalink This one was a real treat to see. It is not often that I have been truly entertained by a good story. Lord of the Rings is on of those few films that does this. The plot line of this film is was kept me glued to it. It did not have any weak points that I could tell. It moved along well and only had a few points where the plot dragged a little. I also have to admit, at times the film did seem to be taking a very long time but it also seemed to move quick. I also feel that the film stopped at a good spot and it seemed to be a natural break in the story. I wonder what more could be coming in the next films. The acting was strong. I was surprised by how well Elijah Wood preformed in his massive role. I was very grateful the director did not allow his character or dwell on indecision which tends to bog down other films. The supporting actors and actresses was also very good and really helped the film move along. These two things combined really make for a good entertaining experience. I have not read the books and I am not very familiar with this type of movie so I did not really know what to expect. I have to admit, this was good and well worth my time. The only draw back would be some of the fight scenes. They may be a little too violent for children. Over all, the best film of 2002 I have seen so far, (10 out of 10)
10.0~"One ring to rule them all!". bannonanthony Sign in Permalink I had not read any of the LORD OF THE RINGS before I saw the film series, and I still have not read it but I think that Peter Jackson has done a superlative job in bringing the story of the three books to the screen. My family now owns all of the extended editions of the three films on DVD, and while the original theatrical cuts weren't too bad at all, I'm glad to have seen the extra footage. The performances are all fantastic. Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are both excellent as the two wizards. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are great as main hobbits Frodo and Sam, Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean throw in great performances as Aragorn and Boromir respectively, THE MATRIX's Hugo Weaving is great as the Elf King and INDIANA JONES' John Rhys-Davies is great as the dwarf Gimli. This first film is of course all about establishing the characters and what they have to do, and it is handled well. I can see why it was unsuitable for children below a certain age, because for children things like the Orcs, Uruks, Ringwraiths, the Balrog and, in his brief appearance in the flesh, Lord Sauron himself are the stuff of nightmares. But the story is engaging and the characters all fully-rounded. I regret that unlike TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING, I never saw FELLOWSHIP in the cinema, but I still love it. It's unfair though to try and pick a favourite out of the series because each part is brilliant in its' own right. But FELLOWSHIP is an excellent beginning to the series and not to be ignored.
9.0~One of the best films EVER seen recently Switcher1972 Sign in Permalink I read the books just before the release of the 'Fellowship', and Wow... I was already a great fan of heroic-fantasy literature and movies, but it was too much to handle in just one screening I've seen it a lot since 2001, and each vision was like a childhood pleasure Great adaptation. A lesson of cinema. A lesson of life. Don't tell me i'm an addict. I'm not. I hope so. Peter Jackson rocks. He already rocked in the 80s during the "Bad Taste" years (cult-fan favorite), but THAT was/is... beyond words. Edit (13/08/28) : still unique - yeah, you still can say it is a unique experience. The comparison with the most recent "Hobbit" work confirms it big time (unfortunately for Peter Jackson, i'd add).
10.0~I was bored and read the Cliff Notes in Jr. High; how wrong I was! lambiepie-2 Sign in Permalink How I wish I could have seen THIS film first. I had no interest whatsoever in The Lord of the Rings books. Let's be honest, when its required reading in literature class and the teacher made middle earth seem as dry as a chip, who would have an interest? Well, this film made me have an interest and want to go back and read the books again. This production was lavishly and handsomely done. I was excited, thrilled, scared at points, cheering, laughing and just caught up in the wonder of this production. There isn't ONE character I didn't like, there wasn't ONE moment I wasn't interested. There is so much I can explain about the film, but for my review, I just want to comment on how it effected me as an ex-student assigned to read a book I though was horrid, and seeing it decades later as a wonderful adaptation that I watched over 100 times by now. Here's another film I did NOT go to the movie house to see and yes, I am kicking my own butt for not doing so. I missed a great film on wide screen, and just to let everyone know, I am in line for "The Two Towers" already. Granted, this will not help my "C" grade I got when I was assigned to read it back in the day, but I love his film to death. I just bought the expanded DVD, and now I am a Lord of the Rings fan for life! Future LOTR literature teachers, take note! Then make sure your students get to see the film as a companion piece to the books...believe you me, they'll thank you later with plenty of interest.
10.0~Great! Sokorra Sign in Permalink I must say, I first only wanted to see this movie because of the Hype over it. Then I started to read the book and was hooked into the LoTR world. The movie held me in it's grips the whole time, and I actually sat still for most of the movie. That does not happen often. The movie was wonderful and all the actors involved did an amazing job. Another reason I rented it (and now have bought it)is because of Elijah Wood, who should by this point be able to show he is more then just a child actor.I highly recommand this movie to anyone who Loves fantasy as much as I do.
10.0~Update Corsten Sign in Permalink Well well, 9 months down the line and look at the reaction from this movie. I bothered to read a few of the poorly-written, dull comments posted about this movie and a couple of them struck me. For how stupid they are. Naming no names but answering their silly criticisms is what I'm here for. Firstly, someone called this film for not being original. "Wizards in pointy hats". HELLO - Tolkien is the source material for this stereotype! What, like, were you thinking!? The Lord Of The Rings is completely original; many of the stories for both books and films today haven't half cribbed from it so please stop whining that LOTR isn't original. Let me tell you there'd be no Star Wars without this. Just see them for reasons why. On the related subject, another apparently-intelligent reviewer here called this movie's SFX for being poor in comparison to Star Wars: Phantom Menace. Hello: those fx in that movie reeked. They were all far too CG. Effects in LOTR were far better for the simple reason that in Phantom Menace, you could tell they were special effects. In this movie, however, the fx looked real and believable - you weren't lead to believe what you were seeing was an effect. That is all really. This movie rocks. Roll on December 18th!
1.0~SHOULD NOT BE # 1!!! deb207 Sign in Permalink I went to see Lord of the Rings the other night with some friends, and at first it was great. It was fast paced with a lot of action. But nearing the hour and a half mark the pace slowed dramatically; so we sat through slow and boring scenes for the last hour and a half. There was no character development and there was no explanation of terms used for people who were not avid fantasy readers or watchers and there was no climax or lead up to anything that could be considered a climax. About 45 minutes until the end of the movie about 15 people got up and walked out -- they had the right idea. They didn't miss an ending just a slow cut off. I know the movie is a continuation movie, but it could have been ended more smoothly in order to keep people guessing and wanting to see the next part, but instead people walked out tired and making comments about how it was a mistake to make all 3 parts at once. The first part might have been big because of advertising payoff's, but after everyone sees it, the other two will be flops.
10.0~Easily the best movie I have ever seen empress11 Sign in Permalink Nothing compares to the greatest film of all, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. As I watched my favorite books come to life before my eyes I was positively engrossed in this movie. To start off, the scenery must be of the most beautiful places in the world. New Zealand was the perfect place to film it and from the grassy fields to the high mountain tops, each shot was capturing and very believable. The Shire was exactly how I imagined it, with the rolling fields to the hobbits holes, with their round doors at a perfect height for the little hobbits. Rivendell was the most stunning scene out of them all, as perfect as a picture, with misty waterfalls, sparkling streams and the careful structure of the buildings and towers. The beginning told well of how the great rings came to be and Cate Blanchett has a very powerful and capturing voice. The characters all played their parts well. Elijah Wood was more than perfect and adorable in his roll of Frodo Baggins. Ian Mckellen did an outstanding job in his roll of Gandalf the Grey. One of the best characters has to be Strider/Aragorn played by Viggo Mortensen. The scene between Aragorn and Arwin was one of the most beautiful. Liv Tyler gave a great performance in her role although I do not think that Arwin was a big enough roll to be credited third. But I guess they have to intertwine women into the picture. In the movie, the two most enjoyable characters were Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). They were quite funny as the good natured hobbits, always ready for their next breakfast. And there is no friend quite like Sam (Sean Austin). Comments about Frodo and Sam being gay are silly thoughts because its nice to see that two guys can give each others hugs with out being homosexual. Saramaun (Christopher Lee) quite frightened me at first but after reading about the actor who played him and his life,I would love to meet him. Especially since he has meet J.R.R. Tolkien. The orcs, quite yucky, but very believable and very evil. I love Gimli (John Rhys Davis) with his axe and I must admit that Legolas (Orlando Bloom) who is very quick with his bow and arrow is also very attractive. Boromier (Sean Bean) although was very tempted, in the end proved to be worthy of his master. The last thing I must comment on is the directing. Peter Jackson could have done no better. Every shot caught your eye and the graphics that went along with it made it all the while better. Also, the sound track for this movie better win its Oscar because the music is beautiful especially the Enya songs. All in all, this being the greatest movie, derived from the greatest books, I cannot wait to see how they have captured the second two books.
10.0~Nearly as good as it could possibly be ! Dmon4u Sign in Permalink As a long term reader of the Books, I readily agreed with the "experts" that said a possible movie would be too limited for the material. When I viewed it, my first impression was that the Director put his heart into it. Nearly everything that was cut out was necessitated by the confines of the films length. The whole picture had that quality/"the money's on the screen" look and feel. My only reservation was the added scenes with the women characters. I hate pandering to any audience. Logically though, if most deleted scenes were added back in at the time, they too would need to be shortened. Sometimes one needs to be satisfied with what you get and how good that is, rather than anguishing over something lost. All I can say as a wrap is : They said it couldn't be done ! It is ! Now for the extended DVD set - can't wait !
10.0~Dream come True....... Hagalaz2000 Sign in Permalink What can I say, I read the books, I used to play D&D, love role-playing games and now you get this GREAT MOVIE. If you have the least bit of interest in Fantasy you must see this movie. 10 out of 10!!!
9.0~Tolkien would be proud. Man_of_Death Sign in Permalink Perhaps it is to late to write about LOTR but if you are wondering I saw it on a special Nexus preview December 10 2001(I live in Reykjavík,Iceland) . The Fellowship of the Ring is the latest masterpiece directed by the unlikliest director of all time. But as Peter Jackson did with Braindead and The Frighteners he brings on the screen a work of art which Tolkien himself would be proud of. I´m not happy to say that when I saw it first I was not satisfied but then I read the first book and saw the movie again and was completely satisfied beyond all doubts. I look extremely forward to The Two Towers to see hopefully another masterpiece. Brilliant, dynamite, a must see you name it and everything will point to LOTR.
9.0~A brilliant spiritual existential movie dantown Sign in Permalink This is a brilliant shocking movie. It speaks to your soul. It was designed to be so. The visual impact of this movie only underlines the spiritual import of it. For, every human being is a small unsubstantial waif in the large world-that is, us. This metaphorical movie reaches deep inside our souls. Each of us is a hobbit who traverses this life and wishes to kill evil. We fail, and succeed in steps. We may meet Cate Blanchett-types , or Liv Tyler-types, but we must pursue life and be good. We are titanically set up up for failure-if we do not pursue goodness. That is the message of this fine film. All of life is a great trial. An adventure. It is within our grasp to pursue it with glory.
10.0~Nothing short of one of the most beautiful films ever to crafted. tswartz700 Sign in Permalink I know saying it's one of the most beautiful films ever to be crafted is saying a lot, but when you get these results from a seemingly "impossible" film, you know the director has hit every mark perfectly. The film depends on not the acting, but the characters, oddly enough, because they are the films backbone of the story; they are so different as far as their cultures and backgrounds. The music is by far one of the best scores ever written. I don't want to offend anyone, but, in my opinion, this score is definitely more "deep" and beautiful than that of "Star Wars". And "The Lord of the Rings", to me, is by far a better film. Unlike most films, the set and backdrop were incredibly difficult, and, though not the core of the film, obviously, just created obstacles that made it more difficult for the director to reach the core. The core of the film is definitely aided by Shore's perfect score, and by the beautiful sets that transport you into the world you would call Middle Earth. To me, the core is the emotional pinnacle in the film. To me, that was, more than all the others, the very last scene. When Frodo is holding out his hand with the One Ring in it, looking into the East, knowing his inevitable danger that is ahead. When he thinks back about Gandalf. When Sam comes along after he has started to paddle across the river. When Sam nearly drowns. When Aragorn talks to Legolas and Gimli about how they are going to leave Frodo and Sam alone to go on their trek, and how they will go save Merry and Pippin from torment and death. Then when Frodo and Sam reach above the river bank. Then, after a few lines, go ahead on their journey. I shall say that this is my favorite scene in the film. It is so beautiful and perfectly crafted. It is more than just a fantasy film, but is possible to bring one to God, through the beauty of it. I know that seems "over the top", but this film is truly a beautiful masterpiece. I can go on and on, as you have probably heard in reading past reviews, but it's true, this epic is one of the most monumental films of all time. I know there's still "The Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Casablance", and others, but this film is just as beautiful as them. I don't know that time will treat it as good as it treated those films, but just and see before you tell me what a moron I am for comparing this film to them. The acting may not be as strong, which is still great, but the emotion that this film explores is one that I have never felt, and is close to the feeling I got when I realized the beauty of God. I highly recommend this film for anyone who has three or more hours to watch it. Not to watch it with "the guys" on Friday night, but maybe alone, where you can explore your most out-of-reach emotions of beauty without distractions or interruptions. 10 out of 10. Perfectly well-made.
10.0~How 2... frodo3005baggins Sign in Permalink describe this movie? I can't find the words to... Oh! I know! How about THE BEST DAMN MOVIE EVER MADE!!! OK, bit of an unfair opinion, as I have never seen Casablanca or The Godfather or even Psycho, but it is the best movie I have ever seen. I have waited with anticipation for The Two Towers since I came out of the cinema after watching FOTR. Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is the best movie adaptation of any book. The acting is superb, especially <spoilers> when Gandalf the Grey (superbly portrayed by Sir Ian McKellen) fell down the pit beneath the Bridge of Khazad-Dum, and the Fellowship are mourning over their lost friend and leader outside. You can feel their emotions and the music makes you cry as well. The soundtrack is also wonderfully composed by The Silence Of The Lambs composer Howard Shore. All in all 1000/10, 11 stars and 100%.
10.0~A Masterpiece that gave Fantasy a new start !! florent-piovesan Sign in Permalink There is so much to say about this first installment of the trilogy. Peter Jackson and his extraordinary directive skills managed to do what everyone thought to be impossible : bring Middle-Earth to life !! The cast, the crew, the soundtrack, and of course the beautiful landscapes of New Zealand made the epic story that is The Lord of The Rings believable. Slightly different from the book written by J.R.R Tolkien at certain times, the nearly 3hrs are filled with adventure, courage, friendship and a glimpse of bigger things to come. And even after almost 13 years, it is a classic that hasn't aged at all. Definitely a 10/10, and thank you Peter Jackson for making fall in love with cinema.
10.0~Why I gave this movie a 10 without actually telling anything about the movie! Sirjump Sign in Permalink In my personal opinion this movie is worth a 10/10 - to me! That's why I gave it a 10. *I* feel it is as true to the masterpiece of a book that it can be. To *me* it was a dream come true to finally see pictures of how I imagined middle-earth and the saga of the ring to be. When I scrolled down the different user comments it baffled me that almost every other post were against this movie, and a lot of it is based on comparison to other "masterpieces". Well who cares! I certainly don't care if you knowitall-homesitting-movie-critics like Citizen Kane and 2001 better than LOTR - FOTR. Some of you are even giving this movie a lower vote than you perhaps initially would, just because it doesn't deserve a place in the top 10 of the movies of all times? Well duh! Perhaps it has the 4th place (currently) because that's how the majority feels about it. They don't follow the politically correct Hollywood we-know-best routine. They follow their hearts and personal opinions. And good for them. Good for all of you that are able to watch a movie and actually say; "This movie meant something to me... I think it is the best film I have ever seen." Don't you dare give it a lower vote than you think it deserves! Now I am going to see it again - on DVD - until the special edition comes out - which I will see while awaiting The Two Towers.
10.0~It should be number one! rabbott87 Sign in Permalink I've seen this incredible artistic work of genius twice now, and I intend to see it again. I was very amazed that it wasn't #1 in the top 250 films list, and was overtaken by the inferior Godfather (I know many people will probably disagree with me on this one) and the Shawshank Redemption. I thought the standard of acting was fantastic, and Peter Jackson is a marvel. It utterly deserves to be placed in higher rank that the Godfather, a violent, crude film. However, I do agree that the Godfather is a well made film, but it is such a shame because of the content. The Lord of the Rings is wonderful, and appeals to practically anyone. It deserves all the praise it receives, but definitely none of the censure. I cannot wait till the next part comes out, and it does the anticipation justice.
1.0~I did not enjoy the film. Kais Sign in Permalink I found the changes made in the story line showed Mr. Jackson did not understand the book, -at all. His his replacing the character of Glorfindel, a warrior, with Arwen, a Lady of the Realm (turned female warrior for no apparent reason other than to attract Xena fans), completely destroys the point of the Tolkien trilogy. He simply can not undo the damage he has done with this "substitution". A significant segment in "Return of the King" hinges on the fact that there are not female warriors. I am so disappointed in the film and will not be watching any of the following installments. I just wish Mr. Jackson had bothered to read the books before he butchered them.
10.0~Never before in my life were my cheeks more aching... Nachtritter Sign in Permalink ...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read "The Lord of the Rings" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with "The Hobbit" and "The Silmarillion" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in "The Hobbit" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least. Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen. As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance. The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried "ranger". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return. Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.
10.0~Breathtaking jyaegerr Sign in Permalink No words can describe how incredible this movie is. I read the books first and fell in love with them. I was worried that the movies would not capture the essence of them, but I couldn't have been more incorrect. Wow. If you are a lover of fantasy, by all means see this movie immediately. If you are not a lover of fantasy, still see this movie immediately. The acting is incredible, as is the story, scenery, characters, and dialogue. I myself am not a huge fan of the fantasy genre, but this movie is the single film that got me interested in movies. There are many characters in this movie, but they are all memorable and interesting. Some people criticize the film for having a slow exposition, but the establishment of the world in which it takes place is part of what makes it so awe- inspiring and believable. I can not recommend this movie enough.
1.0~Brilliantly done opening, but collapses spectacularly Niv-1 Sign in Permalink The first ten minutes of The Lord Of The Rings, The Fellowship of the Rings are among the best and most exciting I've seen. Cate Blanchett's narration is energetic and layered. The sweeping scope, the fast paced clips are really well done. That stuff gets an A. The rest of the movie is so spectacularly dull, save a couple of moments, the movie just collapses. Peter Jackson's direction of the Hobbit scenes is so broad, all of them come off as one-dimensional idiots. I could not stand Pippin and Merry, I was hoping they were killed off. There is one scene before the characters go into a cave and fight a couple of trolls, they fight a water monster. I have no Idea why the writers would put two fights back to back. OK,its dangerous, we get it. Another thing is there are minutes long scenes where the characters just walk, taking up screen time. There are some good performances. Liv Tyler,her first scenes with Frodo, Cate Blanchett, but that's it really. I had to give the movie a 1. It just totally collapses.
10.0~Do I HAVE to wait for Two Towers and Return of the King? (sob sob) exeverywhere Sign in Permalink Lots of other people have gone to great lengths to talk about how great this movie is. I'm sure that they have said everything I could say, I won't bother just repeating them. I just thought it was an extraordinary film. All I can add is that when I walked out of the theatre (even after the sixth time) I kept saying to myself, Do I have to wait for the next two movies? I want them now! Now! NOW! Aaaaaaaargh!
10.0~Everything and more than expected amosib Sign in Permalink I couldn't wait for this film to arrive and to go and see it and it didn't disappoint in any way. It was exciting, dramatic and moving. The scenes were breathtaking and effects magnificent. Now I am desperate for parts two and three, if they are half as good I will not be disappointed.
10.0~Big Surprise LorDom Sign in Permalink Before this movie was made, I had barely even heard of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When the movie came out, it got such rave reviews and looked so interesting that I was quite eager to see it. When I finally did see it, I was SO impressed. The story is absolutely enthralling, the special affects were amazing, and the acting was superb. This movie really got me more interested in all the actors playing the hobbits, and also Ian McKellen, actually to be honest, I REALLY enjoyed all the actors, especially, Viggo Mortensen(playing Aragorn). There is not one element, one scene in this movie, (in my opinion) that could use any improvement. I would strongly recommend this movie to any who enjoys the fantasy\science fiction, even if you have not read the books. This is the best movie I have ever seen, and I can't wait to see the rest of the trilogy.
10.0~Excellent!! krueger71 Sign in Permalink What can I say, this trilogy will seriously contend with the original Star Wars for best adventure movies ever! Can't wait to see the other two movies. Having them on DVD does not hurt either :) Wonder when Lucas will get his act together and release Star Wars 4-6?
10.0~Not just good, its golden. nickthegun Sign in Permalink I was a precocious brat. I had The Hobbit licked and was half way through the LOTR before I finished primary school. I grew up with these books; the world of middle earth sometimes seemed as familiar to me as the village I lived in. So when LOTR: FOTR came out I really couldn't wait. But on the other hand, adaptations have the habit of, well, sucking. A lot. Luckily Peter Jackson knew his Tolkein onions. He also seemed aware of the possible death threats he would receive from obsessive D+D players. As far as I am concerned Jackson has created something wonderful. He has breathed life into one of the worlds most enduring tales and done it so magically it just entrances you. Most three hour films start to feel like three hours by the end. My arse was going numb by the end of JFK and Titanic was overlong by 2 hours and accounts for three of the suckiest hours of my life. FOTR, however, grabs you by the throat straight away and doesn't let go until the credits roll. And when they did I sat back and wondered if it had really been three hours. Surely that was two, tops. But it wasn't. I was so engrossed, the time just flew. And in those three hours Jackson gives us some of the most spectacular vistas ever seen, some of the best action and special effects I have ever seen and, most importantly, one of the best stories ever told. It could have easily been different. He could have played to the studio. He could have re-jigged the story for modern audiences. He could have played it completely straight and included all the songs (so many it really would have been LOTR: the musical). He got it spot on. He kept the right parts, dropped the right parts and updated the language carefully. The result was a faithful interpretation, which kept the magic of the original, but did not alienate new comers to the story. I cannot praise FOTR highly enough. The only thing which will top it is the new extended version which I cant wait for. Oh, and the next two in the series. Roll on the Ents!
3.0~Poorly adapted... Galleto Sign in Permalink I'm the biggest Tolkien fan ever; I've read the book many times, and I've made all my friends read the book as well. (It's a condition of my friendship.) Perhaps these are the reasons why I was so disappointed with the movie. I can't judge...I didn't stay for the whole thing. What little I saw consisted of sappy background music and hobbits hugging people. Really, I thought they were Teletubbies. They left out crucial elements in the story, or changed the facts in sloppy afterthought. For example, they cut out the Old Forest and the Barrow Downs. So then at Weathertop, Strider gives all the hobbits swords...just in time for the fight with the Nazgul...A little unconvincing. The characters were much simpler; Saruman comes to mind. They retooled all of the beauty out of Gandalf's tale of betrayal. These are trifles, but they cut so much out of it, that the movie wouldn't have made sense to me, had I not read the book. For example, in Bree, when they met Strider, they didn't get the letter from Gandalf saying Strider was an okay guy. We just had to rely on Frodo's "hunch." Again, a little unconvincing. What's a palantir? What's an orc? They tried so hard to be cryptic and mystical that they left the audience with little clue as to what's going on. Well, I could go further, but I can sum it all up by saying just this: Read the book...it's much, much better.
10.0~WOW. jamie_inscore Sign in Permalink You know, I don't care what people say about Elijah Wood - he did an excellent job. And Viggo Mortensen? He's the most handsome guy out there. I'm probably one of very few people that never read the books, but I will tell you now that I've seen this movie, purchased the 5 disc DVD box set with bookends, My next purchase will be the books. I'm quite well read but for some reason I missed this one, and I don't know why.
10.0~The Fantasy Motion Picture to Rule Them All... fearfulofspiders Sign in Permalink Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings, I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released, to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness, but wanting more! Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept. Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition, but shows the power of film, and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous, and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee, The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere, a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history, and full of wondrous images one could never imagine. The acting is superb. With a complex script, each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story, and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall, or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal, but it's completely believable. Never losing pace, the writing and direction is flawless, making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut, we do see the passing of the Grey Elves, and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book, there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well, but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers, in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film, and the ones made by Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way. The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room, plot advancement, and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own, be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen, the Mines of Moria, or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed, each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold. The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI, miniatures/bigatures, and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact, they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath, two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations, when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery. Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful, epic, and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen, it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country, race, or character is stunning. Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece, allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements, equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three, one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever.
10.0~The Perfect Start To The Perfect Trilogy shane_beacham Sign in Permalink One of my biggest regrets in life is not seeing any of the Lord of the Rings movies in theaters. At the time, I just wasn't all that into them. Eventually friends and family members of mine convinced me to check it out. As soon as The Fellowship of the Ring ended, I knew I was hooked. "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien and is set in the world of Middle Earth. In this world long ago, there lived an evil dark lord named Sauron, who forged the One Ring of power. Sauron is eventually defeated but his ring is lost for centuries, eventually ending up in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. Frodo learns of the ring's past, as well as Sauron's return, and that if Sauron were to regain this ring, he could take physical form again and bring destruction to Middle Earth. Together with eight other companions, Frodo sets out for the land of Mordor to destroy the ring in the fires of Mount Doom. So, where to start? First of all, this is a film that beautifully captured the world that it was trying to bring to life from Tolkien's novels. It never felt like a location that they were shooting the film in; it felt real and alive and made you want to go there. Not only that, but it added the mythology of Middle Earth in perfectly, not beating you over the head with it but using it as a way to advance the story and expand the world. After this movie, I wanted to go to New Zealand just so that I could be "in Middle Earth" (I still do). The performances are also incredible, and you fall in love with every one of these characters. Elijah Wood, who was 18 when he started shooting these movies, showed that he could bring a lot of emotion and weight to the character of Frodo, and showed his shift from someone who lives in a peaceful world only to be sucked into this world of evil. Ian McKellen is also perfect as Gandalf and gives perhaps the best performance in the movie. Sean Astin is great as Frodo's undying companion Sam, Viggo Mortenson shines as the heroic but conflicted Aragorn, and Christopher Lee is great as the villain Saruman. As for the other cast members, they are all incredible and, overall, they not only play their characters but become them. This movie is epic in every single way. Every aspect, from the battle sequences, to the cinematography, to the music, to visual effects, EVERYTHING about this movie is epic. Not to mention, the movie succeeds in every one of these aspects. The action and battle sequences in this movie, as well as the two sequels that followed, are the golden standard for battle scene filmmaking. The music, composed by Howard Shore, is able to combine the mystery and majesty of Middle-Earth with the epic feel that carries with the story; it's one of the best film scores ever written. The visual effects are top notch and still look fantastic even to this day. Everything about this movie is at a ten. And did I mention how many great scenes are in this movie? From the opening prologue, to the cave troll fight in Moria, to the Bridge of Khazad Dumb sequences, there are so many memorable and incredible sequences. And at three hours (almost three and a half if you watch the extended cut), it never feels boring at all. Finally, the emotion of the movie is strong. This is not all spectacle without any heart. You feel the weight of this journey and also feel for the characters. The movie has a lot of heart, which makes it more than just your typical fantasy film. Overall, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is an outstanding achievement in cinema, and is a fantastic start to a fantastic trilogy. These three movies are among my favorites and nothing I say in this review can truly describe how good they are and how much I love them. Check them out and see for yourself.
9.0~A very solid start to a great trilogy TheLittleSongbird Sign in Permalink J.R.R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story. Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad. However, I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor. Now I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director, but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures, and this is no exception, where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope, with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman, the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue, which on the whole is excellent, Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it. And the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here, while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel, and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee, whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good, and indeed it was, and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir, and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really, as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen, who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf, the delivery to the camera, the delivery of the lines, perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom, yes he is dashing and handsome, but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland. In conclusion, a great start. 9/10 Bethany Cox
10.0~Awesome, simply awesome jjlord Sign in Permalink Plot Summery: The Epic Fantasy based on J.R.R Tolkien's book. Frodo Baggins is a simple hobbit but his life is turned around when he finds the ultimate ring of power that once belonged to the Dark Lord Sauron. Soon after he is joined by a fellowship of comrades willing to destroy it in the fiery Caverns it was made. Remember this is just part one so don't expect this to "end"... I will not say much more as I don't want to have to tick Contains Spoilers just explain how good it is as that is for you to find out. Comments: Before these films came out I'd heard of the books however my sister said she read them and found them boring. I was a bit of an idiot admittedly as I just went along with what she said without actually reading them myself. I never really thought about it for a long time but when I heard there was a movie coming out I was like "Well it looks like an average Christmas blockbuster". On Saturdays me and my mates have a sort of night out together to just chill out spend time with each other as good friends do and one or two of them said lets go to the movies. I said why not as he wasn't really thinking but I was annoyed when they decided they were going to watch "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring". I thought I don't like fantasies, Its a 3 hour epic and I'm exhausted. I was the only one that objected yet little did I know how good this movie really would be. *Sorry if this seems like This is your life* When it came on I was surprised how terrific the scope of it was and the special effects in the opening battle scene left me in awe! I soon got past the shock of how good it was and it soon turned to Enjoyment. The acting was brilliant, Cinematography superb, Music very good and there are so many heroic characters in it (although I can't go into detail about it). When I came out I was in Shock again and out of all five of us only one didn't like it. They were harry potter fans though. Very very good. HIGHLY Recommended. See soon....
10.0~The best movie in the world!! sitingwitdadog7 Sign in Permalink This is the best movie that you will ever find. Legolas is so hot. The people who made this movie did an excellent job. This movie was made almost like the book, but it was still great.
10.0~Quite Simply: One of the Best Films Ever Enrique-Sanchez-56 Sign in Permalink A few thousand reviews in a month or so bespeaks of many things. I find it hard to add what has already been said. But I will try to capsulize my take on LORD OF THE RINGS: 1. Superlatives are insufficient to describe the utter awe that this movie has elicited - in me - and in the world. 2. You'll never be able to please everyone. Mr. Jackson has virtually achieved that. I haven't seen such a splendiferous response to a movie in a long time - not even from 'Titanic' or 'Harry Potter'. 3. The movie's opening comes at the most propitious time in history. We need fantasy right now, Harry Potter and other vehicles are providing that...but it is hard to compare them to the sheer virtuosity of this movie's execution. 4. 3 hours has always been a horror story to Hollywood's mass market audiences. But to anyone who has attended a screening of a really long movie like Bertolucci's '1900' 5 hrs+ or 'The Sorrow and The Pity' (almost 5 hours - depending on the version), 3 hours is NOTHING. Movies SEEM to be getting longer these days. But the audiences are not complaining as much as they once did. This is a good thing. Frankly, at the end of the movie...I just wanted to go ON AND ON. 5. Every actor, every scene, every effect is believable. Despite the more than generous mix of sets, real outdoor scenes, created outdoor scenes and mixtures of these, one's beliefs are never jarred from the Tolkein-Jackson fantasy world. 6. The Howard Shore music (which suggests some measure of doom by adapting the most famous motto in history - second only to Beethoven's Fate Motto from his Symphony #5 in Cminor - the DIES IRAE (Day of Wrath) theme from 'Office of the Dead' from the extensive catalog of Gregorian chants) - uses music and sound and not just Super-compressed FOLEY sounds (which are OVERUSED these days to a fault instead of music in order to shock audiences into an artificial level of frenzy)...to evoke true suspense and excitement. 7. Elijah Wood - proves that no other actor could have portrayed Frodo (even if the 'book Frodo' was much older). His performance is astonishing in the breadth he exudes with the economy he expends. His eyes are among the most expressive I've seen in a long time. Elijah has always taken the more interesting and unflashy parts during his surprising career. But in each role I have seen, he has brought deep human emotion and a strength found ever so rarely in the more flashy actors. This is not to deride as Speilberg's choice of Haley Joel Osment as Frodo. Quite simply, Haley would have been just too young and though his talents seem limitless to us now, Elijah just IS FRODO. Thanks to all involved in the making of this masterpiece. The world cannot wait for the next two!
10.0~SPECTACULAR milanzman Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson and the entire Fellowship of the Ring crew did the best job in the world. They bring you to Middle-Earth (New Zealand). Where Frodo is entrusted with a daring task to destroy the one ring in the cracks of doom in Mordor. he meets new friends and perilous places. The movie is an Oscar WINNER!!!!!! Cant wait till the two towers!-Milan
10.0~100% FAN martin-oros Sign in Permalink This movie is a masterpiece of the movie history. I love it. I also read the book which I liked a bit more but nevertheless the film is breathtaking. I am a 100% fan of J.R.R. Tolkien.
10.0~An awesome trilogy! joshuadrake-91275 Sign in Permalink I decided to do something new with this movie review. I will not only review the first film, I will review the entire trilogy. The plot follows Frodo Baggins as he goes on a journey to destroy the One Ring and with the help of the Fellowship and his friend, Samwise Gamgee and the evil / good creature Gollum, he is able to destroy the One Ring in the one place that he is created: Mount Doom. I love this trilogy and to this day, I think it is one of my favorite trilogies (others include The Matrix trilogy, the original and prequel STAR WARS trilogies, THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY and the original X-MEN trilogy), but I really thought that this trilogy was amazing and Peter Jackson gets a lot of praise for this film, King Kong, Tintin and the Hobbit trilogy and it is really amazing. The first 2 films are nearly three hours long, but the last film The Return of the King is 3 hours and 20 minutes long and I thought that would be way too long, but after the find ended I was not angry or bored. When I first watched The Fellowship of the Ring, it kept me interested and very amazed from beginning to the end, after that I watched The Two Towers, and it kept me emotionally engaged until the end credits and I was impressed with the climactic fight scene at Helm's Deep, then I finally got to The Return of the King and I could have not been happier with this one, it not only made a billion dollars when released in the theaters, but it won all 11 Oscars including Best Picture, making the third film the only fantasy film to win in each category. Not only you can get interested in the movies, you can also get interested in the characters and action, as well as the plot. Frodo is a cool character, played by Elijah Wood and his performance is amazing. Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White / Gandalf the Grey is really cool and amazing, he is a character that he is amazing, and his performance was great and I was angry that he did not get an Oscar for this role. Also, he was playing Magneto during production of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the first, second and third X-MEN films. The character I was horrified about the first time I saw this film was Gollum, because of his split personality between Smeagol and Gollum and it was amazing to see him on screen, Andy Serkis played him and I liked him as Gollum in this trilogy and the first film in THE HOBBIT trilogy, An Unexpected Journey (2012), which was released in December 2012 and I did see it and I did see the second film and I really enjoyed it. My favorite scene is where Gollum is talking to himself and that was really funny and just well acted by Andy Serkis and this would lead him into playing the title role in Peter Jackson's KING KONG 2005 remake and Caesar, later on in RISE of the PLANET of the APES and DAWN of the PLANET of the APES and I can't wait to see him as Caesar in the next "Planet of the Apes" reboot film. These movies have some fantastic dialogue and action, especially in the second and third film. Every battle in this trilogy is amazingly well-done and spectacular and the added great CGI for this film trilogy. My favorite battles in The Fellowship of the Ring are when Arwen (played by Liv Tyler) saves Frodo and the battle inside Balin's Tomb and that was incredible and spectacular. My favorite battle in The Two Towers is the very, very, VERY long battle at Helm's Deep, that battle sequence was amazingly well-done. My favorite battle in The Return of the King is the end battle because there are two things happening: Frodo destroying the Ring and fighting Gollum and the entire Fellowship fighting against the Orcs. The cinematography, visual effects, production design, creature design, make-up effects, editing, musical score and atmosphere of this movie was an amazing job and it was also incredible and the direction by Peter Jackson is amazingly well-done and fantastic. Overall, this trilogy of films are incredible with every movie released and every time I watch these films are incredibly amazing. Yes, I will always love The Fellowship of the Ring for starting this trilogy, but The Two Towers is amazing and is a great improvement over the first film. My favorite one is the trilogy is The Return of the King, because it has better character development, better action sequences, better acting, better music and visual effects and most of all, the best ending to a film trilogy. I know a lot of people think that the ending is way too long in the third film, but I'm used to watching three to four hour long films at all. This is one trilogy that I don't think gets enough critical praise and credit. FINAL SCORE FOR ALL THREE LORD OF THE RINGS FILMS: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - 8/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - 9/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - 10/10 FINAL SCORE for the entire trilogy will be a 9.5 / 10
10.0~Brilliant page turner mr eastwood Sign in Permalink Excellent story telling in the film medium!! I was wowed by it. Well done (an understatement really) to director Peter Jackson and all those involved in the making of this film. The film's pace never let up and increased it's edge as the story unfolded-the editing was excellent.
10.0~This movie was well worth it. I even cried to know it was out. spacedrivefilms Sign in Permalink I have waited for years for this movie. I have things for the early 50,s form this. I have the cartoons. Now the movie was the best. I wish that as a Indie movie maker I could have been a part of the making of the movie. I almost cried when I was watching it. I wish my friend could have been alive to see this movie
10.0~Maybe not the best movie of all..... pikachu1 Sign in Permalink But the best fantasy film ever!!!!!!! This movie is the coolest. Elijah Wood does a great performance. At first I didn't know him, but now he one of the cutest actors I ever seen. I'm sure everyone agrees with me as the best fantasy film. This is what fantasy should be for every fantasy film out there. And is probably where fantasy really begins. Right here, at the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings. Everyone should see it. Don't think it is some sappy film that you don't want to see. You gotta see it, believe me. I give it 10/10. If your into fantasy and want to see what a movie really should be, you gotta see this movie.
10.0~The battle for middle earth has began! Elgitarren84 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It had the same impackt on me as star wars had on me as a kid. The story line follows the book pretty good. Peter Jackson is a genius keep up the good work! The second film was even better (the second book is also better then the first) must i think that this film is one of the best motion pictures ever made!
10.0~surprising DieGefaehrtin Sign in Permalink well, "the lord of the rings" has always been my favourite book. when i first heard about the movie, i decided to boycott it. I mean, it's so annoying to not be the only one loving the novel anymore. for years i've tried to convince people to read the book and nobody wanted to/had the time to/was interessted in it. and just because there was some hollywood-blockbuster made, everybody around me has turned into a "lord of the rings-expert". so, can't change that anyway but didn't ever want to watch the movie because I thought there was no chance that anyone could ever bring the shire to live the way i've been imagining it. boy, was i wrong... some friends of mine "convinced" me to watch it (=told me they had tickets for "Le pacte de loupes" and waited for me to find out which movie we were actually watching) And, what can I say, I loved it. i totally lost myself in the beautiful landscape and the (let's not deny it) HOT actors. Although I should hate my friends for tricking me into watching it, i'm now a big fan of the movie myself.
10.0~Great movie with a great cast bsbsavagebnl Sign in Permalink I really thought all of the actors and actresses brought the book to life. For those of you who have read it, the movie helps to understand the book. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do. Its a great movie with a great cast.
10.0~Very good SMLA11 Sign in Permalink I absolutely love this movie! This movie has really awesome action and very great special effects. The acting was way too good. Ian McKellan should have won for best supporting actor, not that Tom Wilkinson was bad but I really enjoyed his performance. I haven't yet read the book but I hear it's as good as the movie. Overall I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. This is probably the only long movie that I can see again and again. rating 10 out of 10.
1.0~It's NOT that great ! Beass Sign in Permalink Why ?? -Because it is very repetitive, that's why. Here's the story in short: Bad man/creature/ghost/ting creates a powerful and evil ring. Anyone who possesses it and wears it becomes obsessed. Ring bad. Hence, someone (the hobnobs) must get rid of the evil ring. -so far so good. But then that's it ! From here on in, it's all travelling, fighting evil, more travelling, fighting more evil, even more travelling, and fighting even more evil. A pattern starts emerging... Yes, there are some nice effects and it looks real pretty, but the story blows chunks !! I don't care if the book is fantastic, I go to the cinema to see a good film, not a good book ! And in this case the film wasn't great. Special effects alone, does not a good movie make !
10.0~Captivative/thought provoking/imagination inspiring manya-1 Sign in Permalink Seen it four times now ist time did not know the story. second time had read the book half way through. the movie was good enough to encourage me to read the books. after reading the book...what a fantastic movie! This is the story of US...we who live at the darkest hour before the dawn of the new Day has appeared...our blessing will be matched by our efforts to bring light to this world.Though the task unimaginable hard and impossible yet there is no other way. As Gandolf said to Frodo...it is not up to us to chose the time we live in but to do what is necessary with the time that is given to us.
10.0~A Film for Our Times NORWOLF1 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings is a movie for our times. If we look past the stunning visual effects, lush scenery, and spectacular action sequences, and listen to the wisdom of Gandalf and Galadriel we hear the quiet whisper of the true meaning of the film- heroism. The message of this film is that true heroes are not the great and powerful, but the everyday person placed unexpectedly into trying circumstances. What a message at this time in our country's history. On September 11th we saw normal, everyday peoples lives changed suddenly, unexpectedly. They were forced to be heroes, to work to save not only their own lives, but the lives of others too. As Gandalf says, we do not choose what times we live in, but we choose what we do with the time we have. Remember this theme and focus on Frodo's trials and perserverance whenever you watch this movie. Remember the loyalty and friendship of Sam. That is what this movie is truly about. Peter Jackson has created a visually stunning film, filled with action, yet rich with meaning. He has for the most part stayed true to the themes and sequences in the books. While he has changed some characters and scenes, those changes do not significantly alter the plot and in some instances actually improve it. Though the movie is played out on a grand scale, the film is really about a story of one little hobbit, Frodo, and his unexpected challenge of having to be a hero. The score by Howard Shore is superb, quite worthy of the Oscar it received. The score is destined to become a classic. The cinematography is also superb, also definitely worthy of its Oscar. My one criticism, is that Saruman is given more time on screen than in the books. I felt he should be more so behind the scenes as he was in the books. The more sinister evil is the evil that cannot be seen. Though Christopher Lee, as always, is superb. The rest of the cast is also superb, especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo. Kate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are also excellent in their roles, bringing a strong female presence.
8.0~Good, but too much unnecessary stuff added to the story Darth_Vicious Sign in Permalink I liked almost everything about this movie. The actors, the effects, the costumes and the story (of course). But they had added like half an hour to the movie which I found very unnecessary and haughty. Movies are the best when you watch them at the cinema, but i don't want to sit still for three hours if it isn't really necessary. So the fact that they had added 30 unnecessary minutes bothered me a lot. But except that, it's a very good movie.
10.0~Wonderful film, for fans and newcomers alike. bunni_hop Sign in Permalink i'm amazed at the number of people who say this movie is 'the worst movie ever made'. there are so many things i could say to argue against this, but i'm sure the majority of them have already been said. before i saw LotR the only tolkein book i'd read was the hobbit when i was about 9, and i hadn't enjoyed it. this movie moved me to tears in several places and as soon as i got home i found the books, and read them, and all the other books related to them. i went on to see the film 2 more times, and i loved it just as much as, if not more than, the first time. if a movie can change people's views to the extent that they go from disliking the stories to being an avid follower of the books, Peter Jackson must be doing something right.
10.0~I wish Tolkien was Alive to see his world come to life!!!!!! imcholly Sign in Permalink I have seen this movie four times, and all for times it was great and never got bad or boring. I watched the 1978 film called Lord of the Rings and when I saw that movie I loved it. But years after seeing that movie I have seen Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and it was a lot better. I have also read all of the books about 6 times and I did not think that the movie was as good as the books, but I thought that Peter Jackson did an amazing job on creating Tolkiens world. I was rather upset by the fact that they left out the Tom Bombadil part in the movie that was one of my favorite parts in the book. I was also upset about Liv Tyler's character was placed in the movie, for some reason that really got to me and a lot of people that I know, but I did think that Liv did a good job for the small part that she had in the movie. I really liked all the actors the casting directors really did a good job with casting this movie. Elijah Wood was great for the role of Frodo Baggins, and also all the actors that played the Hobbits in this movie. Also all of the other actors like Ian McKellen who played Gandalf The Grey better then any one probably could, and Viggo Mortensen who played Aragorn or Strider, as some might call him. I loved how Sauron was made to look, and also the Orcs and the URUK-HAI. I really liked this movie and I know that a lot of other people do to. This movie will probably go down in history as one of the best, I know that is definitely on my top ten list and I can't wait till The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King come out I think that they will all be just as good if not better. I would recommend this movie to any on that loves Tolkien or just loves movies. I wish Tolkien were alive to see his world come to life for the whole World to see. TEN STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10.0~Maybe the best movie I have ever seen. kjulmain Sign in Permalink I was quite young the first time I read Tolkien's masterpiece and did not get much out of it at first. Then I read it again and again. Now I have read it five times in Finnish and once in English. Each time I got a bit more out of it. That is also the case with the movie. Every time I see it (I have it on my computer) I like it a bit more. With the other two parts, the trilogy as whole will be the best movie ever made. It is so simple.
1.0~Three sides of the trilogy waari Sign in Permalink After seeing this movie about 20 times and having read the books countless times and since my hobby is, and has been for 20 something years, watching movies I think I can make review ... The movie as a action / adventure / fantasy movie This is the category lotr fares best, all the basic elements of a decent movie are present, a horrible enemy that tries take over the world, a hero (and his friends, that include the comic relief), a object that destroys the enemy, lots of monsters, fight's & cliffhangers. As a "popcorn" movie it is quite good, although the movie is maybe a bit too long, for an action movie that is, the audience receives what it is looking and waiting for and visually the movie is quite nice indeed. Just as a action / adventure / fantasy movie I would give it a 7.5 / 10 maybe closer to 8 even, but it's not something that would blow my mind, all this has been seen in countless other movies, maybe in different form, in different surroundings, but still nothing ground breaking. The movie as a movie This is where it hit's thin ice. Character's are very shallow, their motives and their personalities are left in the dark (other that can be shown in fights) eg. Frodo run's into Merry & Pippin in some field, and so they decide to follow Frodo, albeit they have no idea where they are going and why, had the movie established that they were good friends before it had been a lot easier to understand. Story is driven forward with a really fast pace (after Frodo leaves Shire that is) and unfortunately it is done with the expence of the story, all emphasis is given to action, action and more action. The characters are as basic as movie characters go, you got the comic relief (Merry & Pippin) the unbeatable warrior (Aragorn) the turncoat (Boromir) and so forth, and since the movie "had" to be modernized you also need the "femme fatale" (Arwen) and still this would be tolerable IF the characters were something more than a aid that just runs the movie forward. One other major problem is that the movie is "pre chewed" nothing is left to the viewer, the director takes the easy way out and so underestimates the viewers badly, I think it's rather sad really. So what does the movie leave you with ? well basicly your typical action adventure that is set in fantasy land. It's a typical hollywood production that emphasis on glitter rather than substance. As a movie I would rate it about 6 / 10 The movie as a adaptation of Tolkien's work Well, what can I say ? basicly it takes just the basic storyline and forget's everything else, it's so horribly different from the book that it makes me cringe in terror. Those who disagree with me should really read the book's ... Peter Jackson is surely entitled to his vision but he shouldn't say that the movie is faithfull, since it is not. Jackson took the easy way to make this movie, he forgot about the soul of the book and made a action movie instead. Timeline is totally wrong, parts are cut out (like Bombadil) parts are added (like Arwen) since it needs to be "modern" I have read several review's here that say that the books needed to be modernized, may I ask why ? dont see a reason personally. I am not going to start to list everything that is changed, as I would need several pages more room, I am sure that if you want you can find places in internet that list the changes. As a Tolkien adaptation my rate is 3 / 10 Bottomline is that while lotr is quite enjoyable and should be seen if this genre appeals to you it's not that special, when Jackson made the movie he tried to target as broad audience as possible and so had to seriously alter the books in order to make it more appealing. Visually quite stunning (the landscape) and with good actor's it's nice, althought nothing that would deserve it's present ranking...
10.0~My new favorite movie! Unclemoe77 Sign in Permalink This is my new favorite movie!I saw it twice and I loved it.The acting was great and the movie was a lot like the book.I just finished reading 'The two towers' and I can't wait to see the movie.A lot of people don't like the movie because it's really long and it isn't exactly like the book.It is really long but I don't think it ever gets boring. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I love this movie and I recommend it to anybody who liked the book.
10.0~Everything a movie should be, and more! Wookie_Herder Sign in Permalink Awesome story. I never read the book, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. Great cast, though it was tough to sometimes see past the Matrix in the Fairy King. Great acting! Unbelievably beautiful cinematography. Great for the whole family, maybe with the exception of children under 6.
10.0~Excellent Barquamz Sign in Permalink Beautiful movie with great effects, though it's sometimes a little unrealistic because they kill loads of monsters with their swords, bows and axes. Elves are according to the most sources highly magical orientated. I think that if Legolas would throw a fireball would have been better, but ofcourse it's according to a book. The elf-race is made beautiful just like the orc race. There are also humoristic pieces in the movie and I like that too. Not everybody survives and that abbandons the happy-ending stuff. Besides the open-ending is very good, because it makes this movie special. The mage fight between Gandalf and Saruman was funny to see, though it probably wasn't that hard to make, but what do I care about that? The plot is made very good and I really want that second part fast, alas is comes at christmas, so that takes quite a while.
10.0~The best movie of all time, and the only "10" I've ever voted! fiera121 Sign in Permalink This is the only movie I've ever given a vote of 10 to, and I'll probably never give another, unless The Two Towers and The Return of the King live up to its high standard, and I have no reason to think they won't. I am counting the moments until December for the next movie, and I have no idea how I'll get by until the final film, which will be over a year from now. Let me go on record as saying that I've been a fan of all Tolkien's work since the early 70's. I remember the animated film they tried to make of LOTR back in 1978, which was rather poorly done, in my opinion. At that time, I thought there would never be a decent film adaption of this trilogy, due mainly to its complexity. The fact that Peter Jackson has done so now, and done it without animation, is astounding indeed! For those of you who haven't yet seen it, click your way over to your favorite shopping web site and buy yourself a copy of this on DVD. Don't bother to rent it because you will undoubtedly want to watch it over and over. I promise... You will NOT be disappointed!
5.0~An Animated Guide to the Book kakugo2 Sign in Permalink I would confidently give this movie a rating of 5, being half a movie. I would have to say that it is by no means on par with the unique aspect the book of the Lord of the Rings has over other books, in other words it's a run of the mill reproduction. It fails to contend with other good reproductions however because it failed to keep consistency, and due to the fact that the film had not the time to unfold every tale, it became a blur of emotional actors and wild looking battle scenes. Much like Star Wars. It is obvious that the creation of the film was indeed a challenge and what not from the point of view of expenses etc. but this does not justify the conversion of what is quite an enjoyable richly written adventure novel into a Geek-Convention compliant film. I do believe that this film has indeed achieved this status, by the will of some ill-minded fool in production. The reason why I gave this movie 5 and not 0 is because it does in fact (beyond having no plot for those who have not read the book) depict the scenes described in the book in a most masterful manner. If anything, we could omit the entire cast and the music for the sole purpose of having an animated aid in reading the book, perhaps scenes could be used as illustrations. Beyond the visual excellence however, as stated previously, the film has lost all consistency of plot in it's evolution from the book. The characters' development is unstable, not wholly logical, and the emotions conveyed by the characters are also blurred to a great extent (experiencing every possible emotion in the one scene). In addition I cannot stress the frustration at the weakness of each character, as they moan over everything. To sum up, this movie has charm and all that pertain to a Hollywood reproduction flick, though it is a poor mark-up on the book. It is however interesting for one who has read the book (the scenes and such), and those of the challenged daytime movie viewers. Verdict, watch while reading the book, with no sound on and perhaps just cutting out the odd scene with the great single-emotion actors such as Orlando Bloom or Elijah Wood. Enjoy.
1.0~Brilliant? No. Sadly "Hollywood". leeloo67 Sign in Permalink This comment contains spoilers in that it directs you join me in seeing through the thin veil of Hollywood, and directs you inward to know what you really need and want instead of just explosions and effects... Seriously, this could have been one of the best movies ever made. That's right, I'm saying it is not. Even the casual movie fan (movie fan, not one of the mindless herd) has to admit that he/she can sense the fear in the producer's hearts behind every scene in this movie. They took a great risk in making an expensive trilogy like this, and they did not want to get the short end of the stick. The result is a compromise; a combination of good effects and good acting counterpointed with unnecessary cheeze-ball action and, well, bad acting. The result is a bizarre movie with brilliant scenes followed by terrible scenes. Everyone knows the plot summary, so I will skip it. Every cool scene of dialogue, every touching moment between old friends, and every time we felt the pull of evil, we were quickly (before any of the sheep dozed off), bombarded with a scene of the gang struggling along on their trek fighting creatures and getting blown up. Apparently, according to my friends, I was the only person who noticed the tragedy in the cave troll. After slowly being disappointed for several hours, I was quite pleased to see the action take an interesting turn like this. When the cave troll was led into the room, and had a collar on with a "leash" (a chain). Right away I assumed he was a trained beast, made ferocious by being beaten and tortured over time by his master, much like some people do with pit bull dogs, etc... When the troll was fatally shot through the mouth by the arrow, he had on his face a moment of unexpected (for me) realization of the wrongness of his actions. Perhaps this was brought on by his own severe pain and sense that his life would be over in a few moments. When I was ridiculed for this by my friends, I said perhaps I was just trying to read something interesting into this unnecessary action. Elijah Wood. I had trouble at first putting a description to his particular form of bad acting. I came up with the phrase, "blank acting", because he always has that one blank look on his face. You know the one, and the example that comes to mind is the look on his face in the scene where the ring "accidentally falls through the air and lands directly over his finger". A friend of mine found a review that had a better description than mine: "What he does is not acting, it is face-making, and anyone can do it". Is this a good movie? As much as "Gladiator" was a good movie, so is this one. I know the mass herd of movie go-ers return over and over again to see John Woo (and Ridley Scott) and whoever else who claim to have a "new" movie where they just blow stuff up in the same old predictable way, and the people that made this movie know it too. In order to preserve their bank accounts, they put the explosions in for the sheep to wow over. My plea for the future is this: If you are going to take a risk, take it and don't compromise. Make a great film. Don't let Hollywood or anyone shape all of your craft into one boring blob. If you can't do that, then you are not a real movie maker.
10.0~It's the best movie I have ever seen! RasberrySwirl Sign in Permalink Right after i saw it, i walked out of the movie theater simply amazed. it was my new favorite movie. everything about it is so incredible! the way the scenes were shot, the way it was directed, all the little details; smoke coming up from cottages in the Shire, Elves walking around in Rivendell. and every scene has an important meaning, unlike some movies. even in the beginning, when Gandalf comes riding in, it shows the special bond between him and Frodo. It's the best fantasy film ever made. if you havent seen this movie, you must not like watching superb movies! so my suggestion, even if you already have seen it, go watch it now!
10.0~Amazing in every sense of the world. Perfect Cast. Perfect film. 10/10 The_Fifth_Echo Sign in Permalink This was one of the best movies I have seen. Lets start how the movie looked, it looked incredibly far beyond any movie in 2001. I mean come on some of the views were astonoshing. It is kind of cheap to think of it because the movie only cost 94,000,000 dollars to create, I thought it was like 200-300 million. Anyways the best part of the film I think was when Gandalf encounters the dark underworld spirit Balrog. And then it takes Gandlaf. I mean that was perfect, it gave me goosebumps all over. Peter Jackson will always be known for his monumental success the Lord of the Rings trilogies. I congratulate him in making this perfect movie, he deserves all of the Oscars he won. Definitely. 10/10 Amazing in every part of the movie.
10.0~Faithful telling of great story RNMorton Sign in Permalink One of the all-time great fantasy works comes to the screen in nearly-faithful fashion. For those of us who read the books, this is a very special treat. Special effects and music are flat-out awesome, acting is almost as good, particularly the characters of Gandalf, Aragorn and Frodo. Liv Tyler is also great in expanded Arwen role. A definite must-see.
10.0~Great movie, not much wrong with it foxdragon-14855 Sign in Permalink Overall this is a great movie. I'll start off with the bad. Some scenes with Aragorn and Arwen make me cringe just a little bit, but that's pretty much all I didn't like about the movie. The good: Lord of the Rings sets up an amazing world, and the plot is great too. The ending finished this movie perfectly and gets people ready for the next one. The soundtrack is amazing, and the movie contains some very famous lines such as Gandalf's "You Shall Not Pass!" The characters in this movie are also very likable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes adventure and is creative. The movie is a bit long though, so people who aren't willing to sit and watch a movie for long should not watch this movie.
10.0~I would have followed you, my Brother... my Captain... my King. raphael_df12 Sign in Permalink And there it was... The beginning of the most remarkable film/trilogy ever made, by an unexpected director called Peter Jackson, who introduced us the fantastic vision of Middle- Earth, discovered great new talents and showed how amazing New Zeeland can be. And for this, The Fellowship of the Ring, the first installment of this huge story begins with the introduction of the ring and its power to dominate who carries it. First of all let me say a few words about Sean Bean as Boromir. Perfect acting, he was the best for the role for sure. All that greed for the ring was well played by him. He died =\, I hated at the beginning, but I understand it was necessary, especially for the story about Faramir. Amazing scenarios, great visual effects, perfect cast, Ian as Gandalf made a huge legacy, Viggo as Aragorn a true heroic and Elijah well, he will always be Frodo from now on :D One of the best thing about this is movie is the story; J.R.R. Tolkien is brilliant, created a "real" world with all the creatures and places with their own dialog. Do you know anyone who adventured like this? I never! And Peter Jackson shaped Middle-Earth with heart and soul. Visual effects never overcome the story in this movie (but in many movies it does: a.k.a. Star Wars where nothing is scripted). I was Happy when introduced the hobbits, restless when Nagzuls were chasing the Hobbits and Arwen (ohhh, I love her :D), dazzling with Rivendel, breathless at Moria, almost crying with Gandalf's fall, surprised with the Argonaths, sad with the death of Boromir and Honored after watching the movie. This movie is giant, brilliant and beautiful. There are no others for comparison or beat Lord of the Rings, IF ever will be.
10.0~Epic, sweeping film-making at it's very best pyrocitor Sign in Permalink The Fellowship of the Ring When one begins to write one's sentiments regarding a movie such as Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic Lord of the Rings trilogy, the main problem isn't having difficulty finding things to remark upon - the main problem is knowing where to begin. The Fellowship of the Ring essentially redefined the term "quality", in its extraordinary ability to vastly succeed the already unreasonably high expectations of audiences and die-hard fans of the novels everywhere. It becomes difficult to avoid bias by painting the film with outlandish and likely unreasonable praises, but I must confess I could go on for literally pages pointing out how blown away I still am by virtually every aspect of this movie, the first, and in my opinion, strongest as a film of the trilogy. So I'll try to keep it concise - Jackson has truly brought the novels to life in a fashion one could never have imaged short of actually seeing it for themselves. The sets and appearance of Middle Earth are among the greatest ever created, an impeccable blend of CGI, constructed sets, and the already breathtaking landscapes of beautiful New Zealand. The beautiful cinematography brings this all to light again, in the best sense of the word - seldom does a movie look so, simply put, beautiful. The costumes and appearances of the various creatures and inhabitants of Middle Earth are once again, mind-blowing - some of the best and most convincing computer generated images are on display in these movies. This is all punctuated by Howard Shore's simply gorgeous and incredibly moving Oscar winning score. Acting is also simply nothing less than astounding, with every cast member not only seeming torn straight out of the pages of the novels, born to play their role, but also turning out pretty much flawless performances around the board. There are standouts of course, especially Sir Ian McKellan's now career defining turn as the warm yet incredibly wise and powerful wizard Gandalf, Viggo Mortenson's wonderful flawed yet noble hero Aragorn, Sean Bean's excellent and truly touching portrayal of the quintessential flawed male character Boromir, Elijah Wood as the good hearted lead character, the innocent hobbit Frodo Baggins, and Sean Aston as his faithful and loyal companion Samwise, and Christopher Lee as the corrupted and now evil wizard Saruman the White. Cate Blanchett is a huge scene-stealer, as the regal (and briefly chilling) elf queen Galadriel, while John Rhys-Davies is perfectly gruff and hilarious as cantankerous dwarf Gimli, and Liv Tyler is breathtakingly elegant as Arwen (and thankfully given more to do than simply stand around pining, as in the next two films). Then there is of course the absurdly underrated Andy Serkis' mind blowing portrayal of the creature Gollum. Though mainly seen in the next two films, Serkis already manages to make a powerful first impression with his 2 minutes or less of screen time. Again, it seems entirely fair to say the Lord of the Rings movies are among the greatest movies ever made, for their incredibly detailed attention to the details of Tolkien's novels, and their still surprising ability to exceed expectations in every possible way in film-making and storytelling terms. This is epic storytelling at its best - if you are among the very few who have yet to see these movies, strongly consider doing so - it will be well worth your while. -10/10
10.0~Amazing Sayiaman7@yahoo.com Sign in Permalink Oh my. This movie has to be of the greatest achievements in movie making. What is also amazing is how Peter Jackson will film the whole series. Despite some little details missing this movie got the essentials to make this a good movie. Overall 10/10.
1.0~A painful mutilation of the greatest piece of fantasy literature. geza-8 Sign in Permalink I am a big fan of Tolkien's books, but the movie doesn't do justice to them at all and actually is a major annoyance. The scenery and most of the personae are actually depicted very nicely, but as soon as acting and talking starts it becomes plain that the story has been cut, changed, dumbed down, and vulgarized to such a degree that nothing is left of Tolkien's masterpiece and what remains is just an over-length, fantasy film with a thin story and boring characters. The film has the subtlety of a sledgehammer, its fundamental assumptions seem to be: (1) if a danger is such that the heroes just might escape then it's no real danger and must be enlarged to ridiculous proportions. (2) Comic relief can only be achieved through slapstick of the crudest kind. (3) Battle scenes must last at least as long as it would take a five-year-old to read the corresponding passages backward in Chinese. Moreover, if they could be done without special effects they are bad and must be "enhanced". (4) A traitor must walk around with a sign saying "I am a traitor". The worst example for this lack of subtlety is that the Ring is handled much too often, too openly, and with too little care. This trivializes the sinister and threatening item and takes away much of the power of the story. The reckless exaggeration in the "action scenes" is equally awful. Case in point the "Gate of Moria"-scene, when the Watcher gives Frodo a ride in the merry-go-round until everyone had a chance to hack at him; the more restrained story in the book is much more effective IMHO. Similarly mutilated are the scenes: "Crossing of the Brandywine", "Cutting Cushions in Bree", "The Burning of the Riders" at Weathertop, "The Drowning of Sam Gamgee", "Wizards slug it out in Orthanc", and, of course, "They have a Cave Troll", and, really, all of Moria. The main hero, Frodo, gives the impression of a loser: all the scenes in which (in the book) he shows courage, wisdom, resolve are cut or changed. Worst i find this in the key scenes in the Barrow (cut) and at Weathertop. There is nothing in the film giving any hint why Frodo might be "the best Hobbit in the Shire". Due to the many cut or twisted scenes, more than half of the characters have little resemblance to the ones in Tolkien's LotR: Frodo is a loser, Merry and Pippin are idiots until they suddenly turn out to be warrior princes, Elrond appears to be permanently pissed off -- as if everything "... stinks!", Strider is just another warrior hero (his being a loremaster, a healer, the "greatest traveller of our time" etc. does not show), Galadriel and Lorien is done so badly that i wish it would have been cut completely ("more fair than thought of mortal men" is a tall order, but Jackson does not even manage "fair"). Only Gandalf, Bilbo, and Saruman are rendered more or less well. I could go on, nearly every scene has gone wrong. Nothing of the depth of Tolkien's vision, the attention he paid to details (not only visual but to fine-tuning the development of the main characters) or the poetry in his creation is conveyed. What remains of the story is not told in a very coherent or convincing fashion, neither the acting nor the special effects are remarkable. All in all, a complete and utter failure to turn a great book into a movie.
10.0~and Tolkien thought no one could do it Moon_and_Boot Sign in Permalink There are few three plus hour movies that are actually worth watching, needless to say multiple times. This is definitely one of them. The scenery is amazing. The world is really alive. The acting is great, but no actors steal the limelite from the story. Tolkien is the real star in this one, and Peter Jackson behind him. Full respect and credit goes to these two men, which is how film adaptions of books should be. I think Tolkien would be surprised.
10.0~Better than Godfather if you like epic tales of pith and power. sempergumby Sign in Permalink If you enjoy superior acting (and by acting I mean portraying a fictional character, you can't play a "realistic" elf or wizard since they do not exist). If you enjoy vast breathtaking vistas combined with moving dialog against the backdrop of classic good versus evil. If you like to see good/evil in various forms from subtle influences all the way to awesome movers and shakers. If you like a good laugh followed by INTENSE BATTLES. If you like to fly with eagles, ride horse back chased by black riders, battle orcs, goblins, a troll (which by the way is much more animated than Harry Potter's troll--who was knocked unconscious with his own club, SPOILER:the troll in FOTR takes several arrows to the head, numerous stab wounds and keeps fighting the entire party for an extended period of time), and other creatures. If you desire to commune with your inner child. Then Fellowship of the Ring is unflagging in its delivery. This movie is every young man's fantasy come true. Ten years ago we discussed the possibility of making LOTR into a movie on the Tolkien newsgroup and the biggest fear was the inability to bring the glorious tale from the imagination to the screen. Well Peter Jackson has certainly done a terrific job. After watching FOTR there was nothing I would change, unlike the feeling leaving Episode I. Lucas could learn a lot from Jackson about making an Epic in this day and age. Episode I had plenty of terrific scenes, along with plenty of ho hum scenes. There wasn't a scene in FoTR that was ho hum. NOW TO THE CONTROVERSY: This controversy about whether FoTR is the best movie of all time will continue. One good indicator is the number of those seeing the movie who give it a 10. More than 28K and growing, compared with the 25K who give Godfather a 10. Simple math, more people give FoTR a 10 than any other movie (ok so really Star Wars has more 10's with a lower overall percentage). My point is that those who say LOTR is not a contender for the top spot are underestimating its power and influence in the movie industry. What makes a movie the number one movie of all time is that more people think it is the best, not that critics who seem to contradict the majority of movie goers more often than not, like the film. Critics seem to like a certain kind of movie (can you say chick flick) and the general public appears to like action/fiction films, with the exception of Titanic. If you didn't like LOTR don't tell everyone it was a bad film because it really was a unique experience. Rather say you don't like intense films with terrific action, special FX and talented actors playing fictional characters.
1.0~The worst movie hype ever maxwellsham Sign in Permalink This was a disaster. One of the least entertaining pieces of trash I've ever seen. I wish I could have given it a 0 instead of a glorifying 1 out of 10. There is nothing interesting, original, clever, amazing, beautiful or even nice throughout its nearly 3 hour duration. Thank goodness I did not have to pay for the ticket. Titanic was bad this was worse.
10.0~Excellent epic adventure. Takethispunch Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a 2001 epic high fantasy film directed by Peter Jackson based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954–1955). It is the first instalment in The Lord of the Rings series, and was followed by The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003), based on the second and third volumes of The Lord of the Rings. Set in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron (Sala Baker), who is seeking the One Ring. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood). The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions who form the Fellowship of the Ring begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed.
10.0~Tolkein is Hobbit-forming..... Guy Chapman Sign in Permalink It has been said that if, as a fourteen-year-old boy, you don't think The Lord Of The Rings is the best book ever written, there is something wrong with you. And if, as an adult, you still think The Lord Of The Rings is the best book ever written, there is something wrong with you too. This film remedies some of the worst faults of the book (like the implausible and interminable tale of Tom Bombadil) whilst adding few of its own. There are really two marvellous things about this work: first, that it makes accessible a story which is, to be charitable, demanding of its reader; and second, that it allows itself the time (three long films) to do the book justice. The result is a film which is more measured in its pace, and which takes more trouble to develop its characters, than the formulaic Hollywood studio products with which we have normally to content ourselves as viewers. Oh, and you can safely take your mother to see it: there is, for once, no gratuitous sex, no bad language, and no overplayed gore - and for that alone I would rank it in the top ten films of recent years.
9.0~Amazing!!!! condorf Sign in Permalink I LOVE this movie!!! I had never heard about it, when my husband told me "we're going to see The Lord Of The Rings"; I just thought "and what's that?". And I can't see it enough!!! I have the DVD normal version and special extended version, and I HAVE to watch it at least twice in a month. The pictures are great, the characters are GREAT, the story is the very BEST! It's just a pity that Boromir died, that makes me sad every time I watch this movie. I've seen the two others, too. And I just can say: best of the best. Of course, there're some mistakes, some goofs, but which movie doesn't have this? :-) I wish it could be like in this movie; it's really moving, to see how strong the friendship can be, how important it is to be there for each other, to know you can rely on someone... I don't know what else to say about this movie but: GREAAAATTTTT!!!!!
10.0~As good as any movie can get! a_true_american_idiot Sign in Permalink This movie keeps me glued to the television every time i watch it. For all fantasy lovers this movie is a must-see! You will not be disappointed one minute through this three hour movie. You will be begging to see the next movie. The whole cast in this movie was absolutely brilliant. It made you feel as though you were really in middle earth. I love this movie and it is dear to my heart. I've watched it a hundred times a swear. Yet i never seem to get sick of it. Peter Jackson could have never done a better job if he tried. He should be very proud and i know he made the author of all the lord of the rings books proud.
10.0~One of the best movies of all time strzinheaven2887 Sign in Permalink I am so glad to see that The Lord of the Rings has made #3 on the top 250 films. This is one of the best films that I have ever seen, I hadn't read any of the books before seeing this film so I was a bit confused but I still enjoyed myself. After seeing the film one time, I went and bought the trilogy, and so far have read The Fellowship from cover to cover, and I am currently reading The Two Tower. Then I went and saw LotR a second time and this time it seemed as if Middle Earth came alive. I was so pleased with the film. The characters were perfectly portrayed and the visual effect were great. But i think the most breath-taking element of this movie is the cinematography. I couldn't believe that the whole movie was filmed in just one country (New Zealand) However, March 24 was a bitter sweet night for me, and i think many of the LotR readers will agree with me. I was pleased about all the awards it won (visual effects, musical score, make-up, and cinematography) but i was displeased about the academys choice for best picture. But hey there are two more movies yet to be released and I bet they will be as great as the first one. But anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet i advise to see it, you will enjoy it and the movie has a little bit of something many people will like. Well, see the movie and enjoy it!
10.0~Evocative, visually rich and true to Tolkien brig0027 Sign in Permalink I am a HUGE fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I have probably read the books 6 or 7 times, cover to cover. I read it aloud to my children, all 1000+ pages, and I have a cat named Gandalf, the Mostly Gray. I find Peter Jackson's LoTR film rich, evocative, and true to Tolkein. It has gotten better each time I have seen it--which is maybe 10 times now. How many films can handle that level of scrutiny? The script, written by people who obviously love the books, takes a brilliantly conceived but often clumsily written fantasy-saga and transforms it a real world with real people and real feelings! I have been impressed by the clarity of the script, the decisions the writers made to compress a complex epic into a 3 hour movie, and by how the writers managed to get at the emotional heart of scenes. Though I was a bit sad that the Tom Bombadil interlude and the barrow wights had to be cut, that was too bad. Despite the many times that I have read the book, some of the characters and scenes were hazy to me, and P. Jackson has made them vivid and true. If I have a criticism, it's that they go overboard on the special effects--like the gazillion ooze-y orcs in Moria, the dripping-with-blood Nazgul or the variably sized cave troll. Could Sauron have more big sharp metal angles??? But the acting is exceptional: Ian McKellan as Gandalf is the moral center of the film, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian Holm are convincing as noble Frodo, wise Sam and jolly Bilbo, Viggo Mortensen is a manly Aragorn, and Orlando Bloom is a totally persuasive warrior wood-elf. I thought Sean Bean's Boromir was complex, troubled and nuanced portrayal. A film adaptation of Tolkein deserves the best of everything: best acting, best sets, best props, best costumes, best music, best script, best directing, best fighting, best effects, and I believe this film has given it the best of the best. I have to admit I am astonished by those viewers who complain that the Aragorn and Arwen romance wasn't in the book. !!!! It must be a guy thing to miss a major plot line if it doesn't involve swords. Go back, re-read. Tolkein was big on the whole myth-saga thing, and an Englishman to boot, so relationships are deep and feelings suppressed, but it's all there. For me, the fact that the writers understood and brought it out makes me giddy: We can trust these people. We are in the hands of Masters! I can't wait for December 18.
10.0~Best film series you will ever watch. AdrianNN28 Sign in Permalink Best film series you will ever watch. This review applies to all three movies. I love this movie. Great storyline, amazing effects, good actors, great battles and fights, a lot of suspense, great acting and a truly breath-taking soundtrack. Overall, an amazing journey that you will enjoy it every minute. The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and stunning landscapes. Peter Jackson brought to life the vision of The Lord of The Rings to the big screen, not a single thing he could have made it better. I don't know how to describe any better this movie, is truly one of the best film ever made, full of magic, stories, love and battle.
10.0~Spectacular!!!! Ronin-58 Sign in Permalink I hadn't read the books since I was a teenager in the late 70s and what I remembered of the story was not much. But, the movie brought it all back. It was everything that I had pictured in my mind's eye 25 years ago. Casting was absolutely perfect and while I was worried that special effects would overwhelm the film, they were discrete, and subtle enough to go relatively un-noticed. The one complaint I have is with the DVD version where the sound is uneven; music too loud and dialogue too soft. For the best effect catch it on the big screen. Hopefully, they will correct this for the Director's cut. If you haven't seen it yet, go!
1.0~Boring and awful...just like the book. Ronin1272 Sign in Permalink This film was a snore. A boring and slow movie moving at a snails pace. The special effects were ok at best. Avoid this, or if you must, rent it. The actors were ok, except for Frodo. They should have left this idea alone, the book was just as boring.
10.0~Excellent preppy-3 Sign in Permalink Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on. All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie. The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused. I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard. The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real. All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking. The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by. The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way. With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan. But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating). It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids. Still, it's the best film of 2001. SEE IT!!!!
1.0~Is there something I missed.... Anaisnine Sign in Permalink Ok..b4 we get into this let me preface by saying I'm a HUGE fantasy fan. As a child I read loads of mythology and as I got older I got into fantasy novels, and yes, I even enjoy a good sword and sorcery flick. When I first saw the trailer for LOTR a year ago my jaw hit the floor. I coulndt not WAIT to see this movie...and so a year passed. I came to the theater wanting to be swept away into the majesty that is Tolkein...I came wanting to be blown away and fall irredeemably in love with the film. Sigh...maybe I wanted too much. Now the film is not bad, not bad at all..in fact in all honesty I can say that it is prob among the top 5 films released this year(which may not m,ean much considering what came out this year) Yet..I did not come away with a magical feeling..that warm feeling inside when u know u have had a truly good movie experience. I came away a bit fatigued(3 hrs is 3 hrs) and midly dissapointed. The good: overall, I'd say the cast is very good. Id aways thought Viggo was a good actor and he finally got a role he could shine in. Ian Mckellar was great as a somewhat vulnerable Gandolph and Ian Holm was delicious as Bilbo...he made a hobbit actually seem creepy. And the guy who played Samwise(the boy from the goonies) was actually good as well.Even Liv Tyler was impressive(though tolkein purists will claim she had no business in the book) and of course Ms. Blanchett did her usual best(with a narroly defined role). The bad: the script- I just felt( and still do) that if you have read the books( and mr.jackson was admitedlly a HUGE Tolkein buff) you got alot more out of the movie. I think maybe he assumed a prior knowledge and relationship w/ the characters cuz there was very little development of the characters and their relationships to each other. Thats why when a certain cast member died,..I really felt everyone was taking it a bit too hard on screen, lol. Secondly, the dialogue could be on the cheesy side. Now, I know its Tolkein..but at least let me fall in love with the characters b4 u get all cheesy and sentimental on me...at least the two bumbling hobbits were there for a bit of comic releif. CGI- was it just me, or was the rendering horrible? Cgi is always noticeable even if done well..but some scenes were just embarassingly bad. Also, the cinematography was not very crisp..I felt like I was watching the movie thru a haze the whole time. Now granted..the technical failings of the movie dont really bear much on how much I enjoy the plot..but still, for all the money spent..I dunno, I would have thought at least the cinematography would be good. pacing: point blank...when the characters weretn running for their lives..it dragged. Since the script failed to get me involved with the characters, I just was blase at best about any reflections they may have . This was especially apparent at the initial 'meeting of the fellowship' scene. Suddenly there are all these characters that have no discernable relationship whatsoever...yet, they all weep like babies when that certain cast member died...didnt make much sense to me. Now dont get me wrong...there were a few poignant moments( i liked the scene with sam at the end..touching....and Sean bean's charac too..touching) but to me..it was all disjointed...very little flow..I could never really sink my teeth into the film. So, instead of being ravenous for the next installement when the film finally ended..I left like 'well..maybe the next one will be better'. Now, I will say, it was alot better than Phantom Menace..I was never just bored outright..but for all the hype and commotion..I was underwhelmed. Dont let fantasy/tolkein groupies lead u astry, its a good film..but not a great film and nowhere near as good as the first Star Wars trilogy. Sigh...everywhere that I go I read reviews of this nature..so much so that next week I shall see the film again and see if therw was somenthing I missed the first time-A.N.
10.0~Excellent stuch Sign in Permalink Yesterday, I received this film on DVD. I had already seen it four times however at the cinema. I was not disappointed, and I did not expect to be. Having seen programs previewing the film, I saw how much Peter Jackson loved the books and also how much some of the actors loved them also. And so if people loved the stories so much, they would not dare make a trilogy of films without making them top-notch. I have spoken to very few people who have not liked this film. Most of them claiming it was too long or it had boring bits. There were no 'boring' bits in this masterpiece. I think what they were referring to were the not-action parts i.e. character building. The acting, from everyone is of a very high standard and his extremely believable. Especially that of Elijah Wood as Frodo. The overall appearance of Middle-Earth and it's people was amazing. Every conceivable detail was taken into account by Jackson and his team. Nothing was out of place. Even the extras had perfect costumes. The SFX are second to none. And at many points it was hard to tell what was real and what was not. Some people would also claim that the film is too long. The film HAD to be long, I would've complained if the film had been shorter than it was. Three hours was essential to get as much of the story in as possible (I would, however, have liked to have seen Tom Bombadil) and to build up the characters for what is going to happen to them. From start to finish this is excellent. I am expectantly waiting to see The Two Towers, which, from knowledge from the book. Should be even better than the first. 9/10
10.0~A "must see" movie based on a "must read" book domar Sign in Permalink This movie is the best movie ever! The book it self is a superb book, but what about the film. The problems directors are facing making a movie of a book is to please the people who has read the book before viewing the movie. The movie must cover the books full story, and the places and people in the film must be within the descriptions from the wrighter and the imaginations of the readers. If the movie for fill this you should have a superb movie. The director has created wonders. If we look at this movie you will see that he has done just that. The art and places in this movie is wonderful. This movie is really worth watching. And those who don't like it, where is your imaginations?
10.0~I was wrong. SupJessica Sign in Permalink I've never read the books, and when people started talking about The Lord of The Rings movie, I wondered what the big deal was. I saw the previews, and read some reviews, but I just didn't care to see it. A silly fantasy film with wizards and small people with hairy feet? What was that about? Maybe if I was 5 I'd want to see it. So I didn't see it.. months later, it comes out on DVD, my friend buys it and lets me borrow it. So after about a week, I was bored so I said, what the hell, I'll check it out. I was wrong, I should have seen the movie when it came out. I know where I'll be this December, and next December. The Lord of The Rings book box set is in the mail and on its way to my house. I'll be buying my own copy of the DVD tomorrow and I'll buy the special extended edition DVD this November. This movie was awesome, the story, the action, the effects, everything was amazing, especially the scenery. New Zealand is beautiful, I will have to go there someday. The acting was great, the characters seemed real, not just actors playing a part. Great movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it! Even if you haven't read the book, it's amazing.
10.0~JUST AMAZING! TeresaCandelario Sign in Permalink All I would like to say about this movie is "Wow!". It was amazing and I truly cannot wait to see the other two. The funny thing is I never read the book or knew the details before I saw it. Now, I want to buy everything that has anything to do with Tolkien. It was an epic journey. The movie really touched me, I felt somehow "connected" to the characters which is something that I personally have never experienced in watching a movie. Just AMAZING!
10.0~A Masterpiece StreepFan126 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings triliogy is already going down in cinema history as one of the best movie series ever filmed. I'm glad I was privilaged enough to see it on the big screen. Now I have not read the book yet, so I can not make a call as to how faithful it was to the novel. But, in my opinion, it is one of the best movies of all time.
1.0~Are you kidding me? MotownMan Sign in Permalink Okay, first let me say that I did NOT read the trilogy, so I had very little background in the world of Middle Earth. That being said, I am usually a HUGE science fiction/adventure/fantasy fan and I LOVE Star Wars, Star Trek, The Matrix, X-Men, etc... so I had every reason to expect that I would love this too. However, this movie was basically three hours of feeling how hard my seat was on my ass! It seems that at least 30 minutes of camera time was spent on Elijah Wood's dumbfounded and bewildered expression as he stared blankly into space or at his hand as he held the ring. Furthermore, what's the deal with all of these characters? I mean, you have Frodo and Sam (two hobbits), two other random hobbits whose names are hardly mentioned and are only put in for comic relief, Gandorf (spelling?) the wizard whose magic is mostly useless since he runs and cowers just like the hobbits; blonde- haired elf boy (another one without a name) who shoots arrows and seems to have spidey-senses; and bearded dwarf/troll man (another nameless creature) who seems motivated by killing and battle (the Klingon of the group). Then you have two apparent humans, one of which is a "ranger" (whatever that means) whose ancestor cut the hand (with the ring) off the evil dark lord (or whatever) thousands of years ago, and the other random human who doesn't seem to have a name, but he really seems to want the ring. Then there's Agent Smith from the Matrix ("Human beings are like a disease") who plays a 3000 year old elf who almost destroyed the ring, and his ?daughter/relative female elf (Liv Tyler) who is basically inserted to add a pretty female face to a completely male cast. What the hell is all of this nonsense? Okay, now while I'm ranting and raving (sorry, still upset about my sore ass from sitting for 3 hours), who were those faceless guys in black robes who were chasing the hobbits early in the movie and what happened to them? At some point in the movie, the bad guys turned from them into orcs for no apparent reason. And who was the old wizard who used to be friends with Gandorf, but then turned to the dark side? Is he like Darth Vader? What does he hope to gain from all of this? Finally, other than turning you invisible and putting you in some scary special effects dimension, what exactly does the ring do for its bearer?? Oh yeah, it made Bilbo look a little younger than he was. And I guess it makes you feel good, otherwise he wouldn't have wanted it back so badly. Ughhhhh, confusion, chaos, nameless characters (and named characters I can't remember/pronounce/spell), many VERY ANNOYING shots of Elijah Wood's stupid emotionless expression holding his ring, and ... more confusion and chaos. Now, this movie gets 9.5 out of 10 on IMDB?!?!? I give it 3 out of 10 (but I voted for 1 out of 10, just to help bring the average down to where it should be). I'll need to be stoned or drunk before I consider seeing a sequel to this nonsense! Very disappointing!

10.0~The coverage of the entire storyline sharma-shanky88 Sign in Permalink I had read the book The Lord of The Rings prior to watching the movie and well, all I can say is, I was simply mesmerized by the story-line, but most books don't really make amazing movies experience tells, hence when I first watched LOTR - The Fellowship of The Ring, quite frankly I wasn't expecting much and I actually had half a mind to even watch it. The rest they say is history and quite frankly Peter Jackson did a great job with the movie by trying to keep as much of the story he could, given the time constraints and not once did it ever get boring even Bilbo celebrating his birthday wasn't omitted I have watched several directors and production houses simply eliminating parts of a movie they don't consider important, but Jackson, kudos to you. Great movie, must watch, A Fantasy Relic.
10.0~If you like the book you will love the movie sparkd Sign in Permalink This is one of the best transcripts of a book in to a movie that I have ever seen. It tells the story of the book in such a detail that you would have never have thought possible, as a movie in general I think it is quite good but there are better movie's. In short if you like the book you will love the movie
10.0~Nothing But Praise! brian_warnecke Sign in Permalink 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring', is one of the best! A total mind captivating experience! It has the qualities to still be enjoyable 30 to 50 years from now. I got the same sensations from this film as I did when I saw 'Star Wars: A New Hope' on opening day. This to me, is what makes the movie going experience. To take a journey to another time, another land and enjoy the company of some lovable characters you feel you have known all your life. You can't help but to be pulled into the storyline. Paced well, great direction, superb special effects and terrific storytelling. This movie will be an all time classic and is a must see on anybodies list!
10.0~Great return to the fantasy genre Dieghoul Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson's magnum opus is one of the movies that marked the 2000's and introduced the audience again to the fantasy genre. Before LOTR fantasy movies weren't taken serious enough and they were classified as a nerd or geek type of genre, but Peter Jackson knew how to kept all audiences entertained and dazzled by the beauty and richness of his settings, his rich characters and most importantly the relationships they form within the journey. I was around 12 years of age when this movie came out, and it ignited in me the feeling that movies were truly where the magic happened and the best place you can think of for daydreaming.
10.0~Of all the movies I have seen, this one will hold a special place in my heart forever. nca-2 Sign in Permalink I will not go into lengthy details about plot, nor will I bore you to tears with ranting about the beautiful scenery or the skilled actors. It's enough to say the actors were perfect in their roles, Gandalf being the most perfect of them all. No movie have even brought tears to my eyes only minutes after it begun showing. No movie, except LOTR:FOTR of course. I've read the books countless of times and I know pages and pages by heart. When I first layed eyes on Hobbiton and The Shire I knew what I saw, it needed no explanation. I immediately knew the characters, even before they were introduced because Gimli looked and moved like Gimli, Legolas was exactly as he's depicted in the book and so on. That's just one of the things that makes this movie so great. After seeing the extended version, I must say: It should have been 3.5 hours long. 3 wasn't enough. But I'm a die-hard fan, if they had released 3.5 hours I am sure I would have said I wanted 4. Because that's how much I love this movie.
3.0~A great disappointment Zortog Sign in Permalink I seem to be almost alone in not liking this movie... I found it generally lacking the depth of the book - not surprising, as it would be quite impossible to condense the immense amount of material in the book to a movie, however long. However, I entered it fully expecting things to change. Unfortunately, I just found a rather poorly done movie. Some aspects were wonderful, yes. The visuals were spot-on, for the most part. The effects were stunning (with a few exceptions...). But the script... oh, the script! My biggest problem was the general simplification of things. The incredible mystery of the book, the sense that what starts out as a simple adventure is actually a vastly larger story is quite lacking. They simply gave away too much - the information in the voiceover at the beginning for example, was a complete waste of time: why give away all of that at the beginning? Why not show things from the hobbits point of view? "A silly fellow went off on an adventure, and brought back treasure, among which was a ring!" And then start revealing more and more of the story gradually - this could be easily done with explanations by Gandalf and Elrond, exactly as it was in the book. Likewise, other "mysterious" aspects were just dropped - showing Gandalf and Saruman's battle was a fine example. A much better way of doing this would be to simply have the hobbits arrive at the Prancing Pony and not find Gandalf! As it is, the audience knew exactly what was happening right at the start, ruining the suspense.. In general, a vast story, full of intrigue and a great sense of things being larger than just the small part the characters play was reduced to a jolly adventure story. Even this adventure was poorly executed - the mood of the most poignant moments was ruined by falling back on cheesy cliches and feeble attempts at humour.. In Moria, for example, right before Gandalf's 'death', the terrible "dwarf-tossing" joke. Sure, it's silly.. but it makes a part of the story that could have been genuinely terrifying a complete spoof! Ruins the mood entirely.. Likewise, the pathetic battle scene antics: first of all, shake the camera violently whenever there's any action, and then use all the cliches you can: the bit where one of the hobbits looks to the left, sees the monster, then looks to the right and sees the monster. Then back to the left: no monster! And he relaxes. Then the monster jumps out from the right again! Oh eek. Finally, big parts of the story just didn't make much sense without the background present in the book: the trip to the mountains, for example, was a complete waste of time. It would have been better to just cut that, and leave more time to develop some of the other bits that were severely lacking - the entire time spent in lothlorien was quite useless as presented. "Wicked elf witch"? If it's going to be simplified that much, (and I acknowledge that it's necessary in a movie adaptation, and expect it!) why not rearrange it in a way that at least makes sense? Half the actions in the movie seemed to be done simply because it was a way to have a jolly adventure, rather than because there was actually any reason to do it. Anyway... It was a let down. Luckily, I managed to avoid the hype, and didn't get my hopes up at all. But it was much worse than I expected. I'm amazed that I seem to be one of the few that thought this way...
10.0~Brilliant and peerless marcusedenellis Sign in Permalink If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD (Extended Version) and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two distinct categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the "yes, I have read the books" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as "they left out too much", "its not what I imagined" or "Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich". Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve. Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil.
10.0~This movie changed cinema ninjachewit Sign in Permalink The visuals, the dialogue, the action, the tension, everything that a good adventure movie has can be found here. And a good adventure movie seeps into the realm/genre of Thrillers, because the tension at some parts is so gripping that you honestly feel like you're suddenly watching a Thriller. This movie is truly a piece of art.
1.0~The number one movie of all time? Give me a break! richsh Sign in Permalink When I saw that this movie had instantly achieved the 'number one movie of all time' ranking on the Internet Movie Database, I rushed to see it. While the movie is beautifully made, it is NOT the best movie of all time. It's too long and is really nothing more than a group of characters going from point A to point B while having to survive attacks from various creatures along with having to deal with various environmental elements. I found nothing really compelling about the plot. I found myself glancing at my wrist watch on more than one occasion. I believe that the near perfect score this film achieved on the IMDB was a result of all the role playing geeks who saw this movie during the opening week and gave it a "10". I'd say that it is truly more of a 7.5 - 8.0.
10.0~Excellent daughterjudy2002 Sign in Permalink I know that the movie didn't cover EVERYTHING in the book, but neither did Harry Potter, and both are excellent movies. I've seen other movies from books that are just plain...well crap. This movie is one of the best I've seen all year.
10.0~Best Movie FireBird04 Sign in Permalink This has to be one of the best movies ever. Everything about it is great. The acting, directing, screenplay, action, everything. The opening sequence has to be one of the best action sequences ever. If Moulin Rouge beats this for Best Picture, I will be MAD!
10.0~Perhaps the best movie ever. Wrestlord1 Sign in Permalink Maybe I'm a little biased, I love J.R.R. Tolkien, I loved the Lord Of The Rings Books, I've read them several times, and going into this movie I had HIGH expectations. I seriously expected a movie unlike any other, that was beautiful, and poetic, and a true work of art, a motion picture masterpiece if you will...I wasn't disappointed. I went opening day twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything and I have since seen the movie almost 30 times, I love this movie. It isn't exactly like the book, it is, however, Peter Jackson's vision of Middle Earth, and it is a great vision indeed. Hobbiton, Rivendale, The Mines Of Moria, they are all beautiful, Ian McKellan is a perfect Gandaulf, in fact the whole cast is amazing, this is what a movie should be. In my opinion, this IS the greatest film ever made, regardless of what anyone says...I am eagerly anticipating, The Two Towers in just a few months. "I find your lack of faith disturbing."
10.0~Why this film deserves to be No.1 akeightley Sign in Permalink Now I've heard a lot of people saying that this film is nothing more that another "fantasy" and once the hype dies down it will only be remembered as a mediocre "fantasy" film. Well first I'd like to point out that ALL films by definition are FANTASY, unless its is a documentary. Second, how could this film be called mediocre? Unless you were under the impression that all films of the same genre were of LoTR quality or better (just watch Harry Potter to see how that is not true), or prehaps you some how managed to mistake Harry Potter for LoTR. Now why, you may ask do I believe that LoTR should be No.1. Well, in how long has there been a film that can engross people from the ages 6-80+, male & female alike? Not in a long time I would say. As it has the special effects & action we now expect in "blockbuster" film, but also it has "heart". When I say it heart I mean it has done more than just dazzle you into thinging you have seen a good film, by making the special effects the main star for the film. In LoTR, while the special effects are amazing to say the least, they don't steal the show from the main characters of the story. Now other films have this quality, The Godfather & Shawshank Redemption to name a few. But until now no other film has come as close as LoTR to have a successful marriage of the two. And there for can appeal to a wider segment of population without the feeling it is playing to the lowest common denominator. Well this is my reason for saying LoTR should be the number 1 film, and if not Fellowship alone then just wait for the complete LoRT trilogy :-) Also this film improves at least X10 on the second viewing.
5.0~People just like to attack what they don't understand don't they? brokendeck Sign in Permalink It's painfully obvious to me that those who gave this movie 1/10 or 2/10 did it solely for the purpose of trying to knock it down a few notches on the top 250 list in order to bolster their own favorite movie. They didn't even bother to correct their spelling mistakes. Many people also seem to miss the point that Tolkien always meant for his book to be published all at once. It was never meant to be a trilogy. That was the fault of the publisher. They did not wish to publish such a huge volume all at once and therefore split it up into three separate parts. The same was applied to Peter Jackson's movie version of Tolkien's epic. So many people have written that they are confused about the movie yet do not bother to ask themselves why. Why are they confused about the movie? (Yes I consider all 3 movies to be ONE movie) It's because they fail to understand it's complexity and lash out in frustration and anger. But don't worry. These same people may be happier with other movies. God-awful movies which I won't mention. Wait, maybe I will >:) All the Godfather movies, Star Wars Episodes 1, 2, 3, 6, All the Star Trek movies except Wrath of Khan, The Passion of the Christ, Ordinary People (which amazingly actually won an Oscar for best Picture) Titanic (which is astoundingly still on IMDb's top 250 list), Braveheart, ugh the list goes on. Fellowship of the Ring should not be considered as a movie on it's own. It is only PART OF A MOVIE. That being said, one of the confusing issues may be solved. But then again, given people's seemingly in-born tendency to bicker amongst themselves, we haven't seen the last of this "debate".
10.0~Startling iron_teacher Sign in Permalink Millions of people who have enjoyed, like me, the remarkable trilogy by Tolkien were certainly apprehensive about this film. Folks, fear no more. The archetype characters and themes in the books resonate clearly and powerfully through this film. The cinematography and the score, the acting and the pacing, all combine to bring this story to breathtaking, startling life. This is possibly the closest to perfect any film has ever come. The Fellowship of the Ring is action, comedy, drama, tragedy, all rolled into a magnificent single package that absolutely does not seem to last three hours. I wanted more. If you have not seen this movie, stop dithering and rent it. Try to find a friend with a big screen TV and a real home-theater system in order to be able to experience this on the level it should be. Glorious film-making. My hat goes off to Peter Jackson for his daring, and also to Ian McKellan: you deserved that Oscar. 10 stars of 10
10.0~WOW! WOW! WOW! kurosawa-1 Sign in Permalink Wow! Lord of the Rings is a wonderful film and a future classic. Unlike many of todays blockbusters (Tomb Raider or Pearl Harbour for example), Lord of the Rings doesn't draw it's power from stunning special effects and beautiful art direction, but rather from the skill and humanity of the lead actors. Incidentally, the film boasts an exceptionally strong cast, but it's Ian McKellen (Gandalf the grey) who stands out amongst the rest. To even conceive a cinematic version of Lord of the Rings trilogy is daunting, not only because it's storytelling on a very grand scale (and definitely not budget friendly!!) but also because Tolkien never fathomed his book as a motion picture and unintentionally made it very difficult to translate his work to the big screen by breaking many of the rules of film making. However, with only a few minor changes Peter Jackson manages to pull a really spectacular film out of his hat. And for this, he is ignored at the Oscars. Sickening really. The members of the Academy are bunch of cowards, they probably prefered Lord of the Rings over a Beautiful Mind, but as it's a fantasy film felt embarrassed about voting for it. I wholly recommend anyone - not just Tolkien fans - to see this move at least three times. Well worth it!
10.0~A Beautiful Triumph for Peter Jackson HersheyAddict314 Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings. The first time I saw those letters appear on a trailer while watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (in May), I thought it was the most ridiculous title for a movie. The trailer was disgusting-I thought the strange-haired little 'people' (later known as hobbits) were ugly and esoteric. Vaguely, I remember whispering to my best friend at the time, 'Ew...who's going to see THAT? What kind of freak would see a movie with such UGLY people??' Little did I know, I would become obsessed with this 'lurid' movie. About 7 months later, the tickets to 'A Beautiful Mind' were sold out, so I opted to go for LOTR, because nothing else seemed worth my $5.50. The movie astonished me right from the first scene, with the thousands of realistic warriors and beautiful scenery, I was immediately hooked. Throughout the movie, I don't think I blinked once. The characters, the Elvish language, the setting, everything intruiged me. It was artistically and originally beautiful, not at all what I expected. I didn't even notice 3 hours passing by before it ended and I sat dumbstruck in the theater for a while, listening to Enya vocalize 'May It Be.' I walked out of the theater like I walked into a new world. 6 more times I saw the Lord of the Rings. I have two copies of the soundtrack (which is also fabulous) and am counting the days until the Two Towers. For anybody who has not seen this incredible movie, I suggest that you run to the nearest Blockbusters and rent it on August 6th, when it'll be released on DVD and VHS. It's almost essential to life. The actors-Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen-beautifully and acurately protrayed the characters of J.R.R. Tolkien's historic masterpiece, and Peter Jackson stayed true to the novel. I've read the books and became deeply interested in things I never have before, and have looked at things just a bit differently in this world. I highly recommend the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings, to anybody at any age anytime. It is my favorite movie, and I'm not surprised that over 60,000 others voted this movie as worthy of #3 on the spot of the top 250 movies of all time.
10.0~Simply Perfect..... itsruf Sign in Permalink Need I say more? Those who say LOTR lacks originality must be around 14 years old, and not realize that the story was written over 50 years ago. LOTR set the stage for EVERY fantasy (and some sci-fi) movie, show, story, book and role-playing game EVER made. THOSE stories (as good as some may be) are the one's who lack originality.
10.0~New Zealand IS Middle Earth timberlax Sign in Permalink First of all, I read only about 1/3 of he trilogy (the first book, being the Fellowship of the Ring) before I saw the movie. It turned out to be extremely, beautifully cinematographed and acted out. I saw it 5 times and still can't get enough. The story is the same one with the exception of having some detail left out, which was not by any chance a mistake I would say. It helped the movie move along faster. Otherwise it could've been a bit too long, and was cut down mostly due to time. Now, for those who hate the movie completely, and give ABSOLUTELY NO CREDIT to its triumph without any reasonable evidence really are the ones who don't respect movies in the way they should be. (You all have the right to an opinion, however) Some of you say that the effects "sucked" and were the "typical Hollywood big-budget made for the money". Well, Hollywood itself was halfway around the world from where Peter Jackson was making this wonderful film. So I don't think it influenced him much. Now about the effects. Some of you who criticize them don't mentioned which ones, so therefore it could be assumed all of them do. Now if you say that, then basically you are saying that the ones in Star Wars suck as well and the ones in the Matrix and the ones in Terminator 2 because they were all breakthroughs like this movie. Same goes for acting. Those that say the acting was terrible without saying exactly who (and even if you did) also say that EVERY actor in the movie didn't do good. With acting at that level, people like Tom Hanks, Gene Hackman and Robert deNiro (my favorites) would also seem horrible to you pessimists. I personally found every actor in the movie doing the best they have ever done than before. And for those of you who hated the movie WITHOUT EVEN READING THE BOOK AND HAVING HIGH EXPECTATIONS should change your strategy in watching book-adapted movies. Peter Jackson did not want to do a direct book-to-screen translation (he mentioned it to be impossible in one of his interviews) but rather an "interpretation" where the same idea of the original is taken and translated into the world of cinema (with slight modifications due to the fact that literature =/= cinema) for the readers and non-readers to follow the story. If PJ had left in Tom Bombadil then I am sure that those who have not read the book would get completely off track of the story and would hate the movie even more. And, people, I am sure that Jackson has read the book, like most of you, 10 times in his lifetime. For who else would undertake such a project and put so much effort into it? Certainly not Spielberg, or McTiernan or Cameron since they seem to make Hollywood flicks that show their taste in movies, which don't seem to be very fictinous (except maybe for Terminator). I could be very sure about Danny Boyle's "changes", director of The Beach, since he said in the director's commentary that he did not want to base the movie on the book but rather take the idea and use it efficiently. Those of you saying the movie was LONG, well if it was short (unlike the book) you'd then be saying that its too short and not enough was explained and that most of the book was cut out. Those that say that the people who voted 10 for this film were (quoting from some comments) "nothing more but ignorable 15-year-olds who just liked the effects and action". Well, I'm pretty much assured that most of those who voted for 10 in Star Wars were below the age of 20. In fact, that movie seems more "tengerish", but I also loved it, though I am 24. Trust me, if the movie was like the book, I mean like all of you wanted it to be, it would be a total disaster. Too many characters (such as Bombadil), too many extra and not necessarily parts of the journey (Old Forest) and too much dialogue in certain scenes (Council of Elrond). Expect The Two Towers to be more intriguing and have more character development. It really bothers me to see people who insult movies and say things that they don't mean to do, which can be very obviously be seen. Overall, a momentous start for cinema in the 21st century. 11/10 P.S. Just because some people hate the movie does NOT mean, I repeat DOES NOT MEAN that it doesn't deserve to be praised. And it seems sort of unjust to say that LotR should be ballot stuffed to bring it down from its (currently #2) place in the top 250. That's just disrespectful, to the film and the director. And for those of you who keep comparing it to Star Wars for some reasons should remember that the book was written BEFORE. And give Hugo Weaving a break. The man has to play good guys sometimes and try to pretend that he never was an agent but a wise immortal being...
10.0~Great Fantasy Book Becomes One Of The Greatest Movies Ever Made LoneWolfAndCub Sign in Permalink When Peter Jackson took on this amazing trilogy written by J.R.R Tolkien he was taking one of the biggest dares in cinematic history. The Lord of the Rings trilogy has gathered countless fans over the world. The books are captivating masterpieces that delve deep into our imaginations. To think that it would be transferred to the big screen. But Peter Jackson had that certain touch, he turned a great book into a film that will be treasured as one of the greatest films to ever have been made. For those who haven't read the books (I urge you to) the plot focuses on a ring. A ring made for evil. This ring can turn the bearer invisible at will. By luck, this ring lands into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from The Shire. He passes it down to his nephew Frodo Baggins. When Gandalf finds out about this he immediately sends Frodo on a quest to destroy The One Ring. Because if it falls into the wrong hands it could mean an end the Middle Earth. Along with Samwise Gamgee they set off on an epic adventure. This movie is one-of-a-kind. An adaption has never been this good. Everything about this movie is captivating and just so brilliant. I have read the Fellowship just once but I was just so pleased with this movie. The way Peter Jackson has gone from paper-to-film is very inspiring. The look of Middle Earth is extremely beautiful. The beautiful Hobbiton and dread-filled Mordor are just perfect. The roles are perfectly suited. Elijah Wood is great as Frodo, Sean Astin as Samwise was a perfect choice and Ian McKellen as Gandalf was an extremely smart choice. This movie is just perfect and if you haven't seen it I urge now. GO SEE IT!! 5/5.
2.0~A cold, heartless, horror-movie treatment of one of the great epic stories of our time. tone-23 Sign in Permalink I really tried to go into this movie with an open mind. I knew that much would be left out due to time restrictions. I was aware through the promotional campaign that the dialog was going to be un-Tolkien, for reasons I wasn't clear about, since they seem to have gone to considerable effort to get pronunciations correct. I knew that there would be many things about both the story and the treatment of it that would conflict with my own hide-bound (some would say fossilized) ideas. But still I looked forward to it. Then they showed Sauron in the second shot of the movie and somewhere inside, I wailed in despair. I knew, from that alone, that Peter Jackson didn't get it. What is the one thing in LOTR that is never shown? The one thing so evil and horrible that it isn't even described? Sauron. The title character. The Lord of the Rings himself. There he is, in the second shot of the movie. Some funny looking big guy whose armourer has either very very bad taste or a sick sense of humor. The whole prologue was very aggravating to me, because as I watched it I knew that both the structure of the story and the slow building of understanding that characterized Tolkien's telling of it were being ignored. Throughout "The Fellowship of the Ring" (the book, that is) we see the story unfold largely through Frodo's eyes. We don't know about the conspiracy between Merry, Pippin and Sam because Frodo doesn't. We don't know who the Black Riders are because Frodo doesn't. And we don't know the history of the Ring until Gandalf tells Frodo about it. Putting us in the hobbit's shoes brings us into the story. The prologue in the movie separates us from it. On a technical level, the cinematography and editing were completely wrong for a story of this type -- other than a few wide sweeping shots of the fellowship walking south from Rivendell, the movie seemed all wide-angle lenses, swish pans, jump cuts, Spike Lee zooms (zooming in while dollying back or vice versa) or gratuitous and excessive special effects. When Frodo puts the ring on, why does it suddenly get windy? I rather think Bilbo would have noticed something was odd about the ring if all that had happened when he put it on. Almost without exception, all the special effects were over-the-top. From the glow of the fiery letters shining on Frodo's face (which, I will admit, looked kind of cool) to the flaming eye of Sauron. In a word, the film lacked subtlety. Tolkien would have been hopping mad. And Arwen at the bridge made me mad, too. In the book, Frodo stands, weak and wounded on the opposite shore from the Nazgul, and yet with his remaining strength defies them. This is a crucially important moment in his development and our understanding of his character. Though the waves with horses was a nice touch. Speaking of Arwen at the bridge, there are many annoying examples of small changes to the plot done for no apparent reason. Why was it Frodo who figured out how to open the gates of Moria? And why wasn't Sam at the mirror of Galadriel? Why did Aragorn show up before the orcs finished off Boromir (actually, that one's obvious -- so we could waste more time with another damn fight scene, that's why)? and why was he not present when the black riders attacked the hobbits at Weathertop? It is possible to transfer a book successfully to screen faithfully. For example, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone" does an admirable job. I gave the movie a seven out of ten and full marks for keeping within both the letter and the spirit of the book. It left some things out, but you could tell that the filmmakers respected the book, the author, and the book's legion of readers. Several key dynamics from LOTR were thrown out in the movie. The whole business of the mysterious disappearance of Gandalf is left out, and replaced with one of the most bone-jarringly stupid scenes in the film: I call it Gandalf vs. Saruman in the temple of Doom. Was that silliness necessary? The Wizards in the film may have been quick to anger, but subtle they most decidedly were not. The Legolas-Gimli relationship was likewise ignored, as well as the process of Aragorn gaining the hobbits' trust (especially Sam's). But this simply underscores the greatest weakness in the movie -- it doesn't build the characters, it takes them for granted. And what of poor Barliman? He was given such short shrift. Not to mention Tom Bombadil. I read a viewer comment in this forum defending his omission which said (quoting here): `a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age'. That's exactly the point: LOTR is not about this day and age. By and large, the casting was fine, with the following exceptions: Agent Smith from "The Matrix" as Elrond. For God's sake, Weaving even slipped in and out of the "Agent Smith" voice. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn. He was capable of playing the fighter, but either wasn't capable or given the opportunity to reveal the historian, linguist, lore-learned Aragorn. The interchangeable actors as Merry and Pippin. Except for their accents, they weren't easy to tell apart. It's easy to say that even at three hours, the film was too short to cover all the ground in the book (and I will certainly not argue this -- I estimate a faithful, yet watchable treatment at about 24 hours -- but Ken Burns' "Baseball" was almost that long, wasn't it?), but far too much of that precious time was spent in the action and fight scenes. The Chamber of Mazarbul scene (the fight with the troll) was one of the better action scenes, and handled very skillfully, but I would have traded most of it for a better treatment of the Council of Elrond (like, why the heck is Boromir there? Who is Gimli, and why is he at Rivendell? Why wasn't Bilbo there? His offer to take the Ring was most revealing in the book). And, of course, the whole prologue should have been moved into Frodo's sitting room, where Professor Tolkien wisely put it. It comes down to this. They didn't trust the book. The darned thing sold fifty MILLION copies. That's a BILLION dollars worth of books. And has a legion of admirers dwarfing Harry Potter's. But they didn't trust it. One of the things I truly admired about the late Robert Shaw (I sing in the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus) was that he never tried to put his own `stamp' on a piece of music. His purpose was always to get at the heart of the music, to serve the composer and the composer's intentions. In a way, a film treatment of a book is a `performance' of that book. And the better the book, the more beloved by the reading public, the more incumbent it is upon the performer to strive for the heart and soul of the book. Peter Jackson got much that was superficially right, but missed the life at the center. The film is cold, frightening, and utterly unlike The Lord of the Rings. Finally, the most disappointing thing: because any Lord of the Rings film would have to be a production of epic scale, this version may have to stand as the only real attempt at a film adaptation for many years, perhaps forever. There have been dozens of "Hamlet's, and even a bunch of "Tarzan"s. And that's one thing that kept running through my mind: "This is IT. This is the treatment that LOTR will get in the cinema. Damn."
10.0~This trilogy is a trilogy that I don't think gets enough credit. joshuadrake-39480 Sign in Permalink I decided to do something new with this movie review. I will not only review the first film, I will review the entire trilogy. The plot follows Frodo Baggins as he goes on a journey to destroy the One Ring and with the help of the Fellowship and his friend, Samwise Gamgee and the evil / good creature Gollum, he is able to destroy the One Ring in the one place that he is created: Mount Doom. I love this trilogy and to this day, I think it is one of my favorite trilogies (others include The Matrix trilogy, the original and prequel STAR WARS trilogies, THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY and the original X-MEN trilogy), but I really thought that this trilogy was amazing and Peter Jackson gets a lot of praise for this film, King Kong, Tintin and the Hobbit trilogy and it is really amazing. The first 2 films are nearly three hours long, but the last film The Return of the King is 3 hours and 20 minutes long and I thought that would be way too long, but after the find ended I was not angry or bored. When I first watched The Fellowship of the Ring, it kept me interested and very amazed from beginning to the end, after that I watched The Two Towers, and it kept me emotionally engaged until the end credits and I was impressed with the climactic fight scene at Helm's Deep, then I finally got to The Return of the King and I could have not been happier with this one, it not only made a billion dollars when released in the theaters, but it won all 11 Oscars including Best Picture, making the third film the only fantasy film to win in each category. Not only you can get interested in the movies, you can also get interested in the characters and action, as well as the plot. Frodo is a cool character, played by Elijah Wood and his performance is amazing. Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White / Gandalf the Grey is really cool and amazing, he is a character that he is amazing, and his performance was great and I was angry that he did not get an Oscar for this role. Also, he was playing Magneto during production of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the first, second and third X-MEN films. The character I was horrified about the first time I saw this film was Gollum, because of his split personality between Smeagol and Gollum and it was amazing to see him on screen, Andy Serkis played him and I liked him as Gollum in this trilogy and the first film in THE HOBBIT trilogy, An Unexpected Journey (2012), which was released in December 2012 and I did see it and I did see the second film and I really enjoyed it. My favorite scene is where Gollum is talking to himself and that was really funny and just well acted by Andy Serkis and this would lead him into playing the title role in Peter Jackson's KING KONG 2005 remake and Caesar, later on in RISE of the PLANET of the APES and DAWN of the PLANET of the APES and I can't wait to see him as Caesar in the next "Planet of the Apes" reboot film. These movies have some fantastic dialogue and action, especially in the second and third film. Every battle in this trilogy is amazingly well-done and spectacular and the added great CGI for this film trilogy. My favorite battles in The Fellowship of the Ring are when Arwen (played by Liv Tyler) saves Frodo and the battle inside Balin's Tomb and that was incredible and spectacular. My favorite battle in The Two Towers is the very, very, VERY long battle at Helm's Deep, that battle sequence was amazingly well-done. My favorite battle in The Return of the King is the end battle because there are two things happening: Frodo destroying the Ring and fighting Gollum and the entire Fellowship fighting against the Orcs. The cinematography, visual effects, production design, creature design, make-up effects, editing, musical score and atmosphere of this movie was an amazing job and it was also incredible and the direction by Peter Jackson is amazingly well-done and fantastic. Overall, this trilogy of films are incredible with every movie released and every time I watch these films are incredibly amazing. Yes, I will always love The Fellowship of the Ring for starting this trilogy, but The Two Towers is amazing and is a great improvement over the first film. My favorite one is the trilogy is The Return of the King, because it has better character development, better action sequences, better acting, better music and visual effects and most of all, the best ending to a film trilogy. I know a lot of people think that the ending is way too long in the third film, but I'm used to watching three to four hour long films at all. This is one trilogy that I don't think gets enough critical praise and credit. FINAL SCORE FOR ALL THREE LORD OF THE RINGS FILMS: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - 8/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - 9/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - 10/10 FINAL SCORE for the entire trilogy will be a 9.5 / 10
10.0~My Favorite Movie! zwacka Sign in Permalink How can anyone not love this movie?? Its the best fantasy movie ever made and by far the best adaptation of a book made movie. I believe Tolkien would be proud. It goes beyond ordinary cinema and will forever be remembered as a historic event in which all future works will be compared. I cannot wait to see the rest of "Lord of the Rings" come to life on the big screen!
5.0~Doesn't add to the book snsh Sign in Permalink This movie loses a lot from the book, and all it adds are a few special effects. The first five minutes are cool -- everybody seems to love that part. Then the movie becomes too slow, too formulaic. "Look here, this is where you feel sad. This is where you cheer. This is where you say 'ooh, ahh'..." A movie can enhance a book by adding dialogue. But in this film, the script is a series of monologues. The characters give speech after speech, and it becomes hard to tell them apart because they're all approximately the same. When they're not talking, there are a few good action sequences, but most of the time it's characters posing, wallowing in self-pity.
10.0~Extended version a tangible improvement, and not just for those who love the books castiron-2 Sign in Permalink When I saw the original theatrical release, I was, like many others who knew and loved Tolkien's books, pleasantly surprised that Peter Jackson and his team had succeeded in making a good movie without betraying at least the spirit of the books (betraying the letter was unavoidable in anything less than a 12-part miniseries) and that the movie's most glaring flaws were essentially all errors of omission rather than commission (unlike a certain other version by one B*ksh*). Now I have seen the extended edition (in deference to Peter Jackson's professed dislike of the term, I will not call it the director's cut, though IMO this merely deprives him of the kudos he richly deserves for creating this much-improved version) and I am overjoyed to find that many of the original errors of omission have been rectified, turning what was already a good movie into an excellent movie. Certain yawning gaps in the theatrical version (especially noticeable--and not just for those who have read the book--during the fellowship's sojourn in Lothlorien) were expertly filled, and the story now does far more justice especially to the talents of Cate Blanchett and John Rhys Davies (both of whom received shamefully short shrift in the theatrical version) and (to my pleasant surprise) of Hugo Weaving, whose Elrond has become much more balanced with just a few deft strokes. Moreover, though most of the changes have made the movie adhere closer to the book, this has certainly not made the movie less enjoyable for those who have not read the books; if anything, the movie's pacing has become more even, lessening the frenetic feel that previously marred parts of it (of course, if you believe it _should_ have been an Action Movie And Only An Action Movie, you might regret this development). All in all, I believe the extended version is a considerable improvement on the theatrical release. I originally rated the theatrical version an 8, and I would say the extended version is about a 3-point increase, but unfortunately I can't rate it an 11, so it'll have to be a 10.
10.0~Every word that means "stupendous" should be used Freedomisanillusion Sign in Permalink This movie, was breathtakingly outstanding! Peter Jackson sticks entirely true to the books, and doesn't spend time exploiting the people who he's cast for the roles. The scenery was beautiful, and blending the computer graphics with it was fantastic. The way the Hobbits and Normal people contrast in size is a very cool trick, and the Ringwraiths were superbly well done. If it isn't really obvious, I loved this movie.
10.0~Greatest movie of all time even better! lohengrin Sign in Permalink Just got and watched the extended DVD of FOTR. It was amazing. The 208 minutes fly by all too fast. Everything I've missed is there, the gift giving in Lothorian, Aragorn's origin and be prepared for an even more brutal, savage battle in the end! Too bad they could not keep these scenes in the theatrical release since it would have made it easier for people who had never read the book to understand the depth of the story and characters. I only wish I could update my 'vote' on the IMDB and give FOTR an 11 out of 10! ...only 1 month till Two Towers!
4.0~did I ruin the film? thingsthatshine Sign in Permalink did I ruin the film by reading the books years ago? I had the strangest feeling watching this incredibly praised film that I live in an alternative universe where we were forced to watch a rather tiresome version of the film. I was ecstatic to hear all the critics praising the film, ecstatic to hear all the early viewers praising the film, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype that it had been given. Minor Spoilers there were many things that disappointed me in the film - the shallow characters and comedy relief that Pippen and Merry play, the whole council of Elrond, the battle of the wizards, and, my god, the final "let's hunt some orc" nonsense from Aragorn. Hey Peter Jackson, couldn't you just take a couple more days and make sure some of those scenes were done a little better? the battle scenes were good. hollywood certainly knows how to show someone getting sliced up or beheaded nowadays. but I just had a hard time finding the soul of the movie. spoilers end maybe if some critics had said that they didn't know what all the fuss was about, then I would have gone in with lower standards, and maybe on some rainy end of winter day, i'll give it another chance, but for now I believe that millions have somehow been duped into believing that this is a great movie ("the best of all time" as too many imdb reviews state). honestly, and this hurts because I was such a fan of the book, i have to give it a 6 out of 10.
10.0~masterpiece aaron867 Sign in Permalink The varied responses to this movie are a testament to the fact that we project our own internal reality on the world around us. I always thought it was ridiculous to make high school kids read classic literature. It goes so far over their heads that it probably isn't worthwhile. Tolkein's written work is much the same. I read the story 3 times. First time it was way over my head. Second time it was a boring hack and slash story. Third time it was a soul stirring work of art that stung me deep in the heart and created a feeling that lasted for months afterwards. The story is an intricate examination of the human spirit that leaves you breathless (if you have the eyes to see it). This is definitely one of the best movies ever made. There is no question about it. It's not like the written story (and it's amazing to me that so many writers were impressed with how well it followed the book- Saruman and Sauron are NOT allies for one thing). But it stands as it's own entity better than I would have ever thought possible. Perhaps we shouldn't judge outright until all three are done. For people who write negative things about the movie, I assume that they fall into a couple different categories. One is the person who cannot feel, and thinks it is a hack and slash picture with neat scenery. The other is the flatland literalist who can't stop analyzing everything, and picks it apart until it is stripped of all value. These are the people that should not be making evaluations of movies such as this. Not caring much for the movie is fine, but bashing the written work is more self-degrading than anything.
9.0~Best film ever to have hit the big screen . . . cazzyman Sign in Permalink Truly an amazing film - A mile-stone in cinema history, and, I think, could never be re-made to such a standard of which we know The Lord Of The Rings to be. Well done there Pete! Who could have thought you could make a film of such momentous talent from the best book that the world has ever seen. It is my all time favourite - ranking high no.1, and there, I anticipate, it shall stay forever. That is unless you can beat the best, while the years of my life slowly fade into an unwritten history. I think that it was Sam who was the REAL hero. Out of the three, The Fellowship rules on high - winning only by a neck over The Return of the King.
10.0~An Epic for All Time Zulu_King Sign in Permalink Now, having seen the Platinum Extended Edition twice in three days, and as and experienced cinephile and life-long watcher of films, I can safely say that the LOTR is one of the great cinematic experiences of all time. It represents a magnificent achievement in filmmaking and its process--easily taking six-seven years of constant work by Peter Jackson and his genius craftsmen. By the end of the the trilogy, Oscars should be given to every one of the principal designers who shared in its vision. Many people will wish that this scene or that scene should have been added. Given the complexity of this shoot, it's a minor miracle any kind of coherence exists at all. This film was not film back-to-back-back in order, with Fellowship coming first, as some have reported, but filmed as one film--one that was twelve hours long. Locations were secured--and then all the scenes that would happen there throughout the three films were then shot. Many of these scenes would have to fit with scenes shot, perhaps, a year later. Jackson is still editing the picture--two years after principal photography has finished! One still has to judge the film as a whole, however and, to this critic's eye, most everything rings true. Everyone has a couple of quibles and I am not immune. My particular quibbles are with Sean Astin as Samwise, and Liv Tyler as Arwen. Those two actors, fine in their own right, are too "American" to suggest Middle Earth. Astin will always be Rudy--the role he was born to play and Tyler will never eclipse her role as Affleck's main squeeze in Armageddon. Filmmaking is all about making decision. On an average film with a 60-day shoot, the director is, perhaps, making 200 decisions a day. That breaks down to 12,000 decisions (just for principle photography.) Add in a pre-production of eight months or so and you can add another 40,000 decisions. The LOTR was THREE YEARS in pre-production, 15 MONTHS in actual filming, and another THREE YEARS in post-production. If you are an absolute genius, you could not expect to get more than 95-97 percent right. With 200 decisions a day, that means 10 or so answers a day are not based on concrete knowledge but instinct and that illusive talent: creativity. With LOTR, just during the production phase alone, 2,500 decisions were made just that way. Mind boggling. No, my friends, I am not going to quibble that Jackson should have done this, or sustained that, had been more poetic here, or ethereal there. Certainly, Peter Jackson is a great director but he is no David Lean--but let's not hold that against him. LOTR will stand the testament of legend and rank as of the great epics of all measured time, savored for generations to come. See it. Be it. Live it.
10.0~Unbelievable! jerrod_84 Sign in Permalink I received the 5 disc 'extended edition' of "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" for Christmas and it's honestly one of the best movies ever made! There was an uncomprehensible amount of work and time and people that went into making this film trilogy - it's honestly mindblowing! Though some of the minor story lines differ slightly from the book, I still really like what all has been done with the film. The visual conception is what is the greatest. All of the detail put into Rivendell and Lothlorien is fascinating!
10.0~Wonderful yooker Sign in Permalink Made you feel as though you were on the quest with them. Attention to small details was incredible - it is obvious that Jackson is a huge fan of Tolkien. I was very nervous watching it for the first time - scared that they would screw it up - instead I got the best Christmas present in years - with two more to follow
10.0~Breathtaking! What a Wonderful Film! **Warning! **Spoilers!** nekkosduredro Sign in Permalink Having now seen the film 17 (!) times at the cinema, and written 3 previous imdb user comments, I think it is time to write one final praise of its qualities. My earlier comments have been written without me preparing a script, so I have done that this time. Let me start at the beginning of the film. Galadriel (unseen) starts the opening narration (the world is changed.....) and at this time, no matter how many times I see it, I start gasping for air, and I feel like the film becomes part of me. No film has ever had this effect on me before, without anything really happening, and I can´t explain it. Then the "Theme of the Ring" plays over the films title, and it is so sad, yet beautiful, that it wonderfully prepares you for a tragic and sad story that will be enlivened by humour. Then follows a short retelling of the forging of the Rings of Power, with the unforgettably sad image of the nine kings who will "return" as the Nazgul. And the amazing battle-scene at the foot of Mount Doom, in which the ring comes to Isuldur. He is then ambushed and killed, and the scene where he floats dead in the Anduin brings tears to my eyes no matter how many times I see it. This says a lot about Peter Jacksons achievement: Despite that he has made a film laden with SFX, he has managed to bring back to (big-budget-)movies something basic that has been lost since Star Wars or so: To make a film really affect your emotions! All right, perhaps it hasn´t been entirely lost, but I have never experienced it to this effect. And the ring comes to Gollum, E.T.s bad twin brother, I saw the 20-year edition last Saturday, and that creature had the same fingers, very similar head and body, and a scene in which he stares into the camera the same way as Gollum in Moria, and humans saying (repeatedly)"he (E.T.) came to me." Then follows the first appearance of Frodo, then Gandalf, and their wonderful first exchange (A wizard is never late....) and the magnificent ride through Hobbiton, with fireworks, Gandalf, and the wonderful first frowning, then laughing, then stared into frowning again old woman, who, in a simple way captures the spirit of the hobbit. Actually, I myself grew up in a hobbit-like family in al rural area, and that is perhaps why I like the film so much. In fact, the old woman and her daughter? reminded me of my grandmother and my aunt (her daughter), but enough of that.... Then of course, there is Bilbo. Because the book is so widely read, his disappearance at his own birthday party, and the Ring making him (slightly) aggressive, could easily have been trite on film. But because of Peter Jacksons brilliant direction, and Ian Holms spot-on performance, it comes across as entirely fresh. My favourite moment is when he accuses Gandalf of wanting the ring, Gandalf uses his powers and Bilbo falls into his arms like a child. I´m not going to retell the entire film here, but let´s take the first appearance of Aragorn/Strider. He is a mysterious stranger sitting in the corner of an inn, staring at Frodo. This must be one of the oldest clichès in the book, but Peter Jackson actually makes it mystifying and exciting without too many effects. In the end, I must give praise to Peter Jackson for making a film that has the same effect on me as it´s title-object has on it´s former bearers: It draws me to it. My own, my love, my p-rrrrrrr-eeeeee-c-i-o-u-sssssssssssssss! 10 out of 10
10.0~A glimmer of light in the darkness that movies have fallen into. Remij Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring reminds us of what makes movies the greatest form of entertainment in our daily lives. Yes, some people respond bitterly towards this movie and say that it is a waste of time. I cannot tell them to do otherwise, so we will just have to put up with their "remarks". The ONLY reason someone may not enjoy this film is that it is a movie based on events that "never happened". Well, there are some other reasons like being age 4 and having an attention span of ten minutes. That brings me to the point about the length of the movie. If anyone complains about the movie being too long I can only respond by saying read the book. **Spoiler** I am kind of sad that some important events (in my opinion) did not make the film, like Tom Bombadil and the guidance of the elves through the woods to Bree. **End Spoiler** I must congratulate Peter Jackson on his excellent efforts to make this world of unimaginable depth come to life. He was able to make Dwarves and Hobbits look different. He was able to fix the size proportions of Hobbits, Dwarves and the rest of the races, without the use of stilts. He was able to place the viewer in the "boots" of Frodo Baggins as he traveled the great land of Middle Earth in his quest to destroy the ring. I give this film all ten fingers up, raised high in the sky.
1.0~TERRIBLE FILM!!! Nerds are now in the know and cool for a while Theatum Sign in Permalink WTF kind of film is this? I hear so many people talk and talk of this movie, so I felt I should see it to find out what all the fuss was about. After all, I even got recommendations from people who did not read the book. Since I did not read the book, I figured the movie must have something for people like me since so many who didn't read it loved it. While watching this movie I realized something, THEY LIED. No sane human being who didn't read the book can honestly say this is a good movie. This is a boring, drawn out piece of trash. What's happening with LOTR is this---it has become COOL. Yes cool. For the moment anyway. Just like with all nerdy obsessions, like Star Wars, Transformers, Indiana Jones, whatever....when they become cool all of a sudden the nerds that love them seem to be "in the know" about something hip and chic. So it's hip and chic to say you get it and you love it too, even when you think it's the dumbest thing you ever saw. That's whats happening with LOTR and it's nerdball fans. Well I don't need to look cool, I already am, and I say this film is TERRIBLE. It's so freaking boring, I fell asleep half way through. I only woke up again when whoever was killed by those blue demons. Not a single character was developed, not a single character is introduced. Nothing whatsoever is shown to us the audience. What the hell is going on in this movie? The writing is terrible, and the acting is bland. The directing is pretty good I admit, and the visual SFX are impressive. That's about the only good points of LOTR. This film is only for die hard fans of the book and people who want to look hip and chic for 15 seconds.
1.0~A dire three hour film about walking Goataid Sign in Permalink The problem with this film is not it's look, as it does look amazing, but it's length and confusing nature. Now if you've read the book then I dare say you'd have an idea what's going on but if you haven't then what I am told is an 'awesome epic' becomes a rather long film involving walking. And boy do they walk. they walk up hills, through forests, caves and over mountains. And then then walk some more! Another fault with the film is that although the cast has been assembled to be true to the book, none of them have any presence at all. It all makes you wish that someone with some charisma would turn up in a car and get on with it
10.0~Excusable flaws don't detract. philcooper Sign in Permalink There's a very obvious problem when transferring any book to the big screen, namely that some of us may already have seen it. It's not that the story holds no surprises (save for the occasional controversies that surround the fate of characters like Hannibal Lecter), it's just that many of us have already read the book, and thus we've already directed our own version of the story. We've already seen it in our mind's eye. And this is the problem that plagues The Fellowship of The Ring. You'll see a lot of reviews here proclaiming it as nothing short of the second coming of cinema, and a few that dare to knock its serious shortcomings. Let me clear this up right now. The first issue that many may raise is that this is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Quite right, while taking pains to ensure that they stayed faithful to the novel, Jackson et al have not simply been able to lift their screenplay directly from its pages without a few necessary changes. There is a great deal of mindfulness in the film about the portion of the audience (and it will be large) who are unfamiliar with the novels. Accordingly a great deal more emphasis has been placed upon pacing and storytelling more appropriate to a classic film narrative. Hence we need to see Gandalf's protracted bid to escape the clutches of Isenguard interspersed with the Hobbit's journey to Rivendell. It simply isn't appropriate to expect an audience to bear with the Hobbits' journey, no matter how good the actors are or how enthralling the story is, for upwards of an hour without constant reminders of the films other protagonists OR the threat of the evil they face. Having Gandalf just turn up at Rivendell and tell his story via CGI-filled flashbacks simply wouldn't have had the necessary effect. Secondly, the omission and reworking of characters. Yes, it was sad that Bakshi felt his animation didn't need Tom Bombadill, and given that he features strongly in Tolkien's other works this has to be frowned upon by the die-hard fanatics, but introducing diverting, but ultimately pointless episodes into the list of the challenges the Hobbits face is hardly going to keep you riveted to your seat is it? I mean, a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age. The film is already stretching the audience's suspension of disbelief as far as it can go. Hence the chaff of Bombadill is cut. He isn't relevant to the rest of the story so he can be done without. It's sad for Tolkien fans for him not to be there but there's only so much celluloid available, even with a film this long. And yes, Arwen Undomiel never saved Frodo from the Dark Riders, but please, remember your girlfriend needs to have something to sink her teeth into as well, not just midgets and men with beards looking mean or scared as they fight monsters. So, for gender representation and a bid to prevent half the potential market (please remember that like all film, this is a product to be packaged and sold) her character gets a drastic overhaul. Go sister! There are numerous other issues relevant to the faithfulness of the adaptation from novel to screenplay but please, let's be content with what we've got here. It's a hard task to do all this well and Jackson, along with the rest of the boys and girls at Wingnut and WETA, should be commended for what they have achieved. That said there are some definite flaws in the film, even those that can't be overlooked by justifying the needs to relate to the popcorn and nachos audience. Firstly, we've got the Fellowship itself. Now, Merry and Pippin, while not really being established as Frodo's friends and thus not having the same kind of bond with him as they do in the novel are moderately well integrated. However, at the arrival of Boromir, Gimili and Legolas we just get left in the dark. None of these three characters, all representing important races, cultures and locations of the world of Middle Earth are given no more than token arrival-shots to introduce them, and little or no back-story as to how they came to be where they are or why they feel compelled to join Frodo's quest. Offering their various weapons is noble, and it sounds fantastic in the trailer, but when we finally get down to it we just don't know who they are or what they're about. Accordingly we don't ever really have time to care about any of these three, save for Legolas whose fighting proficiency alone makes him stand out. Sadly, Sean Bean is allowed little more than to switch from foreboding bad guy to friendly companion and back again (thus betraying his characters ultimate fate from the first time he opens his mouth) and John Rhys Davis is left with little more to do than scowl and look short. It doesn't help that both these characters seem to get a pretty raw deal for screen time, especially Gimli, who is barely in the film at all. We won't even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between Sam and Frodo. All of this is indeed a shame. The film's greatest strength after its story are its strong characters. However, whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at Gandalf, perhaps not with a humble air so much as a wonder that he's being allowed to soak up all the screen time. And yes, what you've heard is true; the fight sequences are shockingly bad. Well, perhaps that IS an overstatement. The fight sequences aren't exactly bad, they're riddled with good ideas and clever moves, but the camerawork and editing is so erratic that you'll have a hard time picking out anything to inspire awe or respect. The problem here is that the benchmarks for on screen fighting have all been established nowadays by The Matrix, Crouching Tiger and The Phantom Menace, and all of these films use lengthy shots to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography, rather than have us crane our necks and dart about the screen with our eyeballs trying to glimpse it like a rare bird or nipple-flash at a premiere. Now, these, yet again, are only a few of the problems. There's the geography of Middle Earth, some ropey special effects moments and the clumsy ending to deal with. But you can read the books and see the film for yourself; I've already typed enough about all that here. BUT, now that I've just spent the main chunk of this review telling you about the shortcomings of The Fellowship of the Rings as both a movie and an adaptation let me tell you, it is good, exceptionally good. There is no denying that the storyline itself, acting, effects, props, sets and so on and so forth are all spot on. Visually the film is a triumph and WETA has now, without question placed itself ahead of Industrial Light and Magic in terms of industry leading special effects. There are bags of style to proceedings, with some sequences displaying the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague sections of the novel to life. All parts are played to perfection by the cast, and the casting is literally some of the best and most appropriate seen in years, none of this who-hot-and-who's-not Jerry Bruckheimer trash, it's a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. We'll give particular credit to Sir Ian Mckellan, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and Elijah Wood again here. No doubt they've had scores of favourable and loving reviews already but these performances truly are worth mentioning just once again. The film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Yes, it does take perseverance, no it's not entirely faithful to Tolkien's work and there are some serious flaws, but in a year that has been so barren of even five decent mainstream movies I think it's safe to say that no matter when this film had been released it would have outshone its competitors.
10.0~Won me over! Nickandf Sign in Permalink LOTR passed me by as a teenager and it was only the chance hiring of FOTR on video that alerted me to the delights of Middle Earth. Peter Jackson has done something right if he can get a forty-something suddenly interested in a whole new world. Having seen the film I read The Hobbit and then the LOTR trilogy, just started The Silmarillion. Excellent reading, the only sadness is having left it so long before falling under the spell The film rates as one of the best I have seen and no, I do not mind if it differs from the books. The extended DVD is even better, although it has caused me to lose sleep watching all the goodies on it. 10/10 Mr Jackson!
10.0~Excellent! Malarien Sign in Permalink This Movie was a fabulous adaptation of Tolkien's story. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had great directing and casting. The sets and costumes were so fantastical and believable that I felt like Middle-Earth was a real place. Props to Peter Jackson and his cast and crew!
10.0~Brilliant and Intelligent asticht-2 Sign in Permalink For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest. I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition, several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film, I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey, if you do see it first without them, you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all, this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known, well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien. The filmmakers did the book justice and that is the bottom line unlike Bakshi's version of 1978 which was a disappointment at best and unfinished as it's final release turned out to be.
10.0~Sock Blowingly Superb! General Comment Sign in Permalink Superlatives are perhaps used too casually these days, but not in the case of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I've been trying to work out why this film had such an effect on me, that I've been back to see it again and again. The special effects are superb, The cinematography is breathtaking. The music is awesome. And the tale that is told is wonderful. But there's something more than that. This film has moral themes which strike deeply. Evil is a tangible force that appears to be unstoppable. But, though it appears to be victorious at every turn, in fact this is NOT so. Hope is found in the unlikeliest of places, and you get a feeling that, although the evil is terrifyingly powerful, there is something greater at work. I can see why Christians love this film. The characters in the film are not cardboard cut outs. They seem real , and you find yourself caring for their welfare which is a very rare thing in movies. They are not invincible heroes, far from it. They suffer from self doubt and other infallibilites. They are afraid, even desperate, but you respect them because they have a cause worth fighting for, hopeless though the fight seems. The movie's ending is tragic and sad, but you leave the cinema strangely uplifted. It's not over yet, not by a long way, and you so want the free peoples to win through that you want to see the next two instalments straight away, even if it means sitting another six hours in the theatre. Oh, and I have to mention the trailer for the Two Towers. It raised the hairs on the back of my neck, and, after it ended, my heart was pounding. This is a story and a half, make no mistake. So choose your own superlative for this movie. Whichever you choose, it won't do it justice. I don't think I can wait until next December.
10.0~Difficult to Fault!! dataconflossmoor Sign in Permalink How can a film miss when it has everything going for it, storyline, graphics, authenticated digitalization, and maybe some of the most fabulous cinematography that I have ever seen in any movie made whatsoever!! This was a painstaking effort of folklore and fantasy which homogenized in conjunction with the rendition of the novel "Lord of the Rings" by Tolken!!! I do not know if anybody remembers the animated version of "Lord of the Rings" made in 1978? I enjoyed it very much!! However, with this triumvirate of epic "Lord of the Rings" movies which besieged the movie viewer in the early part of this decade, and eventually took the movie industry by storm, more and more film aficionados will appreciate Tolken's work now than ever before!! "Fellowship of the Ring" fascinates the movie audience by manufacturing monsters who wind up taking on mere mortals... This induces a David and Goliath confrontation which provides a suspenseful entertainment for anyone watching this film!! I just cannot get over the breathtaking cinematography in this film!! I believe it was filmed in New Zealand, now, I want to go there!!! Rated as one of the top twenty American movies ever made, I definitely recommend seeing "Lord of the Rings/ Fellowship of the Ring" Survival of the fittest never became more creative than with this movie!!
10.0~A good opinion Firecrackers Sign in Permalink This movie was amazing. The special effects, the acting, the adaptation from the book, and if you've read the book you'll probably agree that the casting was done amazingly. Its just what I imagined from the book. Especially Aragorn and Legolas! If you haven't seen this it comes out August 1st. No need to rent it just go out and buy it. This movie is HUGE! And the next 2 are supposed to be better.
10.0~A truly fantastic adaptation of a timeless classic hathororange Sign in Permalink As a original lover of the Lord of the rings novals, I found this to be a brillent adaptaion. To see the books come alive in such vivid detail is truly breathtaking and till now would only have been alive in such a stunning format in the minds of the readers. It is a wonderful fantsy world that seems real to the point that one can live it, It is full of action and although fairytale like has a dark charm and realism about it. A truely fantastic film. I also feel myself that the film itself was bursting with acting Talent, The casting was truely magical and each actor brought their chacter to life with amazing skill. Well Done. I would suggest anyone who gets the chance to watch thsi film and let a little magic into your life you won't regret it.
10.0~Loved it, really really loved it bugtronic Sign in Permalink Everything I could have hoped for and more. I love the books and felt the movie did them justice. I had forgotten just how much plot there is to get through in each book. I'm amazed they could condense it to 3 hours. I loved the creative license they took with Arwen. In the books I always felt she kind of showed up in the end out of nowhere. A really incredible movie, the sound was astonishing and the cast was perfect. Well acted, well directed, definitely got slighted at the Academy Awards.
10.0~This is a great movie. Baxter9289 Sign in Permalink I hadn't even read the books when I went to see this movie, so I had no idea what to expect. This movie is a breathtaking masterpiece. The acting is very well executed and the effects are stunning. Despite its long length it stays interesting and entertaining during the entire movie. I can't say enough good things about this wonderful movie.
1.0~Grandiose scenary, but a weak story. RIK-22 Sign in Permalink I'm ignoring the fact that this was a book conversion and judging purely as a film. I haven't read the book and I'm not overly interested in children's films, but I thought with Peter Jackson at the helm, that maybe this would be a more adult version of an alleged classic. I like Peter Jackson as a director, every since he made 'Bad Taste', which took him 4 years, I believe. Any great film, has one main theme, you need to believe and care about the characters. Whether you have great special effects, acting or story twist, you need to feel something. This is where LOTR fails very badly. The film started very well, I like the atmosphere and the style, and there was even some tension. If the film has ended when Liv Tyler rescued Elijah, then, although short, I would have liked it. From that point onwards the film became very tiresome. Basically any depth was lost, it became a sequel to 'Clash of the Titans' or any other Ray Harryhausen film. Lets just walk somewhere, have one of the Scottish Hobbit's do something stupid (which was very annoying by the way) and have to fight some monster or creature. This carried on for 2 hours. You realised at this point that no matter who or how many things attacked, this bunch could beat them all with relative ease, hence then, you didn't care anymore. The worst part was the end scene one bloody soldier against 50/60 men and they still couldn't kill him, just silly. One other point, the 'Special FX', good FX are when you don't know that they are there, they mix seamlessly into the background, like the film.'A.I.' (crap film though). LOTR, had a lot of bad FX, they were obvious all the time, very few of the backgrounds actually looked real. The mines and the big creature looked particularly fake. If I'm being cynical about the story, why didn't Gandalf just use the big bird to fly them or the ring over the mountain and drop it, but that wouldn't be a very long film I guess. How many times can someone drop or lose a ring, that is meant to be so important. Judging by the comments here, a very overrated film, good at times, but generally childish and silly, I would recommend it to anyone under 14, for me 5/10. I suppose a lot of blame has to go the book, as essentially the story is a poor one. BTW- Why is every new film on IMDB, `The greatest film ever made'
10.0~Some problems I've noticed (spoilers) Laecy Sign in Permalink Before I begin complaining, let me say that along with Moulin Rouge, Amelie and a few others, this is one of my favorite films of all time. It is enchanting. So much so that it took me up-teen viewings of the movie to notice anything to criticize. First, and so glaringly obvious, it galls me that it took me so long to notice, there is a HUGE timing discrepancy near the beginning. Bilbo had left the Shire, and Gandalf had warned Frodo to "keep it secret, keep it safe" and ran off to figure out what the Ring really was. He was in Gondor reading the account of Isildur, a country which took the Fellowship months to reach from Rivendell, and as he's reading there's a cut of one of the Nazgul talking to a hobbit. We assume from the architecture that the Rider is in the Shire, but even given the benefit of the doubt, no hobbits live further from Bag End than Bree. So the Rider could not be more than a couple days away from Frodo. Yet when Frodo goes to his house and all the windows and doors are open, the intruder turned out to be Gandalf. The relief was so great (though rather obviously contrived) that we never stop to think that even if Gandalf had had Shadowfax at this point, there was no way he could have beaten the Nazgul to Bag End, much less have time to sit down for tea and a chat. Second, though Christopher Lee did an excellent portrayal of Saruman, whoever scripted his dialogue must've come from writing B horror films. Practically every one of his lines is a cringe-worthy cliché. One of his greatest weapons is supposed to be his voice, his ability to convince anyone of anything. Not to mention the embarrassing fight scene between the two wizards. Two powers that have been around since before the world began and are the Middle Earth equivalent of arch angels would have a much subtler and more... um... dignified battle than tossing each other around the room. The last major objection I've developed is the portrayal of Sauron. Just the fact that they DID portray him. Tolkien never once physically described Sauron because he knew that his embodiment of evil would be severely limited by making it tangible. During the prologue, Sauron comes out and starts throwing people around, supposedly to show how powerful a warrior the Ring made him. But that is not the nature of the Ring. All of the evil in the story is very subtle. Gandalf came the closest to explaining this when he said he would want to use the Ring for good, but that it would turn his works to harm. Sauron is supposed to be the same way. He did not demand that the rulers of surrounding kingdoms subjugate themselves to him. He poisoned their minds, allowing them to continue to believe they were working for their own good, while really helping the forces of Mordor. Sauruman, Theoden, and Denethor all thought they were trying to promote themselves and protect their people even while being manipulated by Sauron. The movie, I guess did not have the time to develop these concepts well, but to see the thoughtful and subtle manipulation by evil turned into brute force was rather disappointing. Like I said, I truly love this film, I think it did nearly as perfect an adaptation of the masterwork novel as possible. I really had to like it enough to spend the time to find these problems. Well, it's something to think about the next time (or first time) you watch it.
10.0~Really Great ! karlheinzblank Sign in Permalink What should i say? A lot of words is spoken about this film. I make it short: Simply ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME !!! PS: Sorry my english ist not good, but i try my best :-)
10.0~The beginning of the epic.. seventh_samurai54 Sign in Permalink This is one of the greatest films ever made, and is one of my two favorite films (the other being Seven Samurai). There's no amount of praise I can give this film that has not already been given. All of it is well deserved. So, if your one of the very few who have not seen this beautiful film, what's the hold-up? As for me, I have seen it many times, and it has not lost any of it's beauty since the first time. From the acting to the directing to the set design, everything about this movie is brilliant. A classic film.
10.0~Brilliant, my third favorite film ever. Atticus_1588 Sign in Permalink I have seen "LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring" twice in theatres. The first time I left I knew I had seen something great...but I needed to see it again. I went back about two weeks later and realized this film is brilliant. The story is extremely strong. A simple story told complex, and greatly. Although I have not read the books I plan on eventually doing so now that I have seen the film. The acting is also a very, very strong part of this film. Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frodo. He does such a great job. Also, Ian McKellen did a great job of Gandalf. The rest of the acting is great too. The directing is the best thing about this film along with the story. It takes you from place to place so well and vividly...it is amazing. Peter Jackson knew exactly what he wanted to when he walked into doing this film. He had an amazing vision. The music score is also another method of telling this story even stronger. It fits perfectly into any scene they are doing in the movie. If I have left anything out about this film I know why. There is so much I could tell you about this film and how much I love it but I will just point out those things. I cannot wait until "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers". It looks just as amazing as the first just from the previews. If you have not seen this, go see it NOW. In a theatre or when it arrives on DVD and VHS. 10.0/10.0 A classic
1.0~a movie to sleep through 16mm-3 Sign in Permalink this film is a work of genius. marketing genius. i went along because friends insisted it was great, two having seen the film three times. i found not a single scene showing any real imagination. i noticed the guy next to me nodding off. yet he swore he loved the film. what is going on here has something more to do with psychology and marketing than filmmaking or aesthetics. i like sex and violence, but there was no sex and the violence was so ridiculously schmaltzy i could only yawn. i was a student at oxford at the end of tolkien's life, read all his books and have an appreciation of what he was trying to do in his books. yet how odd that i cannot find a single redeeming feature of this film. i love crap films with no intellectual content that entertain. it was with heartfelt relief that i saw the credits begin to come up. thank god i could get out of the theatre.
10.0~If you didn't like this film TexasRedge Sign in Permalink If you didn't like this film...........You probably dont like many movies at all. I have just one word to say about this film. "SPECTACULAR" This is a must see for anyone who just likes movies.WOW
9.0~One director to rule them all... BethKyleXYnet Sign in Permalink If Peter Jackson ever makes any more fantasy movies, I'll go see them just because of what he did with Lord of the Rings. He has well established himself as a director worthy of his craft. I was so impressed with Lord of the Rings that I was persuaded to buy the book, something I do not often do after a theatrical viewing. I'm glad he cut what he cut and made the decisions he made. It took guts to be able to stick to the meat of the plot and not go into all the unnecessary details that might have been nice, but completely unrelated to the plot. This movie is so thick with plot you can stir it and have it leave trails. Renowned Hobbit chefs would understand that terminology. How many words of praise can be directed towards this film? Superb, enchanting, intoxicating, splendid, marvelous, awe-inspiring, history in the making. I don't think anyone else could have done it as well. His choice of actors, crew, effects, WOW! The man's a genius!!!
10.0~Are the Critics qualified? neilwalmsley Sign in Permalink I've read many of the negative comments on this site about LoTR, and they are almost all from people who have blatantly not read the book. To those people, keep quiet. Now, I appreciate that you shouldn't always have to read a book to watch the film version, but this is an exception. Also, I really find it amusing that some of these people think its a dungeons and dragons rip off, which is funny as it was written decades before D&D, and in fact almost all fantasy of the same sort of genre is based on it. sorry if I've offended anyone, though if I did, hooray, I must be doing something right.
9.0~Amazing Tara7 Sign in Permalink This movie is amazing, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard, the world is magical and the story so amazing. I loved the movie.
10.0~Can it become better than this? em_ny Sign in Permalink Yes! But it is still the greatest movie ever made, in my oppinion. I have a feeling that nothing will ever beat the Director's Cut! SPOILERS AHEAD! Overall, Peter Jackson have stayed faithful to the book, to the extent of what's possible. Tom Bombadil was no greater loss, but the addition of Lurtz felt unnecessary. I missed some depth in the friendship between Frodo, Merry and Pippin. Merry and Pippin mostly seemed to think 'Well, this looks like it'll be fun, why don't we come along?'. Merry, Pippin, Gimli and Legolas were given too little screentime (especially the last two), but had the movie been longer, I believe few people who hasn't read the books would've seen it in theatres, so it is excusable. Some unnecessary changes were: Frodo solving the riddle to the door of Moria instead of Gandalf, Aragorn LETTING Frodo go in the end, Bilbo not being at the Council of Elrond and Galadriels 'outburst' telling Frodo what would happen if she had the Ring, which I didn't care for at all. Anyway, now I've pointed out what I didn't like in the movie, but all the other things were fantastic, epic, wonderful, amazing, mind-blowing, indescribable. The acting was great, standouts were (though everybody was very, very good) Ian McKellen, Sean Bean, Sean Astin and, of course, Elijah Wood (Ha! to all of you who said he was too young etc., Elijah Wood IS Frodo, period). After seeing it three times (and intending to see it again and again) I can without doubt say that it is clearly the best movie I've ever seen. Don't miss it! Go see it now! I mean, the worst thing that could happen is that you don't like it, and I doubt that that hasn't happened to you before. 10/10 (what else?) PS. Howard Shore, I worship you!
10.0~Good. Better. Best. TJ-91 Sign in Permalink This is, hands down, one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I do not believe that a film of this scale has been attempted with such breathtaking success anywhere, ever. This includes even classic epics such as Cleopatra, Ben Hur, The 10 Commandments, et al. They may have had a larger cast and required actual sets, but all that pails in comparison to the necessicities of constructing Tolkien's Earth. He is, as this film, without peer in its class. This is a must see for anyone who has ever liked movies.
10.0~A spectacular classic. fatalfivealive Sign in Permalink Lord of the rings is a true classic of epic film making. A great combination of truth, virtue, honor, and friendship that transience each generation. Ian Mckellen is great as Gandalf the wizard, and Elijah Wood is just as good as Fr odo. The Special Effects are truly breath taking and the setting is timeless. If you can only see one movie in your entire life, then see this film. It's that good. I can't wait for the next film in this series.
10.0~How can anyone say this isn't the best movie ever??? dwarf-6 Sign in Permalink Not much to say about it. This is the real thing, this is all you want to see in a film that. The story, the actors, the locations, it's all great. How much movies are there that can put you in a chair for 3 hours long and not bore you for even .5 second?? Go see this this movie, and if you have seen it, go see it again. Vote a 10, make this the best movie ever and go see it so it can at least defeat the little harry potter at the box office.
10.0~First, And Still The Best Of LOTR ccthemovieman-1 Sign in Permalink Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint. Now, several years later after having watched all three of these "Rings" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the "Fellowship" film. Anyway, "Fellowship," stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters. The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.
10.0~Perfection (well, almost) dcldan Sign in Permalink What can I say that is able to describe the immense quality of this film? Words don't come easy when I try to describe the impressive beauties of an epic legend turned into images. The enormous task of adapting the film is superb, with and outstanding plot, a perfect direction and a very well chosen casting of actors! Is is a film that fills and overwhelms all I had imagined when I read the book. There is few films than for me, deserve a 10, if I could, for this one, I would give a 12 to it!!! Emotion, action, love, passion, tragedy, greed... All the most touching emotions of our world moved into an fantastic and moving world filled with strange creatures that will, of course, make you stay 4 hours (yeah, 4!, so big is the greatness of the film!) in your sofa, absolutely amazed and desiring to know how continues. Peter Jackson (the director), must have been inspired by God to do such a perfect film!
10.0~This is the best movie ever made! ZanAmadio Sign in Permalink The first instalment of Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best movie ever made in the history of the world and I can't wait to see The Two Towers and Return of the King! I have been a huge fan of the books for more than half my life and have been waiting forever for somebody to make it a live action movie and actually do it the justice it deserves! These films are incredible, breathtaking! Film making at its absolute best! It's got tear jerking drama, amazing action, heart pounding adventure, and all built around a deeply moving human story. The casting is spot on, the music is beautiful, the cinemtography is out of this world, the effects the best anyone has ever seen, it's just simply the best movie ever! The book of the century is now finally the greatest movie epic ever, depicting the greatest story ever told! (But that's just my oppinion) :)
10.0~After 14 months, still outstanding cafcode Sign in Permalink It just gets better over time. A beautiful job. Everything holds up, with more and more nuances and small details coming out. I've seen this 5-6 times now, still outstanding; script, score, acting and casting.
1.0~Disappointed! pilch17 Sign in Permalink Totally over-rated! I'll be honest: i wasn't expecting much in the first place. But the film is lifeless, bland, dull, boring and was WORSE then I expected it to be. As the worst film I've ever seen, it runs pretty close to Pearl Harbour. As for "The Two Towers"? Well, even by threat of death I wouldn't see it. Awful!
1.0~Boring Darth_Khazel Sign in Permalink When books are transmitted to movie format, I can handle inconsistencies. But as a movie alone Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Rings cannot stand on its own. There are a couple of parts that you can't understand without reading the book. But looking past the inconsistencies is the outstanding trait of this just being a boring movie. Very little action, long dialog and dreary setting makes The Fellowship a bore. Beyond the production is (in regards to my own personal affections) a lack of enjoyable characters. I find that if I don't like the characters, I can't like the movie in question. Every one of persona annoyed me. How can you like a movie if the characters fall short of whatever story you're trying to tell? Though the acting was admirable, I'll give it that, Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring still can't make up for a lack of character and progression (action). Altogether boring, it makes a one star in my books.
10.0~One of the best movies I've ever seen... Chelsea Smith Sign in Permalink Lord of the Rings was awesome! I hadn't read the book prior to seeing the movie, but it was great anyway. I liked the movie so much I couldn't wait to read the book to get more info on LotR! I finished the first book, and I say that they made a GREAT adaptation of it. I mean, I didn't particularly LIKE the Tom Bombadil part, it was just...weird, I'm glad they left it out. I can't wait to see the next movie, I'm half way through the second book, and it's as good as the first one. The only reason I don't give it a perfect 10 is because I couldn't exactly follow the story. (Although after I read the book it made a bit more sense) I give this movie a 9 out of 10!
10.0~The Greatest Movie of all Time Stucco491 Sign in Permalink This was fantastic. I think Peter Jackson is a genius, and how they were able to film the locales from the books was amazing. I have read the books and noticed they left out some parts - which didn't disappoint me at all! I can't wait for the oncoming "Two Towers" and "Return of the King"!
1.0~Complete and total Crud TheNorris Sign in Permalink Well I went to this film not know what to expect so I had an open mind. I left about 2 hours into the film because it was so slow and mind numbly dull. I can appreciate that for a film to incorporate a massive novel it needs a long time to set the film so that people can get into it, however it starts off dull and never goes above mildy interesting. It is a slow film, I knew that from the beginning, however Apocolypse now was a slow film but that was never boring or tedious. The acting is dire, apart from Sir Ian McKellen who is alway a pleasure to watch. But I cannot feel that I was watching a Playstation computer game with nicely drawn people. All I know is that you will not see me at the next two films for no amount of money or wealth offered. Matt Norris
10.0~This movie had everything movies should have and more! LadyDivine Sign in Permalink I loved this film completely. I thought the acting was superb and the direction was outstanding. Peter Jackson is the undiscovered Steven Speilberg. Star Wars was neat, but a little technical. Lord of the rings is pure dream and detail! I loved it! If you have not yet seen this movie, then go and experience entertainment in it's truest form.
10.0~Beautifully Shot! jrenee80 Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson did an amazing job visually retelling these stories! I wish I could leap inside the television and live in Middle Earth. I have watched the movies about a dozen times each and I haven't gotten bored with it yet, in fact, it sometimes feels as though I'm watching it again for the first time. I have heard complaints about the endings, some say they are too many "almost endings" but I happened to like that just when I thought it would be over, another scene started. I also became emotionally invested in the characters. I'm not a big reader so I am so glad that I had the chance to know these stories I would have otherwise never experienced. I will be enjoying these films for years to come.
10.0~Absolutely stunning careax Sign in Permalink This film is without a doubt the best film I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot of great films. Even though I'd read the books beforehand and thus knew the storyline, I still got clammy palms throughout this cinematic masterpiece. Everyone I've met has been impressed by this movie, and for obvious reasons. The casting is perfect. The acting is outstanding. The scenary is breathtaking. Peter Jackson's directing is inspired. The special effects are mind-blowing. The action sequences totally rock. The music is beautiful. And the attention to detail in the props and buildings is excellent. I know a few purists have frowned on some of the plot changes in this movie, but if they'd have made the film exactly like the first book it would have been nine hours long, with the first four hours being very slow and pretty dull for most of the audience. As it is, most of the plot changes are inspired, and really add to the cinematic experience. I cannot wait until December 2002 when The Two Towers comes out! In the meantime I will be seeing The Fellowship a few more times. It is so rich and full that you still notice new details and marvel at its quality even after several viewings. That the acting in this film didn't sweep the Oscars says just how blind, corrupt and pathetic Hollywood really is. That this movie made so much money in the box office, and has gathered such a huge amount of praise and a vast throng of fanatical fans says much about the quality of this modern masterpiece. If you are a purist of Tolkien's novels or you feel uncomfortable around sword and sorcery stories maybe you should avoid this film. Otherwise you simply must see this instant classic!
10.0~For the record ..... DanB-4 Sign in Permalink When I began to write this, there were 4,053 registered user comments on this film. I doubt that anyone will ever read this, but as an avid IMDb user, I feel like it is almost my duty to register my comments. I loved this film. I had not read the books and it mercilessly left in the dust, but no matter. from sheer craftsmanship and filmmaking, it can be enjoyed. The special edition DVD is a must own. There is so much skill, care and (yes, I'll say it) love put into this film, that it is hard not to like. It requires a knowledge of the books, but that can be gained. Peter Jackson set out with a nearly impossible task of bringing Middle Earth to life and triumphed. I cannot call this in the all time top ten, but I think that in time, the three films will be viewed together as one of the most important event is film history. **** out of ****.
10.0~Good movie; good action! closeout Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is a great film. While a popular complaint is that it is a long, slow movie, I totally disagree with that. The film develops its plot at a good pace unlike other movies that force the entire plot(when they have a plot) down your throat. I'd compare it to Star Wars--epic, long, and fun. Hey, for the people that like LOTR(and we are lots of people), having the movie three hours long is a good thing; we get more movie for our buck! Still, I can see that people who don't like anything related with fantasy will find it boring...but what did you expect? But, there are some great action sequences. All of the action is very well done and none of it is over-the-top violence. There are five distinct battle scences along with several other thrilling sequences and the long journey in the Caves of Moria. Some other reviewers have stated that the action/violence is too much; I would disagree with you. Without the action sequences, LOTR would be Star Wars(only the original three will do thank you very much Mr. Lucas) without any starship fights or jedi duels...the action is part of the story(without overpowering the story)? The movie is also top quality in acting, sound, and effects. In my opinion, Boromir was the best character; he had the best internal battle: he wanted to take control of the ring to save his people when in fact he knew that it would corrupt him. Even thought he was a flawed character unlike Aragorn(cool character but not too deep as of yet), Boromir had my sympathy and I could understand his desire to wield the ring to protect his people. Sound was great...a little too much at times. And, the effects were top notch without being overdone. Unlike Star Wars: The Phanton Menace where the effects MADE the movie(actually Natalie Portman was the best effect but that's another story), the special effects in the LOTR seem to complement the story. My only problem with the story is that it doesn't have a hot blond princess in need of rescue(LOTR is like the Chronicles without Laurana...) SPOILERS BELOW: Aragorn chopping the head of the bad guy was tres cool! A little Gladiator-like but wayz cool! Maybe a bit violent for the kids... Boromir's death sequence was unbelievable(in a good way)! Sean Bean made Boromir's death seem confincing, painful, and heroic; most other heroic deaths are usually very silly but this one was "real." Why the hell didn't he get the Oscar for that? In the screenplay when Gandalf gets dragged down the chasm by the Balrog, he says, "Fly, you fools" where as in the movie he says, "Run, you fools!" In my opinion, the screenplay gets it right! END SPOILERS I just hope The Two Towers and Return of the King are equally good as Fellowship of the Ring...I have no reason to doubt it!!!
10.0~If you love fiction, a must see. smithremail Sign in Permalink This particular movie is centered around a survival of mankind. It illustrates several scenes of sorcery and demonolgy. There are a lot of special effects and computer generated images of hobbits. There is one scene where the image looks very realistic. There is one dwarfs all others are dead which are called mountain dwellers they lived in the earth. The hobbits lived in the shire and were little people. We have good fairies that fought along the side of humans. Evil kings who rode on dragon typed creatures called nastaf, also a good and bad wizard and demons that are called or-ks. Struggle for power and the right to exists. "Good versus evil".
1.0~Disappointed. Refuse to be insulted any further by Peter Jackson mpi2100 Sign in Permalink This poorly directed, miserably cast interpretation of what may be the most fantastic Fantasy Epic ever conceived made me restless when it wasn't boring me to sleep. I struggled through the 1st two movies before picking up a complete 4 in 1 hardback. The Book of the Ring was amazing to say the very least. JRR Tolkien magnificently created a wondrous, and enchanting world of passion, and revolution. Looking back on these movies in hindsight makes me want to take a dump on PJ's front doorstep. Do yourself a favor and read this series from the comfort of your own imagination instead of ruining it with this horrible cinematic tragedy.
10.0~A gargantuan filmmaking achievement FlickJunkie-2 Sign in Permalink Prior to this film, Director Peter Jackson was obscure even among the anonymous wannabes of the film industry. His resume consisted of a half a dozen indy films in the horror and comedy genres. If you took the budgets of all his prior films together, they wouldn't equal his salary for this franchise. He now owns the second highest grossing film in history. Talk about a Cinderella story! This film was somewhat of a personal obsession for Jackson. It took eight years from inception to completion. He originally pitched the idea to Miramax who agreed to take it on and then balked at the cost of a two movie deal and backed out. Desperate to save the project, he presented it to New Line Cinema and convinced them that if he filmed in New Zealand, used his own effects company and filmed all three movies back to back, he could make three films for less than the cost of two. They bought the project and gave him a record $270 Million budget for the three. He completed the filming for all three films in 16 months of continual shooting, a record. Jackson's task was daunting. He wanted to create a film with mass appeal that was true to the classic books. Considering the devoted following of Tolkien's trilogy, their preoccupation with the smallest trivia and the sheer volume of the works, this was an almost impossible task. Jackson decided to lean toward the action/adventure elements, while paying homage to aficionados with scenes that compressed the intricacies of the various cultures and contained allusions to various pieces of trivia that only devotees of the books would understand. The result is a terrific film that doesn't leave the books out of the screenplay. The transformation of the real world into the fantasy world is nothing short of fantastic. The combination of makeup, set decoration, costumes, New Zealand locations and special effects sets a new standard for this or any genre. The attention to detail is astounding from the elf ears to the hobbit toes. The ensemble cast does a fine job without any need for a superstar. Elijah Wood is lovable and believable as the dauntless Frodo. Wood has the perfect combination of childlike exuberance and steely resolve to play the ring bearer. Ian McClellan, who is a big ring fan himself, is perfectly cast as Gandalf. With almost 40 years in TV and films, McKellen is one of the veterans of the cast. He is a powerful dramatic actor and he renders Gandalf with great range. He is formidable and commanding in some scenes, and tender and paternal in the scenes with Frodo. Along with Christopher Lee (55 years in film) the battle of the elders is given enormous dramatic power. Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Aragon. Mortensen demanded to do all his own stunts and trained exhaustively at swordsmanship and other combat skills to make his fight scenes as realistic as possible. In one scene he had a tooth knocked out and after a quick trip to the dentist he was back on the set later that day. Ian Holm is wonderful as Bilbo Baggins. Holm captures the ageless hobbit with a youthful enthusiasm that belies his advanced age. This film is really more the first episode of a miniseries than a film that stands alone. By the end it is clear that we haven't yet reached the middle, even if you never read the books. Still, at three hours, it never drags. It is a tremendous filmmaking achievement that redefines the fantasy genre and sets production standards that will be difficult to equal. It is fabulously entertaining for audiences of all ages. One cannot see this film and not be eager for the next episode to be released. I rated it a 10/10. It is motion picture history in the making.
10.0~An Instant Classic!! KiefD Sign in Permalink Only time will tell if The Lord of the Rings will be ranked among those of The Godfather and Citizen Kane but for now it is at least on par with Star Wars and high above any other Fantasy film of recent memory. Suffers from a lack of climax but that won't be a problem when all three films are complete as a trilogy. Truley shines in the special effects department. Ian McKellen and Sean Bean accomplish the most in acting. Always great to see Christopher Lee in ANYTHING. Has an overall polish. The story just seems to glide along (there are no hicups or rough patches). New Zealand is Middle Earth! Recommended to anyone who loves an epic!
10.0~Big screen experience lbeska@hotmail.com Sign in Permalink This is an absolutely wonderful movie, definitely something to experience on the big screen. I am not a fan of Tolkiens books and was dragged under protest to see this movie but I found it well worth it. If you want to experience another world, (so realistic that I felt that there was a parallel universe out there with wizards, hobbits, orcs and elves) this movie is absolutely a must.
1.0~One of the most awful movies of all time fight_clubbin Sign in Permalink From day one this movie has been called a classic.Even before its release it was already recognised as a classic.That fact shows that this movie was going to be called a 'classic' whether it was good or bad.This is one of the most droll movies that was ever made.It was not paced well,most of the acting was bad except for Viggo Mortensen, but the most irritating aspect of this movie was the number of times Elijah Wood opened his hand revealing the ring (half the movie was him opening his hand and a showing the ring).The only good aspect of the film was the special effects and some of the action scenes.This movie doesn't even come close to classics like The Godfather,Memento,Fight Club and 100s of other brilliant films.This movie should be on the Top 10 worst movies of all time not #4 on the Top 250.
10.0~This is my fave movie!!!!! nalbrecht84 Sign in Permalink I wanted to read the books before I went to see the movie. So I bought the fellowship of the ring and the two towers (knowing later i'd go buy the reutrn of the king). And as i read i never took the story in but once i saw the movie i have become more involved then ever. I have seen the film 3 times and plan to see it again and buy it when it comes out. I check the websites each day and download videos and evrything. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as the hobbits were by far my favourite characters, they are all talented and amazing in their owns way and brought the four hobbits to life. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn was perfect and he played the part wonderfully. The rest of the cast were great too and Peter Jackson should be proud. Every thing that happens for this film and cast they deserve. I can't wait to see the next two films.
10.0~Awesome BadgleyMishkafan Sign in Permalink I think this movie rocked. It stuck so close to the book it was just excellent.This movie has action love some scary and freaky looking creatures. I highly recomend this movie. But after you see it or even before I would recomend the book.
10.0~A Visual (& audio) Feast! jbirtel Sign in Permalink First...A disclaimer! (and trivia; for those who care) Lord of the Rings is NOT a trilogy, despite popular perception. It ranks as one of the longest single novel that's been written and consists of 6 books: BOOK I "The First Journey" and BOOK II "The Journey of the Nine Companions" comprise FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. BOOK III "The Treason of Isengard" and BOOK IV "The Journey of the Ringbearers" are THE TWO TOWERS. BOOK V "The War of the Ring" and BOOK VI "The End of the Third Age" concludes THE RETURN OF THE KING.(the titles were part of Tolkien's manuscript but were never used). That said, the upcoming TWO TOWERS & RETURN...are not sequels and shouldn't be viewed as such. So There !!! Like Peter Jackson, I can't wait till the entire trilo...oops, I mean the entire story can be viewed back to back on DVD at 10 hours plus. Oh! the movie. It's great! On 1st viewing, there were more things I liked then didn't, but my perception was prejudiced from my own interpretation cemented thru many years (I read it 8 or 9 times over 20 years). But on repeated viewings, I came to appreciate the brilliance behind the maker's decisions on how to tackle the telling that would appeal to readers and non-readers alike (face it! there's no way to please EVERYBODY). Compromises were necessary; so it wasn't to the letter of the book. What was captured faithfully were the set-pieces, the characters (fleshed out beyond expectation) and the spirit of the excitement & thrills. This is what cinema should be. Those who liked the movie (readers and non) will appreciate a repeat viewing that is near improbable to catch the first time. SUBTLE SPOILER:(that's Gollum's voice screaming "Shire" then "Baggins", seconds later the Nine Riders exit the gates of Barad-dur [the Dark Lord's tower]. Immediately what follows is Gandalf's approach toward Minas Tirith [nice long shot] that will be more prevalent as the city besieged in RETURN OF THE KING. And of course, readers will recognize Tom, Bert and Bill, the trolls from "The Hobbit". This is just a few bits of treasure laced thru-out the movie). (more subtle spoilers) I admired the slight changes made. I never did believe Frodo could've stayed on that horse by himself, in his condition, on his final flight from the Nine Riders (unless the horse sprouted an extra pair of hands to hold him) so Arwen's expanded role seemed totally justified. It also gave the filmaker's an opportunity to expand the role of women as heroes, that was sadly minimized in the trilo...darn-it!...I mean the epic (I almost take that back as the character "Eowyn" will prove in the upcoming sequ... I mean, installments of the story). Also, the Tom Bombadil episode was an amusing trifle...for the novel (I did like it), but I always wondered how anyone could film that section without producing unintentional laughter from the audience. It's ommission is ok by me, as the first part of the movie really belongs to the thrill of the chase and the terror of capture from the Nine. There are so many nice things said about the performances, the music, the locales, the props (wonderful) that's been said better then I can (most of all...Jackson and the collaborater's vision) so, no sense in repeating it here. It's not totally flawless...but realistically...what is?? As far as it's slight from the American Academy Awards as Best Picture...big deal! (It did win the British Award and American Film Inst. Award) No lack of any award robbed my enjoyment from Citizen Kane, Chinatown, Wizard of Oz (I equally loved the movies that did win_) and the lack of Best Picture won't take any pleasure away from Fellowship.. (please don't interpret that I'm lumping these movies on the same level - I'm just making a point - then again, maybe I am) For those who didn't enjoy it as much, that's understandable. No movie in history has been unanimous amoung critics, or viewers for that matter. I wasn't sure how much I enjoyed it the first time, but after many repeat viewings, I surrender! 10 out of 10
10.0~A MARVELLOUS EXPERIENCE ross-landy Sign in Permalink I really think that people who criticize a movie so readily should consider if they would be able to do a better job themselves! In fact, if one hasn't read the book, they should not be qualified to comment on whether the movie ended too abruptly, or speculate on when and why certain events are included in the movie. One minor complaint I had was that the elves (e.g. Elrond) could have been better depicted with some supernatural beauty, apart from that I think this movie is excellent and has no boring moments, in fact every minute is well filled. Everyone who's seen this movie should also read the entire book trilogy in order to understand the context better, or has most of the population become too lazy to read? I read the book (it took about a month) before the movie came out and am planning to re-read The Two Towers before the second movie comes out. I was also a bit disappointed by the scene where the Fellowship are waiting to enter Moria (here the events differ from in the book) but overall the movie was well directed and captured well the peace and tranquillity of the Shire and the contrasting menace of Mordor.
10.0~OMG this kind of stuff makes me remember why i hate idiot people Bear-144 Sign in Permalink Ok I'll admit when i first saw this movie I absolutely recalled back to the book i fell into my imagination, back to the many times i read it , and i arrived back into middle -earth once again when i saw this movie, i do wish it was longer so that they could have built a little more on the relationships between the group, but then there would be more ( idiot people crying :(( boo f-ing hoo. Ok what i was going to admit was that when i first saw the movie i thought that the high i was on was just that i had just seen the movie, it would go away like other movies i just see and really like, but nine times later i dont think that at all, i can watch it over and over and i never thought anything would knock "Glory" off my # 1 movie but it has. For the idiot people i was talking about (and u know who u are) the ones complaining about the way it ends. Maybe read the book and you'll know they had to end there. then the other idiot people the ones giving FOTR a 1 just so Shawshank and Godfather will climb again. grow up. this sight is so u can vote how u feel about a movie if u love Shawshank and Godfather than all means vote a ten but dont cheat a great movie like FOTR just so your movie is better all you're doing is cheating you're self and making IMDB a joke and not worthy of a top 100 movie sight. oh yea 10/10 and i didnt stoop and give god or shawshank a 1 just to make FOTR better i gave them what i think they deserve. so lets all grow up
9.0~Another World koruyucu-ss-dk-248-701883 Sign in Permalink How to get acquainted with another world? Answer. Remember childhood. Everything you embrace with excitement. Your curiosity. While trying to discover your own world with them, it is a new world that comes to mind: Middle-earth. Endless, endless, pushing your imagination. A world you never want to leave. A world that is born of a unique author but too big to fit in his life. The first film of the trilogy is just the key hole in this world. Have you looked at it once? No more turning back. It is a haven for people like me who are bored in the real world, an escape route.
5.0~Did Mr. Jackson ever read the books? swlamboy Sign in Permalink Trying to be as objective as possible from the stand-point of one of the "purist", my humble question is: Did Mr. Jackson ever read the books? Or more importantly, did Ms. Walsh ever read the books? After all, is it not the responsibility of the true screen writer to condense and translate (while remaining true to the original works) the written word to a format suitable for filming? While no one can deny that the cinematography, graphics, special effects and even the casting (in most cases) deserves the highest praise. It is the loss of the true spirit of the literary work, that irks me most. While I can forgive the omission of many key characters (the films would have been ten times longer), I can not forgive the changes made to what motivated the remaining characters; the blatant changes in events and the placement of characters; the addition of scenes and events that never happened in the book; and of who did what, when and especially why! For the "purists" I would not recommend these films, your will be utterly disappointed and dismayed. For those who don't care, or have never read the books -go -you'll have fun -enjoy!
10.0~Maybe you think it wasn't good enough julfly Sign in Permalink I know, for those who haven't read the books, or those who have read the books but expected to see something like....I don't know...the best-movie-ever-made-that-everybody-would-love-and-never-forget, maybe after watching this first part of The Lord of the Rings, you felt like if this was an "unfinished" thing, or just asked yourselves why was it that people were making a big fuss for nothing. But, let me tell you something, it's my personal opinion, but just remember every little scene you've seen when you were sitting there on the cinema, and wait for this end of year to see the second part of the trilogy. Be sure you'll finally understand those things you didn't. And, besides the fact that Peter Jackson left a lot of things that should have been included behind, this movie "The Lord of the Rings" is going to be the-first-part-of-the-trilogy-that-everybody-would-love-and-never-forget. Good Luck, Julia
8.0~An epic movie of a once-in-a-lifetime sort. pacharacfc Sign in Permalink Director Peter Jackson has not only attempted the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he's pulled it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, too.
10.0~OUTSTANDING IN EVERY RESPECT! Khwaj Sign in Permalink I don't care what many might think about this, Lord of the Rings rocked me to the "Beyond" and back. Powerful visions of the past, epic battles since films like Braveheart, Gladiator and Brotherhood of the Wolf. It packed plenty of punches than a dozen Mike Tyson's put together. Although I hadn't read the books it didn't dissuade me in any way whatsoever to watch this film. Hats off to actors Sir Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee and of course the lovely Sean Bean and Cate Blanchett. Forget Titanic, this by far is more than just a technical accomplishment or creative input. I really do hope that it sweeps the Academy Awards which it will no doubt do. Birds, beasts, demons this film also very much reminded me of gothic visions of other directors like Dario Argento and the late great Lucio Fulci with there dark brooding imaginations featured in their body of works.. . For example the scene where Gandalf confronts the gigantic demon was without a doubt the single most spectacular scene that really does shake the very grounds of the film's sequence. I know I might sound like a real boot kissing art fag for liking this film a little too much, but on the other hand the visuals are most definately the single biggest advantage besides the acting as well. I know I also that not reading the book I might sound biased too, but then again it's personal opinions that really matter. I just hope that the follow up (Two Towers) also lives up to what Fellowship of the Rings offered us. Instant classic 10/10
10.0~Brilliant, but the full movie (released Nov. 12) on DVD is better Echaad Sign in Permalink I am a Lord of The Rings fan. Fan being short for (Fan)atic, I admit to that as well. I didn't get into Lord of The Rings until my better half read it to me, starting with The Hobbit, and then through the three books (actually one book, Tolkien didn't want it split into three, but the publisher insisted, saying that it was too long). After it was read to me, I went and read it to myself several times and I still need to read it several more. It is brilliant on so many levels. I was prepared to dislike the movie, particularly when I learned of the many omissions, and indeed when it came to Lothlorien and Galadriel (played extremely well by Cate Blanchett, although some seem to feel it wasn't well played and I cannot understand that, she did a brilliant job) gave only ONE GIFT, the phial of light to Frodo, I almost hit the roof. Peter Jackson who keeps saying (on his commentary track and elsewhere) that he doesn't like the term "Director's Cut" nonetheless DOES state that the material returned to the movie, over HALF AN HOUR (a fifth of the film!) does improve it. He even states that the "truncated" (his word, not mine) version of the Lothlorien portion of the movie was not as good, that the longer version was much better. If that isn't saying that he prefers his "director's cut" I don't know what is! Okay, let him call it the "full cut" or "complete version" or whatever he likes, I think that if Dances with Wolves could come in at three hours, certainly some of the half hour could have been included, particularly where the absence thereof will create confusion. When at the beginning of the second movie they eat Lembas, what will those who haven't seen the full cut think? "What is Lembas?" "Why are those cloaks special?" "Where did those daggers come from?" "That amazing rope Samwise Gamgee has, where did it come from and why is it magical?" Yes, well.. THAT'S EXACTLY why Peter Jackson REQUIRED that the FULL CUT be made available PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF The Two Towers. He can say he doesn't like the term Director's cut all he wishes, but the fact is, he required that the real cut, the real version, the Director's cut (because that is what it is) be made available so that those who care CAN SEE the FULL movie and understand things that otherwise would be confusing, particularly to those who haven't read the books. There is so much connective, important, material that was left out.. I don't think the movie lost dramatic pace with it put back in. To the contrary, because it makes more sense and things are far more clear, the movie is better. The truncated version of crucial scenes does no one any favors. The movie is long ANYWAY. Might as well have it be long and make sense and be the best movie it can be. We got the "Gift Set" that includes the fifth DVD by National Geographic and the book ends modelled on the Argonath -- for the true fan, it's a good buy, but if you wish to save money, but still enjoy the true movie and the "Appendices" (which go so far beyond anything ever provided in a DVD that there are no sufficient descriptive terms -- you simply have to view them. Two full DVDS of history making material that is utterly fascinating. They were making history and they knew it and they documented it in such as way as to make it as exciting as possible, and exciting and interesting it is, not just for the fanatic. Read the books.. See the "extended" version of the movie, THEN go and see the next movie. After you see the next movie you'll be waiting for the half hour or so that will have been deleted from that one and after comparing the theatrical version and the DVD version just released of the first one, you'll understand why I say that. Theatrical version: Quite good Complete version: Excellent, beyond what I thought could be done in a movie. Not to be missed, and I don't say that of very many movies at all. But do read the books if you can.. no matter how brilliant the movies are, the books are far more brilliant, they have to be. Tolkien's work is a true masterwork the like of which has not been seen. He created several fully fledged languages for the series. Two Elven tongues, a dwarvish tongue, and so much more. This is brilliant masterwork at it's highest and no, it isn't as accessible as a popular novel, you have to work a bit, but the story carries you along, and if you sharpen your intellect while reading and thinking about these books it is only your gain. Read, view, enjoy. This is one of those that is truly worth it.
10.0~The Very Reason We Go to the Theater to See Movies!!! Ozymandias_the_King Sign in Permalink Epic has been used to describe many films, such as "Braveheart", "The Godfather", "Dances With Wolves", etc. Such films deserve to be labeled as such. "Fellowship of the Ring" defines the word epic. This film has captured the very essence of the books, by being more than we ourselves have imagined, and more well defined than we ever dreamed. Peter Jackson did a phenomenal job in bringing the book to film with stunning visual effects in grand scope. The telling of the story is more than just the fantastic performances of the brooding Viggo Mortensen, the magical Ian McKellen, the impressive Sean Astin, or the inspiring Sean Bean. It is also the magnificent manner in which Peter Jackson utilizes the big screen experience. The stellar landscapes, extraordinary scenery, and spectacular soundtrack help to make this film the very reason that we go to the theater to see movies.
10.0~Gave reader a great look at the world they imagined... TheEvilNiffler Sign in Permalink It gave people a new in depth feeling that they didn't get from the books. It enthralled you and made you feel a part of the world. The directer did an awesome job. It couldn't have been done better. This is a must-see if you have or havent read the books. It had me on the edge of my seat even though I knew what was going to happen. It should have been best movie of the year. I think it matched Harry Potter in excellence.
10.0~An Epic Adventure with Magnificent Scenery Boombooms2003 Sign in Permalink I had read The Hobbit earlier in the year for the first time before I even knew that they were coming out with The Lord of the Rings movies, so when I found out that they were making these movies, I got all excited and immediately I was drawn to wanting to see them. And in seeing the first installment, I am indeed amazed by how it was able to capture all of Tolkien's magic in the movie to the smallest little detail. Watching the movie, I felt I was right there with them experiencing the action alongside them. The actors did amazing jobs fully taking in their characters and embracing their personality. The scenery was amazing as it was beautiful and how much I wanted to believe a place like that really exists. It was such a beautiful movie and I cannot wait for the next ones to come out!
9.0~Thrilling movie for a rainy day grafkyl Sign in Permalink This movie is full of action and mayhem at its finest. Tolkien's novel is vividly unfolded in this adaption of the famous book. The Nazgul are well done, as are the landscapes. However, the scene with the Balrog vs Gandalf and the mordor landscape, plus the eye of sauron can be very terrifying for children, even me an 18 year old. The way they depict Moria is outstanding, and it is generally a good film. Keep in mind that the balrog, Moria and the dead dwarfs, the eye of sauron and the orcs will scare little children. And Saruman might frighten children as well. Orlando Bloom as Legolas was a great choice and yes the scenes are intense. Otherwise it is a great film.
10.0~A masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all time marshall89 Sign in Permalink This movie is sheer brilliance. I can't believe I didn't watch it until just recently! The Fellowship of The Ring packs an incredible wallop with superb settings and designs, exciting battles, and a 5 star cast. Famous actors Ian Mckellen and Christopher Lee (One of my favorite actors) contribute timeless performances, and the rest of the cast leaves me speechless. Elijah Wood plays the main role of Frodo Baggins spectacularly, Sean Bean is cool, Viggo Mortensen is thrilling, and what can I say about Orlando Bloom? I LOVED HIS CHARACTER(Legolas Greenleaf)!!!! I also really like the guy with the big beard and the axe. Wasn't that John Rhys-Davies? Anyways, this movie also moves well with its imaginative plot, courtesy of J.R.R. Tolkien. The Lord of The Rings will never let you escape for a second, with amazing battle scenes that feature a meagre number of battlers take out an entire army of trolls and baddies in outstanding fashion. There's also the captivating visual effects to grab you. As yet another plus, Peter Jackson perfectly illustrates Tolkien's story on the screen. So, yep. This movie is one of the greatest films of all time and is one of my most highly recommended favorites. It also gives me three important things to do: 1, read the book. 2, see The Two Towers. And 3, get this on DVD! My rating: 4.5 out of 5.
10.0~a film that defined a genre. filmboy-1 Sign in Permalink This film is a wonderful excursion into fantasy and adventure. Again, yes the film has it's flaws, but what movie doesn't? A few characters and situations were changed or omitted because of time restraints, not to mention to continue the flow of the film. In comparing this to Star Wars, note that this is toward the current prequels; not the original trilogy which began a revolution in moviemaking and moviegoing. The prequels don't compare in quality to those films. The fact is that the LOTR books predate Star Wars by a couple of decades, of which George Lucas borrowed a few sources from. I'm sorry, but the prequels just don't match up to LOTR OR the original SW trilogy, so it's not unfair at all.
10.0~Don't bother watching unless you read the book. shawnamabrey Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** There are two reasons to not watch this movie unless you have read the book: one is that it will bore the heck out of you, and the other is that you might really like it but have spoiled the read, not becoming acquainted with the full storyline by reading the book first. Personally, I read the book (er,trilogy) first. For many Tolkien fans, all this movie had to do was not suck. Tolkien fans have been robbed of a good cinematic interpretation of the book for so long that giving the TLOR in film was like giving a starving man a cracker. I waited until my 24th birthday to go and see this film and would get upset at my friends if any of them tried to tell me their opinion of the movie before I had seen it. It was very important to me that I have NO expectations. I did not want to be disappointed. Well, I wasn't. From the opening narrative I was enthralled. I now believe this film was executed towards one primary purpose: to make the Tolkien fans happy. Every detail and scene was inspired by original illustrations of the many artists who have painted or drawn scenes from TLOR over the decades. Rivendell was so perfectly portrayed it actually brought tears to my eyes (and I'm no crybaby). I was actually overcome with emotion at really seeing what my mind's eye had seen for so long. I think many viewers, myself included, had the feeling that this film BELONGED to them. This film was cast,scored and directed long before Jackson ever put his hands on it. This was MY film. Jackson did a good job of not getting in the way of MY film too much. Obviously I am making an argument for the emotional reasons that many enjoyed this film. On the other side, I completely understand how somebody who never read the book would find it boring. It has been long enough since I went to see the film that I can be objective and look at the flaws. In fact, there were a few flaws I found while watching it, and I'll mention those first. Elijah Wood, in my opinion, was not hobbitish at all. I never thought of hobbits as boyish and undeveloped-even if they are young in age as Frodo was. Dudley Moore is really the only hobbit-type who comes to mind right now. I admit Sean Austin did have that perfect affability a hobbit should have, but he too was not quite right. I don't recall who played Bilbo, but he was MUCH better (and provocative I might add). The main gripe I have about the hobbits was their makeup. It is obvious that they were made to look much more human than they actually were written to be. Hobbits are not dainty and hairless! Capturing the look of a hobbit was missed in the film, and unfortunately, was a major flaw. The original book WAS titled The Hobbit, after all. My next gripe is about the battle scenes. While some have commented on how good they were, I found them tiresome due to the weird camera angles and overdone graphics. The only battle scene I appreciated was the unoriginal, though wonderfully epic, battle in which what's-his-name chops the hand off of the big bad ugly dude. This leads me on to my next point: none of the monsters seemed that scary and were almost all way overdone. I felt at times that I was being catapulted back into an early 80's flashback of Iron Maiden and other cheese heavy metal bands album covers. Or was it a WWF lineup for Halloween? The music was also a bit obvious. I am sure we all like our Enya when we take our bubblebaths, but I thought the artist's familiarity detracted from the originality of the rest of the film. I like Enya, but this song was weak and went nowhere. Whatever happened to the Led Zeppelin or even the Jethro Tull era of music-the time when TLOR was at the height of its popularity? Enya seemed the Celine Dion of fantasy cinema, and I don't mean in a good way (I pray I'm safe here in assuming any self-respecting Tolkien fan steers clear of Celine). Her music and even the original score were just a wee bit overdone, me thinks. There were certain scenes when I wondered if the music could get any louder. On to my favorite scenes in the film. Hobbiton was executed with perfection. I'm only sorry there wasn't more film time for it, but hopefully in the sequel. The only qualm I had was the Bilbo's hobbit hole was not quite as lavish as described in the book, and I would have enjoyed the eye candy (that is, after all, what this film essentially was about). The guy who played Gandalf was superp, and I know others will hate me for bringing Hollywood names into it, but I'd have really liked to see Sean Connery as Sauron and Anthony Hopkins as Gandalf. Still, they were both played wonderfully and my favorite scene was when they first met in Sauron's castle. I thought Rivendell was fabulous, but again, the elves also looked too human! The flight scene with Arwen was good and Liv Tyler was well-cast, and the languages of the elves was absolutely perfect. I have actually studied the languages and could see they did have to improvise since it was never really a complete language to begin with, and it was done beautifully. Objectively, I can see how somebody who has not read the book would find the movie a total bore. In fact I know I would have not made it through three hours. But having read the book, I was wishing the movie was 30 hours long! I liked the movie for emotional reasons, and though that doesn't make me a fair critic, I hope the movie's success will continue to encourage people to go and read the trilogy to understand what everyone was talking about. Despite the film's obvious flaws and lack of appeal to newbies, I still have to give this film 9 out of 10 stars due to it's visual and fan-pleasing integrity-which is practically unheard of with books-turned-movie. I might buy a larger television just to watch it when it comes out on DVD.
10.0~great movie adaptation of a truly challenging work Allen-31 Sign in Permalink I probably can't heap any more praise than has already been offered on top of this film. It is simply wonderful. And I say this as a Tolkien fan who has read the books at least a dozen times since the fifth grade. (I am 34 now.) Of course there were cuts to be made. LOTR is not a cinematically constructed novel. And I don't mind how Peter Jackson made his cuts and changes. Obviously there isn't going to be long exposition about the myriad of historial references to Middle Earth. Peter Jackson managed to capture the essence of the story without sacrificing much. Of course, like many Tolkien fans, I have a list of things that I wish were different. But none of these really detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film. Glad Bombadil didn't make it into the script at all. The ONLY important fact of the journey from the Shire to Bree was the nature of the swords that the hobbits recovered from the barrow after Bombadil rescued them, but even that is probably too much info to try to explain in the film narrative. Bombadil is a great character, but his involvement is isolated and contributes nothing to the development of the rest of the story after he and the hobbits part company before reaching Bree. Better he was left out all together. I also didn't take issue with the lack of seeing Legolas and Gimli becoming such great friends in the first film, mainly because the bulk of that happens in The Two Towers. If Jackson downplays it there, then it will be worth critisizing at that point. Arwen? Didn't really bother me. She is making up for the loss of a couple of minor characters (Glorfindel, Elrond's sons who join the battle later on). And if her romance with Aragorn can be played up a bit instead of acknowlegded but invisible as it was in the novel, it will make for a lot more dramatic tension when Eowyn's obvious liking for Aragorn twangs a few unrequited heartstrings later on. If I had to list the films weakest points, I would mention the following: I didn't care for interpreting Merry and Pippin as mostly comic relief. I can't image that Peter Jackson won't correct this in the upcoming films since they play important parts in the development of the war. But I wish Jackson has preserved SOME of their original motivation. Merry, Pippin and Sam knew of the Ring from their years of friendly spying on Bilbo, Frodo, and Gandalf, and when they came to know how important and dangerous it was, they were determined to help Frodo "through thick and thin." Making them funny, accidental companions didn't do their characters much justice. I really missed Pippin telling off Elrond when Elrond declared he was against Pippin being part of the Fellowship. "Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison or send me home tied in a sack. Otherwise I shall follow the company." Brave words from a truly devoted friend and much preferable to his rambling, comic speech in the film that I think should have disqualified him from going on a mission to save the world. Not enough Lothlorien and Galadriel. The special edition DVD is supposed to correct this. I can't wait. I thought the time spent on the collapsing staircase scene in Moria could have been devoted instead to more plot and/or character development (like Merry and Pippin). Not that it wasn't exciting and well done, but with the Balrog in pursuit this additional 3-4 minute action sequence invented solely for the movie could have easily been dropped for important things that actually happened in the novel. But despite these flaws, a truly wonderful and awe-inspiring adaptation of a very good story that is hard to adapt. My hats off to Peter Jackson, the cast, and crew. Can't wait for films two and three.
1.0~Lord Of The Rings: The most overrated movie since the beginning of time. (Lazy Review  Some Spoilers) hazzers Sign in Permalink Let's get one thing straight: I'm going to be... controversial... daring... notorious... I'm not going to say that this movie was "good". Shock. Horror. I was looking over the top 250 movies on imdb, and there was Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring sitting in fourth place. FOURTH place? How can this movie be the fourth greatest movie to EVER be created? How? Especially when you find masterpieces such as Schindler's List, American Beauty and Das Boot propping up the pile. It's not a surprise; there's no doubt in my mind that the next two films will also grace the top ten: all three of them, gleaming in a line. But why? Am I the only person in the entire world who DOESN'T think this is "one of the greatest films of all time", "best ever", "sensational"? It's amazing  but when I was asked, "What did you think of Lord of the Rings?" and I had the plain audacity to reply with "It's alright, I s'pose  average", I was greeted with an array of shocked faces. It's like the film no one can criticise. And if you do, you're clearly insane, and deserve to be locked up. As for what I made of the film itself, it started off well  characters developing nicely, interesting storyline. It was once Frodo set off with the ring that things went downhill. This probably originates from the book, but why was everything hidden in the mountains of doom, in the land of evil behind the trees of terror? Did everything really have to be that over-the-top? Even down to the whole: black = bad, white >good? I've not read the book (I also never, ever intend to)  I'm ignorant, clueless, no chance of ever getting it', BUT... when I came out of the cinema, I couldn't even tell you the names of half the characters, let alone anything about their personalities. You form a fellowship, and you'd expect one or two alliances/disagreements to occur. Barely anything. In fact, I was surprised any of them even cared when Gandalf fell over the edge. There was just no depth. It was all action, action, action  and no relationships or much development of characters. Even in The Terminator, you at least knew one or two things about the main characters. What makes a great masterpiece of a film is having action, drama, strong characters, etc. As far as I can tell, the only plus side of this film is the special effects. A few other points to add... Firstly, half-way through the film, when they arrived at the Elvin village, it almost felt like the film was over. There was all the closure of, "we're safe now..." and not even any cross-cutting back to the black riders. When the fellowship finally set off (a good hour and a half into the film!) it felt like another film was starting. Gollum  the most un-scary thing. Ever. Oh, and the scene where the fellowship were hiding, and one of the hobbits knocked something over  was that meant to be quite so funny? Aragorn and Boromir look near-identical. This is most confusing. 3 hours is just too long. Unless the film is worth it. And this one isn't. I dread to think what sitting through the director's cut must be like... If anyone out there agrees with me, track down the spoof version of this by French and Saunders. That is sheer brilliance. Anyway, I'm off to live in a cave until 2010, when the Lord of the Rings hype should've died down sufficiently. Unless it's anything like Star Wars. In which case, I'll see you 30 years. I can't help but wonder, I wonder if this film would've been successful if not for the huge amount of propaganda and anticipation, which just wasn't deserved? But then again, if this film hadn't been so successful, would I have been so critical? It was probably worth a 7 out of 10. However, it painted itself as an off-the-scale 10. So I'll give it a 1 instead. Ha.
10.0~A Truly Magnificent Film smkjws2 Sign in Permalink I like any other reader of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy believed that middle earth could not have been brought to life in a film because it is its own fantastic world. but when i went to the showing I was absolutely amazed and i was also heart broken when i watched the Academy Awards, if Shakespeare in love should get an award over Saving Private Ryan then the Lord of the Rings without a doubt should have beaten a Beautiful Mind (i do like a beautiful mind). anyways back to the movie. the scenery was fantastic, obvious that New Zealand is the only place in the world that can be recognized as middle earth. Cast was not incredibly great but i appreciated Mortensen as Aragon and McKellen as Gandalf, but the real standout was the smaller part of the great Christopher Lee as my favorite character Sauromon. This movie is a must for all LOTR readers and everyone else, truly the beginning of a great trilogy and a taste of whats to come.
6.0~Great spectacle, bad script worldblee Sign in Permalink Tracking all the making of information leading up to the film, it seemed like Jackson was doing a great job. The scenery, props, casting, makeup, and effects all seemed beautifully authentic. And in action, they deliver. But the script (it's always a danger when you see three writers and one of them is the director) spoils the magic. It's more than making Arwen's role more significant (and a completely different character) in a blatant attempt to beef up the roles for women. I didn't like that, but women's roles are admittedly sadly lacking in the original story. It's that Jackson puts his clumsy fingerprints all over Tolkien's themes and tells the story from the perspective of Men. Apparently, modern moviegoers need to identify with their race. (Side note: all the critics who say how the movie has preserved the magic of the books probably haven't read them since college.) The relationship between the four hobbits isn't set up at all in the movie; aside from Frodo the other three hobbits seem thrown into the quest by chance. Rather than being a reluctant, conflicted hero, Frodo is praised by all the other characters but actually does little but squeal, get stabbed, and look on the elves in wonder. Saruman (a lesser character in the fiction who only appears the first book through Gandalf's recollection) takes up far too much time in the movie. And by the end we've seen Sauron's eye so much I wonder there's anything to reveal of the dark lord in the second and third movies. I expected changes, but I fail to see the rationale for many of Jackson's edits--they don't make the story better or the action flow more smoothly. The Lord of the Rings is an elegiac tale of the passing of magic from the world and of the heroic struggles of those races passing from the world to preserve goodness. In Jackson's eyes, history is told from the perspective of the victors, the Men. Hobbits, who drive the action in the books, are along for the ride while Aragorn, Boromir, et al are the real protagonists in the movie. I give Jackson full credit for taking on a task of this scale and achieving an epic feel. If only he'd started with a script as good as his scenery.
10.0~The Platinum DVD version LBytes Sign in Permalink I originally commented on the theatrical release and original DVD. This is an update to those comments. The Platinum DVD is the version to own, period. It does not fix a couple of things that bothered me about the original version. One added scene has a color palette so different that it should've been left out if not correctable. But, but this version fleshes out the characters and the story in a pleasing way that I can give it a 10 without hesitation. I guess it was just too long for the theaters.
10.0~Oh my God stuntman298 Sign in Permalink I personally believe that Lotr is by far the best movie I have ever seen, I'm not a big fan of this type of movie, but I feel in love with it the 1st time I saw it, I have now seen it more times that I could possibly count. The movie is stunning in ever senses of the word. Its visual arts and sound blow you away, not to mention the great acting done by the entire cast. I recommend this film to every person I see. I can't wait to see how Two Towers turns out. The Stuntman
9.0~A treasure for all. iant61166 Sign in Permalink As a lover of the book of long standing, some 22 years it was with a mix of trepidation and anticipation that I viewed this film. I had had my ticket for several weeks for the earliest showing in my region and the day off work booked. The only draw back was a late arrival back from Malta which meant that I got to bed at 5am on opening day and my ticket was for 10 am. This meant that Pro Plus and coffee were the order of the day, but I would not miss this film for the sake of sleep. Prior to the performance the cinema was playing the Beatles and I saw the SW ep 2 trailer for the first time, a confluence of 2 of my other great loves and obsessions. From the opening scene I was hooked and knew that Peter Jackson had produced a masterpiece as my eyes drank in the rich detail of the depiction of the bucolic nature of Shire life. As a fan I saw the small faults, the glossing over of 17 years between the departures of Frodo and Bilbo and the absence of Bombadill. However I also realised that this was a adaptation of the masterpiece and was functioning for a different medium so should be judged as a stand alone not as the book, I can re-read the book anytime that I wish. As the film progressed my expectations were surpassed beyond all hope culminating in the scenes in Moria which were simply the most exciting scenes I had seen on a screen up until that time. Remember when Sean Bean as Boromir says " They have a cave troll " we simply accept the existence of such a creature without question. We were IN Middle Earth! Over the next few days as I considered the experience my conclusions remained the same. This was a success beyond all hope, Aragorn was brought to life, Galadriel was terrible and beautiful but I believed that the character most brought to life was Sam Gamgee by Sean Astin
7.0~Bored rakeysh Sign in Permalink I think I can watch this film a billion times and not get bored. Today I saw LOTR for the third time and I noticed a few details.
10.0~A movie experience beyond my wildest expectations... Ophelia-23 Sign in Permalink When I first started watching this movie in the theater, I expected a Harry-Potter like fantasy adventure. I was pleasantly surprised that it was much more than that. The bonding of the characters and depth of emotion captured on the screen surpasses anything I have seen before. I applaud Peter Jackson for defying all movie-making traditions to bring to life the wonderful Tolkien trilogy, which I read long ago. Every detail, every word of dialog, the cinematography, the costumes, the acting, the scope of this movie alone is phenomenal, much less when considered along with the Two Towers, and the final installment yet to come. The release of the second movie inspired me to watch the Fellowship of the Ring again and again. After multiple viewings, I still find other nuances and layers of meaning revealed. Other movies I have been to recently do not hold a candle to the Fellowship of the Ring or the Two Towers. I fear the Oscars will ignore the Two Towers this year. The Academy doesn't know what to do with this ground-breaking project Peter Jackson has brought to the screen. It deserves a special award of its own. The fans' reward will be forever etched in our hearts. Thank you Peter Jackson for this masterpiece!
10.0~Excellent director's work sly13 Sign in Permalink As I was waiting for the film premiere to come to Russia, I was wondering would it be so good as it claimed by watchers from other countries. Almost all reviewers were excited and impressed. But all my fears were gone when the movie started. It's the most successful screen version of the any book I ever seen. The soul, the smell, the unique spirit of the book was perfectly re-created. All characters are good. The places which Adventure passes are wonderful (I think New Zealand should expect great raise of tourism industry). You are watching this spectacular and starting to remember the feelings of you childhood, the feelings of exploring fairy tales world, where magic is in the air.. This movie - it's a kind of Magic.
10.0~I dream of the day I can sit down and watch all three movies together. atigercub Sign in Permalink Never thought a studio would cough up enough money or allow enough artistic freedom in order to tell the complete story. The fact is, they did and they did it right! These first two films have brought back my excitement for the movies! Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all involved in making these films for their dedication, commitment and respect to a story that has enriched us all.
10.0~A role model for all movies! Howyadoin95 Sign in Permalink I just saw this movie, 8 months after its original release, and I have got to say that this is one of the best movies ever made. It has all the qualities, of a movie, that I love. Some are that it is long, it is an adventure film, it is about a quest, and it has an excellent supporting actor, Ian McKellen, who should've won best supporting actor. This movie has great music and great cinematography, which I like the most about this film. The best, I think, are the shots that are far away from the fellowship, and show all of the scenery. These shots show us how beautiful, nice, dark, and crazy Middle Earth is. So, an A+ for that! The music plays well with the film, and that helped the film with some of its most dramatic scenes. Some films deserve to win Best Picture, but lose to another movie or never get nominated. Those films have been the better films, better than the ones that won. Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring is one of those films. It will be remembered more than A Beautiful Mind, and will probably be voted one of the greatest films ever made! Rating:4 stars out of 4
10.0~The best Film I Have Ever Seen! 8934 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time. I am a big fan of the book and I think that the film did the book a lot of justice. The effects in the film were amazing. The battle scenes and the effects when Frodo puts the ring on. The opening of the film was brilliant with the big battle and how it explained about the rings. I think that the actors who were cast were perfect for the roles that they played, I think that Sean Bean was perfect for the role of Borimir and Elijah Wood as Frodo was amazing. I loved this film and I cannot wait till The Two Towers comes out!
10.0~Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! Count_Dooku Sign in Permalink When i went to see this movie, i hadn't read the book. I had tried several times, but could never get past the first 3 chapters, and i never really caught on to the story. However, if you think that would make me less interested, you are wrong. This is the most incredible movie i have ever seen! Often, movies of books are really poor, or rely on the success of the book to translate into money at the box office, but LOTR was a fantastic movie in its own right. It inspired me to read the books, and i cant wait for the Two Towers to come out! (PS: I think it was a debarcle that it didn't win any academy awards, especially losing best adapted screenplay to a Beautiful Mind, and Best Director to Ron Howard. The Academy have proved beyond all doubt, that their collective brain power is about the same as the South American jumping flea.)
10.0~Simply put, a masterpiece across the board jfmorris Sign in Permalink Upon my first theatrical viewing (I'm at five now, with at least one more to come), I might have scored the film slightly lower, but a revelatory second viewing convinced me that to rate this film at less than a perfect "10" would be pointless caviling with one of the most impactful cinematic experiences I've had in many, many years. It's easy to find fault with virtually any aspect of any film ("Legolas looked fake jumping off the Cave Troll!"), but such opinions are, as they say [paraphrased], like certain orifices of the body--everybody's got one. I, for one, prefer to wallow shamelessly in my intoxicating newfound love for what Peter Jackson and Co. hath wrought, and "objectivity" be damned. (It has nothing to do with the appreciation of art anyway.) Of course, if you think stories about wizards, goblins, and desperate quests, however profoundly conceived and carefully executed, are really stupid, then by all means stay away from this tale in all forms. But then...what are you doing on the Internet? If, as I suspect, you're in the opposite camp, then my advice is this--see the movie ten times, buy/read the books, collect all four mugs, get the soundtrack, and generally speaking, do whatever else you can think of to reward this risky, epic endeavor. And don't forget the DVDs this fall. If there's justice in the world, Peter Jackson and his collaborators will be showered in gold statues come March. If there's no justice in the world...well, just thank Illuvatar that we may still find solace in the refuge of art, as practiced by great artists like Peter Jackson and J.R.R. Tolkien.
10.0~Don't listen to the naysayers filmboy-1 Sign in Permalink Why not view this film and decide for yourself. Most of the bashers are Tolkien perfectionists, Star Wars geeks that don't want to admit that these 3 LOTR films will definitely overshadow their overly mediocre and shallow prequel trilogy and those who just plain don't get it or appreciate this kind of genre. Sure there are some differences from the book but I think most of these changes for good, or otherwise it would have been a 10 hour movie, unbearably too long to keep the interest of today's moviegoers. I,like many people had reservations about seeing this film but after I did, I came to appreciate Tolkien's works even more. In my humble opinion this is one of the best films to come out in a long time and one of the best ever. I will anxiously await the next two films and hope to see them all back to back. Thank you Peter Jackson, you've done a wonderful piece work.
10.0~"Rings" doesn't disappoint obsessedchikee Sign in Permalink Absolute Genius. I was a Tolkien ignoramus when first I saw this movie. I refused to see it in theaters because my mom said I had to read the book first. I hated the book the first time I read it. When I finally saw Fellowship, I spent the majority of the film on the edge of my seat. Talk about master film-making. Peter Jackson is a genius to have brought this world to life. Sean Astin absolutely shines as Sam, Elijah Wood is the perfect Frodo. Ian McKellan as the wizard Gandalf is amazing as well as Christopher Lee, the evil wizard Saruman. Viggo Mortenson plays the soft spoken warrior Aragorn to perfection. All the other actors not mentioned did a wonderful job with their characters. Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens crafted a remarkable script with beautiful dialogue. I could go on and on but the biggest praise I can give it is this. When the movie ended, I read Fellowship, Towers, Return, and even the Hobbit within the next three days and now can quote lotr with the best of them(and actually know what I'm talking about) A must see for anyone. Fellowship of the Ring did not disappoint.
10.0~Brilliant Timberz Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson did a great job on making this movie. Middle Earth just came to life. The actors were fantastic; Sean Bean and Ian McKellen were my favorites. You have to see this movie twice to notice how EXTREMELY detailed it is. It's just all good. Now the length..It was 3 hours. Yes, 3! hours! In my opinion, that wasn't enough. When the movie ended I just wanted to see more. I see alot of comments on this movie about it being too long. I have just 1 thing to say about this: You KNOW you're going to a 3 hour movie, then don't walk out of it and complain it was too long. That makes no sense. If you don't like the length, don't watch it.
9.0~An epic triumph Smells_Like_Cheese Sign in Permalink What a good movie! I have seen both this and the two towers in the theater, and may I say that that it is a one of a kind experience. My mom said that Star Wars was the best she saw in the theater. And I guess Lord of the Rings is our generation's Star Wars. It's impossible not to see this movie. You have to watch it. Otherwise, you're missing out on a wonderous movie. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring 9/10
10.0~Rised above my expectations of the movie. Wonderful effect and acting. martin_j Sign in Permalink After having seen this movie twice I agree with the majority that this is an exceptional good movie. After having seen the movie the first time I spend the most time comparing the movie with the book. To be completely honest i was a little bit disappointed because the left out crucial moments and information which makes the book extremely good. No details are left unexplained. After having seen the movie the second time I relaxed and could really enjoy the movie for what it really was. A splendid movie with astonishing effects. Today I am looking forward to see the uncut movie which hopefully will contain the left out scenes and histories. Well done and keep up this good work.
10.0~Awesome! moviefanat Sign in Permalink I was unsure if I wanted to see this movie at first. But I was in awe at how incredible it was when I did see it. I didn't read the books and it didn't make things hard to understand at all. Also, I personally didn't think the ending cut off too soon at all. I think it flowed perfectly just like a good book. I recommend this strongly.
10.0~It's a 'must-seen' movie... anchous Sign in Permalink I read "Lord of the Rings" three times. The first one at the age of six. I love fantasies, and I think it's the best. It's unreal to make a movie based on this book because it has so much action. It would be too long. I think, the director diserves aplause. It's so good that he stood up to the difficulties and did his work very well. Now the whole world knows there is such a good book. I want to thank everyone who helped in making this film. A warm thank you to you all.
10.0~beyond every expectation humpback Sign in Permalink First off - watch this Movie ! Its quite possible one of the three best movies of the 2001 season, and if one can stand the few scenes with some violence ( although even my sensitive girlfriend did not consider them "too bad" ), and does not need the quintessential happy end for one's satisfaction, its the best movie in a long time... That is, if one is willing to accept and watch a fantasy story at all ( and not just "Verminator 15" or whatever ), and can live with the fact, that this is only the first part of a three-piece whole (unlike Star Wars or whatever) It's utterly terrifying (in the most positive sense )and surprising what Peter Jackson did with the voluminous book ( which could have been used to make a movie three times the current length, if he had stuck to _all_ the details like some puritstic folks demand ) - the scenery of the book fairly leaps out of the pages onto the screen, providing majestic vistas, lovely shots of the shire, some cute episodes and above all keeping to the epic mood of the books, condensing whole pages (even chapters) of description into quick, yet evocative shots and settings, He is able of capturing essential moods with some of the key lines of the books, yet cutting back on several of the long conversations, outlining the shire, the elves and even the dark enemy within the first few scenes and establishing the whole frame of Middleearth within minutes ! At the same time he is adding the huge canvas on which to paint his telling of Tolkien's story. Yes, Peter Jackson had to cut some "classic" scenes from the books (and fans of the will gripe and gripe and the moan some about it) yet those scenes were cut to make the movie/story more accessible to a wider audience, not to diminish the pleasure of some fanatic adherents of the "Original". Live with it - basically some of the scenes cut I found nice, even if more than merely superfluent, in the book (of which I am an unabashed fan ). This is helped by excellent camerawork and editing, as well as a moody soundtrack. And I guess, he did actually film the sequences, and we get to see them on the DVD edition, possibly extending the movie into a truly epic 4+ hours... As for the acting - well, I can accept Eliah Wood as Frodo (and he is nicely a-breed-apart from his fellow "countryfolk" hobbits), Ian Holm as Bilbo is extraordinary, and the same holds true for Ian McClellan - if he should get the 'Oscar' for it, it would be well deserved indeed. The only problem for me was Hugo Weaving as Elrond - not that his acting wasn#t up to par, but rather his distinctive face screamed "ahhh the 'Matrix' villain " at me the second he came on screen. Oh well... The rest of the cast is solid to superior in their performance, although Sean Bean is sadly underused - what a great Aragorn he could have been, but Vigo Mortensen fills the spot well enough, too. The small roles played by the few other "names" in the cast (Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett...) add some flavour and hint at those characters importance, yet do not detract from the storyline - this is first and foremost a plot based movie, not a star vehicle ! Anyone going to view LOTR simply because someone particular is acting in it....oh well. LOTR's "star" is the incredible richness of the story, the athmosphere (which is a far far shot from anything else marketing itself under and the "fantasy" label) and the detailed and deep setting - not any hired Hollywood talent. Witness the FX-shots inside Moria, the huge statues flanking the Anduin falls, Isengard ( especially the underground shots ), the high pass sequence or Barad Dur, the Iron Tower. Or the "spirit world" sequences, or or or..... Lean back and enjoy - nothing less is delivered, no more could have been asked. Its a miracle that Mr. Jackson could transfer the richness of the book onto the screen at all - that he succeeded so above everyone's expectations is a tribute to his skill. 9.5 out of 10 hobbits PS - for those considering the film "sexless" and "unromantic" - Not every great story needs some heavyhanded, breathless bedroom action to catch the audience interest and imagination. As for the "Arwen" part - IMHO Liv Tyler was not enrolled to provide some "female flesh" but to combine several people from the books into one readily recognicable character..., Yes, for broader acceptance, too, I guess. So what ? Guess someone is going to gripe that Peter Jackson did not hire some real hobbits either..............
9.0~The start of an epic and memorable journey Leray97 Sign in Permalink At 3 hours and 20 minutes (I watched the extended version), The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring initiates what might be the best cinematic fantasy trilogy I'm ever going to see. The runtime of this film and its two sequels have turned me off from watching them for years; I knew that they would be epics that took their time to develop the LOTR world and lore, and I was prepared for this film to drain all of my energy for the day. I'm definitely a bit tired, but it was worth it. Despite this film being backed up by its own source material, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring presents a fantasy that doesn't feel too whimsical but very accessible for the audience. Frodo's character arc and the overall plot of this film are easy to follow and very rewarding of any investment made by the viewer. It's actually hard to believe how well this movie turned out, given the state of filmmaking on a technological standpoint during the late 90's to the early 2000's. Of course, times weren't that primitive back then but to tell a story like The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring does is demanding; the filmmmakers had to establish a world, it's regions, the characters and their associations (basically, the lore), all in a way that wouldn't completely confuse the viewer. Whether it be by narration, verbal exposition (which usually isn't so great to sit through except in this case), or heavy CGI, I believe that everyone involved in the making of this film succeeded in creating a fictional world that the audience can immerse themselves into and enjoy the ride. Fantasies are usually lighthearted in nature, but The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring doesn't skimp out on the more emotional moments, as they are so vital to the character arcs. It details all the aspects of the trials and tribulations that Frodo (as well as the rest of the fellowship) has to go through to attempt to save Middle-Earth, thus creating a more well rounded story instead of a one-and-done kind of adventure. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has many great character performances as well. Maybe it's his gigantic blue eyes, but Elijah Wood nailed his emotional and dramatic scenes. As Frodo is caught in the middle of this situation, he's overwhelmed for the most part and Wood does a solid job in portraying the emotions needed. I really liked Viggo Mortensen in this film, his character was the rock that I could fall back on when things were heating up and that definitely has to do with Mortensen's acting prowess, at least in portraying a character like Strider. Even on its own, The Fellowship of the Ring creates a fantasy world that the audience can easily immerse themselves into and makes for an incredible experience with the characters that we get to know and love.
10.0~A sight to behold anpwxcat Sign in Permalink Growing up, my dad would always tell me his favorite books were The Lord of the Rings volumes. But I was never interested in fantasies, so I didn't really care. Then I found out that Peter Jackman was making the movies so I told my dad. He became really excited. But still, I didn't care. Until one night in November, when they showed the LOTR special on TV. I was able to catch only the first ten, fifteen minutes and instantly, I wanted to see the movie. I had never read the books. My dad took me and my family to see the movie. I was a bit excited and curious to see how they would do it. Mind you, I knew next to nothing about this story. I sat through the entire three hours in Middle Earth and fell in love with it. Through parts, I would clutch on my brother's arm, tense and hoping that everyone will make it through a lot of the sticky situations they were in. I fell in love with Legolas and his graceful Elf self. The minute the movie began, I was drawn in. The special effects were terrific. I felt like I was there. I wanted (and still do) to live in Rivendell among the Elves. The backdrops for the movies was fantastic. Sir Ian McKellan's quote about how New Zealand is Middle Earth is so true. I was very impressed with the casting. I'm a huge movie buff so I have seen plenty of movies and I won't be lying when I say that LOTR has the best casting ever. Every person, the mains and the extras, WAS the character they played. The make-up was incredible. The orcs creeped me out. The Elves entranced me. The Hobbits brought a smile to my face. Elrond, Hugo Weaving, is the perfect Elf King, firm and commanding, yet with love for his people and respect for Frodo. I could go on and on, but I won't. I loved the fact how PJ was able to make the Hobbits look small in every single scene. I would LOVE to know HOW in the world they did that. I love how the Elves are so graceful and look ethereal. I know that the movie is three hours long and people balk at that. I took a friend of mine who hasn't seen the movie because it was three hours long. He loved it. He was engrossed and he had never read the book either. This movie is one of the, if not THE, finest piece of work I have seen. I eagerly await "The Two Towers" and "The Return of the King". I definitely recommend this movie for everyone to see at least once. I have seen it four times and will see it yet again soon. I can never get bored of this movie. Go. See it. I leave you with a quote from Gandalf: "All we have to decide is what to do with the time that we are given"
10.0~one of the greatest films yet jharrell15 Sign in Permalink If you have not seen this film you are missing out on one of the greatest movies of all time. It contains beautiful dialog, great acting, and a timeless story. When I saw it for the first time I was totally mesmerized. I hope you have the same reaction when you see it. Perhaps you have heard some of the criticism about this movie and I have one thing to say about that, ITS NOT TRUE! People claim that it was too boring and didn't hold their interest. I have to claim that all the people that I've talked to, which is a lot, say that this was a great movie, and the small majority said this was a boring movie. I think that if you don't like this movie then you have no appreciation and no interest in movies at all. I can guarantee you that you will not waste your time and money if you watch this film.
10.0~if you have not seen it ... as10m Sign in Permalink do yourself a favour and go see the movie the only drawback ... needs to wait a year for the next part and then again a year for the last part ...
10.0~Where to start? sleepygirl Sign in Permalink When I first heard they were planning to put my favourite trilogy on the big screen with real life actors I was anxious as to what the result would be. I really didn't need to worry. Kudos to Peter Jackson who has taken a fine cast, beautiful scenery, great cinematography and a fabulous story and melded it into a wonderful movie. As for the Fellowship what can I say, they were all magic and gosh I felt for them, especially Frodo who has the greatest burden of them all. The way Elijah Wood expressed the whole 'I don't want to do this but i know i have to" attitude was astounding. He made me feel like yelling out "I'll do it I'll carry the ring for you". Orlando Bloom was unearthly as the elf and the two humans Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean were wonderfully flawed and heroic at the same time. And Gandalf well Ian Mckellen did it all; nice friendly old wizard and all powerful sorcerer just as i had pictured this wizard with a soft spot for halflings. The other hobbits are a fantastic foil for the increasingly serious Frodo and the Dwarf is a joy. The support cast also shone giving the movie incredible depth. Bottom line: All I want for Christmas 2002 is a ticket to The Two Towers to see what happens next.
10.0~Tolkien's Brilliant Vision Realized Into A Perfect Film jaesboxer Sign in Permalink For the thousands of fans who thought it couldn't be done, to the skeptics and the critics who observed Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord Of The Rings into a trilogy would be the next Ishtar, a disaster of epic proportions, allay your fears. The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring is the most daring cinematic event to take place in years, and despite the fact it undeservedly lost the best picture oscar to A Beautiful Mind, it is, I strongly believe, a film for the ages. NOt since Gone With THe Wind has an epic tale, critically acclaimed, been adapted into a film which is astounding in its own right. The sets are marvelous, the characters portrayed to perfection (Most notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf), and the mythology of Middle-Earth brought to vivid life, combining to make a film that is both spectacular in its grandeur and engaging in its characters. This is a film I believe equal to Lawrence Of Arabia in its scope, and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel THe Two Towers being released this Christmas.
10.0~Great! Spindizzy_Wizard Sign in Permalink Excellently done. My only possible complaint is that they could have shortened up the "grand panoramic view" shots; but thats a minor nitpick compared to them getting the characters, settings, and action so perfectly done. Extremely strong recommendation to any fan of the books. Very strong recommendation to any fan of fantasy.
10.0~A review of a spectacular film! imperial_wizard Sign in Permalink The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a modern marvel. It has great performances, stunts, and visual effects. Lets start with the performances. Elijah Wood is great as Frodo, and it actually seems as if he is in grave peril. Sean Astin gives a fairly good performance as Sam. The other two Hobbits aren't as good as Frodo and Sam, but they give us not horrible performances, but not great ones either. When I saw this, and I saw Ian McKellen as Gandalf, I thought that the character was written for him. He should have won the oscar for it, but a nomination is still fair enough. Viggo Mortenson deserved a oscar nomination for his performance as the Ranger/Heir of Gondor Aragorn. He was great. John Rhys Davies does a quite good job as Gimli the Dwarf. Sean Bean gives us a convincing role as Borimir. Orlando Bloom, gives a very good performance for a breakthrough role. Christopher Lee also deserved at least a Golden Globe for his role as Saruman the evil wizard of the Istari. Cate Blanchett's role as the Lady Galadriel should have gotten an Oscar or Golden Globe nomination. Hugo Weaving had a great performance as the Elven Lord Elrond. Liv Tyler isn't great as Arwen, but she isn't too bad either. With few exceptions, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has phenomenal roles and performances. The Fellowship of the Ring also gives us great filming and phenomenons within the video. Such as, the awesome cinematography that it won a well deserved Oscar for. The makeup on the Orcs was extroadinary, which it also won an Oscar for. Oscar winning digital visual effects also make this movie extremely fun to watch. This film's oscar winning musical score is great, with every musical note matching the scene that we are watching. Personally, I don't completely think that it should have won Best Picture, but I do think that it should have won Best Director, because director Peter Jackson does a completely spectacular job at bringing Middle Earth alive on the big screen. The costumes they should have won an oscar for, since they are completely fascinating and mind blowing. What I'm trying to say is, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is quite possibly the greatest fantasy epic of all time, and you should go see it as soon as possible.
7.0~Masterpiece of visuals, but only visuals bzb2001 Sign in Permalink 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is an epic, ambitious film in scope and magnitude, if not in heart. It tells the fantastic story of Frodo, a hobbit (small person) from the Shire in Middle Earth. The Shire is a peaceful place, as close to utopia as one might find. His peace is interrupted when the sorcerer Gandalf rides into town and discovers the secret to Bilbo's ring. Bilbo, also a hobbit, acquired the ring from Gollum - a distorted creature whose life has been elongated, but also deformed, by the mystical ring. When Bilbo leaves for adventure, it is Frodo's job to return the ring to the desolate Mount Doom and cast it into the fire from which it was made. This, you see, is the only way to destroy the ring. As a mere hobbit, Frodo cannot shoulder this burden alone. Along for the journey is his gardener and confidant Samwise, Sam for short. Two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, too immature for their own good, meet up with Frodo and Sam on their way to the magical land of elves. Once there, a "fellowship" is formed to destroy the ring. One of them is Aragorn, a ranger with a secretive past. He is the primary focus of 'Lord' other than Frodo and the ring. He is a descendant of the man who held the ring over Mount Doom and could not destroy it. He is in love with the elf Arwen but the backdrop of the times leaves that love affair in jeopardy. Sauron, the dark lord who originally created the ring, has found out its location and seeks out the hobbits, and later the fellowship, to take the ring back. Saruman, the secondary villain in the film, is Sauron's "puppet," but also wants the ring for his own power. He is a sorcerer like Gandalf, but has turned to evil. Also in the fellowship, protecting the ring from Sauron and Saruman, is another man, Boromir. He is from the land of Gondor. Legolas is the lone elf representative in the fellowship. Elves are the fairest of the many creatures of Middle Earth and gifted archers. There is also a dwarf (slightly taller than a hobbit and certainly more robust) named Gimli. Dwarfs reside in mines, great connections of caves in the mountains through which the fellowship must journey in order to complete their task. It is difficult to summarize the plot of 'Lord of the Rings' because of the amount of information that is thrown at you. There are characters and their ancestors; different creatures in the elves, dwarfs, hobbits, and men. In addition to them there are the mysterious orcs, goblins, ringwraiths, uruks, sorcerers, and the creature all onto itself, Gollum. This complexity in setup and the numerous strands of plot to keep under control is the primary problem with 'The Lord of the Rings.' It took me up to three viewings to saturate all of this material and half way understand it. The triumph of Peter Jackson's labor of love is that you want to watch it indefinitely to soak in all of this splendor. The effects and settings are indescribable other than to say nothing this stunning has ever been featured on film before. Visually, the picture has no equal and will forever be understood as altering the way movies are seen. Unfortunately, to tell the story's backdrop, much of the humanity involved in Middle Earth is left on the back burner. In addition to that, there is a serious problem with pacing. The filmmakers seemed more interested in remaining faithful to J.R.R. Tolkien's original creation than they are in attempting to make a workable adaptation into a film. In that regard, there is a large battle sequence that feels very much like the climax of the film, but is then followed with upwards of an hour of more footage! This was the straw that led 'Fellowship' from being a great film into a good film. With that in mind, I am forced to think of 'Fellowship' as split. It is a masterpiece of visual technology and presentation, but married to a story that needs more heart and less intrusion of detail. *** out of ****
10.0~A great film LastOneStanding Sign in Permalink Peter Jackson did an excellent job on this film. Some may be disappointed because they left out some parts from the book, but I found most of those parts unnecessary and would have lost most of the audience. All of the actors/actress' fit their parts perfectly; they seemed to fall right into the personalitys of the characters in the book. This movie is a must-have for any Tolkien fan, and is a film that can be watched over and over again despite its length.
10.0~Viggo Mortensen !!! williamlasalle-76079 Sign in Permalink Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn was the best Actor in these movies. Thanks to each Actor and Everyone who worked on these movies. Of all the books made into movies, this series represents the Best work done in keeping the movies right on track with the books. Usually I am mad after watching a movie that I have read the books for. This series was a pleasant surprise.
10.0~One of the best movies in history bogdanjelenkovic Sign in Permalink In my opinion this movie is perfect. I think that because all of the elements were done in the best possible way. Cast crew is very professional and everybody played each role very faithfully. Story is very big and there are a lot of details and a lot of things are happening all the time. What is the most important it is very interesting and attracts attention at every moment of the movie. Effect and action are also brilliant, especially for people who like epic wars. In the end I didn't read the book but I heard some people's opinions who read it and I think small disadvantage is that in the movie there are no some scenes which are in the book. In the other hand I think it is not possible because that movie would be probably about 7-8 hours long. :) I recommend this move to everyone who seeks for excellent epic adventure.
10.0~Best Ever fun22 Sign in Permalink I thought that this movie was the best I've seen in years. I was a little depressed by the fact that every demon you saw, was from a computer game that either was or is out on the market today. That aside, it had great special effects, and audio tracks.
10.0~The Greatest Story Ever Told, Transfered To The Big Screen djrymer Sign in Permalink I have always loved "The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy", and when I heard they were making a huge Hollywood film based on the books I couldn't be more excited. But doubt still shadowed my mind whether or not Peter Jackson could bring Middle-Earth to life and put to the screen J.R.R Tolkien's vision. A year later it finally hit the screens, and I was totally blown away! Everything was perfect: the actors, the settings (New Zealand), the props and especially the score by Howard Shore. Everything was perfect, and this is definitely a film I could watch over and over again.. Can't wait for "The Two Towers" and "The Return Of The King" Excellent, Well Done Peter Jackson & Crew.
